            <li>Panasonic ES81103S Man&#x27;s 3-Blade shaver is a very good product.</li>
            <li>Any time I would use a razor, even very good razors, I would always develop razor burn.</li>
            <li>Very Good and on time.</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s an ok buy, i&#x27;m happy with battery life, i&#x27;ve never been impressed with electrics anyway</li>
            <li>Best of all, the shave is very smooth.</li>
            <li>The best part is that it won&#x27;t beat up your neck and give a very smooth and close shave.  </li>

            <li>This razor was amazing!</li>
            <li>This razor does an amazing job of cleaning up my face!</li>

            <li>I am thrilled with it too!</li>
            <li>A remarkable razor.</li>
            <li>but this gift was one of my best, even better than the tie with fishes on it</li>
            <li>This is a good electric shaver, with a great battery life.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did ,the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>He is extremely pleased with it and says it is the closest and best electric shave he has ever had.  </li>
            <li>But I am impressed with Panasonic for exchanging a defective product by a better model.</li>
            <li>My wife bought me this shaver as a gift, I really am happy with my purchase of this shaver, it works great no problems what so ever and the shave is awesome, close and my skin is so smooth after using it.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li>Nice!</li>
            <li>So mostly I shave the best I can with it</li>
            <li>Great Product with good battery life.</li>
            <li>Tried many and this is the best.</li>
            <li>You should be able to find the one that best fits your needs and lifestyle.</li>
            <li>Still working excellent; just ordered more blades for it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had Panasonic wet/dry shavers for many years and this one seem to be the best one yet without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li>Of maybe a dozen shavers over many years, this is the best yet.</li>
            <li>great shaver, good value for money.  </li>
            <li>A really nice close shave!</li>
            <li>I have tried many electric shavers, but this one is the best.</li>
            <li>The razor does a good job although I find that it doesn&#x27;t do a great job on your neck.</li>
            <li>Good electric shaver with a great price.</li>
            <li>The biggest names with the most blah blah are not always the best.</li>
            <li>It says please wait for 30 days so that your skin can adjust to shaver and it has been more than 3 months since I have been using it, and it has never ever given me a perfect</li>
            <li>NICE!</li>
            <li>This is the best of many shavers I have tried.  </li>
            <li>In many ways, this is the best shave I&#x27;ve gotten in years.</li>
            <li>Quality item works good and price was great</li>
            <li>When the latest of those broke, I followed the reviews and the lower prices and decided on this as the best</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Braun and Norelco and love this one the best over the 5 blade systems.</li>
            <li>Combine this with a nice cream - not foam - shaving product (like Cremo) and you are in business!</li>
            <li>am most impressed with the quality of shaving and my skin is so smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Every guy should own one of these!</li>
            <li>A good razor at a great price.</li>
            <li>What a great buy for anyone looking for a good shave.</li>
            <li>The BEST Electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned and after 40 years of shaving I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve found it.  </li>
            <li>This is a great razor with good features.</li>
            <li>Best, smoothest, most convenient shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s best, but I now use it more often than a blade.</li>
            <li>Love this shaver, best I have ever had.</li>
            <li>The ES8103 is a joy to shave with and is easily the best electric shaver I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>Shaves great, cleans easily, and it&#x27;s awesome shaving in a steamy shower or with shaving cream.</li>
            <li>The self-cleaning feature is very nice, and it gives a good shave, but now 13 months after purchase the display that shows the percentage of charge is going out.  </li>
            <li>The Consumer Reports reviews pointed to this model as being a \\&quot;Best Buy\\&quot; and it certainly was a best buy for me.  </li>
            <li>I notice I shave more often because this is one very nice shaver!</li>
            <li>which is  very easy and get a very good shave&lt;</li>
            <li>As before, this product is a great design, well made, and comfortable to use, while delivering a superb close shave.  </li>
            <li>great, smooth, irritation-free shaves again and best of all the Remington was one-quarter the price of the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>This was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>Just a pleasant hum.</li>
            <li>My son is very satisfied and happy with it.</li>
            <li>It works very easily and is extremely effective in giving me and excellent close shave.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is excellent as well, and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easily Cleaned  Awesome Battery Life  </li>
            <li>It works perfectly and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Great electric razer and price 100% satisfied!</li>
            <li>Works great, I love it!</li>
            <li>Best of all, my skin feels fine during and after shaving.</li>
            <li>We are also not geting the premium products that are very good but are quite more costly.</li>
            <li>This is a very good shaver with many good features.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great razor and a great buy. :-)</li>
            <li>While I am happy with the fact that my husband is happy for the most part...</li>
            <li>After a fair amount of research it appears to be one of the best values available.</li>
            <li>This shaver offers the best value of Panasonic&#x27;s excellent line of shavers.</li>
            <li>- I shave my head bald and and from my experience - it&#x27;s great for face, but NOT so great for top of head / skull.</li>
            <li>Nice convenient, but i sure hope this is NOT the best.</li>
            <li>This razor is good.</li>
            <li>and you are good</li>
            <li>I can get a good, close shave without a lot of effort.</li>
            <li>Good Machine.  </li>
            <li>.this shaver gives me a good shave,so</li>
            <li>good news</li>
            <li>Good buy for the $$$</li>
            <li>The ergonomics are good.</li>
            <li>in ultrasonic self-cleaning feature, seems like a good idea, have to wait and see with time</li>
            <li>The shaver is good</li>
            <li>Price is fair and Braun is now a bit over priced.    </li>
            <li>I settled on Panasonic, and got a good deal on newegg for the ES8103S.  </li>
            <li>, so I feel good about this.    </li>
            <li>I ended up returning it after giving it 3 good weeks of use</li>
            <li>Surprisingly close shave for an electric razor.</li>
            <li>Always good knowing if your shaver is about to die.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Their numbers are based off a 2-3 minute shave, but I don&#x27;t know any guy who can get a good shave with an electric in 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>If not for the recharging thing, I would give it 4 stars because the shave is still good.</li>
            <li>I can give two good reasons</li>
            <li>Works good even if I skip a day or two.</li>
            <li>The battery life on it is really good</li>
            <li>The Norelco had issues with the neck and didn&#x27;t do a good job in that area.  </li>
            <li>It even did a good job around the neck (2-3 passes).</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is quite good .</li>
            <li>However, everything else about this shaver is not so good.</li>
            <li>But, I don&#x27;t know it is really good or not yet,,  by their description,, I should use it about a month to know it.  </li>
            <li>Oh God;;    Anyway,, It&#x27;s working good.</li>
            <li>Superior product with replacement blades and head when needed.</li>
            <li>Slap on some moisturizer and you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
            <li>The rotary razors did not do good in the areas under the nose.</li>
            <li>Never tried this type of head before but after some good reviews and the discounted price I thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li>But if your beard is light, as is mine, this model seems perfect.</li>
            <li>By the way, for a 4 minute shave, you&#x27;ll get around 10-11 good shaves.</li>
            <li>It is not as good as it advertised.</li>
            <li>It had gotten good reviews and was on sale</li>
            <li>The battery capacity LED stopped working, then showed up, then disappeared again for good (I think).    </li>
            <li>All in all, it is a good compromise betwween a blade and an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>recommended one hundred percent, really good</li>
            <li>Timewise to get a good shave it takes longer than with Philips equipment</li>
            <li>Gives me a fairly close shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li>So this is a good deal for the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used good Braun, Remington, and Norelco shavers.</li>
            <li>If you need a shaver, the this Panasonic ES8103S is a good one.</li>
            <li>They all shave good in the beginning.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s almost as good as asafty razor.</li>
            <li>It is as good as any bargain basement Norelco shaver.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic is so superior in quality, features, and performance to the Braun series 3, that the braun should not even be considdered for purchase.</li>
            <li>The price was good.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good.</li>
            <li>Good razor.  </li>
            <li>Its fairly quite.</li>
            <li>The results are about as good and close as with a razor.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s as good if not a bit closer.  </li>
            <li>I had a Panasonic shaver 10+ years ago and loved it.</li>
            <li>But ever since having switched to this Panasonic shaver, I was astounded by how good it was.  </li>
            <li>Good shaver for the $$</li>
            <li>I need a good shaver that just plugs into the wall, and this is it.  </li>
            <li>...how good feels.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good to go.  </li>
            <li>replacement for aging Panasonic shaver--such a good shaver got another one.</li>
            <li>Great shave, nice feel.</li>
            <li>Battery life is good, a couple weeks.  </li>
            <li>Good shaver.</li>
            <li>The trimmer works fairly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I get about four to five good shaves, all in the shower.</li>
            <li>i bought this based on the ratings and caught it during a good price.  </li>
            <li>husband loved the shaver.</li>
            <li>It is noisier than the 7103, but the blade system is superior.</li>
            <li>A lot of what determines how good shave is, is...</li>
            <li>I have now owned this shaver for one month and am delighted with it.</li>
            <li>but the reviews and price of this panasonic were just too good, so I took the plunge.  </li>
            <li>: Good Quality of Shave.</li>
            <li>I didnt think it did a good job</li>
            <li>The price was good and delivery was ahead of schedule.  </li>
            <li>I have been shaveing with a norelco shaver for 35 years and loved them</li>
            <li>The shaver itself does not cause any irritation to my skin while giving a good shave</li>
            <li>Also the battery is good for about 8-10 shaves for me.</li>
            <li>I have never had good luck from an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>Good choice for me.</li>
            <li>Vastly superior to all of the women&#x27;s models that I have tried.</li>
            <li>I am delighted with this shaver.</li>
            <li>and I still get a good shave on my legs.</li>
            <li>The shaver works good</li>
            <li>Good choice.</li>
            <li>Razor feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li>Battery is Good.</li>
            <li>Best feature of this shaver is the close, pain-free, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>the shaver works good</li>
            <li>Battery life is good between charges.  </li>
            <li>I had the Braun for over 10 years and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I came across the Panasonic and while I&#x27;d always heard good things I&#x27;d never used one.  </li>
            <li>It is superior to the Braun in almost every respect.  </li>
            <li>So I got this shaver on a recomendation of a good friend.</li>
            <li>But it works good for me...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a really good on the face.</li>
            <li>It is really good.</li>
            <li>The   GOOD POINTS:</li>
            <li>It gives a good shave.</li>
            <li>rest of the features are good.</li>
            <li>I hope it continues to give this good a level of service to me.    </li>
            <li>They were good, but the shave wasn&#x27;t as close.</li>
            <li>It gives as good a shave as the Remington/Braun/Norelco razors I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t so good</li>
            <li>and it had all the essentials without a bunch of gimmicks you don&#x27;t need to get a good shave.  </li>
            <li>Good Shaver.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was good but the battery was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Read good reviews (consumer reports) on this one and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Since I was going to be without a good shaver for awhile, I bought the Philips Norelco 8240XL.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had good luck with Panasonic equipment, and the price/performance of this item has been no exception.  </li>
            <li>My face is smooth as can be and I am very happy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite as good on the neck (front), but you have to rub to feel the difference because you can&#x27;t see it.    </li>
            <li>Hey gals for those of you looking to find a good shaver for your legs and underarms, this is it.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;It works good</li>
            <li>BUT IS GOOD</li>
            <li>After about two weeks of searching the internet, I settled on the Panasonic ES8103S as a good comprimise between price and performance.  </li>
            <li>This shaver provides a good shave.  </li>
            <li>I found this one on sale and the reviews were good.</li>
            <li>does a good job lubricating.</li>
            <li>good display&lt;</li>
            <li>Price, performance, and everyone is satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Asians on my face shows a good performance.&lt;br /&gt;Want</li>
            <li>Surprisingly good razor for the price.</li>
            <li>For me it gives a good shave and battery life</li>
            <li>With this electric shaver, it took me 3 times longer to get a shave that was one-third as good as a disposable razor.</li>
            <li>He is delighted with it.</li>
            <li>A co-worker had a Panasonic and loved it, so I tried this one</li>
            <li>This is a good electric razor.</li>
            <li>Once you get used to this it is all good.</li>
            <li>not as good as razor but works.  </li>
            <li>It feels good in my hand...</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re mistaken, as it will drip water for hours even after a good drying.  </li>
            <li>The best part is that by 2pm my face still feels smooth, which couldn&#x27;t be said of the ES8103.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>I bought another one just like it because it&#x27;s just that good</li>
            <li>The product works fairly well.</li>
            <li>On the downside, the battery life isn&#x27;t as good as the rotary models I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>I get a good shave.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;i bought this  at a good price..</li>
            <li>I suppose that&#x27;s a good amount of usage though.</li>
            <li>Panasonic used to be good</li>
            <li>All good but the battery life.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how good an electric razor could be until I tried this.  </li>
            <li>This is a good razor that has served me well now for 2 years.</li>
            <li>I get a good shave with the Panasonic, the skin in not irritated, and it all works.</li>
            <li>the good</li>

            <li>All in all a good electric razor that I would recommend.</li>

            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is as shown in the description, I loved it and fulfilled my expectations.</li>
            <li>Good razor</li>
            <li>&amp; I still get 6 to 8 good shaves from it, so</li>
            <li>The electric is still superior to the cartridges in that I haven&#x27;t had the cuts and ingrown hairs</li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>It is affordable and is a good deal for the $80.</li>
            <li>I wanted a Panasonic Shaver because I have had good luck with Panasonic products.</li>
            <li>Feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li>It just didn&#x27;t feel as good in my hand</li>
            <li>The Panasonic works good</li>
            <li>He loved this Christmas gift.</li>
            <li>It does a good job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery life seems good, will try to update in another year.</li>
            <li>It works so good</li>
            <li>This razor provides an excellent and  surprisingly comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had good service from Panasonic products before</li>
            <li>I purchased it seeing all the reviews on the amazon and saying it was a cheaper option for a good shaver, but it ruined all my expectations.</li>
            <li>but after reading good review I go for it</li>
            <li>Good shaver for the money.</li>
            <li>Battery life is good, design is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Good purchase</li>
            <li>Its not as good as a shaving blade, but thats a given.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be sold for good.</li>
            <li>I suppose it would be good for someone with a heavier beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this was WAY too good not to give credit.</li>
            <li>This shaver is of good value at sale price.  </li>
            <li>He loved it.</li>
            <li>The shave isn&#x27;t as good as a razor, but it&#x27;s darn close.  </li>
            <li>FELT GOOD</li>
            <li>then I decided to lather up with some good ol barbasol.</li>
            <li>The choice was a good one and exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>The batterie life is good for now, 5 days with one charge.</li>
            <li>And of course I like the fact that it&#x27;s a wet/dry shaver, which makes it good</li>
            <li>I had to find a shaver good for a senior gentleman  </li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>and this does a good job of mowing my face.</li>
            <li>Not now, I get as good as a shave with the Panasonic ES-LA93-K shaver as I do when using a razor and no nicks.</li>
            <li>Worked good.</li>
            <li>So I decided to look for a good electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have to honestly say it worked great.</li>
            <li>As others have reviewed - and the reason I bought it - it gives a good close shave.</li>
            <li>I have tried using a shaving cream and it works well, but shaving cream is not needed to get a good close</li>
            <li>in all, it does a fairly good job.  </li>
            <li>It still works good, but the cord wouldn&#x27;t keep a connection to the shaver</li>
            <li>i would even pay 100 its that good a shaver.</li>
            <li>popup trimmer is good</li>
            <li>Batterie life is good around 10 between charges.</li>
            <li>Feels good on the face.</li>
            <li>good:</li>
            <li>Have to go over a number of times to get a good shave.</li>
            <li>Panasonic does a good job</li>
            <li>good:</li>
            <li>good:</li>
            <li>good:</li>
            <li>good</li>
            <li>Really good price through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I loved this shaver, and for about a year it worked fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see how good it is six months from now.</li>
            <li>It is a good razor for the money,I would recommend.</li>
            <li>Waterproof is a good advantage.</li>
            <li>I figured it was a good middle-range price option.</li>
            <li>The shave is good, however, after six months the battery life has degraded from 1 week of shaves to 4 days.  </li>
            <li>A good shaver is an oxymoron.</li>
            <li>Good backup as well in case</li>
            <li>This is a superior product.  </li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>The shave is close - as good as I ever got from the Gillette Fatboy, but there&#x27;s no chance of nicking myself.  </li>
            <li>THE RAZOR DOES A FAIRLY GOOD JOB  </li>
            <li>BUT IT DOESNT DO A GOOD JOB ALONG MY JAW BONE EDGES, CHIN AND NECK.  </li>
            <li>TO GET A GOOD SHAVE</li>
            <li>I can get maybe seven or eight really good shaves before the battery dies.</li>
            <li>The shaver does a good job.</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>This razor does as good a job as any in my experience.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this shaver does a good job.</li>
            <li>Good product for the money</li>
            <li>Some reviewers here say it works good on their skull</li>
            <li>If you want a good cordless shaver for both head and face, check out the Bald Eagle by Skull Shaver here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>in all the ES8103S has turned out to be a good replacement for the ES8077.  </li>
            <li>good price~&lt;br /&gt;good</li>
            <li>For the price it is a good value.</li>
            <li>and I get results as good as a razor and blade.  </li>
            <li>That said, if I start with a couple of days of growth (say after a weekend), the razor takes some time to give good results.</li>
            <li>However there is a downside and therefore a good reason for not giving this unit a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li>An all around good razor.</li>
            <li>It looks good.</li>
            <li>corded use w&#x27;d have been good.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Over all good one</li>
            <li>This one got good reviews</li>
            <li>have loved everyone of mine.</li>
            <li>My husband has always had another type of electric shaver but the power reviews on this one were so good</li>
            <li>then that its good has a wall charger cord plus on the razor</li>
            <li>Even with a good shave, when I would run my hand against the grain, I could feel the stubble.</li>
            <li>Excellent and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Good battery life.</li>
            <li>It looks nice, works great, and I&#x27;ve had it for a while and still haven&#x27;t had to recharge the battery.</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>Battery life is good and it charges in an hour.  </li>
            <li>he gets a good shave.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews in Consumer Reports and they mentioned this is a good buy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>With the razor/gel combo my shaves are as good as a blade.  </li>
            <li>but if you catch it on a good sale I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy it</li>
            <li>He said he absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>If you want a good shave this is not the razor for</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see what I&#x27;m cutting....not good.  </li>
            <li>I bought this shaver because I read a review from someone who said it was a good head shaver.  </li>
            <li>They do a good job of shaving close to the skin.</li>
            <li>the money, it&#x27;s a good razor.  </li>
            <li>I read a review saying this shaver was best for those with light or medium stubble.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been amazed at what a good shave it gives.</li>
            <li>I used another shaver years ago and it did not do as a good job as this one.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>I was of a mind to downgrade to 4-star because the power monitor drops about 10% for each shave, implying that it is good for 10 shaves, so you must pack a charger for a two-week trip.</li>
            <li>I noticed that fairly soon after purchasing it.</li>
            <li>good luck using the trimmer on them.</li>
            <li>It has been a good switch, he hasn&#x27;t had any skin problem.</li>
            <li>My son bought one of these and loved it.  </li>
            <li>The Arc3 is a good size and has good features, including a sideburn trimmer, so I can get rid of another battery-operated device on my bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- hold a good charge</li>
            <li>The battery charges in an hour and holds a good charge for a while.</li>
            <li>and you tend to need a variety of tools to get a good result.</li>
            <li>IMO, shave from rotary is superior.</li>
            <li>it is good for me&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>it is good.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t understand this had a good reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the 3,4,and 5 blade disposables for yr&#x27;s and the Panasonic is just as good..</li>
            <li>I am done with plastic razors for good.</li>
            <li>good quality&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used a lot of electric razors (Norelco, Braun), and this is as good as any of them.  </li>
            <li>Really good shaver.</li>
            <li>Battery life is good and the cleaning is no problem.  </li>
            <li>but at 1/4 the cost this Panasonic is a fantastic alternative and excellent</li>
            <li>Good work Panasonic</li>
            <li>Not as good as the Norelco.</li>
            <li>it did good on face .&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>good gift for my friends.</li>
            <li>Delighted with shave...</li>
            <li>Good product for the price.</li>
            <li>It looks and works good.</li>
            <li>Let me say, it was a good feeling after using it.</li>
            <li>And it is just as good in the shower as it is driving to work or standing at the mirror in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>I had a Norelco before and it didn&#x27;t do as good of a job.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think electric shavers gave as good a shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good reghargeable electric shaver for some time.</li>
            <li>and I did not even go the amount of time they suggest to get a good shave.</li>
            <li>Loved this , shaved like a razor.  </li>
            <li>thing feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li>do not need to shave a good product</li>
            <li>and he&#x27;s all good now.</li>
            <li>Gave me a good shave each time.</li>
            <li>It is a good product for its price .</li>
            <li>both good results.  </li>
            <li>I cannot understand all the good reviews, unless some of these are good and some are not.</li>
            <li>Good grip.</li>
            <li>But what good is that if it doesn&#x27;t shave the beard.</li>
            <li>but the results are not so good.  </li>
            <li>I believe it is a good deal.</li>
            <li>and he loved it.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome shaver, feels so smooth on my face.  </li>
            <li>Good battery</li>
            <li>good Shaver</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product over the 30 days requested, and I&#x27;m not blown away, but it does a good job.</li>
            <li>Maybe it isn&#x27;t fair to compare.</li>
            <li>All in all still a good product.</li>
            <li>and then not so good.  </li>
            <li>Good unit, not recommended as a gift for someone you share a bathroom with.</li>
            <li>I bought a Merkur handle, feather blades, proraso shave soap, and I even put oil on my face before the soap, basically I had all the equipment I needed to provide me a supposedly superior</li>
            <li>and it was good to go.</li>
            <li>All in all, a good product.</li>
            <li>Good shave every time.</li>
            <li>Good,</li>
            <li>Good price.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>seemed to be a good durable razor but the razor didn&#x27;t seem to hold charges as does my LA63s .</li>
            <li>Takes some time to get used to it but end result is good.</li>
            <li>The husband loved it.</li>
            <li>do like that it is cordless and seems to have a good battery life.</li>
            <li>you to use it,it is good</li>
            <li>Does a good job of shaving and beard trimming..recommend it to all who need a shave and don&#x27;t want the bother of lather ,etc</li>
            <li>good battery life and LED display.</li>

            <li>This is good razor that delivers day-after-day of DFS to good quality shaves.</li>
            <li>Use it a fair amount.  </li>
            <li>My husband said that the shaver works good and gives him that close shave that he likes.</li>
            <li>i used to philips , but it is not so good</li>

            <li>I am so impressed by the quality and styling of this product and by the smooth shave it gives me.</li>
            <li>and it says on the manual that it is good for 45 shaves.</li>
            <li>This has been a good shaver for me, a woman, for my legs and arms.</li>

            <li>GIVES A GOOD SHAVE .</li>
            <li>This Panasonic had good reviews - but I find that is takes longer to shave than the cheaper shaver it replaced.</li>
            <li>A FAIR CHANCE</li>
            <li>Of course, this means no irritated skin, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>Good quality razor.  </li>
            <li>Loved the price</li>
            <li>to allow corded shaving, this is a must for any good shaver in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>wanted to shave with it for a week before I wrote my review in case something popped up issue wise that I wanted to write about.  </li>
            <li>I have used electric razors for years, but never had a razor as good as this one.  </li>
            <li>This thing holds a good charge, 8-10 shaves before needing to recharge.</li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>I hope your experience is as good as mine.</li>
            <li>Good shave -- good speed -- good product.  </li>
            <li>great item, it has nice design &amp; feel good hold it in hand.  </li>
            <li>The price is very good, very clean shave.</li>
            <li>It shaves the around the neck area perfectly and clean</li>
            <li>I clean so perfectly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works excellent in the shower - lather up, shave and clean - all in one flow.</li>
            <li>Have a special needs son, and this razor works great!!</li>
            <li>Easy wash too!!</li>
            <li>Should be easy to do through Amazon!!</li>
            <li>It did however still hold and deliver a full charge - very impressive compared to some Braun shavers I owned in the past.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with my shaver; provides an excellent shave, very comfortable to hold while shaving.  </li>
            <li>It is very good and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very good ergonomics - fits the hand well and easy to hold</li>
            <li>I purchased from Amazon, which had the best price I found, and it came quickly.</li>
            <li>Having read several reviews and finding it at Amazon for the best price, I must say this is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Exceptional.  </li>
            <li>Bought this through Amazon &#x27;best buy,\\&quot; arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>It seems to do the best job of quickly shaving my scalp as well as navigating face curves.</li>
            <li>Quick charge is great too!</li>
            <li>Not the best but quite adequate.</li>
            <li>The wet-dry aspect and optional use of shaving gel are both the best, making it super convenient.</li>
            <li>Quite possibly the best electric shaver and the best shave from one that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>and like I said - it worked perfectly for 5 years, held charge well, charged fast, shaved great for cordless electric.</li>
            <li>It shaves some better than the best Braun and trims much better.</li>
            <li>The /storage/carrying bag is a great perk and the battery holds a good charge for many shaves.  </li>
            <li>I have this as a gift for my boyfriend and he is super happy!</li>
            <li>I will say the battery is ok and the thing looks good, but it is not that great of a razor.</li>
            <li>This is the best one yet very lightweight, and gives a great shave.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this one would be as good; but it is even better!</li>
            <li>He loves it, and I am happy to see his skin is now very smooth without redness or bumps.</li>
            <li>A very nice smooth shave and works great.</li>
            <li>This is a great product--a very good shave at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I find that the best shaves are obtained with shaving cream after a hot shower: what a pleasure!</li>
            <li>This unit is light, fits well in my hand and does a very good job shaving.</li>
            <li>shave is very good and smooth.</li>
            <li>This has been a very good razor which shaves closely and comfortably.</li>
            <li>Not as close as a razor or &amp;#34;as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom&amp;#34;, but very good</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other people seem to love this razor, and I don&#x27;t doubt it&#x27;s great for them, but I just can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>Out of the box I was very pleased.  </li>
            <li>Ideally, I would make the sound quieter.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>

            <li>If the shave proves reliable I&#x27;ll be very happy with it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been very pleased.  </li>

            <li>I was thrilled to start using this shaver, which gives a really good shave.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>close, good recharging, nice wet/dry use.</li>
            <li>A good price for a nice shave.</li>
            <li>Good charge retention and a readout of the remaining charge which is handy.</li>
            <li>Have always gotten good honest value from Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The sculptural shape of the razor was beautiful (about the closest thing to an Apple product) and I loved the way it naturally fit in my hand.  </li>
            <li>: As I got this shaver out of the well packaged box, it felt quite good in my hand - I liked the ergonomics.  </li>
            <li>The pop up trimmer is not quite as good as the one I have now, meaning that it is not as effective at trimming my side burns and mustache.  </li>
            <li>Very nice razor, I like it better than the Braun I used to have.  </li>
            <li>Being able to use it in the shower is very handy.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with this shaver and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good electric shaver at a fair price.</li>
            <li>I was initially impressed with this Panasonic ES8103S for its low price and very good reviews.</li>
            <li>This razor is by far the best, with a great shave and value at this time.</li>
            <li>After using a Norelco shaver for a number of years and thinking that it was the most comfortable shaver, I&#x27;m rather impressed at how well this Panasonic shaves.</li>
            <li>After reading all the great reviews, I wanted to love this shaver, honest</li>
            <li>This might work good on most people but it did not do good on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Excellent product and shipped very fast.  </li>
            <li>It would be better if it had a stand to put it in!</li>
            <li>I switched from Braun system to this and must say Panasonic is better than Braun these days!</li>
            <li>One of the better foil shavers out there!</li>
            <li>I love this razor!  </li>
            <li>I rated this product 4 stars rather than 5 since I am still seeking a perfect shave with no difficult to cut area issues and no skin irritation; nether shaver provides this.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This is the best of the four electric razors that I have owned over the years, and the first with this type of head.</li>
            <li>love this shaver!</li>
            <li>and I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>So glad I bought this razor!</li>
            <li>If you shave once in a while.. better check something else!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery life is pretty impressive.</li>
            <li>Your wife / girlfriend won&#x27;t be able to stop rubbing your face!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using the Panasonic for the first time this morning I am very impressed.  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Lots of nice features, and I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>My first shave this morning was awesome.</li>
            <li>Well I must say now I love it!  </li>
            <li>better out there for your money!</li>
            <li>You will love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most comfy shave I&#x27;ve ever had!  </li>
            <li>first Panasonic was a 3-blade ES8065 that still works flawlessly.</li>
            <li>It is remarkably close for most areas.</li>
            <li>Love it !</li>
            <li>And also the price is better!</li>
            <li>Fantastic !!</li>

            <li>Love the ability to shave in shower!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this electric shaver!  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too impressed at first</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>This shaver is better than some $200 shavers I&#x27;ve owned!    </li>
            <li>Better!</li>
            <li>Equally competent!</li>
            <li>but with this machine my skin is safe!</li>
            <li>Love this!  </li>
            <li>I love this shaver!</li>
            <li>This is my first &amp;#34;foil&amp;#34; electric shaver and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Let me say, this shaver is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>Again, when disassembling for the first time I was impressed with the simplicity of the design and the ease of cleaning and reassembly.  </li>
            <li>but the experiences were somehow ok yet!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Pleased with this purchase and would suggest it to anyone else!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>, I was pretty impressed</li>
            <li>But, this one is a quantum leap better!  </li>
            <li>My favorite shaver!</li>
            <li>at first i couldn&#x60;t get the cleaning cycle to work,but it is working perfect now.</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>I was so impressed with the first one I bought six momths ago; I decided to buy another.</li>
            <li>,I love it and so will anyone else!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>So glad I took a chance on this one!</li>
            <li>I really love it!</li>
            <li>It looks good, feels good in the hand, has good ergonomics and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced zero razor burn, and get a good, clean, shave.</li>
            <li>He love the 3-blades and says it&#x27;s very easy to use and the results are great...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very good product, very comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Cleanup in water however is great and easy to do.</li>
            <li>Cleans easily and shaves great.  </li>
            <li>This one is especially easy to clean (can use hand soap even).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit after reading all the positive reviews here I was almost expecting the thing to be perfect when I got it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and easily packed and just wonderful.  </li>
            <li>They are a good investment because it provides a close shave, it easy to use, keep its charge and good sleek.</li>
            <li>it took almost 2 weeks for my face to get use to, but now gives the best shave, smooth and easy.</li>
            <li>This shaver gives good close shaves if you shave every day and is very comfortable on my face.  </li>
            <li>Batery life is good and razor is very comfortable to hold and shave.  </li>
            <li>This is a great price for this shaver, I received on time, and it is working just fine</li>
            <li>Also, the flip up trimmer works great for fine detail work.  </li>
            <li>this product is truly awesome, i did not expect it to be that good because of the relatively low price so it was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>This is certainly the best of the lot.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful gift, easy to use, great price and easy to put together and keep clean.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and very effective.</li>
            <li>I think that is insanely amazing for an electric razor</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this great product every day.</li>
            <li>this thing is amazing.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s now just stick with Costco with their amazing return policy.</li>
            <li>So my bottom line on this product is: great technology, horribly cheap materials.  </li>
            <li>This razor is amazing.</li>
            <li>- this shaver has never given me a real smooth shave.</li>
            <li>design is both attractive and ergonomically comfortable.</li>
            <li>I owned three Brauns&lt;br /&gt;before and liked them, however, this is an amazing value considering performance and&lt;br /&gt;build</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>It is amazing; it does everything the description said it would do.</li>
            <li>Never replaced blades, just use the integrated cleaning feature - absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li>The side burn cutter is also amazing.</li>
            <li>Shaver works great - cuts close and smooth, without any &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Amazing.  </li>
            <li>but it gives him a great smooth shave.</li>
            <li>IT IS AMAZING.</li>
            <li>He says it works great and leaves a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Amazing performance after almost 5 years.</li>
            <li>I also never had foil shaver so decided to try this Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got great deal with free shipping and</li>
            <li>Not so with this amazing shaver, hairs all over my bathroom sink.</li>
            <li>Truly amazing shaver.</li>
            <li>but after couple of times of using it I started understanding the amazing capability of this shaver.  </li>
            <li>So I was not prepared for the amazing shave I get from this Arc3 wet/dry shaver.  </li>
            <li>It is just as amazing as my headblade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 9-18-2012:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still</li>
            <li>But does not seem spectacular for face hair.</li>
            <li>This shaver provides me with the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric shaver, it glides nicely along my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>Charge % display is nice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-I do notice that the foil gets warm towards the end of the shave, it doesn&#x27;t burn me, but I notice an increase in temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think the what you get for your money makes this a good value, and as noted, I&#x27;m buying 2 more.  </li>
            <li>I almost forgot...be sure to give this shaver a fair shake...</li>
            <li>I noticed the foil gets warm after one side of the face is done.  </li>
            <li>am thrilled to not have to buy razor refills and shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Shaves nice and close and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin.  </li>
            <li>However, he really liked the quality of the shave and wanted to stick with the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>I honestly can recommend this shaver and Panasonic has won me over as they kept their word with what was advertised.</li>
            <li>The charge indicator is nice.  </li>
            <li>also this gives a nice close shave with no burn.  </li>
            <li>and I liked the self cleaning station.  </li>
            <li>Battery life is quite good although it does self-discharge at about 10%/week although this might improve as the battery is used more.</li>
            <li>This one gets in close and fits nice in the hand.</li>
            <li>I would say that I am pleased with this product and if the longevity is good I will buy another when the time comes.</li>
            <li>This is a nice shaver.  </li>
            <li>I now own two, one for the home and one for the car.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice if it came with a cleaning brush.</li>
            <li>The reviews pointed to the Panasonic ES8103S as a good bet, so I gave it a try -- and  I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>This is an okay razor, but not as good as I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
            <li>The charge indicator and alerts for cleaning and recharging are nice features.  </li>
            <li>When using it, I can tell that the blades are giving off some heat, as it is warm on my face.</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Speaking of travel shavers, I also own a Panasonic ES3833 wet/dry, battery-operated travel shaver.</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>Speaking of travel shavers, I also own a Panasonic ES3833 wet/dry, battery-operated travel shaver.</li>
            <li>but you&#x27;ll need to be handy with a soldering iron.  </li>
            <li>-- Again, maybe an issue with all foil shavers, but I have found that instead of catching the shaved off whiskers they are ending up all over the counter and my shirt.  </li>
            <li>-- Again, maybe an issue with all foil shavers, but I have found that instead of catching the shaved off whiskers they are ending up all over the counter and my shirt.  </li>
            <li>Having used electrical shavers my whole life I have to say this is the best one I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>It was quieter than the others and much faster and best of all</li>
            <li>A fairly close shave with a trimmer that is okay.  </li>
            <li>After my Panasonic was lost (to put it nicely) from my travel bag, I decided to get a Braun shaver.  </li>
            <li>Product was just as described..very nice.</li>
            <li>nice shave..</li>
            <li>I have also recommended this system to a friend who also is loving the results.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s about as nice as a compliment as I can give it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best shave ever gotten from an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>I told my buddy he could use my razor, but that if he liked it, he&#x27;d have to date his own.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll have him shave me with my own razor.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is well placed to handle sideburns and works nicely for shaping beards if that&#x27;s what you want.</li>
            <li>It has a nice battery, When it is charged to %100</li>
            <li>nice item for man</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with the purchase.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with its good quality.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have to be honest.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t want to have to keep cortisone cream handy for shaving</li>
            <li>Also, the Braun will not move over your skin if it is oily or micro-moist from a warm bathroom, even with shaving powder.</li>
            <li>Good price and so far very happy with results.</li>
            <li>The battery &#x27;countdown&#x27; on the display is nice, not just a warning that you&#x27;ve run out.  </li>
            <li>I have learned that each razor has its own characteristics.</li>
            <li>Really a nice razor, quite too.</li>
            <li>Really, really, really like this shaver: great on my legs!</li>
            <li>nice to use in the shower</li>
            <li>That comes in really handy.</li>
            <li>Make sure you hold onto your receipt, there&#x27;s a good chance you may need it.</li>
            <li>The product was really convenient to use and gives awesome experience.</li>
            <li>Nice, close shave.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>it as good or better as my braun 5-series shaver it replaced.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve own Braun shavers for years.</li>
            <li>I bought this razor after much searching and I must say I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
            <li>It charges fully in about 1 hour, providing 7-8 shaves, and the charge display (at 10% increments) is a nice feature to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, moving head is nice although I don&#x27;t use that function.</li>
            <li>Now that&#x27;s good value :)</li>
            <li>-Looks nice...</li>
            <li>I used to own Panasonic ES8066 and still own it.</li>
            <li>He is just thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li>Nice balance, close shave.</li>
            <li>The shaver itself handles very well and does give a great shave!</li>
            <li>Nice close shave.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really need all the bells and whistles so this one is perfect.</li>
            <li>The battery level indicator is a really nice feature and takes the guesswork out of knowing when it&#x27;s time for a recharge.</li>
            <li>even better, but for me I am completely satisfied and see no need to improve upon what I consider to be a great razor.</li>
            <li>The trimmer accessory is awesome and the shaver is smooth and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Prompts on display for charging and cleaning are nice.</li>
            <li>Nice shape, fits hand well.</li>
            <li>Gets quite warm while in use.   </li>
            <li>This shaver is really nice.  </li>
            <li>Nice and close shaves.</li>
            <li>I get results that are as good as or better than any streight razor I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>It might come in handy for when shaving with a blade isn&#x27;t an option.  </li>
            <li>My dad ordered this one and really liked it.</li>
            <li>Its kind of compact, really great to hold and comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>but it does a really nice job</li>
            <li>This updated model has a floating head which is nice</li>
            <li>I owned a Braun many years ago and loved it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>So my experience is keep a razor handy if you do not plan on shaving every day.</li>
            <li>but the shaver part is awesome and works very well.</li>
            <li>It does a nice close shave and it does catch the longer hairs also.</li>
            <li>I own a separate trimmer.</li>
            <li>bought this one per the good reviews and the razor is probably ok, but I was expecting more,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Now that he&#x27;s getting used to the shaver, he&#x27;s getting a really nice close shave.</li>
            <li>This may be the quickest charging model I own.  </li>
            <li>I get a really nice, close shave with it.</li>
            <li>Still not as good as a blade, but does the job and is much more convenient.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would be nice if you could lock the shaver in the &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; position.</li>
            <li>some kind of power off lock would be nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice close shave.  </li>
            <li>Husband liked the shave</li>
            <li>I guess you have to spend more than this to get a good electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Couple of times I did, I got &#x27;missed a spot&#x27; kind of comments.</li>
            <li>Nice design.(shape)&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good for about 3 years, after that the batteries won&#x27;t hold a charge for more than one or two shaves.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t ever get another kind.</li>
            <li>the downside, the grip isn&#x27;t quite as nice.</li>
            <li>but does an excellent job of providing a very close shave.</li>
            <li>Thrilled with the quality of the shave using this model</li>
            <li>Have used top of the line Braun and this shaver shaves just as good.</li>
            <li>The high-speed cleaning feature is a nice addition.</li>
            <li>Do your own research.</li>
            <li>Just like many have found out, this is a really good shaver.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;linear\\&quot; feature on their higher-end models is excellent, moving the blade so fast that the the beard seems to evaporate.</li>
            <li>Ive always had Rotary Norelcos and wanted to try a diff kind.</li>
            <li>Effective:</li>
            <li>: readout of charge remaining is nice; blinking \\&quot;charge me\\&quot; icon is convenient  </li>
            <li>Nice to have it be waterproof, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am glad I made a good choice.</li>
            <li>The trimmer works nicely.</li>
            <li>Just get the WES 9013PC replacement kit on its own.  </li>
            <li>Well, it would be nice if it were muted a bit.  </li>
            <li>and it does the job nicely in both conditions.</li>
            <li>And the clipper also works nicely.</li>
            <li>Excellent item thanks..</li>
            <li>Excellent, close shave &amp; very well built.</li>
            <li>I use this for shaving my head, and it provides a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>The Shaver Saver is nice to use in between shaves as maintenance.</li>
            <li>The nice thing is I notice no drop off in power from 100% charged to the 40%.  </li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>I really liked this razor.</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower, which is really nice to get a close shave.</li>
            <li>It gets nice and close on edges.&lt;br /&gt;*Overall</li>
            <li>It gets nice and close on edges.&lt;br /&gt;*Overall</li>
            <li>This is the best wet/dry shaver that I have found and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I do rinse it in the sink when I&#x27;m done and have noticed that it has a nice &#x27;stench&#x27; afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Pivots and flexes nicely.</li>
            <li>It has a nice weight to it.</li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t be cost effective to return it to Amazon even though I could.</li>
            <li>Nice shaver for the money,</li>
            <li>Does a nice  conferrtable shave.</li>
            <li>I still use skin balm after shaving, but now I do it to smell nice.  </li>
            <li>I have always used Braun and bottom line is they really are the best.</li>
            <li>liked it a lot</li>
            <li>The reviews tell a good story, the overwhelming majority of people give this one 4 or 5 stars because that makes sense.</li>
            <li>I liked the reviews on this product and have never owned an electric razor before.</li>
            <li>Having used Braun shavers for many years, I was looking for a good shaver with a lithium-ion battery</li>
            <li>Nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li>Nice job.</li>
            <li>Wet/dry is handy feature, as is the cleaning method.</li>
            <li>He liked this one</li>
            <li>Nice close shave.  </li>
            <li>ONE.VERY NICE.</li>
            <li>This provides a nice, close shave.</li>
            <li>It is a wet/dry razor, which is nice if you like to change it up once in a while.</li>
            <li>well, kind of forgot about it for awhile.</li>
            <li>He liked that it also had a beard trimmer since he has a goatee.</li>
            <li>Time&#x27;s up, you own it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>So nice to not have to go through the morning ritual with blades and shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I honestly regret not replacing that piece of trash a year go and at 70.00 this razor is a steal.</li>
            <li>BTW its nice to just wash it after every shave there</li>
            <li>the grip is nicely made and the head can be locked so it doesn&#x27;t move or unlocked...</li>
            <li>works ok, not so good on neck.  </li>
            <li>Percent charge remaining is nice as is the sonic setting used for cleaning.  </li>
            <li>It provides a nice close shave with no skin rash, etc.  </li>
            <li>the most i&#x27;ve ever paid for one and the battery life is good for about 10 shaves (1 per day)</li>
            <li>gives a nice close shave and a trimer</li>
            <li>Nice product.  </li>
            <li>This one is the absolute best!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I reget the purchase because it works well, charges fast and has stuck with me for a while, but it&#x27;s not the best electric shaver out there.</li>
            <li>Razor is a good value.&lt;br /&gt;Works better as a trimmer according to my son.&lt;br</li>
            <li>All of the above,This Shaver is a nice thing.</li>
            <li>The really nice thing is that I can use it with shaving cream.</li>
            <li>but it is kind of dust</li>
            <li>I could buy 3 of these for what it cost me to own one Braun.  </li>
            <li>The battery display is handy.</li>
            <li>The wet/dry ability is nice, too.</li>
            <li>The side cutter on the ES8103S is good and better than the Braun or the Norelco.  </li>
            <li>It is not as good as the side cutter on the Panasonic ES4000 because it is mounted on the side of the razor body whereas the ES4000 cutter extends beyond the head of the razor and can better access areas around the ears and dangling nose hairs.</li>
            <li>the percentage of charge remaining window is nice</li>
            <li>/&gt;Good:&lt;br /&gt;- looks nice</li>
            <li>Honestly, I gave it a try knowing that I have never had luck with the electric razors.</li>
            <li>Kind of a pain to use.</li>
            <li>Nice price</li>
            <li>Awesome product and it works really well.  </li>
            <li>I think it would be nice if it was a bit wider.  </li>
            <li>It looks nice and works well to me.</li>
            <li>absolutely the best electric I have ever owned!  </li>
            <li>The flex head is nice as it contours around your face.</li>
            <li>I found it got kind of gummy.</li>
            <li>is nice &amp; appears to do a nice job.&lt;br /&gt;Tomorrow</li>
            <li>When you now get started, you will have to be accustomed to it before you learn how to use effectively.</li>
            <li>, it just would of been nice to feel they appreciate my business.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still giving it three stars, because I feel that it&#x27;s well built, a good value, and that others with easier beards might have better luck than me.</li>
            <li>He gets a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>In fact, when my brother tried it he absolutely liked it.</li>
            <li>I tried it because of the good reviews and the reviews were once more on the money.</li>
            <li>and it is an excellent combo, highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>That said it seems to be working ok after 2 months the shave quality is good with this 3 foil razor with 2 blades.</li>
            <li>Fits my hands nicely</li>
            <li>A NICE PIECE OF EQUIPMENT.  </li>
            <li>I do have to say that the return was a piece of cake but would much rather had a great razor with no return!!!!</li>
            <li>Good or better than my Braun.</li>
            <li>Does a nice close cut.</li>
            <li>Just as good or better shave than $300 Braun Shaver I have.</li>
            <li>Awesome, really does shave 99% as close as a blade with zero irritation.</li>
            <li>is truly astounding.</li>
            <li>Has nice recharging ability.</li>
            <li>Gets nice close shave in under a minute.</li>
            <li>A simpler charge indicator that was always on would be nice.  </li>
            <li>Best shave speed and smoothness, fast recharge, cord/cordless operation.</li>
            <li>Knowing this, and knowing my price points, I started my own research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product, though, works reasonably well and is the best blade substitute I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>but this own has outlasted them all.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice shave.</li>
            <li>Nice shaver.</li>
            <li>Even with trendy retro double-edged safety razors.</li>
            <li>which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li>The price was right and the ratings were very good.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice reliable razor for primarily shower use.  </li>
            <li>It was a very nice, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Quick easy, no fuss, excellent results all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shave wasn&#x27;t perfect, but there was no irritation, it did a nice job on my face and a decent job on my neck.  </li>
            <li>clean an nice, great resistance to water, and cleaning</li>
            <li>I got it for 50 bucks here on Amazon and it is totally worth my money!!!</li>
            <li>but this is great shaver with closeness for a clean shave.</li>
            <li>display is great for reminding you to clean and recharge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has not made me better looking or more successful.</li>
            <li>Everything else about it was great, it just couldn&#x27;t clean my neck.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it on weekends when I do not need the clean shave of a razor and am happy with it.</li>
            <li>First, I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it worked but after time, it great!</li>
            <li>Great shaver -- I&#x27;ve had mine for 4 years, and it still does a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li>but the main function is perfect!</li>

            <li>I highly recommend this excellent product!</li>
            <li>But this is an awesome product and is highly recommended.</li>

            <li>This new shaver is excellent.  </li>
            <li>this new Panasonic is incredible!</li>
            <li>I am so impressed I just bought replacement blades which I never do because of the cost vs a new razor.</li>

            <li>I bought a new razor and as it turns out one I&#x27;m very happy with.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t get that detailed and the shaver does a good job on its own.  </li>
            <li>men seem to have medium - light beards, that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s so many great ratings.</li>

            <li>Quick shipment and great product.</li>
            <li>Best to get two of anything you like, next year&#x27;s models are not always (if ever) quite as good.</li>
            <li>The closeness of the shave is also excellent, which, again, is the key to a good</li>
            <li>Whatever, I have finally found the perfect shaver at a really good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had this shaver for a couple of weeks and it works great for a quick morning shave.  </li>
            <li>Great for a wet/dry quick shave.</li>

            <li>This is a great razor which allows you to shave quickly.</li>
            <li>Great razor, shaved my beard off really quickly, but do not leave it in the bag they include, after you rinse it with water, or it will become stinky.</li>

            <li>I read the reviews and it seemed like the shave was good and smooth, and</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve been very impressed with the close shave that it provides.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best electric razor I ever owned.  </li>
            <li>The features are nice, but the shaver itself could be a bit better.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic ES8103S is a great balance of useful features vs price.  </li>
            <li>I have had about 4 shavers and this is the best one so far.</li>
            <li>By far, the best shaver I have ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Far and away the best shaver I ever owned and</li>
            <li>This is the best by far.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best shaver I&#x27;ve obtain to reduce the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow</li>
            <li>I am 74 years old and this is the best shave I have ever had.</li>
            <li>WOW, I am so impressed.  </li>
            <li>I read online that the best thing for people with sensitive skin and acne is to shave with an electric razor</li>
            <li>This is by far the best electric razor that I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>The shaver is surprising lightweight but doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.  </li>
            <li>But the most amazing thing of all is cleaning.</li>
            <li>I got this one about three weeks ago and so far, I would say this is the best one ever.</li>
            <li>This one by far is the best one I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Amazing - seems to work even better for me than the reviews here.</li>
            <li>This model is proving to be dependable and an improvement over my old one, and cost-wise, is also an excellent value.</li>
            <li>this is by far the best shave.</li>
            <li>For my sensitive skin, that&#x27;s what&#x27;s worked best.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After two weeks of using the Panasonic ES8103s shaver I must say its a good comfortable shaver for the price, but for me I&#x27;m going to pass.</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing electric shaver I have ever had -- or used.  </li>
            <li>Thus far this is the best rechargeable razor I&#x27;ve ever owned (have used it for a week).  </li>
            <li>The weight is good and the handle is comfortable in any position or grip.  </li>
            <li>Best Shaver I&#x27;ve got so far.</li>
            <li>I use both hand and electric razor and this one by FAR yields the best results!</li>
            <li>good fit for orient people&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li>Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Rechargeable Linear Pivot Action Shaving System, Silver is excellent and performs as advertised.</li>
            <li>so far excellent shave .</li>
            <li>So far this electric shaver is the best.</li>
            <li>This has worked perfectly for me so far.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned a lot of electric razors in my lifetime and this one is by far the best yet.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin i think this would be the perfect machine for you.</li>
            <li>So far I would rate it excellent.</li>
            <li>It lasts many cycles and does a really nice job.</li>
            <li>and I have owned most of the popular brands out there.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I can&#x27;t imagine a better shaving experience for what I paid ($54.99).  </li>
            <li>This is my 4th electric/rechargeable razor and this is the best one so far.  </li>
            <li>By far the best electric razor I have ever had in my 64 years.  </li>
            <li>So far I am very happy with this shaver and recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li>I love it and its so nice.</li>
            <li>This is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve had so far.  </li>
            <li>so I gave it a try, and so far, it is the best shaver I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I think in this price range we know what we are getting - not the bottom of the barrel cheap electric shavers that don&#x27;t stand up to the test of time, nor provide a good shave.</li>
            <li>Will update this review after some time (Panasonic mentions 30 days) to see if extended beard growth can be handled more effectively.</li>
            <li>and so far it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>GREAT VALUE - WORTH THE PRICE.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had electric shavers before, but this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>This shaver is by far the best I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used electric razors and this is by far the best one that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The results are just too patchy no matter how many passes you make or what kind of technique</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice to just be able to wash the heads.</li>
            <li>This razor does a wonderful job on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Its comfortable to hold while you are shaving and gives a good shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had electric shavers for over 40 years and this one is the best by far.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is by far the best shaver I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely perfect for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to buy a product where the company can guarantee its&#x27; quality (for more than 90 days let&#x27;s say, Panasonic puts a 2 year warranty on this).</li>
            <li>Practical, cheap, good built quality</li>
            <li>The purchase price and free shipping made this shaver a good value.</li>
            <li>So far i am very happy that it gets as close as a bic razor.</li>
            <li>To my surprise he actually liked it :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to rinse it off when done.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still getting used to it, but so far I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li>I think it may come in handy now and again, but for the most part it just sits there.  </li>
            <li>you are looking for an exceptional shaver I would strongly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>Much better than normal razors and the best electric shaver</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has been almost 9 months, and I cannot count how many times he has thanked us and commented on how wonderful his new shaver is.  </li>
            <li>It is a great shave!&lt;br /&gt;- Do not expect it to work smoothly right away if you&#x27;re switching from the blade.</li>
            <li>He used this one right away (it arrived fully charged) and thought it was great.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine, so I</li>
            <li>it is easy!  </li>
            <li>I bought the Panasonic ES8103S in December of 2010 and it is still going strong!</li>
            <li>I strongly recomend this!</li>
            <li>5 years and still running strong!</li>
            <li>The shave is quality is excellent - almost as good as a razor, and the experience is fast, smooth and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>The best thing is, I can run it under hot water to clean it.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work that good for the price you pay for it!</li>
            <li>Aside from doing what the ads say, it is very quiet, easy to handle and provides a very good shave - a welcome way to start the day.    </li>
            <li>Good, clean shave.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many razors over the years, but this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>It gives a great shave and it is extremley easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The wet/dry feature is really great, and it&#x27;s easy to charge and clean.</li>
            <li>When it stops grinding, I know I&#x27;m clean and good</li>
            <li>When it stops grinding, I know I&#x27;m clean and good to go.  </li>
            <li>It works great and is so easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I am still in the assessing programme but so far am most impressed.</li>
            <li>This shaver provides a good clean shave.  </li>
            <li>I have been a Panasonic user for nearly 10 years now and have been very impressed by the quality of the product, but more so by the quality of the shave.  </li>
            <li>Clean shave, feels good.</li>
            <li>The water foucet icon display is a good reminder to clean the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Panasonic ES8103S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric... does a faster job for shaving, trimmer works great for my mustache and side burns and the unit is easy to clean either with a brush or by washing it.</li>
            <li>overall I am happy and the thing still works great.</li>
            <li>It holds charge and gives a good clean shave.  </li>
            <li>but honestly, the shaves just keep getting better and better.  </li>
            <li>He states it is easy to use, clean and does a great job.  </li>
            <li>Pro - Battery level display, clean alert; rapid charging process; looks good  </li>
            <li>There may be better ways to do it, but this works the best for me so far.    </li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and gives a great close shave.</li>
            <li>I loved the clean shave, he wasn&#x27;t impressed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shaver is easy to clean and maintain.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a great buy, just skip the using it in the shower.</li>
            <li>I bought it because it was reasonably priced, got reasonably good reviews for closeness of shave, and the brand got good reliability</li>
            <li>flexible and quiet-a good fast shaver with a good trimmer.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and was a great price.</li>
            <li>With the Panasonic I get a good, clean, close shave every time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easier (for me and him) to clean and does a good cut.</li>
            <li>My husband has had many shavers over the years, from Norelco to Braun; but this one is by far his best.  </li>
            <li>best shaver I have ever used, fast and comfortable with a close shave.</li>
            <li>But be aware, it is super noisy!!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a joy to use and charges very fast...</li>
            <li>So in my opinion, there&#x27;s nothing special about the ES8103, but it&#x27;s basically a good razor</li>
            <li>When Amazon ran a holiday special for about $65, this seemed too good to pass up.</li>
            <li>When I received it and used it the first time I was fairly happy with it</li>
            <li>The first use was a great surprise.</li>
            <li>first shave was great</li>
            <li>, I first thought it was great, guess because it didn&#x27;t eat my face off.  </li>
            <li>Got what I paid for, pretty happy but it could be cheaper.</li>
            <li>This is apparently the best shaver my husband has ever had.</li>
            <li>But even at that higher price, it&#x27;s a great shaver for the money.</li>
            <li>Since then, it consistently gives a great shave.</li>
            <li>important, it looks very elegant</li>
            <li>Great product, my husband loves it, he said shaving is a lot faster now, thanks!</li>
            <li>The saver is great, battery life is outstanding and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I decided to give the ES8103S a try and after about six weeks I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to charge, quite and good shave.</li>
            <li>To clean it, I just pop the top off and give it a good blow on either side.</li>

            <li>shaver is very comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li>The result is a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Very smooth, and delivers a quality shave each and every time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ergonomically built and very light weight.</li>
            <li>and I have a very light beard.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and battery lasts.</li>
            <li>and if i just want to get a quick go-over without getting close, it&#x27;s good for that.</li>
            <li>Nice n easy.</li>
            <li>Shaving after splashing some warm water on the face yields pretty good results too.    </li>
            <li>This shaver does a good shave but not as good as an older Panasonic I have had for many years.</li>
            <li>Excellent battery life; you could probably shave for 30 mins straight on a full charge and</li>
            <li>It gives him a close shave, is handy, and easy to transport when traveling.</li>
            <li>A good quick shave.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li>Well, I first liked this shaver because it worked good.  </li>
            <li>It charges quickly and the battery life is quite good.</li>
            <li>Conclusion: there are higher priced shavers out there that look fancier, and I&#x27;m sure they have some useful bells and whistles this one doesn&#x27;t have, but this is a great, attractive shaver that feels good in your hand and is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>The shaver is great, light and charges quickly.</li>
            <li>It is a good hand fit and easy to move around his face.  </li>
            <li>It is light and easy to use and has good instructions.</li>
            <li>He is able to shave with this shaver very comfortably.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very happy with it as It shaves as close as a regular razor and leaves my face very smooth.</li>
            <li>I have very fair, sensitive skin as I am blond.</li>
            <li>, it has a very good trimmer for sideburns and the pivoting action of the razor head</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s been a very good purchase for me.  </li>
            <li>In addition to being quite loud, this shaver does not do a very good job of shaving - even after many passes.  </li>
            <li>The vibrating foil does a better job than Norelco&#x27;s spinning blade heads - probably faster blade speed.</li>
            <li>it is the most powerfull shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li>He is handicaped in many ways &amp; is on blood thinning medicine &amp; they wouldn&#x27;t shave him unless he had a electric r portable razor.</li>
            <li>This shaver never holds a charge for more than 2-3 shaves anymore.</li>
            <li>I wanted a great shave in between using my razor on the weekends and this really fits the bill.</li>
            <li>more foam\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>However, the shaver seems to work better on my face with some water.</li>
            <li>it hurts a LOT MORE with this shaver when you put your after shave on.  </li>
            <li>nope, even more irritation.</li>
            <li>The instructions say to use it with shaving cream for a month and then you can do it without the shave cream, however, I have never been able to get to that point.  </li>
            <li>need to go over areas of face more than once but still</li>
            <li>ok.  </li>
            <li>, BTW, don&#x27;t believe that hogwash about having to use an electric 30 days or more....</li>
            <li>Price is ok for product.</li>
            <li>I say, invest in your face and get a more pricey one.</li>
            <li>so I ordered this and it has been a night and day difference better.  </li>
            <li>You probably won&#x27;t find that magical electric shaver that you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned several brands and rate this the best for both shaving and ease of cleaning.</li>
            <li>Amazon even had a $15 off coupon for the Arc 3 and that makes this an even better value!&lt;br</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>On the face, it is ok.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic, it turns out, is a quantum leap better.</li>
            <li>but with this I am able to shave every day (even in the morning and at night before going out).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-wet shave in the shower is even better</li>
            <li>And before buying I read the reviews and have found for the most part, that I am in line with others views.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>And before buying I read the reviews and have found for the most part, that I am in line with others views.    </li>
            <li>Love this razor and would recommended it to others looking.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean  Good battery life    </li>
            <li>Better than a $200 Braun.</li>
            <li>After a month, I am extremely pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li>yes but a 5 or 7 series and way more $$$$ than the pana..</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research to see what was getting top reviews in the $75-$150 range.  </li>
            <li>I find I can&#x27;t seem to get quite as close of a shave with it, but I believe that is because the shaver screen is a bit more robust than the Remington.  </li>
            <li>I bought it on the recommendation of a friend, and I love it.</li>
            <li>that might be a consideration for many people.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li>I love this shaver period.</li>
            <li>I had a Panasonic shaver for many years</li>
            <li>and I hope to find a better product to replace it.</li>
            <li>after two months of use, I&#x27;m quite satisfied.</li>
            <li>altogether way more pluses than minuses.</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>A former co-worker recommended it, and I was very happy to discover it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many electric razors.  </li>
            <li>Better to have each percent shown or</li>
            <li>Probably because they use more plastic parts to save on cost, but still it is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is okay but could be better.</li>
            <li>(it does seem to shave better that way</li>
            <li>It tugs a bit more at the skin.</li>
            <li>I would have no doubt facial shaving would be equally superb!</li>
            <li>Try it and you too will love the results.</li>
            <li>I have been on a quest for a better shaver for many years.  </li>
            <li>but after many &#x27;trials,&#x27; it becomes second-nature.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer in the Braun did work much better.  </li>
            <li>and I could not have bought a better razor for him.</li>
            <li>Shaving in the shower, he&#x27;s able to shave almost as close as a razor, but his skin has NO irritation.  </li>
            <li>The charge lasts more than a week; I didn&#x27;t bother to bring the charger on my 1 week business trip to Europe.  </li>
            <li>It is still my favorite razor.  </li>
            <li>I love this shaver and will never use another brand again.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I have shaved with gillette blades for over 15 years now, and suffered most of it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad to give it up for a better shave    Notes:   </li>
            <li>- Takes more time to shave vs. razor (</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the top of the line, and it&#x27;s not an el cheapo.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver, everything as the ad said.</li>
            <li>I would endure all these annoyances for a better, smoother shave.</li>
            <li>I am totally pleased with my razor.  </li>
            <li>I was a long-term Braun user, but am glad I switched to the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>because I just didn&#x27;t know any better.   </li>
            <li>I found that today, I am glad I didn&#x27;t throw out my $30 one, because in the end, it was the one that didn&#x27;t act like a dysfunctional lawnmower.     </li>
            <li>The rotary felt more like a power tool in your hand.  </li>
            <li>I have been using electric shavers for over 30 years now and have tried many of them.</li>
            <li>The razor is a bit noisy and cumbersome to hold compared to the shape of most rotary razor bodies.</li>
            <li>So my review is &amp;#34;go for the Braun and pay the price for a better shave.</li>
            <li>My Norelco was so-so, my Braun was better, my Remington was a joke.</li>
            <li>I can say that even more surely now.</li>
            <li>It is a critical reason why this is the best.</li>
            <li>Love the battery power sensor, and wash/charge reminders.</li>
            <li>I would have liked to see a nicer travel case instead of the cheap cloth bag, but as for the shaver itsef, I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a reason to spend more money, and I would recommend this Panasonic shaver to a friend.</li>
            <li>Love my Panasonic.</li>
            <li>The trimmer seems better than most that I have used on shavers as well as it cuts even and doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;chew\\&quot; through like a lot of shaver trimmers.</li>
            <li>This allows the razor to make more cuts per unit time for better coverage.  </li>
            <li>The sonic cleaning mode seems to do a good job of keeping the blades clean, is easy to use, and does not take up space like some of those self cleaning models.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is the best electric shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I like this Panasonic much better.  </li>
            <li>It is great, giving me a really close shave and no cuts.  </li>
            <li>While it has a pivot system for myself I have found that it works better if I lock it in place.  </li>
            <li>None of them lasted much more than a year.</li>
            <li>So, if you are traveling, make sure you pack the shaver away</li>
            <li>So, if you are traveling, make sure you pack the shaver away safely.    </li>
            <li>Simply put, this razor is the best I have owned.</li>
            <li>I will say that even consumer reports lists this razor as one of the best and for the price, it simply can&#x27;t be beat.  </li>
            <li>I thought all electrics just required many passes to get a so-so shave.  </li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;m glad I did</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really glad I chose this one.</li>
            <li>It is an okay razor for the money.  </li>
            <li>Great price and really the closest shave</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hooked on Panasonic now and when I have to replace this, I&#x27;ll be sure to stick with them.</li>
            <li>I have not had an electric shaver in more than 20 years.</li>
            <li>I think it is quieter than many I have used.  </li>
            <li>Just be sure to read the instructions for cleaning.    </li>
            <li>I have used (prefer) electrics for many years, both rotary and foil.</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>3/14/2012 - Still love my shaver.  </li>
            <li>holds a charge for many days.  </li>
            <li>I also love that it can be used wet/dry and cleaned with water.</li>
            <li>more time for shaving , -shave</li>
            <li>Pleased with all my purchases</li>
            <li>I was in need of changing heads and my brother recommended this razor and I am glad that he did and that I took his advice.  </li>
            <li>While using this item with shaving cream I received much better results.</li>
            <li>and they keep getting better.  </li>
            <li>it gave a much better shave.</li>
            <li>This shaver is much better than the Norelco it replaced.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;m getting a closer shave than I was able to get with a razor.  </li>
            <li>With this shaver, I just take the top off and shake out the hairs, and now</li>
            <li>The Braun is ok</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m looking for something better.</li>
            <li>The trimmer isn&#x27;t any better.</li>
            <li>I hope amazon will let me return it used, because there&#x27;s no way it&#x27;s touching my face again, and otherwise I&#x27;ll just be out the $65.</li>
            <li>I love Panasonic Wet/Dry Shavers and have been using them for many many years.</li>
            <li>but I love the Panasonic shave quality and the versatility of their Wet/Dry shavers.</li>
            <li>but this one is so much better.</li>
            <li>I have owned several panasonic shavers over the years and find this one to be the best.</li>
            <li>I decided that I needed a better razor that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I saw no reason to purchase a shaver for more than a hundred dollars.  </li>
            <li>although I am beginning to think it does a better job (closer shave).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: Now using this shaver for 6 months, I feel qualified to tell you guys that I still love this shaver.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d get a better shave from a blade.</li>
            <li>I had considered the 4-head design costing a bit more, but I thought that was overkill and too bulky for my taste.</li>
            <li>While I wouldn&#x27;t know how those perform, I can&#x27;t imagine them being any better than this one.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m more of a board shorts and tee shirt type guy</li>
            <li>I did a notable amount of research on both price and reviews before I selected it and from where I bought it.</li>

            <li>All in all, I am pleased with this razor and would recommend it to anyone looking for a next-step or two-up from an entry level electric razor.</li>
            <li>I bought this after doing hours of research on what the best mid level electric razor was.</li>
            <li>that just costs more money every time to refill.</li>
            <li>, I doubt that electric razors will ever get better than this in terms of closeness of shave.  </li>
            <li>ease of cleaning is fantastic!</li>
            <li>$blades must be way better.</li>
            <li>Buy one, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>I love how it forms to the contour of your face while cutting.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I since had two Brauns and they were OK.</li>
            <li>It eclipsed my Braun and Remington in every way, in terms of shaving and usage; I like the looks of the Braun a bit more.  </li>
            <li>I have owned many.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for about 20 years, mostly the wet/dry type when they came out &amp; mostly Panasonics.    </li>
            <li>I keep it in a plastic glass along with my toothbrush, which is actually more convenient than a stand.  </li>
            <li>I had several electric razors and this is the best one ever, I do wish it had a charging stand, though.</li>
            <li>After reading (too) many reviews I ordered the Panasonic ES8103S.   </li>
            <li>What a fabulous razor, a dream!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a great product that works very well.</li>
            <li>Now this is based on shaving with it 5 times with it, but I have really enjoyed it and do recommend</li>
            <li>Considering the cost of the Gillette 5 Blade cartridges, the Panasonic looks like an even better value.</li>
            <li>and he has said that it is better than that one.</li>
            <li>Compare with Norelco and Braun - I like the shave of Panasonic better.</li>
            <li>maybe over time my experience will be better</li>
            <li>and he love it .</li>
            <li>and thank me bought it for him. :)</li>
            <li>I would have rated it five stars but the stubble on my face takes considerably more effort.</li>
            <li>If you shave your head, you will love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are a lot of things that I love about the shaver.</li>
            <li>That means that you have to plan ahead and charge it before you need to shave (which makes the battery percent display all the more convenient).</li>
            <li>My face was baby-bottom smooth!   </li>
            <li>unsuccessful finding electric razor that cuts close any better than this.</li>
            <li>I have owned many different electric shavers over the years and this is the best one!</li>
            <li>The Braun never gave me a satisfying shave</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t ask for better service.</li>
            <li>Using a combination of an electric shaver and a blade gets my shave much closer and definitely more comfortable than just using a blade alone regardless if the blade is a top of the line Gillette, which probably the best blade design available.</li>
            <li>I am now quite pleased with it.</li>
            <li>(but cord is better for</li>
            <li>I have owned many electric shavers over the years.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I am able to get over 10 shaves per charge on it.  </li>
            <li>Bought this model because it was ranked as the third best Pansonic shaver you could buy.  </li>
            <li>I love the ability to wash it under the faucet and not worry about water damage.  </li>
            <li>but you have to go over your face too many times to get a close shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the performance will suffer, but it&#x27;s the best/closest shave</li>
            <li>shaving quality: It was better compared to</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall: The shaver is OK for the price</li>
            <li>Overall a very good shaver!!</li>
            <li>This razor is ok.</li>
            <li>Better then</li>
            <li>I love the battery meter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased</li>
            <li>so of course I have to go over a couple spots more than once</li>
            <li>It works better on shorter hair, not so well on 3+ day hair.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research and decided that I didn&#x27;t want to pay more than $100.  </li>
            <li>You cannot get a better shaver for the money.  </li>
            <li>This is actually a better shaver than the one I returned.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this razor.</li>
            <li>Plus price here on Amazon is top notch.  </li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>The shave is ok but not close</li>
            <li>I was amazed at the quality of the shave I was able to get, and</li>
            <li>even n more amazed that I got virtually no razor burn.  </li>
            <li>This electric shaver is way better than any razor blade I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>but this shaver works for better.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I do find that this shaver does do a much better job on my chin area.</li>
            <li>makes it work so much better.  </li>
            <li>just something in my situation might want to consider, a norelco might be more forgiving.</li>
            <li>A shorter beefier handle would have made it much more practical as well as</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there might be some microscopic difference between the closeness of the shave, but I couldn&#x27;t tell.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The battery life is excellent and the charge time is very short.</li>
            <li>and it worked a bit better.  </li>
            <li>Outstanding shaver --</li>
            <li>GLAD</li>
            <li>It has become a favorite task to shave.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>This is a phenomenal shaver.  </li>
            <li>It has done everything that I need and more.  </li>
            <li>In effect, this electric shaver has mostly replaced shaving cream, making the shaving task quicker.  </li>
            <li>but overall I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>Now he is always as smooth as a baby with no razor burn or in grown hairs to bother him!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it&#x27;s waterproof</li>
            <li>Much better shave than the Philips Norelco.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think you could find a better shaver for the money.</li>
            <li>wonder how many shavers they sell just because of that...</li>
            <li>I love the closeness of the shaves as well as the ease of cleaning the razor.</li>
            <li>I just wish it did a better job shaving.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you put the cover on the blade.</li>
            <li>but now that I&#x27;ve had this one for over a month I can tell you that its much better.</li>
            <li>I recommend you buy this shaver if you don&#x27;t want to spend more than $100.</li>
            <li>So much better quality and engineering than the Braun.</li>
            <li>After fully charging it, I gave it a try and was relatively satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>No, but its the best I have personally used.  </li>
            <li>I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this shaver.</li>
            <li>I get even better results on shaving the mustache than I do with my razor.</li>
            <li>Notably, the shaver had evidence of vapor on the inside of the screen.</li>
            <li>Since it had a one year warrantee, the Panasonic rep explained that if I could get a copy of the receipt I would be able to send it in for repair or replacement.</li>
            <li>I was able to send a copy of the Amazon email receipt (from the person that gave me the gift) and Panasonic sent me a pre-paid label to attach to any box to send the shaver in.</li>
            <li>My Dad borrowed it when he visited, and he really thought it was great.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This is an ok shaver.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting more for the money, but maybe I&#x27;ve been spoiled by Remington.  </li>
            <li>the shaves keep on getting better with no irratation.</li>
            <li>It is better than my Norelco.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this is probably for safety, since it&#x27;s rated to use in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li>It does provide a nice smooth shave and the battery life seems to hold a charge for a couple weeks when shaving once a day.</li>
            <li>This is the second Panasonic razor I have owned and find the quality of the shave to be excellent.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to friends for sure.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this purchase, especially for the price!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I decided to give this thing a try.  </li>
            <li>It shaves a lot closer, cleans much easier, charges faster and is, at about $80, a great value.  </li>
            <li>It captures most of the hairs it cuts inside the shaving block.  </li>
            <li>And while it is a wet/dry shaver from what I&#x27;ve found on the Internet it is not fully water proof; more like water resistant.  </li>
            <li>Almost as good and economical as DE shaving, but faster to use when you include setup and cleaning.</li>
            <li>In my many years I&#x27;ve used &#x27;em all.  </li>
            <li>like it :)</li>
            <li>i tryied different shavers and this one is one of the best.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d gladly purchase it again any day.</li>
            <li>Shaves better than a blade.</li>
            <li>I got this shaver a couple of months ago hoping that I wouldn&#x27;t have to use razor blades any more, because latetly I been cutinng myself while shaving.</li>
            <li>panasonic is a good brand and this one just proves it.</li>
            <li>This foil shaver is much better than the budget rotary units I have been using from Remington and others.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I used Brauns for many years.</li>
            <li>The one caveat is the battery doesn&#x27;t hold that many charges.</li>
            <li>I \\&quot;assumed\\&quot; that Panasonic&#x27;s razor technology had moved forward after many years</li>
            <li>ES8243A had a nice velvet-lined vinyl bag, while the ES8103S comes with a CHEAP cloth bag.</li>
            <li>I suspect most of the parts for the Japanese-assembled ES8243A, aside from the foil, blade and motor, were imported from China.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still trying to find a better product</li>
            <li>I have used Braun&#x27;s electrical shaver more than 5 yrs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received this shaver and was pleased with it.</li>
            <li>My latest job requires me to shave often.  </li>
            <li>A great buy and a real bargain.</li>
            <li>I shave more often since the shaver do its job</li>
            <li>I had to go over some spots so many times that it caused skin irritation.</li>
            <li>Well, on the top of the head anyway.</li>
            <li>OK, it is going over a lot of territory.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>There are better options out there.</li>
            <li>I doubt it will get better in time.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many electric and manual razors and every one always caused a rash.  </li>
            <li>I discovered a tube of Alba coconut lime shave cream lying in my drawer, and that made my experience even better.</li>
            <li>Oh, and one more thing-</li>
            <li>BY BEING ABLE TO USE IT IN THE SHOWER WITH THE ASSISTANTS OF THE STEAM/WATER</li>
            <li>I switched to the Panasonic from a Norelco rotory blade shaver and it took a couple of weeks until I felt like I was getting a better shave</li>
            <li>Both shavers require more repeat strokes than I would prefer.</li>
            <li>It gets a close shave to most of my face.</li>
            <li>I love this thing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>He recommended this one to me and I am sooo glad I listened.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but it doesn&#x27;t cut all the hair.</li>
            <li>It works much better than any I have owned.  </li>
            <li>Many of the reviews seem to indicate poorer reliability.</li>
            <li>When I found the ES8103, I found a shaver with all the strengths of the ES8047 plus better battery</li>
            <li>Make sure you change the blades when you see the performance drop off.</li>
            <li>My Norelco needed replacement after many years, and that model was discontinued.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think you can do any better.</li>
            <li>so maybe I just work better with foil.</li>
            <li>But simply, this is the best electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li>After a week of use, the shaver gets better and better and grows on you.</li>
            <li>pros:&lt;br /&gt;- close shave on most parts of my face</li>
            <li>good build quality&lt;br /&gt;- easy to clean</li>
            <li>/&gt;- struggled in thicker parts of my beard - took longer and more passes, and you could hear the thing struggling (fyi this did not happen with the 14,000 linear motor in the ES-LA63-S).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>though gave a close shave for most areas of my face, couldn&#x27;t cut it with thicker parts of my beard, so no go.</li>
            <li>It did ok on under arms and face.</li>
            <li>You think for the price, it would be much better  </li>
            <li>better product.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>There may be better ones out there</li>
            <li>Works better when I use shaving cream.</li>
            <li>This product is just OK.  </li>
            <li>I use it mostly when I am on the go</li>
            <li>Best electric shaver I have had in the last 40 years.</li>
            <li>I love saving money and not having to buy replacement cartridges for my Gillete razor.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>It ok .</li>
            <li>Make in japan , it way better then this</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe the low price, and it is a GREAT shave!  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried a Panasonic shaver before and was pleased with this one.  </li>
            <li>Better than the Remington did.</li>
            <li>For the most part Panasonic has meant quality products made in Japan, not anymore.</li>
            <li>but there are many better units at the non-sale price of this shaver.</li>
            <li>I love it and so does he, 5 stars for me.</li>
            <li>It looks better than it works.  </li>
            <li>Better recharging setup on that one.  </li>
            <li>Of course now I realize it was because I was spending so much more time trying to get a close shave with</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing alot of research and it seems that men with rougher / thicker beards need to spend more money on a stronger electric</li>
            <li>- that convenience has made the purchase worthwhile.  </li>
            <li>These two setting allow me to have more control over the shave</li>
            <li>Am I glad I purchased it - YES.  </li>
            <li>I am really impressed with how close of a shave I get, especially when using the shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>after a month everything is ok.</li>
            <li>i am satisfied...</li>
            <li>You would be better buying at Walmart or Target where you can return without hassel.  </li>
            <li>I prefer this one.&lt;br /&gt;Needs to be charged about every 17-20 days using it once a day.&lt;br /&gt;Overall pleased.</li>
            <li>how many times I go over it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am convinced that, like most things in life, you need to try it for yourself.</li>
            <li>It felt like I needed to apply more pressure</li>
            <li>so I ended up leaving it in Locked position most of the time.</li>
            <li>in fact its even better.</li>
            <li>Replaced the latest in a series of Braun shavers with this after reading the ratings on Consumer&#x27;s Reports and find this to provide a better shave at a much more affordable price than the Brauns.  </li>
            <li>This is an ok shaver, doesn&#x27;t give a close shave.</li>
            <li>MAGIC works well but is too inconsistent (e.g. chemical</li>
            <li>I believe it provides one of the closest, smoothest shaves of any electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned (better than Norelco and Braun</li>
            <li>love that it is wet/dry, since I often prefer to shave in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I suggest more people purchase this shaver.</li>
            <li>With my ES8043SC I could tap the top of the unit after I removed the top to knock out the cut shaving hairs.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t try it with this unit because you&#x27;ll probably break the top.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m betting that it&#x27;ll do just as well or maybe even better.</li>
            <li>OK, but I prefer a closer shave</li>
            <li>However, I am so satisfied with this razor that I was motivated to get off my butt and write these words.</li>
            <li>I found it&#x27;s better than phillips.</li>
            <li>Does not cut pieces of meat out of my neck like most shavers and this one works well with water.</li>
            <li>I think it is the most bang you can get for your buck.</li>
            <li>He has mentioned over and over that it was the best Christmas present he has ever received, and considering how many Christmas&#x27; he has seen and how many children and grandchildren he has received presents from, that says a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it was ok for a foil, but this baby rocks.</li>
            <li>Simply the best electric razer I have owned.  </li>
            <li>and I am able to get close and shave around the goatee with no</li>
            <li>Had it for about 5 years now and love it.</li>
            <li>More words.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also more noisy</li>
            <li>I would not be satisfied.</li>
            <li>The Panasonice model that I purchased is better than most that I have tried.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver..</li>
            <li>So, if you shave every day, this thing does a nice job giving you a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>When this is done properly the trimmer is excellent.</li>
            <li>most impressive thing is that after a fully charge, it can work for about 2 weeks with daily usage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>- they are retained much better in the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works well for more than 2 years</li>
            <li>So glad that we made this choice when there was so many to choose from.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was so glad to see.</li>
            <li>gives a better shave then this.</li>
            <li>but that has nothing to do with the shaver and more to do with his learning curve.</li>
            <li>I love both.  </li>
            <li>made more of a difference than I thought it would.</li>
            <li>Love the wet/dry razor.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still highly pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best shave and most comfortable I have ever had in my life.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li>Way better than mine.&amp;#34; So now my son owns it.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using this shaver.</li>
            <li>I looked at many reviews here and felt I should add mine too.</li>
            <li>No wonder there have been so many reviews on this one...</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s pleased with it..  </li>
            <li>This one is lighter and more compact.  </li>
            <li>most of the time finish shaving the mustache area with a blade shaver.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li>and he is glad to receive it.</li>
            <li>Okay</li>
            <li>I have always used either a top of the line Braun or Eltron.</li>
            <li>I must say I am extremely pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li>Hopefully this will get better once I get adjusted with the saver</li>
            <li>I am totally pleased with every feature of the Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather a not so close shave but more uniform.  </li>
            <li>Nice razor, have had for approx 8 months and has worked great so far.</li>
            <li>This one is substantially better than both.</li>
            <li>I have used Norelco rotary razors for many years.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver.  </li>
            <li>Yep, the packaging//marketing is on target :) I&#x27;m a newbie at shaving my head and have never used a manual (blade) razor.</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;ll probably never learn, nor (have to) gain the courage, to shave my head with a manual/blade razor :)</li>
            <li>The shave is as close as a manual razor, but it is much more convenient.  </li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>have tried many types of razors all promising to do a great job, none did, except this one.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I am sure this works for many people, but it didn&#x27;t meet my expectations after using it.</li>
            <li>I thought this would do better.</li>
            <li>but now it&#x27;s doing a better job.</li>
            <li>Be sure and give it the month to see if it works for you.</li>
            <li>This is the best shaver I have used in the last 20 years.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I read the review &amp; gave this shaver a try.  </li>
            <li>It may do even better with soap and water but not tried as I am satisfied as is.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s more than satisfactory for my needs.  </li>
            <li>I have had many electric razors over the years....</li>
            <li>The Panasonic works much better without the irritation.</li>
            <li>Just bout this and am enjoying it a lot.</li>
            <li>If there was a choice to pay the difference and upgrade it for a better model, I&#x27;d do it in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li>I love Panasonic razors.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll probably buy the $31 replacement screen/blades and hopefully get many more years out of this.</li>
            <li>I was sold on the outstanding reviews, and jumped on these for the $59 sale.</li>
            <li>It also shaves closer and better than any as well.</li>
            <li>At this point I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>This is the favorite electric razor my husband has ever had.  </li>
            <li>I love to shave with it</li>
            <li>I read many reviews before picking this model.</li>
            <li>They love them.</li>
            <li>Have been fairly pleased as I was a razor user for years....</li>
            <li>It also seems to now cause more skin irritation than it did at the beginning.  </li>
            <li>I get a nice smooth shave time after time.  </li>
            <li>I bought it :)</li>
            <li>More plastic.  </li>
            <li>I swear shaves better.  </li>
            <li>I picked this panasonic razor based on a rating where a guy said he&#x27;d been using electric for many years and this was the closest shave he had had.</li>
            <li>excellent condition, shaves as close as a triple regular blade.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the purchase at present.</li>
            <li>Love would order another</li>
            <li>Love this razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure a lot of people prefer foil shavers to rotaries, and that they work well for them.</li>
            <li>I have had many cordless shaver.  </li>
            <li>I love the razor and it out shaves the Braun.</li>
            <li>and I think I&#x27;m like the Panasonic&#x27;s suit me better.</li>
            <li>one good thing I&#x27;ll say about this unit is how easy it is to clean.</li>
            <li>I could not be more pleased at the performance and value.</li>
            <li>I reckon I will be able to use it for quite a while before I have to replace the blades and foil.</li>
            <li>The foil and blades are so much more cheaper for this unit than the quad blade max</li>
            <li>Better than anything</li>
            <li>so I shave mostly in the shower with glycerin bar soap which I also use for bathing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have owned this for more than 4 years now.  </li>
            <li>After exploring my choices, and reading the reviews for many electric shavers, I decided to go with this Panasonic.</li>
            <li>It still holds a charge for a week or more</li>
            <li>The best part is I haven&#x27;t cut my upper lip since I&#x27;ve started using this razor.  </li>
            <li>This one is even better.  </li>
            <li>but this is still better than razors costing 2-4 times as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a bit more than a month now.</li>
            <li>It does an excellent job and actually gives you about 12 shaves before it needs recharging.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t rush to review it then.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had an electric razor for more than 30 years.  </li>
            <li>That said, I still am using it more than 90% of the time.  </li>
            <li>I like being able to use it in the shower and contrary to some of the reviews</li>
            <li>I love this shaver.  </li>
            <li>Yet, I did not give more stars because this blade is advertised as a man&#x27;s blade.  </li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s shape is better than the circular shape of most electric shavers.</li>
            <li>However, I can say the recipient of this gift was very pleaed with it and had great raves about it.  </li>
            <li>Most of them are 5.</li>
            <li>just use more water.  </li>
            <li>The best thing about it from my standpoint is how quiet it is!  </li>
            <li>It works better than most electric shavers I have tried.</li>
            <li>My favorite shaver I have ever had.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Used it for years and thought that a Braun would be better.</li>
            <li>This is simply the best!</li>
            <li>Better type for him.  </li>
            <li>but many have said it gives a close shave then as well.  </li>
            <li>I still prefer the braun 6520 foil/trimmer design and its overall shave though even though that one isn&#x27;t perfect either.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used electric razors about 15 to 20 years ago and they did not get any better.  </li>
            <li>Fast charging and great shaves</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s magic.  </li>
            <li>and I still love it.  </li>
            <li>I love how it&#x27;s washable too.</li>
            <li>Glad I finally found something that perfectly meets my needs.</li>
            <li>I upgraded from a rotary shaver, and this works much better.</li>
            <li>its okay.</li>
            <li>The ES8103s simply delivers the best shave I have ever head.  </li>
            <li>An all-around great razor for me, I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There have been many comments on battery life.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps your experience might be better than mine.</li>
            <li>Over the years I have tried many types of razors.</li>
            <li>If you are like me and have felt like you have tried so many and and are still looking for a satisfying shave, by all means try this one.</li>
            <li>Alex is completely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned 6 or 7 electric razors, mostly inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>Works well to shave my legs, I love it.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a Christmas gift to myself in 2010, and almost a year later and its working flawlessly.  </li>
            <li>For the price and efficacy, I can&#x27;t think of a better razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>The shave is still among the better I&#x27;ve had from an electric razor</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still satisfied with it though, I just need to remind myself to bring the charger if I&#x27;m going on extended business</li>
            <li>The shave is still among the better I&#x27;ve had from an electric razor</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still satisfied with it though, I just need to remind myself to bring the charger if I&#x27;m going on extended business trips.</li>
            <li>Has a \\&quot;Soft\\&quot; mode, making shaving more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>Good battery and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this model shaver for many, many years.</li>
            <li>All I can say is this razor is much better than any Norelco I have owned.  </li>
            <li>ok..</li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t love it..</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s ok..</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>I had one of these for years and love the Panasonic quality.</li>
            <li>and I believe in starting him off with the best.</li>
            <li>I have owned many electric shavers and none has given me the satisfaction that this Panasonic has.  </li>
            <li>Overall an excellent product.</li>
            <li>Will write more after I get</li>
            <li>Have to buy more.</li>
            <li>They claimed you might not get a better shave from any razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Ok just received this.&lt;br /&gt;Charging....</li>
            <li>I think I can do better.</li>
            <li>This is better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that any razor can do a better job of a shave than this one?&lt;br</li>
            <li>Two blade was better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll shave with this in many directions.</li>
            <li>It looks ok?</li>
            <li>find it entertaining the lathering up of the soap on my face with this razor.</li>
            <li>Lathers more after I run water over the blades.</li>
            <li>After more experience with this.</li>
            <li>Two blade was better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll shave with this in many directions.</li>
            <li>It looks ok?</li>
            <li>find it entertaining the lathering up of the soap on my face with this razor.</li>
            <li>Lathers more after I run water over the blades.</li>
            <li>After more experience with this.</li>
            <li>Works better than my Philips HQ9070, which misses a number of hair.</li>
            <li>He was very happy with it and requested same one as replacement.</li>
            <li>so if you wait for better results, you won&#x27;t be able to return it...</li>
            <li>it seems that I am re-charging it more than the Norelco.</li>
            <li>I have had many electric shavers over the years, but this one is exceptional.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Glad she bought it for me.</li>
            <li>This one performs so much better.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice smooth shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li>but I mostly don&#x27;t do those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t shave any better to me.</li>
            <li>my favorite is the panasonic es8103s 4.8 stars, panasonic ES-LA63-S 4.5 stars, too bulky;</li>
            <li>i haven&#x27;t used a hand razor since, well satisfied</li>
            <li>&gt; Annual replacement cost of foil should not be 50% or more than the shaver</li>
            <li>It may resonate sometime but is ok.</li>
            <li>The shaver head will bend to the contour of your face, most notably your jawline&lt;</li>
            <li>Excellent product; this is my second one.</li>
            <li>My only knock is it doesn&#x27;t do great on the neck with longer hairs, but I&#x27;ve never had an electric shaver that does a good job there.</li>
            <li>I love the responsiveness of the flexible shaver head, and the electronic display for battery life was also a convenient feature.  </li>
            <li>about a month.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I had my doubts, but after 3 weeks my beard, face or razor is getting  better, or all 3.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m glad for that.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>It is getting better though.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re shaving hair more than about 3mm or 1/8 in.</li>
            <li>After checking various web sites, I selected the Panasonic ES8103S because of the features and the excellent price I found on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The Norelcos and the Braun that I owned were all top of the line models as well, I&#x27;m not a cheapskate.  </li>
            <li>so much more superior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought this February 2013 and paid more than I ever had for a shaver.  </li>
            <li>Looks like it is just more planned obsolescence.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be much better than I  found it.</li>
            <li>Simply put, this is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>They are simply the best and keep getting better.  </li>
            <li>Look no further, this is the best shaver for the money you can buy.</li>
            <li>All in all, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s one of my best purchases of the last year.</li>
            <li>The Remington design is better and easier to use.)  </li>
            <li>--I get many shaves from one charge.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s almost no place on my face where you get most of the blades to contact your skin.  </li>
            <li>I was going to get the 4 blade model but would have paid $40 dollars more.  </li>
            <li>Been using it for a month, still love it.  </li>
            <li>My favorite razor.</li>
            <li>In doing research for this purchase, I decided my top price would be $100.  </li>
            <li>I cannot imagine spending more than that for an electric razor.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>First rate quality, first rate design, and superb shave.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I also have 4-blade shaver from panasonic and it definately works better compared to this one.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s contoured to fit the hand nicely.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver mostly for the sideburn trimmer to trim my mustache and around the edges of my beard.  </li>
            <li>I love the charge.  </li>
            <li>Better shave than with my Braun.</li>
            <li>and you can get many years out of it.</li>
            <li>Do not let this shaver sit on the charger for more than 40 minutes ever.</li>
            <li>have shaved with it 3 times now and love it :)</li>
            <li>Really glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>How many shavers hit the landfills around the world every year with the toxic batteries still inside them?&lt;br</li>
            <li>but yet we allow this to pass as OK.</li>
            <li>On top of that, what are the effects of all these toxic batteries going into our environment?&lt;br /&gt;Why</li>
            <li>I mostly use it with lather, but sometimes without.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s recharging capabilities are excellent and last every bit of the fourteen days.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to replace the foil/blade every 12 months which you can get here on Amazon - kit Panasonic WES9013PC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using Panasonic wet/dry razors for more than fifteen years.</li>
            <li>I like the Series 7 somewhat better</li>
            <li>The Panasonic is light-years better than the travel razor it is replacing, which was a Braun priced between this one and the Series 7.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a ok shaver, but save your money and get a Braun</li>
            <li>instead it&#x27;s just a better product.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s pleased</li>
            <li>Had the raiser now for more than 6 months, maybe a year?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend any more to get a fancier razor.</li>
            <li>I also use in and out of shower, but prefer to do it before the shower, seems to work better that way.</li>
            <li>This is much better for me than blades and water, but I&#x27;ll probably replace my Norelco&#x27;s shaving head and use that machine instead.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic ES shaver provides a good close shave, however, most importantly, it is easy to clean and maintain.  </li>
            <li>My dad is pleased with this razor.</li>
            <li>but this one is ok to get started out on electrical shavers. &#x27;</li>
            <li>, u just have to work more at it.</li>
            <li>Love this one.</li>
            <li>My hubby requested an electric razor and after going through many reviews I decided on this one.</li>
            <li>This shaver gives a close smooth shave all your wives/girlfriends will appreciate!</li>
            <li>,MORE SUIT</li>
            <li>Neither of us have found a better shave than we get with the ES8103</li>
            <li>/&gt;works better with a litter water or lather .</li>
            <li>Still much more convenient then a safety razor.</li>
            <li>It tended to pull more than cut...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will update after I have used it more.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver..</li>
            <li>What more could we want, guys?</li>
            <li>I have used electric razors for more than 25 years.</li>
            <li>In the begining, it worked perfectly but 6 months later it stopped working.</li>
            <li>Have been using electric shavers many years and  for the price  </li>
            <li>Still want to explore more.</li>
            <li>I had a Norelco before and felt like I could cover the areas better, but I may just not be use to the Panasonic yet.  </li>
            <li>I think I will like it better</li>
            <li>the more I use it.  </li>
            <li>The best part is that it does not pull his facial hair at all.</li>
            <li>EL PRODUCTO LLEGO OK, TAL Y COMO LO OFRECIERON ESTOY TOTALMENTE SATISFECHO CON EL MISMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hat tip to reviewers who said the three blade was better than the four - I&#x27;ve had it for a week</li>
            <li>I love this shaver.</li>
            <li>I also love the &amp;#34;Time to clean&amp;#34; alert.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m quite pleased.</li>
            <li>Many Norelco&#x27;s are not advertised as wet/dry.</li>
            <li>I have been using this Panasonic model since January 1st, 2013 and have been pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I would knick or cut myself many mornings and that just wouldn&#x27;t do after being permanently placed on the blood thinner Coumadin.    </li>
            <li>SHAVES THE NECK BETTER THAN ANY OF THE THREE PANASONICS</li>
            <li>I have used an electric shaver for many years.  </li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping</li>
            <li>I never leave reviews but for this one I hope this saves someone money and decides to stick with shaving until something better comes out.</li>
            <li>Sturdy Construction, packaged well, works better than any Razor I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li>I was able to kinda go all around after I thought I had gotten it all</li>
            <li>Love this razor...</li>
            <li>I seem to get a better shave.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic electric shaver!</li>
            <li>I am glad I went with this razor.</li>
            <li>Used a couple of Norelco shavers for years and was happy, but this shaver gives a much closer shave.  </li>
            <li>I totally love this razor</li>
            <li>I love how it&#x27;s waterproof</li>
            <li>After thoroughly evaluating many reviews here and elsewhere, I picked this Shaver out for a Christmas gift my wife could put under the tree for me.  </li>
            <li>It did seem to work better in the water with shaving cream</li>
            <li>and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>I cleaned it (more thoroughly than just empting the captured hair)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a &#x27;rotary&#x27; style shaver for many years...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m extremely pleased and would recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
            <li>After 2-3 years, I decided to look for something better.</li>
            <li>and they shaved much better.</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t sure what sort of quality Panasonic would have in this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using electric razors for most of my life.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I will have to replace the blades soon, but for now they are still getting the job done.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in many years</li>
            <li>LOVE being able to use this in the shower - just soap up and shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to say that about an electric shaver before.</li>
            <li>I love this razor, it is my every day (</li>
            <li>Gave this to husband for gift and he is really enjoying it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so sure.</li>
            <li>They feel more like tweezers or a band-aid than clippers.  </li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for probably 40 years, and I&#x27;ve tried most brands.  </li>
            <li>I researched this thoroughly and am well pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>and he is satisfied with his.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s hope their customer service is better than The Nerds.</li>
            <li>It shouldn&#x27;t sell for any more than $50.</li>
            <li>I still am keeping my Hydro 3 and the blades I&#x27;ve been able to find, but just for a backup.  </li>
            <li>The razor you see in the picture, on top.</li>
            <li>more words required.  </li>
            <li>2 more</li>
            <li>I probably have heavier growth than most men.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Based on my experiments the gel works better than the foamy.</li>
            <li>Better than my razor ever was.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I made</li>
            <li>so I am saving more time when I leave from home.</li>
            <li>It looks great, too, not that that really matters to most guys.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice smooth shave, but can cut you if you have pimple.</li>
            <li>OK for travelling</li>
            <li>After using Norelco for many years, decided to try something else.  </li>
            <li>Keep trying shaver makers, maybe some day a product better than Norelco will emerge.  </li>
            <li>and I knew not to expect to be able to use it exclusively.</li>
            <li>I had a Braun many years ago</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see too many men walking around with</li>
            <li>But I still find it doesn&#x27;t do a flawless job even on short stubble.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Manufactures make better batteries.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with my purchase, one for me and one for my Dad.  </li>
            <li>Even when my wife gifted me one -</li>
            <li>Felt much better now.  </li>
            <li>one might even call it sexy.</li>
            <li>, my girlfriend bought the slightly better Panasonic ES8249S model --</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s no longer sold, but it has 4 blades and 13,000 RPM and it works MUCH better</li>
            <li>that I know works better</li>
            <li>Might just take more time for my face to get used to this one?</li>
            <li>Of course, it takes much longer to shave than with a blade (40 minutes or so for me), but I&#x27;m more than happy with the results I&#x27;ve achieved.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i love it~~</li>
            <li>A closer, comfortable shave, and quieter to boot!</li>
            <li>quality on a two-day beard was EXCELLENT and required no multiple passes except on neck&lt;</li>
            <li>Am ordering two more today.</li>
            <li>are better in quality and performance, this shaver is no slouch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>have only used this shaver twice, but I couldn&#x27;t be more impressed.  </li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m really glad</li>
            <li>My hearing is better than most peoples&#x27;, and it didn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>Not the top of the line</li>
            <li>Used that one for too many years without replacing the foil and blades.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned my lesson and will change them more often.  </li>
            <li>Though someones commented that it is noisy but for me the noise is OK</li>
            <li>I noticed during my shave, most of it lands in the sink and not caught in the storage head</li>
            <li>This with shaving cream is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>It takes more time then I would like to spend shaving to get a close shave.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic ES8103S is ok.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps the cleaning part if the most \\&quot;annoying\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>So I mostly used a blade.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than a blade,  </li>
            <li>After a couple of months, I can safely conclude that it does provide a close shave.</li>
            <li>If it did, I&#x27;d give it more stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would gladly purchase this again.</li>
            <li>foils any more</li>
            <li>With the Panasonic electric shaver, I am able to shave every day with not irritation to my neck at all.  </li>
            <li>but it is better than the Braun I had.</li>
            <li>I apply a bit more pressure</li>
            <li>and I find it does a better job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the price, I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>After a weeks use I have found this Wet/Dry shaver to work nothing short of excellent.  </li>
            <li>This shaver gives me almost as close a shave as I get with a blade and when traveling it is much more convenient.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this razor for more than a year now</li>
            <li>I will admit that I have never gone more than 2 days</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>I have had for over a year and love it.</li>
            <li>I have bought and eventually returned/discarded so many electric razors over the years that I had given up on them.  </li>
            <li>so I thought I would try one more time.  </li>
            <li>You should give it 30 days to train your beardand not go back to shaving with a razor for the best results...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s never received any more attention than that.</li>
            <li>thinking: better purchase a replacement foil/blades.</li>
            <li>when i use it,it makes big noises!i wonder if it has been broken?not my best choice !</li>
            <li>I am reasonably satisfied.</li>
            <li>a box would have been better though.&lt;br</li>
            <li>would be something better than this</li>
            <li>the shaving head is too narrow.&lt;br /&gt;Takes more time to shave&lt;br /&gt;short battery life&lt;</li>
            <li>This one is better in terms of a closer shave.</li>
            <li>Still better than the remington I was using.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS RAZOR.  </li>
            <li>AND SURE BEATS</li>
            <li>It shaves well on most parts of my face except in the lower part of the neck.</li>
            <li>This shaver is better then others I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>&gt;  Shaved hairs fall into the remove able head</li>
            <li>I am hoping the reviews I read are correct and that he will love this product.</li>
            <li>this shaves better than the rotary ones (with circle-shape blades).</li>
            <li>What I meant by better is &amp;</li>
            <li>More to follow.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, it still irritated my skin a bit.</li>
            <li>I have used Remington and Braun prior and this is the best!.  </li>
            <li>Now I decided to shave every day once more</li>
            <li>i the spot between the outer foil and the power button lest you accidentally turn on cleaning more and injure yourself.</li>
            <li>All in all, I love it.</li>
            <li>but it does better coming close to my chin beard.</li>
            <li>This is obviously the best shaver</li>
            <li>/&gt;Compared to the Braun 7, my ES8103S has never showed an issue and is much more reliable.</li>
            <li>When my latest started having problems I began the search for a replacement.</li>
            <li>I love the LCD display of battery percent remaining.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do not buy if price is over $150, there are better reviewed shavers at that price out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7.5/10</li>
            <li>Bought this as I&#x27;m no longer in Japan to be able to pick up foil and blades.</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>3-Arc is a life saver,  and I love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only reason why I won&#x27;t give it a perfect mark is because of the price (I keep thinking of the hand bags I didn&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li>or  About 4.25 stars!I love it</li>
            <li>The only reason why I won&#x27;t give it a perfect mark is because of the price (I keep thinking of the hand bags I didn&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li>It works great, shaves very closely, and I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s still the same awesome shaver.</li>
            <li>Works ok.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased that this isn&#x27;t a problem with the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>It is OK for when we do not go out.</li>
            <li>I called customer service and was told that the pre shave liquid is safe.</li>
            <li>I use it every day, I am completely satisfied, both with the price and quality of this shaver.</li>
            <li>I like this razor better than the Remington I used to use.  </li>
            <li>Norelco and Braun products used to be better before they started manufacturing them in China.  </li>
            <li>It gives a good close shave and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I love the read-out that tells what charge the batter is at.</li>
            <li>I had been using Braun for years and boy am I glad that I switched.  </li>
            <li>but I was expecting a bit more from Panasonic.</li>
            <li>This is a great shaver and is highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I think it takes too many passes to achieve a close shave without irritation.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s much better than my philips architec for 320$.</li>
            <li>I kept trying DE, but in the end I think I had more irritation and nicks than with Schick.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t started week 4 yet, but I expect my results to continue getting better.</li>
            <li>Use soap every once in awhile to keep it most fresh.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After comparing many shavers I decided to go with this one.</li>
            <li>OK, I did my research and looked through the Amazon reviews for shavers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure he would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>His exceptionally smooth face is a plus for me, too!</li>
            <li>am totally satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I have missed a opportunity to buy a better one with discount, so I suggest if you do not need it in a hurry, you can wait to buy a better one.</li>
            <li>Never has an electric razor given me a truly satisfying shave and this one is no match for my Fusion blades.  </li>
            <li>I got this because sometimes the electrics work better around the edges of the jaw line, and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint, plus it&#x27;s saved me during some car rides to meetings.</li>
            <li>in theory it does a better job.</li>
            <li>and I spend about 5/10 minutes most mornings shaving and probably charge 1 time every 7 days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really enjoying this shaver so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i shave my face neck and head with this, been using it for almost two weeks, it does an ok job.</li>
            <li>maybe the four blade would do a better job?</li>
            <li>am saving it for my husband&#x27;s birthday on June 17, but I am sure he is going to love it.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great shaver and way better than the 3 head rotary shavers that cost so much.</li>
            <li>I have no complaints and am glad I chose this model.</li>
            <li>otherwise OK.  </li>
            <li>Some have been better than others, but it is always better to shave in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I have been using electric shavers for over 50 years and my Remington that I have been using (I have been using Remmington shavers for most of those years)</li>
            <li>I love the power meter.  </li>
            <li>I bought this shaver several months ago and have been using it 3 to 4 times a week and am very impressed with the performance!  </li>
            <li>After reading the reviews for many razors I decided to buy this for my boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m quite pleased.  </li>
            <li>I have used this shaver for over a week and it cuts ok.  </li>
            <li>However, after using it on my face and my head, both my face and head started to have many bumps.</li>
            <li>I do not need shave every day like most guys.</li>
            <li>After about 3 months I am completely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I had before it and is holding up much better; the Braun had problems with the trimmer after 8 months.  </li>
            <li>Cost OK.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have it for more than two weeks when the number display went out.  </li>
            <li>Was a Remington foil razor user for many years before trying this razor.  </li>
            <li>Use something better if you have time, but this thing does what I need for my moderate/medium hair growth/coarseness.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work well for me, Braun is 100% better.</li>
            <li>The shaver worked ok, but doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a razor.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I absolutely  love it and battery life</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>Love using it with shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I love the shaver.</li>
            <li>Electric shaves are never going to be able to replace a razor shave</li>
            <li>and so could have used more than a flimsy cloth travel pouch</li>
            <li>The pop up trimmer gave me better results than I could ever achieve with the Fusion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m exceptionally satisfied.</li>
            <li>A FANTASTIC Shaver!</li>
            <li>Most I have tried snag at the hair and pinch or give you razor burn.</li>
            <li>10% battery had been used more than 3 times, 1 to 2 times each.</li>
            <li>He can&#x27;t get a close enough shave with an electric unless he&#x27;s in the shower, and this product is the best wet/dry electric we&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad.  </li>
            <li>I love this shaver.</li>
            <li>It works as advertised and better.</li>
            <li>In fact, the emollients in some canned lathers deliver more moisture than whipped lather.</li>
            <li>No electric shaves as close as some of the modern and vintage DE razors; but this electric does a great job and it will not damage your skin.</li>
            <li>This is my 2nd Panasonic Men&#x27;s Shaver, and it is by-far my best electric shaver yet!  </li>
            <li>Nine nine nine nine nine nine nine more words.</li>
            <li>Love this shaver.  </li>
            <li>a good, clean shave and the clean-up is easy.  </li>
            <li>At this point I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>It was recommended in Top 10 Foil style electric shavers.  </li>
            <li>so I shave more almost every day.</li>
            <li>Better than the 2 Brauns I have.</li>
            <li>mostly the Panasonic or Norleco 3 circular blade style.  </li>
            <li>I tried one many, many years ago</li>
            <li>Nice, smooth, close shave.</li>
            <li>This is a gift to my father, my father very like it, great.</li>
            <li>3 more words required.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t mastered the razor yet, but expect it to get better.</li>
            <li>no matter how many times I go over the area.</li>
            <li>This Is better than eitherone.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>What more can I say???  </li>
            <li>But I read that foil shavers shave smoother than rotary ones and I read through many reviews.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>That, I believe I will get better with practice.</li>
            <li>and I get a much better shave</li>
            <li>and it just works better with or without charging cord.</li>
            <li>This is much better than using a razor.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>AS MOST ELECTRIC SHAVERS</li>
            <li>It does best if you use daily.</li>
            <li>I like my Norelco better, but then again, that cost $80.</li>
            <li>Sure, there are all sorts of self cleaning shavers out there with plenty of fancy schmancy options</li>
            <li>After trying several razors, My hubby like this one the best :)</li>
            <li>20$ shavers perform better.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this shaver and would not hesitate to buy another if necessary.</li>
            <li>I like this much better.</li>
            <li>but it needs a more flexible head.</li>
            <li>My cheaper shavers work better then this one</li>
            <li>Shaves much better than the Norelco I had.  </li>
            <li>Good close shave and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Much better then</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Close shave and better than my Braun series 3.</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great product, even the trimmer works surprisingly well</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s better than the Brauns I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>However, this shaver is way better when used wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I bought Thayers Lavender Witch Hazel to use as an after shave, and it is possibly the best after shave you can buy.  </li>
            <li>I have used many different types and brands of electric razor, and this is the best one I have had.  </li>
            <li>This creates more time/cleanup time shaving which is what we are all trying to mitigate.&lt;br /&gt;-Because</li>
            <li>This creates more time/cleanup time shaving which is what we are all trying to mitigate.&lt;br /&gt;-Because</li>
            <li>Have purchased many Panasonic shavers for my guys over the years.</li>
            <li>I like it better than the Norelco I owned before.</li>
            <li>I really love the quality and closeness of shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>recommend the seller &amp; most of all the Panasonic product any day of the week.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Replaced a Norelco with this razor and it is some what better</li>
            <li>So glad I switched.</li>
            <li>this thing is amazing...being able to rinse and wash it with water.  </li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This thing is so much better on all counts.  </li>
            <li>I love the time saved cleaning it without needing a brush and disassembly.  </li>
            <li>works better than any electric  </li>
            <li>and I sure can&#x27;t shave in 4-5 minutes as some claim,</li>
            <li>I had a Braun shaver forever and thought nothing could ever top it.</li>
            <li>and it is more cost efficient for the electric shaver.</li>
            <li>There are definitely better shavers out there, but you will be shelling out a BUNDLE to purchase them.</li>
            <li>easy to carry and very easy to recharge.  </li>
            <li>this is a very good shave, shaving is pretty easy and smooth...</li>
            <li>pretty good - best results have been right after a hot shower or with shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>I hoped the shape and appearance would be a positive for an old-school kind of guy, but was impressed by the high tech features.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is a nice feature - very useful for the sideburns, as I do grow sideburns.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still going strong, takes a full charge, and gives a good shave.</li>
            <li>I am even more pleased with this latest version, as the shave is the best I have yet experienced, the noise of the shaver is virtually non-existent (compared to all earlier versions), and the feel and quality of the product remain high.  </li>
            <li>This 8103S seems just as good for size and, right now, for sharpness.  </li>
            <li>This electric razor is by far more superior than my Norelco rotary razor!  </li>
            <li>In summary, it gives a great comfortable shave, handles nicely, and appears to be of high quality.</li>
            <li>I hope it will fix itself as I get older and more experienced</li>
            <li>nice floating head, waterproof and easy to wash, battery charge state indicator easy to understand, plastic protective cover fits well and stays on.</li>
            <li>then not shaving really close battery power good cleaning unit is very easy</li>
            <li>We both read about this one &amp; both got very excited.  </li>
            <li>Easy to maintain, easy to use!</li>
            <li>When I received this razor for Christmas I was very excited to alleviate these problems.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth and has a great battery live.  </li>
            <li>Highest recommendations to Panasonic for great new shaver!</li>
            <li>Overall great product, very satisfied.</li>
            <li>The fact that you can clean it under running water is nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice feature to have and let&#x27;s you clean the shaver under running water without fear of damaging the shaver.</li>
            <li>Works great for shaving my head which was the main reason I bought it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and beautiful and cuts very close.</li>
            <li>Nice and clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I can no longer get a refund, which is understandable, but I also in good conscience can&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to handle, easy to keep clean and has a good battery life.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my son for his 16th birthday as his first razor after reading many good reviews.  </li>
            <li>My dad can operate this on his own and then clean it.</li>
            <li>I was very satisfied with the old model and this seems almost as good.  </li>
            <li>Gets a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li>You must take your time when using this shaver and when you do, you&#x27;ll find that you get a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li>This shaves better than Norelcos but they&#x27;re pretty good too..</li>
            <li>Gives me a nice, clean shave with no irritation (eventually).&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>It does have a nice way to clean out the stubbles from the blades.</li>
            <li>this provides a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li>Nice clean and close shave.</li>
            <li>it is easy to use and it is easy to clean, gives a good shave.  </li>
            <li>I always thought it must be a gimmick, but for me, it works great - highly recommended.    </li>
            <li>The high speed of the blade is a great plus, as is the wet/dry shave feature.  </li>
            <li>The batery life is great and it charges very quickly and does not make much noise either.</li>
            <li>Both good shavers, depends what your requirements are.&lt;br /&gt;You need to have a way to charge the Panasonic every couple shaves, whereas the Norelco could get you through a week&#x27;s worth of shaving on one charge easily.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic is good for a quick light shave or a touch up</li>
            <li>Also the 14000 RPM makes the whole shaving experience faster and much more pleasant as it eliminates the pulling of stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li>The charge indicator on the front is very accurate and easy to see.</li>
            <li>When cleaning don&#x27;t forget to use liquid soap as it helps keep the head of the shaver very clean.  </li>
            <li>Very clean shaving.</li>
            <li>It gets them both very clean with no cleaner or fuss....instantly.</li>
            <li>Shave very clean and perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does its job and a very clean job at it.</li>
            <li>it is very light weight and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and easy to use, portable and reliable.</li>
            <li>The first impressions with this new one are excellent, very smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li>Light, easy to clean, and holds a good week charge.</li>
            <li>But, honestly, if this lasts for 2 years - I would have got more than my money&#x27;s worth and would gladly buy another one.  </li>
            <li>The first shave wasn&#x27;t good</li>
            <li>This product is pretty good</li>
            <li>The Panasonic ES8103S Wet/Dry RechargeableElectric Shaver is a pretty good electric shaver.</li>
            <li>It does not shave as closely as a bladed razor but it is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a good razor with plenty of power and this one performs pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>It did a pretty good job, probably a bit of a learning curve on my part.  </li>
            <li>I have always owned a NORELCO shaver and it was pretty good, however the PANASONIC blowes it out of the \\&quot;water\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice feature is to have the battery scale on the front in full view.  </li>
            <li>I must say, the battery life is pretty good on this thing.</li>
            <li>This shaver is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used by a long shot.  </li>
            <li>I have had a couple of Braun and a Norelco  shaver and they were pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Now, after a month, I get pretty good results.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric razor, so maybe they all suck, but I don&#x27;t get a good shave.  </li>
            <li>This is my first &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; electric shaver (not just a travel shaver), and I feel like it was a good investment.</li>
            <li>Just as the title states, pretty good shave.</li>
            <li>The reviews seemed pretty good, so I gave this one a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good shape, fast shave!</li>
            <li>I get a shave 95% as good as a razor on the first shave.</li>
            <li>Going on 3 months of use and its still just as good as the first day.</li>
            <li>Best shaver I have had in a long time</li>
            <li>It really does give a nice close shave!  </li>
            <li>I consider both of these as minor complaints for a razor that superbly performs</li>
            <li>in all, its a pretty good shaver.</li>
            <li>Still, six years is a pretty good run, and no complaints.</li>
            <li>Breaking my hand was the perfect excuse to be adventurous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Remington was a higher end foil model and it did well (but to be fair, I used that one when my beard wasn&#x27;t as rough/thick</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it 6 or 7 times and it does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>Firstly the cost - there was also a $15 off special - and the great reviews.  </li>
            <li>Despite the manual&#x27;s hedging about needing up to a month to get used to the new shaver, I got a great shave from day one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this new shaver now for about 8 shaves and it&#x27;s doing great.  </li>
            <li>, I have to say it does do a great job, his face is as smooth as it is when he uses a real razor.</li>
            <li>Works great for the most sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li>I bought this shaver because of all the great reviews it received hoping it would be better than my old Norelco.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best electric razor I have ever used and is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>The speed, comfort, closeness used dry are the best of all the shavers I&#x27;ve used.      </li>
            <li>This one is much better, gives a closer shave, is quieter, &amp; cleans up easily.</li>
            <li>The unit charged very quickly and appears it will work for four shaves before requiring a charge.&lt;br /&gt;I would not use this for underarms, but I&#x27;m satisfied using a safety razor for this area.</li>
            <li>so I continue to use it as a dry shaver with excellent results every time.</li>
            <li>I have an older Panasonic 800 series shaver, but this one is the best in shaving that I have experienced, much faster than the older models.</li>
            <li>I got useto using it, its so handy and quick to use, there is no messingaroundwithsoapand water.</li>
            <li>it kind of irritates my skin when i try to do a quick shave.</li>
            <li>I love the wet/dry feature and easy clean-up.</li>
            <li>Nice quality and re-charges quickly.</li>
            <li>The shaver comes in handy for a quick shave</li>
            <li>This shaver is easy on your skin if you don&#x27;t make too many passes</li>
            <li>You can shower with it and he leaves it on shower top landing for easy  access.</li>
            <li>I get the best shaves by shaving dry.  </li>
            <li>(the headblade stuff is excellent) as I didn&#x27;t like using it dry or with water alone, but</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own quite quickly.  </li>
            <li>researched using many of the reviews of razors and decided from one particular review by a fellow that compared two shavers in a very lengthy review that this was the best deal for us.&lt;br</li>
            <li>lol it really gives u a smooth shave</li>
            <li>This Panasonic has a excellent COMFORTABLE face following shave.  </li>
            <li>Once I figured out that a wet shave working in a circular motion and using my favorite gel lather gave me the best results for my skin and beard type</li>
            <li>The best thing I love it about it is that I can do wet shave with it.  </li>
            <li>I was thinking that maybe I should have spent more, but this one turned out to be the best shaver I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>Best shaver ever - very quiet and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a specific set of specs and this seemed to fit the bill perfectly.</li>
            <li>Works great battery life not as good as expected.</li>
            <li>I had many cheap shavers do a way better job.</li>
            <li>He really likes this and feels like he gets a good shave, much better than he was expecting.  </li>
            <li>Also, easy to clean unlike the Norelco I own (taking apart and reconstructing blade arrangement is Mickey Mouse).</li>
            <li>a positive note, the shaver is easy to clean, retains a charge fairly well, feels nice, and the blades don&#x27;t appear to be getting any duller.  </li>
            <li>,maintainability is very easy with clean up a matter of running the unit under water.  </li>
            <li>it is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>This razor works well and is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>like that the shaver is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>The power monitor is helpful, and it is very easy to clean under running water.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Great shaver...bought this for my elderly father with very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean, and also like the pop-up trimmer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to clean - no need to get the razors with the cleaning stations where they get you for the cleaning solution.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Clean up under running water was very easy and thorough.</li>
            <li>and it is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Shaves close and very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean -</li>
            <li>Considering he is using it every single day, it&#x27;s holding up just great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll make this short and sweet to help you decide more efficiently if this is best for you...</li>
            <li>Electric shavers are great for Ladies with sensitive skin issues as well as Men!</li>
            <li>The Panasonic goes about its job with surgical precision and efficiency; the high-pitch whine it produces is not super-loud, and not unpleasant in a high-tech kind of way.</li>
            <li>The shaver worked great at first however the blades dulled quickly.</li>
            <li>The unit is very light and feels cheap I have been using a Braun Series Seven for Five plus years and still use it.</li>
            <li>, I had no problem getting shaves that are very smooth and comfortable.</li>
            <li>It is very light and comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different pre-shave lotions and found good old Williams Lectric Shave does best.  </li>
            <li>most of the reviews were positive and i am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Who would have thought that a shaver you have manually clean is easier to maintain than one of those self cleaners?!?  </li>
            <li>my husband loves that he can clean it by running it under the faucet!</li>
            <li>but it works just fine and the battery lasts for a week without going for a charge, You should think twice about buying the top of the line, save $$$ and get this model.</li>
            <li>Or you can even use soap to clean it thoroughly!</li>
            <li>It is great for touchups or the odd missed hair, but really great if you want to get cueball smooth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: As of December 13, 2015, this shaver is still working perfectly for me with the original blades and screen (see above).</li>
            <li>As of December 13, 2015, this shaver is still working perfectly for me with the original blades and screen (see above).</li>
            <li>The best way to shave with it is to use it every other day at most.</li>
            <li>It has a quick charge function and is easy to clean and would recommend this product to those looking for a good electric razor.</li>
            <li>As with most other things Amazon had the best price and service.</li>
            <li>it took me a good 15 minutes and a full 60% of battery life each time I tried to shave (the unit got very hot while I was doing this).</li>
            <li>: Sometimes misses hairs under certain spots - looking into the Arc 4 for a good price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>My 16 year old son and my husband are both very satisfied with this shaver!</li>
            <li>And the more I try to get my neck clean, the more irritated it becomes.  </li>
            <li>A nice clean and comfortable</li>
            <li>Each morning it would give my face a nice clean and smooth look.  </li>
            <li>you Seller, good packaging, quick service in getting here quickly, and</li>
            <li>It has a very good cleaning mechanism without the need to buy extra cleansers though.  </li>
            <li>This shaver gives a very good shave in a very short time.  </li>
            <li>Very good close shave overall.</li>
            <li>If you are going back and forth through reviews, consider this very good shaver and by all means trust that Panasonic doesn&#x27;t just make cameras.</li>
            <li>and actually it makes a very good work.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>very simple very good</li>
            <li>I consider that very good longevity because of the double duty</li>
            <li>If the power monitor were more accurate this shaver would deserve a 6-star rating.</li>
            <li>I love the display, and the comfortable design of the unit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed at how close it shaves and with minimal irritation.</li>
            <li>More importantly, it doesn&#x27;t shave when plugged in, which means you always have to time the charge correctly.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts a long time, the razor has a nice contour that fits in my hand well, and the display feature with the batter power is great.  </li>
            <li>Yep, the Panasonic Nano shaver is the best I&#x27;ve ever used, and by a fairly wide margin.    </li>
            <li>Almost forgot the most important part, function...</li>
            <li>My husband indicated that there is no pulling of the skin which helps for a more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric shaver and I&#x27;m very pleased.  </li>
            <li>The % charge display is convenient for understanding when charging is needed (better than just a warning light).  </li>
            <li>There is much more cheap plastic</li>
            <li>and then so it glides more freely.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic does a great job all the way around and shaves almost as close as an old school razor (without the razor burn).  </li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s a great product, my skin is just too sensitive.</li>
            <li>the situation changes with time, I will update this review, but so far, works really great.</li>
            <li>but the wet shave is AWESOME.</li>
            <li>Most importantly is the quality of the shave.</li>
            <li>Then the battery life between recharging started becoming noticeable shorter.  </li>
            <li>Everything so far is pretty much perfect  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic shaver at a fraction of the price of a Braun with more features.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;ES8103s is lighter and more smooth.</li>
            <li>Probably will be better off buying a cheap razor from WalMart.</li>
            <li>but since I have an incredibly nosey spouse, it was discovered and used the same day it was delivered to my house.</li>
            <li>I was happy with the performance of this shaver, but at about 15 months of use, it started working intermittently and then completely stopped working (wouldn&#x27;t turn on).</li>
            <li>and I was getting a closer more comfortable shave with</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>And I love his smooth face.</li>
            <li>This shaves a lot cleaner, more comfortable, deeper, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about cuts.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still the closest, most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>The best part is it&#x27;s all wet now.</li>
            <li>i like the wet shave best.</li>
            <li>will say it is one of the more comfortable razors I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>I appreciate being able to lather my face and shave smoothly and without enduring the cuts that the most-refined safety razors inflict.</li>
            <li>I am getting the closest most comfortable shave of my lifetime.</li>
            <li>Most important, it shaves&lt;br</li>
            <li>For me, the wet works best.</li>
            <li>wife came across this saver, on sale, and great reviews, so I gave it a try, and all I can say is WOW.  </li>
            <li>or unlocked mode is great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Good shave, easy to clean and fits my small hands, perfectly!</li>
            <li>Gives a comfortable shave and does an OK job</li>
            <li>I have relatively light growth, but it seems to work much better after say, three days of not shaving.</li>
            <li>best shaves has been wet.  </li>
            <li>I will have to say this gives me the most comfortable closest shave of them all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Obviously the most important thing is how it shaves: No complains here.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, it does not bother anybody in my house, so it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>Handsome instrument that is comfortable to hold and to use.  </li>
            <li>You have to try it yourself to see if your face enjoy more with a Philips (tri-cyclone cutters) or one from Panasonic (</li>
            <li>WOW, great shaver.  </li>
            <li>It seems that most shavers today are made in China and are cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>Just OK - I have given it the 30+ days that Panasonic said it takes to get comfortable with it</li>
            <li>Great razor took me some time to get used to it, but now i am completely satasified</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shaver arrived yesterday and is working perfectly just as I expected.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the fact that this makes it much more convenient to keep my stubble off my face.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been happy so far (been using it about a</li>
            <li>and it is safe and comfortable.</li>
            <li>It shaves closely and smoothly and  it couldn&#x27;t be better.</li>
            <li>Works best wet with shaving cream.</li>
            <li>This has been great so far (3 months of every-other-day shaves or so).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like it best wet using shave cream.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Very, very close shave, just as good as with the razor.&lt;br /&gt;-No water or foam required</li>
            <li>Good razor which gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li>i have had this model for over a year now and would say that this razor does a good job and the battery holds up reasonably well.</li>
            <li>In the end, I just wanted a close, good electric shaver that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and that&#x27;s what I got at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>it came fast and it my take more time to shave to get good results but its smooth.</li>
            <li>The shipping from Amazon was fast and packaging was good.</li>
            <li>That being said, Panasonic is a good all-around shaver.  </li>
            <li>The replacement blades for this are reasonable, also, price wise and seem sturdy compared to the triple-head razors.</li>
            <li>This razor is very versatile and does a good job with shaving and trimming.</li>
            <li>If you are considering a good razor, at a reasonable price, this is the one to get.</li>
            <li>It gives a good close shave and is very quite.</li>
            <li>really, its just an electric razor -- a good shave is what I needed, and this is doing the trick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Panasonic ES 8103s for about two weeks so far, and can honestly report that it has delivered by far the best shave I have ever had, blade or electric.  </li>
            <li>This shaver has surprisingly shaved very close.  </li>
            <li>ProCurve gives a really good shave, and that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s really all about.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been much of a fan of electric razors but this Panasonic gives good service.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s not cutting quite as nicely as the 1st time I used it.</li>

            <li>This shaver has a good design, it&#x27;s quitter than others and shaves very close.</li>
            <li>I think it does a good job and did not cost that much.  </li>
            <li>I bought one for travel, and loved it so much, bought another one for home.</li>
            <li>I had been using a blade and a rotary razor, this one shaves twice as good and twice as fast.</li>
            <li>fast shaving speed with good shaving</li>

            <li>its very easy to charge and charges quickly.</li>
            <li>I have not had any problems at all with the lcd readout and like the way it lets you know when it needs to be cleaned which is very easy and quick to do.</li>
            <li>works great,  easy clean-up,  clear directions,  light in the hand with good ergonomics,  held the first charge for 8-9 shaves.  </li>
            <li>I was prepared to spend $150+ on the more fancy electrics, but this one had the best overall reviews, and for once, they were right.</li>

            <li>Easy control and even wet shave works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Great shaver, super close and really, one pass...</li>
            <li>I have always used Remington brand electric shavers and loved them - close good, but dry shaves.</li>
            <li>The new shaver gives an amazingly close shave!  </li>
            <li>He loves this one so much, figured he&#x27;d love it again! :)</li>

            <li>The blades are still good as new and it is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a great feel to it since it is rubberized on the back and sides and feels very comfortable.</li>
            <li>SHAVER.IT IS VERY LIGHT TO HOLD AND EASY TO CLEAN WITH WATER</li>
            <li>40 seconds to clean a shaver is pretty darn good.     </li>
            <li>It says it gets 14 shaves to a full charge-don&#x27;t believe it!  </li>
            <li>This is one example where paying more gets you your money&#x27;s worth!</li>

            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good about !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this and other Panasonics for years, and they&#x27;re the best electrics I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>It took about eleven passes to get a good shave and an additional nine under my chin to make that area as smooth as I prefer, which is pretty smooth, let me warn you.</li>
            <li>This is the best razor I have ever owned, but lets face it guys, while a little more hassle, nothing competes with a razor shave.  </li>
            <li>Purchased ES8103S due to excellent reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Used other products before, but this is best.</li>
            <li>Seems to perform better &amp;#34;wet,&amp;#34; although using it in this manner is not environmentally friendly, as consuming oceans of water if used while showering.</li>
            <li>It takes significantly longer if you wait more than a couple days between shaves.</li>
            <li>Bought this based on other Amazon reviews and after a month of use I am very impressed with this razor.  </li>
            <li>Other than that shaver works great!</li>

            <li>I shave him frequently myself and although it does an ok job, it certainly isn&#x27;t as good as it sounds.  </li>
            <li>Update #5 05/06/2017 - Guess what folks, this shaver is still going strong after 6 years.</li>
            <li>shaver is still going strong after 2 1/2 years of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool looking and shaves pretty good.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>Battery life is decent &amp; charges very quickly: 1 charge is probably good for 45 mins shave time, about 1/2 dozen shaves.</li>
            <li>I had an older model that was a really good razor.</li>
            <li>It was a good upgrade from my older Panasonic shaver, and I will not hesitate to recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>Figured I&#x27;d spend some decent coin to get a good shaver.</li>
            <li>A fresh cutter and block delivers a comfortable and effective shave.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>After 3 years of continuous usage - 3 times a week - it is going strong, except I had to replace the Outer Foil around 18 months, as it wore out and started scratching my face.  </li>
            <li>The good news is that when you do you end up with a decent shave.</li>
            <li>Great foils for a close shave and a nice trimmer to buzz the rough off.</li>
            <li>This new model (8103) does a very good job at the first cut</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone wanting a good electric razor.</li>
            <li>I found this Panasonic highly rated and at a good price.</li>
            <li>Highly efficent, good recharge holding.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice close shave (for me anyways) and charges very fast.</li>
            <li>Holds a good charge highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I purchased my Panasonic ES8103S right here on Amazon in January 2010 and it has worked excellent up until just yesterday February 19, 2015 when it suddenly stopped taking a charge.</li>
            <li>About 8 years ago, my first electrical shaver was a Panasonic, which I think it was easy to use when I found out how handy a electrical shaver could be and amount of time</li>
            <li>Very comfortable shave with no razor burn and it&#x27;s shaves quickly.</li>
            <li>it went through it quickly, leaving my face very smooth.</li>
            <li>Great shaver for general trimming.</li>
            <li>what was most important for me is how good it seemed to be with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a pretty amazing razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a pretty amazing razor.</li>
            <li>Great: price, quality, brand and product in general.</li>
            <li>I was originally going for a Norelco Rotary, but most reviews warned that the foil could fall off from the blades and you could get cut or that the razor itself was made of cheap material.    </li>
            <li>That may be true for some beards, but mine requires more than one pass.  </li>
            <li>If I redesigned the razor, I would consider having three, full width blades and screens for greater coverage and fewer required passes.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer is also pretty handy.  </li>
            <li>he&#x27;d use whatever--not interested in buying his own.  </li>
            <li>I have been a tried and true supporter of rotary shavers for better than 30 years...</li>
            <li>Kept a good charge really easy to clean and gave him a really close shave.</li>
            <li>Been using electric razors most of my adult life and this one has by far been the best.</li>
            <li>Not real loud, gets the job done very easily!!</li>
            <li>Hands down the best shaver I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>Owned, wore &#x27;em out, and thought some were better than others, but this one has topped them all for comfortable and ease of use that leaves me with a close shave that feels like I&#x27;ve had a clean close shaved.  </li>
            <li>Hands down, this shaver is the best electric shave I have ever had.</li>
            <li>Hands down best electric razor I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>hands down the best!</li>
            <li>The result has been an astonishingly close shave that leaves my face smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>This Panasonic is hands down the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
            <li>I love the features this has, like the light up LCD screen that shows the battery level and when it&#x27;s time to rinse the blades clean.</li>
            <li>Having used electric shavers for 40 years, this is the smoothest, most comfortable and clean shaving shaver.</li>
            <li>Hands down, the best razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li>good for a fast clean shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had Braun and Norelco shavers, and this one is hands down the best I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>Hands down, the best razor I have ever owned!</li>
            <li>I tried the razor (dry) and it did not give a very good shave.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet, strong and gave me my first truely perfect shave from an electric.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s by far the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used though, and I highly suggest it.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, since I have no idea when I&#x27;ll have a working razor again (as they offered no turn-around time), I purchased a highly rated &#x27;Panasonic ES 8103 S&#x27; which so far has been excellent.</li>
            <li>My husband loved his new shaver.  </li>
            <li>people that got a defective unit complain instead of getting a new one and trying it out with a fair review.</li>
            <li>the new  ones are just as good.</li>
            <li>The shave is not quite as good as when it was new.  </li>
            <li>Pros:  - easy to clean  - battery lasts 2 weeks  - nice battery status indicator  - the shave is as good as other razors I&#x27;ve used  - pretty good price    </li>
            <li>This shaver works just fine.</li>
            <li>Shaver Works Fine</li>
            <li>My face it works fine on...</li>
            <li>The razor itself continues to work fine</li>
            <li>Comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to charge, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>In comparison to my previous electrics, this one is the best I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>This one cleans fine without that stuff.    </li>
            <li>Have had this one 4 months and the foils seem fine</li>
            <li>You get 10, 20, 30, etc, which is fine.</li>
            <li>The razor still works fine, but it is a pain to have to guess when to charge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He says it is easy to hold and use--shaves are close and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Clean and mostly one pass shaving, easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li>It gives a comfortable shave and charges easily.</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s a fine shaver.</li>
            <li>When it dries out the display is fine</li>
            <li>It works fine.  </li>
            <li>The side to side pivot was fine, but I didn&#x27;t care for the in and out motion (like a car shock) on my face.</li>
            <li>It felt fine, but it took forever</li>
            <li>It has worked fine for over 20 years.  </li>
            <li>This shaver gives a smooth and easy shave.</li>
            <li>but it works fine</li>
            <li>than the fact that it didn&#x27;t shave worth a crud, this seemed like a pretty good razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shaves were fine, but today</li>
            <li>At first I was very happy with the Panasonic shaver, but enthusiasm has waned over the period of several weeks.  </li>
            <li>This suits me fine.  </li>
            <li>I have this razor for over year and a half and still works perfectly.</li>
            <li>It misses the fine hair on my neck</li>
            <li>Also does a fine job under the chin.</li>
            <li>Build quality looks and feels fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better razors -need to go over many , many times before I get a half-way decent shave.</li>
            <li>razor itself is holding up fine.</li>
            <li>Battery performance is still fine, I can get about 10 shaves per charge.</li>
            <li>Everything went fine, cheers</li>
            <li>It is light, easy to use, and it cleans itself.  </li>
            <li>Like it fine and would recommend to anyone who shaves with an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>I used a three-headed, six-year-old Norelco electric razor that did fine.</li>
            <li>This shaver works fine in, before or after the shower.  </li>
            <li>Works fine.....</li>
            <li>it is easy to use easy to clean and easy to use</li>
            <li>Update: Still working fine as I add this update on August 23, 2014.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fine.</li>
            <li>The pop-up trimmer is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t cut your skin if you use a light touch.</li>
            <li>and till now is working and doing its job just fine.</li>
            <li>It requires all kinds of lotions and creams and after shave balms just to feel fine and hopefully get rid of the redness.</li>
            <li>Easy and comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to recharge.  </li>
            <li>The timmer works just fine.</li>
            <li>Just started using electric shavers, maybe it will be fine once the technique is mastered.</li>
            <li>Around the mouth and chin, it does a fine job but along the jaw and the neck areas, arent as effective.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Another one I just purchased as a spare since I love this shaver so much! :-)</li>
            <li>It is light weight and easy on the face.</li>
            <li>My previous shaver was a Norelco, which was the best I&#x27;d had until now.</li>
            <li>It works perfectly fine for me.</li>
            <li>Cheap and easy care</li>
            <li>/&gt;the light weight device, it is easy to use and does the job.</li>
            <li>The delivery was just fine, as everything I receive from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>working fine.  </li>
            <li>I tried it on my arm hair and it took it out just fine.</li>
            <li>While the shave quality was fine for me, the hair trimmer never worked well and the LCD display gave out within 6 months.</li>
            <li>I have been using Norelco  Electric Shavers for many years for a quick or weekend shave none of them have even&lt;</li>
            <li>I used for many years, battery life seems to drain quick</li>
            <li>It still charges quickly and lasts for many shaves.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, I haven&#x27;t had to worry about that!</li>
            <li>He can&#x27;t believe how quickly it works, but better yet, how closely it shaves.  </li>
            <li>but it sure is quick and convenient.</li>
            <li>It gives a close shave on most areas of the face and quickly.</li>
            <li>This one is super!</li>
            <li>, it shaves more quickly and feels sturdier -- but</li>
            <li>Quick close shave!</li>
            <li>The rapid charge is a pleasant change from my old shaver that took all night.  </li>
            <li>This provides a good shave, has a decent battery life and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>This Panasonic electric razor is comfortable to use, recharges quickly, and is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>but this razor seems to be quit good at taking it down almost as good a a razor and shave cream.</li>
            <li>This electric razor is incredible and I can use it every single day without any irritation.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much awesome, but it&#x27;s better used wet</li>
            <li>The battery meter looks nice and it&#x27;s nice to know exactly how much juice you have.</li>
            <li>I have tried the new braun and norelco and the Panasonic is by far the best.</li>
            <li>The new Panasonic I bought is clearly the best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clear and the charge on it is really good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean, easy to charge</li>
            <li>Quiet, close shave after a couple of passes, great battery/charges very quickly  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean and easy to carry.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean, easy to charge.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and easy to charge.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to clean, and the blades are easy to replace.  </li>
            <li>I had asked my wife to find me a razor that is easy to clean and this one seems like it will hit the mark for easy cleaning.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Battery life is good so far, about 3 months and still going strong.</li>
            <li>This is my 4th Panasonic razor and I think they&#x27;re great, mainly because the motor is just stronger than what I&#x27;ve experienced in other electrics.  </li>
            <li>This is just one dang fine shaver, holds a charge for weeks, super easy to clean, even in the shower!</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with my shaver and look forward to many more close, comfortable shaves from it.</li>
            <li>The thing I&#x27;m most impressed with is the short amount of time needed for an amazingly closer shave with zero irritation to my pretty sensitive face.  </li>
            <li>clean close shave on my tender face, love that I can run it under the faucet for a better cleaning, recharges very fast</li>
            <li>This razor works quickly, is nicely shaped, fits my hand very well, gives a good readout on the battery level, and recharges fast, even for a quick shave.  </li>
            <li>The screen has held up perfectly (the Braun screen would lose bits here and there, causing the shaver block to grab and chop little bits of skin).</li>
            <li>Hopefully I grow out of this noise, as this is a wonderful little shaver, except for the noise.  </li>
            <li>Except a little noisy when I use it, everything else is very wonderful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the Panasonic ES8103S razor and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Found this shaver is very good and gives a close shave all over my face and neck like the way it cleans and using it as a wet shaver</li>
            <li>It remains to be seen what kind of battery life it has, but if it&#x27;s like my old razor it should go a couple weeks on a charge, which is fine for most business trips.</li>
            <li>It remains to be seen what kind of battery life it has, but if it&#x27;s like my old razor it should go a couple weeks on a charge, which is fine for most business trips.</li>
            <li>partly because of the price from Amazon and free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased .......and would highly recommend it....</li>
            <li>Best razor that I have owned...hands down!</li>
            <li>They clean up easily and give a smooth, close shave</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going to return it, and spend $150-$200 on a more powerful / advanced one.</li>
            <li>But I cannot stand the huge noise which sounds like car engine.</li>
            <li>But this Panasonic gives an amazing fast and close, comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean, battery lasts, and leaves my face smooth.</li>
            <li>I am not going to return because Amazon can&#x27;t write accurate descriptions in this case.</li>
            <li>I got a 100 dollar Braun to replace it, huge mistake.</li>
            <li>Some reviewers said that 4 and 5 blades are so huge that they have problems shaving under the nose.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>Smooth shave, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It charges quickly, it&#x27;s easy to use and to clean, but the noise is a huge drawback.</li>
            <li>This shaver was great initially - close and comfortable shaves.</li>
            <li>smooth and close shave that was a cheap and light weight work</li>
            <li>The whole process is so much faster than using a blade, its great.  </li>
            <li>Also, being wet/dry is another huge plus.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sold on those 4 and 5 blade shavers, they just look too huge.</li>
            <li>The shaver also doesn&#x27;t break my skin if I go over any raised acne bumps, which was a huge problem with the manual razors.</li>
            <li>Really came in handy on our driving trip.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>In the short time that he has been using it,the results are great.</li>
            <li>A couple of passes and its smooth...</li>
            <li>like I used a Mach 3 razor, skin is smooth</li>
            <li>skin feel smooth  </li>
            <li>This shaver is so smooth and quite.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this shaver.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic shaver.</li>
            <li>comfortable  4.</li>
            <li>easy to clean</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and does provide a close shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been burned before by cheap shavers, and know you get what you pay for, but then there comes a point when you have to remind yourself</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I have a light beard and use a pre-electric shave; just soap when in the shower -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for several years and am generally happy with it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a great price for a Panasonic, which is the only brand of shaver I&#x27;ll buy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean with liquid hand soap, so the optional cleaning machine is not a necessity.</li>
            <li>The product was advertised as provided a close, comfortable shave</li>
            <li>It still takes me 4-5 minutes to shave each morning, but when I&#x27;m done it leaves my face smooth and stubble free.  </li>
            <li>Louder than the norelco but not annoying.  </li>
            <li>Holds a charge well and is easy to clean-</li>
            <li>The shaver does great on my face and jaw line but the neck is a completely different story.  </li>
            <li>The shaver seemed very well built with a nice weight to it.  </li>
            <li>sound, charger cord, and travel case.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my head baby  smooth.</li>
            <li>Great shaver, this is the second one I have owned of this model.  </li>
            <li>Its quite smooth.</li>
            <li>This shaver is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Primarily Norelco but also Remington, Braun and Toshiba.  </li>
            <li>- Easy and inexpensive to clean (had to do it once in</li>
            <li>so I replaced it with a cheap razor</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price :)</li>
            <li>It provides a smooth, close shave and does not irritate his skin.  </li>
            <li>I feel like the shave is closer, and I appreciate the smooth, non-irritating shaving experience.  </li>
            <li>feel is comfortable to handle</li>
            <li>and it did an decently smooth shave.</li>
            <li>The wet/dry feature is fabulous and I wouldn&#x27;t buy a shaver that couldn&#x27;t be used in the shower, it&#x27;s just too convenient.</li>
            <li>All the reviews promised a painless, smooth shave that is about as close as it gets for an electric razor.</li>
            <li>I had a Braun prior to this and was happy with it as well,</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to use and is advertised to use with water and shaving cream.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic ES8103S is a fantastic electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean</li>
            <li>and I found the Norelco didn&#x27;t move as smoothly across the skin as the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>The shave is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It slices through my stubble with ease and gives a smooth, comfortable shave every time.</li>
            <li>Can clean it easily with liquid hand soap.</li>
            <li>Panasonic recommends that the razor be recharged at a comfortable room temperature</li>
            <li>Wet-compatible  Comfortable to use  CONS:  </li>
            <li>This shaver is easy to use and to clean.  </li>
            <li>It takes about four times longer to get a shave that I would not feel comfortable leaving the house.</li>
            <li>So my guess this one will give me great shaves over and over again - but last about 5 years as well...</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to hold, and the head pivots to contour your face.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s really easy to take apart to clean.  </li>
            <li>I was not expecting such a great shave from an electric razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite comfortable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite comfortable.</li>
            <li>I needed an electric razor that would leave my face smooth and not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Overall this shaver works great and appears to be well made.</li>
            <li>but now it cuts smooth.  </li>
            <li>but i understand then i wouldn&#x27;t be as cheap of a price.     </li>
            <li>Cuts close and smooth.</li>
            <li>This shaver is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Easy clean up too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely great for shaving the head and equal to a blade even without shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>found a bit of Argon oil as an aftershave leaves your face smooth as silk.</li>
            <li>but, after my beard was conditioned , the shave was as smooth as a babies bottom.</li>
            <li>And the Panasonic has a fantastic trimmer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Waterproofing means it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It has a comfortable \\&quot;floating head\\&quot; that will adjust to the pressure you use to apply it against your skin and it will also tilt to the contour of your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Which is a rare moment in time :)</li>
            <li>easy to clean.</li>
            <li>comfortable, close shave.</li>
            <li>light, durable,</li>
            <li>Speaking of battery life, the display showing battery percentage (with light) is fantastic.</li>
            <li>After a month or so, I can say it&#x27;s faster and closer than the rotary (which I now keep at work, just in case), and almost as comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Overall seems like a great unit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good design and removes most of my facial hair comfortably.  </li>
            <li>* Light weight and quiet.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>So, enjoy this feature while it is still available.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The built-in ultrasonic cleaning is truly fantastic.</li>
            <li>Easy to use &amp; clean.  </li>
            <li>Overall, i am happy with it.</li>
            <li>Your face will be smooth after using this razor.  </li>
            <li>This is the closest shave, next to a safety razor, I&#x27;ve experienced.</li>
            <li>still don&#x27;t get a smooth shave</li>
            <li>Feels cheap made in China material -1&lt;</li>
            <li>This razor has a fantastic cut.</li>
            <li>feature of this shaver is the close, pain-free, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I passed the shaver lightly hoping that would make a difference, but the hairs were continued to pull.</li>
            <li>So for now, I&#x27;ll stick to the 2 blade model which I find comfortable, and gives a resonable shave.</li>
            <li>Impressions 5 days in, daily: works great, beyond expectations.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I need a trimmer, check, and a comfortable shave, check.  </li>
            <li>It fits comfortably in your hand and is reasonably light in weight.</li>
            <li>Easy to Clean.</li>
            <li>Ease of use was the primary reason</li>
            <li>Much more powerful than my $30 Panasonic 2-blade.</li>
            <li>smooth Larry       ps.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean  </li>
            <li>Completely smooth.  </li>
            <li>All these years, I believed in the marketing hype and used the rotary shavers from Norelco(including arcitec 1050) and lived with the conclusion that if I wanted a smooth silky shave, I will have to use a razor blade.    </li>
            <li>and it leaves my face smooth as a babys bottom.</li>
            <li>Smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>Comfortable and close shave</li>
            <li>I am amazed at how smooth the skin is after a shave.</li>
            <li>get a smooth comfortable shave</li>
            <li>After shaving, the Panasonic comes apart easily for clean up in soapy water.   </li>
            <li>This is a great shaver, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>I would say 99% as smooth as razor, the difference is nominal</li>
            <li>Despite the three weeks without a shaver, I thought this was fantastic customer service.</li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic.  </li>
            <li>then another 2 or 3 passes to really get a nice shave.  </li>
            <li>If you want a really smooth shave, start with lather and a safety razor follwed by an electric like the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>Stays charged for a week and re- charges in an hour.&lt;br /&gt;Feels smooth on my face and gives a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>Charges fast and having the display battery life is nice.</li>
            <li>It is pleasantly smooth, retains it&#x27;s charge.  </li>
            <li>I read the fantastic reviews of the Panasonic es8103s and gave it a try.</li>
            <li>I did some research and thought I&#x27;d try this model for my primary shaver.  </li>
            <li>My face is almost &#x27;baby&#x27; smooth.</li>
            <li>Perhaps moisture is getting inside, or Panasonic&#x27;s LCD screens are simply CHEAP.</li>
            <li>Convenient and comfortable when use it.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast-only issue I would have is their was no bubble wrap in the box to help secure the shaver from bouncing around as box was rightsized but needed some cushioning for the ride to my house.</li>
            <li>It cuts smooth and close...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as smooth as a Mach 3</li>
            <li>The head doesn&#x27;t curve to fit the scalp, but none of them do.    </li>
            <li>It is easy to clean every now and then.</li>
            <li>and the shave was fantastic....</li>
            <li>It is comfortable and smooth and shaves almost as close as a blade.</li>
            <li>It is a smooth operator.</li>
            <li>Light weight</li>
            <li>The shaves I get are close and smooth.</li>
            <li>It also tells you when it&#x27;s time to clean it, and it&#x27;s waterproof so you can easily wash it or shave in the shower.</li>
            <li>and I have skimpy, light beard growth.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>comfortable in</li>
            <li>I found it easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>One important thing to me is that I did NOT get any razor rash.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean and can be washed with water without any problems.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean as it is water proof.</li>
            <li>With my fairly light beard it lasts two weeks between charges.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give it 6 stars if they were available.  </li>
            <li>Cheap Plastic seems to be the priority in the manufacturing of the unit.</li>
            <li>issue i have is it does not shave my neck hairs well, but on my face it is absolutely fantastic</li>
            <li>Smooth, so it packs well.</li>
            <li>But, the important part is the shave</li>
            <li>is it is so easy to clean which saves time and hassle</li>
            <li>Along with an unbreakable shower mirror, I shave with soap lather and it takes me about 1-2 minutes for a close, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>Smooth skin and no nicks.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This was such a great testament, I just finished placing another order to replace my husband&#x27;s electric shaver (another brand).</li>
            <li>Sound level is probably equivalent to a Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic and Amazon do a great job of giving side-by-side comparisons of the current shavers.  </li>
            <li>Great shaver especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>When available as &amp;#34;Deal of the day&amp;#34; it&#x27;s a steal.</li>
            <li>I have light morning growth</li>
            <li>so it seems to cut easily and cleanly.  </li>
            <li>It took a bit to get used to, but I really enjoy this style.</li>
            <li>So easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This is an absolutely fabulous deal, given the price these sell for now.</li>
            <li>Yes, I&#x27;m talking about the cheap plastic ones you buy 5 per pack.</li>
            <li>Eventually it will work, but you have to apply it lightly to those stray whiskers.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>Sound like mower.&lt;br /&gt;Is</li>
            <li>Overall I am happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Stopped because I could not get a close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to clean and charges fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is a zero skin irritation factor and it&#x27;s easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>I use it with shaving cream and it provides a smooth and close shave, with no skin irritation at all.</li>
            <li>It shaves so smooth.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable Grip    </li>
            <li>it was fairly smooth over my face.</li>
            <li>It cuts smoothly and efficiently.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>My face doesn&#x27;t feel smooth and</li>
            <li>Even when the firmer setting is chosen, the head still pivots to some degree just not as freely.  </li>
            <li>but this one is very close and feels nice and balanced in my hand.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Product packaging does not show the HydraClean Dock is available as an accessory.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean shaves close.</li>
            <li>Fantastic shaver.</li>
            <li>Works great, especially with Gel.  </li>
            <li>This shaver may not quit be razor smooth but its damn close.</li>
            <li>When i bought it and started using it it went well gave a smooth shave</li>

            <li>Since I was used to a rotary, it felt comfortable and smooth from day one.</li>
            <li>The factors that were important to me about this Panasonic were that it is cordless and can be used in the shower.</li>
            <li>, light shave oil with Dr. Bonner&#x27;s pepperment oil soap, and just the soap.</li>
            <li>Again great razor for the price but don&#x27;t expect the same shave as a 300$ plus razor.</li>

            <li>This gets just as close and leaves my skin baby smooth.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s not all that light.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel or look cheap in anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Usage....</li>

            <li>five stars if it didn&#x27;t take multiple passes, but it might be more apt to irritate the skin if they redesigned it to cut more aggressively.</li>
            <li>Still, since the shaver itself does a great job, I haven&#x27;t had a big need to use it.</li>
            <li>After a couple months of use, I&#x27;ve found that to be confirmed.  </li>
            <li>Not so comfortable on face.    </li>
            <li>In just a couple weeks of getting used to this Panasonic, my face gets near-up razor smooth, and my neck is closer than I could ever get it with a razor.  </li>
            <li>After using it, my beard is smooth, but not as smooth as when I use the razor.</li>
            <li>Blade and screen still shaves close and irritation free after 2 years.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a close shave and clean up is beyond easy.</li>
            <li>This is important, because you can&#x27;t leave the shaver plugged into an electric outlet all the time.</li>
            <li>It does a great job but again have to make multiple passes.</li>
            <li>It gives a shave as smooth as a blade.  </li>

            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Instructions is unclear on how to get the water faucet icon to light up.</li>
            <li>Shaves are close and smooth.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic razor does a pretty good job, the shave is almost as good as a manual razor (on legs anyway), but its pretty loud.</li>
            <li>THIS IS FANTASTIC.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to clean as well.&lt;br /&gt;Wet</li>

            <li>can be bought for under $80 w/ free shipping on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It is also easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Holds a charge well and is really easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I have a light beard</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s plugged in (recharge mode) it doesn&#x27;t work so keep an eye on the battery life light.</li>
            <li>Close and smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I have a fairly light beard but the hairs on my neck/</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, and the charge lasts for a week.</li>
            <li>Feels comfortable in hand.</li>
            <li>but when I switched to using a shaving gel (Edge) I got a close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>This shaver is perfect for the man who razor shaves occasionally, and wants to stay smooth in-between.</li>
            <li>good so far -</li>
            <li>Since I would be without a razor while the battery was being replaced, I bought a current Norelco product (# 8240XL) and it seems to be as good as the Panasonic or even better flowing over my face and getting a close cut.  </li>
            <li>razor cleans up easy with liquid hand soap and water and has a nice sonic cleaning mode to really power clean the heads.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>this one so far is good.  </li>
            <li>It shaves much closer, although it still takes multiple passes to make a perfect shave.  </li>
            <li>so far so good.  </li>
            <li>Nothing but good stuff so far</li>
            <li>I had a Braun I loved for years and this shaves closer, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Good so far +1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>far, the shaver works fairly well.</li>
            <li>and so far so good.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I used this razor because it does as good a job  </li>
            <li>So far, so good, after one week.  </li>
            <li>But I am deducting a star because it is noisy with a loud hum and the trimmer is not as good as the Norelcos.</li>
            <li>I finally tried this one, and it is clearly superior in many respects.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kinda loud, which was surprising.</li>
            <li>He has sensitive skin and gets shadow by noon;not a good combination.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using both for 90 days separately the Panasonic was clearly the closer and more effective shave.  </li>
            <li>I am impressed with the fact that it has a&lt;br /&gt;lithium battery and lets me know how much charge is left at the end of my shave.  </li>
            <li>Much superior to my OLD Norelco..closer and smooth shave without pinching..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing this shaver is far more effective on softer/thinner beards....</li>
            <li>The razor gives a good shave although not as close as my old Braun did before they began manufacturing their shavers in China.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>It gives me a good shave so far.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Satisfied overall for the money, but I don&#x27;t think the Panasonic shavers areas good as they used to be.  </li>
            <li>and so far so good.</li>
            <li>The motor on this shaver is far superior to the Remington</li>
            <li>It is about as good as the old Remington</li>
            <li>Great Razor ,better than expected close shave.</li>
            <li>After much research on Amazon, I finally decided that this model was the best bang for the buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t compare), and my old Panasonic was a cheap $20 one that shaved surprisingly well.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as my old Norelco rotary.</li>
            <li>I replaced a 10 year old Panasonic that I loved, but whose battery pooped out.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>It works well but not as good as my old Braun 5 series.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one works just as good as the old one and hopefully, I&#x27;ll get another 10 years out of it.</li>
            <li>Shaves good, fast, easy to use, my husband likes it very much.  </li>
            <li>The super high speed must be a good answer to the shaving problem.  </li>
            <li>My first still works great, but needed a new blade and foil, and when I saw this one at such a great deal</li>
            <li>quick clean up!</li>
            <li>This was my first screen style and, cheaper than either the fancier Brauns or another Norelco, this $85 wonder shaves beautifully, cleans easily and apparently would even work in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Consistent, accurate and holds a charge, also easy to transport safely.</li>
            <li>My wife, the true judge of a good shave, had no idea I had purchased a new shaver.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic ES8103S is light but very powerful.  </li>
            <li>The shave is light but very powerful.</li>
            <li>The reviews were excellent, so I bought it on Amazon for $64.00 and received it, as usual, very quickly with no shipping charges.</li>
            <li>It does a beautiful job quickly and quietly.</li>
            <li>i used it dry first time out and results were great!</li>
            <li>i used it dry first time out and results were great!</li>
            <li>The other issue is that sometime it pulls the hair (like when I cut the goatee).&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, very good choice of electric razor if you use it often.</li>
            <li>The display of battery power remaining is a nice touch, and the trimmer action is good (as it was in the older model).  </li>
            <li>This razor works wonderfully and does as good a job as some that cost as much as $190 (which I think is a ridiculous price for a razor).  </li>
            <li>and the razor runs strong at full speed until it dies; there is no \\&quot;petering-out\\&quot; period wherein the motor slows to a pinching crawl before stopping.</li>
            <li>First off, it arrived 22 hours after I ordered it 5 days before Christmas!!  </li>
            <li>Display is very useful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for a couple of weeks now and it is very useful.</li>
            <li>Very rarely does it pull a hair..</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does give a very nice shave, it may take a couple extra passes in areas where the hair doesn&#x27;t grow in a uniform direction</li>
            <li>I have never gotten such a close shave than I have with the ES8103S, it is also very gentle on my face, it is so easy to clean with the turbo clean mode feature, and the pop up trimmer is also very good.</li>
            <li>Shave clean, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>the way, I use it for my entire head (scalp and all) and can get 5-7 shaves on one charge and one cleaning, which is great, in my book, just charge up and clean on weekends.</li>
            <li>I have been using Panasonic for many years, but this is so better improved than older</li>
            <li>shaver even tells me when it&#x27;s time to clean and it&#x27;s easy to remove the foil, clean and re-assemble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Panasonic ES8103S shaver is light, compact and delivers a comfortable clean shave.  </li>
            <li>He recently got a great job that required him to be clean shaven every day.  </li>
            <li>This one gives a smooth, close shave quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li>This shaver delivers a nice clean shave, very efficiently, without any pulling or skin burn.</li>
            <li>I am a young engineer who dresses well, smells good and likes to be clean and trimmed.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts for about 1/3 of what it used to, and the shave does not feel as close or as smooth as it did originally.</li>
            <li>I first notice how nice it feels to hold the shaver, so hats of to Panasonic for designing such a good grip feel.</li>
            <li>they were right, after shaving for about a month I don&#x27;t want to try any other devices, it is the best.</li>
            <li>Gives a very, very close and comfortable shave, closer than a blade FOR SURE.</li>
            <li>True to many of the other reviews here, the quality of the shave is excellent, and really does rival the closeness of a blade.</li>
            <li>From the first shave it gave me a very comfortable close shave.  </li>
            <li>This does everything right and tells me easily the charge condition, that I think is easy to read anywhere.  </li>
            <li>The battery on my old Panasonic expired after many years of great service, so I decided to buy another rather than a new battery.  </li>
            <li>The battery charge indicator is accurate and it even has an icon to tell when to clean the shaver.</li>
            <li>The shave is smooth, quick and close (even with fine chin hair).  </li>
            <li>As for the Panasonic, I remember that I picked this shaver up in college when my roommate said that it had the most powerful motor available and that meant it could cut the hairs quickly without snagging or causing any irritation.</li>
            <li>AS COMFORTABLE AND CLEAN SHAVING</li>
            <li>In fact, I swear it does the reverse: it leaves my face so clean and smooth</li>
            <li>I clean it whenever the cleaning light comes on, and I change the blades and foil once a year.</li>
            <li>with Jet Clean System, Frustration Free Packaging]], about $240,</li>
            <li>Clean smooth shave&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It charges quickly, holds the charge well, and cleans easily.</li>
            <li>This model shaves even better than the last, and I am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I own an older Panasonic which I have been using for 5 years and when it was time to replace it I looked around and saw this.  </li>
            <li>Like I said, quick and easy.</li>
            <li>, this deserves a small section of its own, this shaver is really great for guys that get a lot of ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>easy to clean....charges quickly.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know how it fairs on a full grown beard, but for everyday shaving it is excellent.</li>
            <li>Plus, the battery life on it lasts weeks after full charge and it is water proof, making it easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I had an older version of this which i liked a lot</li>
            <li>and it cleans with water quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li>At first I was delighted with it, but gradually noticed that it takes repeated passes to give a really close shave.</li>
            <li>Super easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>Quick, easy, and efficient.    </li>
            <li>Really these are minor issues in an otherwise excellent product in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really these are minor issues in an otherwise excellent product in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s not scientific but good enough for a quick apples-to-apples comparison.  </li>
            <li>It was quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>Shaving with this Panasonic is quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>I would first comment that the ES8103S does a good job of shaving both fast and close.  </li>
            <li>mainly i got it since the charger works from 110v to 240v, but it was also nice that this is a sealed shaver that can work in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Quick to shave and gets all the hair on my face fairly easily.</li>
            <li>It did a nice job on my face and a decent job on my neck.</li>
            <li>a result, do not need to go into much detail you want to get shaver&#x27;ll have a pretty good choice</li>
            <li>Caught this one a good price and after a few weeks, I have to say I am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>The batter life is adequate (holds about for 9-10 shaves) and charges very quickly.</li>
            <li>It charges quick and is easy to hold while using it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very versatile and does a pretty good job,</li>
            <li>This is the first electric shaver that I think gives a good shave in a reasonable length of time.</li>
            <li>The ability to lock or float the head is an added nice feature for different parts of the chin and face and is very easy to clean.    </li>
            <li>&#x27;s : Very easy to clean, works when wet, charges quickly , good shave quality</li>
            <li>The skin on my face is very tender and can get irritated very easily.  </li>
            <li>This provides a very close shave and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Great price for a great shaver, the only complaint I have is it have to go over my neck beard multiple times for a clean shave, works great on the face!</li>
            <li>It gives me a smooth shave, is easy to handle (pretty light), confortable, and the battery percent left display is a great feature.</li>
            <li>recommend it highly, gives a nice close shave...</li>
            <li>\\&quot;If\\&quot; money was no object I would have purchased the new high-end Braun that is rated as the best overall unit in Consumer Reports</li>
            <li>Its okay didnt shave any better after I bought new blade and screen.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean, charges quickly and lets you know when to recharge it by the lighted percentage numbers on the handle.  </li>
            <li>It charges quickly, lasts about 6 or 7 shaves, and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It shaves very close and like so many guys my neck area gets irritated easily.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy to clean under the faucet.</li>
            <li>While it easily shaves most areas very well, to me</li>
            <li>The included charger dumps 5.2volts at 1.2 amps into the handle (fast charging), so you can easily get many shaves out of the unit from 20 minutes of charging.</li>
            <li>Shaves close without irritation, easy to clean, quick recharge...</li>
            <li>It is super easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li>Quick charge and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I am sure that it died because of its exposure to water, but since it is advertised as being good to use in the shower, it did not live up to expectations.  </li>
            <li>It does a GREAT job on the flat surfaces of my face- super smooth.</li>
            <li>It charges fast and is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Quick and super easy to clean and gives a quick, close shave on course whiskers with no cuts!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold, cleans up easily under running water, charges quickly, has good charge retention, and has a good strong cutter with a thin foil.</li>
            <li>In general it is good for the money</li>
            <li>From the first time I used it I got a better shave than I have had in years.</li>
            <li>and the wife likes it because I&#x27;m willing to shave more often.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slim and powerful!</li>
            <li>As rechargable electric razors go, this is the best one I have used in the past 5 years.  </li>
            <li>So far I am very pleased with the Panasonic ES 8103.  </li>
            <li>The oscillation frequency of the linear drive is significantly faster than that of the Remington MS3 3700</li>
            <li>It has not disappointed me at all.  </li>
            <li>If you look at the cost over 3 years, the Panasonic would cost $65 whereas the Norelco would cost $117 which exceeds the original cost of the shaver ($100).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found some issues with the shaver that I wanted to append to my original review:&lt;br</li>
            <li>-- I commented on the noise in my original review.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found some issues with the shaver that I wanted to append to my original review:&lt;br</li>
            <li>-- I commented on the noise in my original review.  </li>
            <li>If the first shaver gave a better shave</li>
            <li>well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I was surprised and very pleased with the performance of this one.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric shaver in more than 15 years.  </li>
            <li>For some reason, it seems to hold a charge better then when I first bought it.</li>
            <li>I originally bought the ES-LT41-K Arc3 and the display started to malfunction so within the year&#x27;s warranty</li>
            <li>The sound is not bad though and is frankly not an issue at all.</li>
            <li>I have had one for around 6 years and it still works like a charm, with the original blades.  </li>
            <li>After reading many reviews (thanks everyone!)</li>
            <li>You may have to \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; if you&#x27;re heading out in the evening after originally shaving in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Takes a long time to get a close shave, otherwise great  shaver to take on vacation.</li>
            <li>WELL worth the money!</li>
            <li>At first my husband wanted me to get him a more inexpensive electric razor like the one he had</li>
            <li>and so far I am very satisfied with the quality and the shave performance.</li>
            <li>When I originally read how to do it in the instructions, I dreaded to ever have to do any of that.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think I would be willing to pay more than $65-ish.</li>
            <li>When he first tried it he thought it was just ok.</li>
            <li>My first foil type shaver in many years.  </li>
            <li>I still have my original 8066 as a backup.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise very pleased with the shaver performance so far.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not disappointed after 2 weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>But, even considering those minor detractions, I bought another one on sale to keep as a spare, because THIS IS A GREAT SHAVER.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t buy again even on a significant sale, as was the case this time.</li>
            <li>I am a 77 year old man who is very pleased with this shaver.  </li>
            <li>Do you want all the bells and whistles like shooting soothing shave gel on your pretty face while taking a shower or more doo-dads than a swiss army knife...</li>
            <li>so far I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recall when I purchased the first one as it has been many years.</li>
            <li>The first thought I had shaving with this: &amp;#34;This is the most pleasant-feeling shave ever!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure that goes for anything that isn&#x27;t a razor.</li>
            <li>So far I have been very satisfied.</li>
            <li>and this is the closest and most consistent shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>far I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Cleaner shave and plenty powerful!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It gives a closer shave than my rotaries did, but it seems like I have to shave significantly longer to get that close shave.  </li>
            <li>and I was so excited to have this Panasonic</li>
            <li>Original June 2013</li>
            <li>Got it on sale and am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do well with long hair, but it&#x27;s great if you shave every day.</li>
            <li>I am also pretty sure Panasonic gives refunds if you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>And THAT is a significant difference.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, my favorite model is out of production, so I tried Panasonic for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s worth investing in!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a shame that they could not have incorporated the original design.</li>
            <li>me smile to give 5 stars!</li>
            <li>I handed it to my bro a fewe days later since he liked it, so I wanted to get one for myself!</li>
            <li>While I originally bought it for $66, newegg had it for $70.</li>
            <li>Works great, holds the charge for a long while &amp; for the pric you cannot beat it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recently I came across the original receipt and operators manual.</li>
            <li>I am still using the original blade and foil, and do not note any appreciable performance decrease.  </li>
            <li>Amazon staff was friendly, however we were not offered anything as compensation for our troubles.  </li>
            <li>Not quite as close a shave as a razor blade and hair grows back quicker, still more enjoyable and conveinent than a razor as no need for shaving gel or water, thus can shave anywhere, even while watching tv!.</li>
            <li>So the money saving in the long run is great as well.</li>
            <li>have the original blade, it does take a bit longer, but still cuts well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought it based on its reviews -- not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li>Original review from Nov. 20, 2012</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually review products unless really impressed.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure you will be too.</li>
            <li>Below is the original review where I gave the product five stars.</li>
            <li>I usually finish shaving in &lt;3 min, every 2 days.</li>
            <li>I assume you all know this, but be sure to plug in and charge first.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using the razor long and it seems to working great.</li>
            <li>I love that you can simply pop off the top and run some water over it to clean it, or if you want to get a better clean, just drop some soap in it too.  </li>
            <li>Although I believe a superior Panasonic model was listed at a similar price on Overstock ( it wasn&#x27;t when I checked before this purchase ) , this model seems fine.</li>
            <li>The first shave was decent, not quit as good as the razor I have used for years.</li>
            <li>Overall a good purchase, but don&#x27;t toss your blades yet for a super close shave on the days you need it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a very good shave, but it&#x27;s just a slightly longer cut.</li>
            <li>6 weeks, my previous razor was a Braun, I used it about 15 years and got very good close shaves.</li>
            <li>All other features are very good however, the head design does not lend itself for a quick clean shave.</li>
            <li>The trimmer on this is small but effective, and I appreciate that it flips out a good inch, which makes it easy to see where sideburns or mustaches need to be trimmed.</li>
            <li>First off this shaver is very friendly to the face.  </li>
            <li>Still has to use a regular razor for the real close smooth shaves, but if he forgets to shave this looks just as good!</li>
            <li>What irritation it has caused is my own fault, because I&#x27;m in need of a new blade/foil.  </li>
            <li>really liked the ES8077, and I still have one that I use as a backup (it&#x27;s almost still new).  </li>
            <li>This new one shaves close a bit quicker, and is easier to clean using a bit of liquid soap and warm water.  </li>
            <li>Great shaver, holds charge still for a very long time.</li>
            <li>In fact it still works great, but its rechargeable battery just doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for very long now, so I thought it was time to replace it.</li>
            <li>it icon even if the unit is clean</li>
            <li>having to clean the blade all the time -</li>
            <li>but it also does a great job dry.  </li>
            <li>30 seconds to clean...</li>
            <li>clean the blades</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how I can read so many different opinions on it from the reviews.  </li>
            <li>The shaver provides a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m happy with the results using it dry)  </li>
            <li>It comes out clean and you can just let everything air-dry.  </li>
            <li>Quick, comfortable, and for me, close as a blade.  </li>
            <li>- surprisingly loud    - takes several passes for best result    </li>
            <li>Panasonic ES8103S is not the top of of the line shaver, but it performs better than anything I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>No nicks, no razor burn, just super smooth.</li>
            <li>After each shave, I like to clean the razor, and it&#x27;s a dream to do if you use soft-foam soap and follow the directions for cleaning that come with the unit.  </li>
            <li>the shaver gives a clean shave (5-8mins)</li>
            <li>I clean it when it says it&#x27;s time to clean</li>
            <li>clean shave and charge holds for couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>To clean it, just place it under running water for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>so I can clean under running water, the swivel head and the compact charger.</li>
            <li>It works great, and I really like that it clearly displays the amount of charge remaining.  </li>
            <li>I have owned a number of shavers over the last 20 years and this is by far the best one to date.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and accurate and you can use it with or without water, even in the shower if you want.  </li>
            <li>Gives a clean save and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>This shaver gives a close clean shave with no irritation at all.  </li>
            <li>I get a clean shave all over my face.</li>
            <li>I like not being dependent on additional products to keep the razor clean.</li>
            <li>I go through shields, so my strategy is to buy the lower end panasonics more frequently, as opposed to buying the top end and then spending money on replacement shields.  </li>
            <li>Also it tells you when you should clean it.  </li>
            <li>Keep your shaver blades and foil clean.</li>
            <li>Provides a quick, close and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is relatively cheap and is a good choice for someone wanting to make a jump from regular razor to electric.</li>
            <li>Basically, the ES8103S can deliver a close, clean shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of different razors and this is the best by far.</li>
            <li>I clean it with a spray bottle of alcohol after each shave.         </li>
            <li>Plus, it will let you know when it&#x27;s time to clean it.  </li>
            <li>Plus I&#x27;d have to clean anything it would miss with a disposable</li>
            <li>This is the easiest electric shaver to clean.</li>
            <li>to clean.</li>
            <li>When it is time to clean the heads, it will tell me that too with a prompt on the led display.</li>
            <li>FOR USE AND FOR CLEAN</li>
            <li>/&gt;No brush to clean it</li>
            <li>The shaver will tell you when to recharge &amp; clean the head of the shaver.  </li>
            <li>Unless you clean this out EVERY time you use it, there are whiskers all over your shirt and sink after you&#x27;re done shaving.  </li>
            <li>It leaves a clean skin without pre shave lotion.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s a lot easier to clean than the rotary models I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>Just take off the screen and rinse, to clean.</li>
            <li>: it makes a clean shave.</li>
            <li>and I have a clean</li>
            <li>clean will be</li>
            <li>good price~~&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s  big sound</li>
            <li>It works like a charm by giving me a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>But it took lot of time to clean the neck and lower chin area , I had to use my Saving blade to clean this.</li>
            <li>and it is shiny and clean.</li>
            <li>but it does provide a clean shave</li>
            <li>It gives a good smooth shave, and I have tried it on my legs as a personal test.</li>
            <li>After using different brands over time this was the best said my 83 year old mate.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s time to clean the shaver.  </li>
            <li>This is the best razor I have ever bought as far as the actual razor goes...</li>
            <li>This is my third Panasonic Wet/Dry shaver and is by far the best one.</li>
            <li>Quick and comfortable and holds its charge well.</li>
            <li>So I am shaving clean my neck, chin and mustache area as I want neither a mustache or beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I always clean my razor after every use.</li>
            <li>The motor is much quieter and considerably faster than everything I have experienced.</li>
            <li>I clean it with liquid soap every time I use it and charge it about once a week</li>
            <li>But, this one started better than the others I&#x27;ve had, and after nearly a year, it&#x27;s still holding up better.  </li>
            <li>It is light weight and elegant yet does a very manly job of shaving close without damaging my skin.</li>
            <li>I still have to use my clippers if I want to look clean.</li>
            <li>If you need a clean shave, stick with razors.</li>
            <li>Never has it gave me a clean shave.</li>
            <li>I choose to clean immediately.</li>
            <li>Works well &amp; cuts clean.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to clean it.</li>
            <li>So far a great product and the price was definitly reasonable would recomend.</li>
            <li>it shaved well but felt underowerered and pop up trimmer didn&#x27;t trim as clean as the panasonics.</li>
            <li>Cleaning is a breeze, just hold under tap faucet, optionally using sonic vibration to clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Gives a clean shave&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver for my husband, he like the speed and the clean cut.</li>
            <li>what I dislike,will not shave clean under the nose area.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had the display tell me I need to clean it yet, but I have.  </li>
            <li>I appreciate the fact that it is waterproof (it is easier to clean it by just passing it under the water)</li>
            <li>to clean (because it can be run under the water)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For convenience and ease of memory I simply clean it every time it needs to be recharged</li>
            <li>Get something like this that you can just clean off in the shower/sink.</li>
            <li>You do have to replace the outer foils and inner blades about once a year to keep getting a good smooth shave with no tugging and as of the time of this post you can buy the replacement foil/blade set - Panasonic WES9013PC - for about $34.</li>
            <li>Gives a clean, close shave.</li>
            <li>This is the best for a young teen with acne.  </li>
            <li>As a &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; razor I clean it with liquid soap and rinse it under running water in the sink.</li>
            <li>After joining the police force, I&#x27;m required to have a clean shave.</li>
            <li>However, dry, it worked great.  </li>
            <li>and I can shave in the shower and clean it under water.</li>
            <li>I take the head apart and brush clean all the blades and foils.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is far better than my many Brauns, Norelcos, erc.</li>
            <li>He is pleased with it and shaves more frequently than before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only owned it 6 weeks or so, but so far it&#x27;s the best, closest shaving electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned--</li>
            <li>overall well worth the cost and a great product.</li>
            <li>I use a disposable razor to clean up what the Panasonic misses.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many Panasonic shavers, they all worked great, but this one stopped working after a few shaves.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend for one who are expecting clean shave.</li>
            <li>and you can rinse it clean under running water.</li>
            <li>It gives a close, clean shave and is a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li>really quiet - works good - recharges quickly - comfortable - blades</li>
            <li>The shaves are great, even on wet/very dry skin.</li>
            <li>so you can clean it with one hand</li>
            <li>Clean shaven every day.  </li>
            <li>Clean up is a snap.</li>
            <li>Braun&#x27;s has a cleaning cradle and some nice touches, but actually this one became my favorite after one day&#x27;s use.  </li>
            <li>wash/ clean up&lt;br /&gt;light and durable&lt;</li>
            <li>Now I get that you don&#x27;t have to clean it every day</li>
            <li>I like the automatic \\&quot;clean\\&quot; icon and the sonic cleaning mode, which make it the easiest shaver to clean that I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>It dry shaves great.</li>
            <li>Not the shavers fault, but, now I get to clean my sink whenever my son shaves.</li>
            <li>like the speed and turbo cleaning with soap,keep&#x27;s the shaver really clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Super-easy to clean,</li>
            <li>Husband has Alzheimers and because he can&#x27;t remember to clean shavers, he thinks they always need replacement.  </li>
            <li>Seems the older I get, the more easy I get nicks from razors, so decided to go to a shaver.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes longer to get a clean shave and the bulkiness doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>He did say he has to &#x27;get used to it&#x27; and had to stretch and pull this skin to get a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>I have Parkinson&#x27;s and still stuck in the life-long habit of being clean shaven.</li>
            <li>but I like that I can clean it and rinse it with soap under water.</li>
            <li>It also is a snap to clean it when needed.</li>
            <li>I have to look in the mirror, use the trimmer to shorten them, and then clean it up.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like scrubs or a beard and like to have the clean shaved look since it matches with my personality.</li>
            <li>Like the display that tells you what the charge level is and when it&#x27;s time to clean the shaver.  </li>
            <li>so I wanted an electric razor for the &amp;#34;final clean up.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>It feels good when shaving, no dry skin or burn.</li>
            <li>It charges SUPER fast, and is very very very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Shaving has always aggravated it, but so does not shaving, as my skin is also very sensitive to my own beard.  </li>
            <li>It is working out very nice for me when the beard gets too long for my razor.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and most were positive so that helped me decided to buy this model.  </li>
            <li>I use the lemon pre-shave oil from \\&quot;The Art of Shaving\\&quot; and cannot be more positive.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy this shaver after I had read all the positive reviews here on Amazon, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>Just 3 blades but high RPM and very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>After the very first shave my wife immediately noticed how smooth I felt.  </li>
            <li>The Amazon price was the best I found and at the time I purchased the Panasonic there was a $10 rebate being offered so the final price was pretty reasonable.</li>
            <li>since Remington and Norelco pretty much exclusively concentrate their product development efforts on personal care technology like shavers, you&#x27;d think they make the best ones,</li>
            <li>Clean up is easy and has a battery meter right on it.</li>
            <li>Right out of the package, I thought it felt cheap and sounded cheap while shaving, but it is durable and cuts well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, fits comfortably in my hand and provides a pretty close shave.</li>
            <li>It more than meets my needs and recharges pretty quickly as well.</li>
            <li>It holds a good long charge, too, and is easy to wield.</li>
            <li>Really it does a fine job!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this shaver, it charges very fast and leaves a very clean shave no matter how much hair you have.</li>
            <li>No electric razor is as good as a blade, but at 2.5 bucks a blade (geeez!), this baby has paid for itself at least three times over (and more like four).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Quiet, does a great job (maybe because my old razor was so old and dull by comparison--but this is WONDERFUL), charges quickly, easy to clean, and wet/dry</li>
            <li>Charges much more quickly (30 minutes) than my older Norelco and cleans easily too.  </li>
            <li>Good in the sense that as the blades aren&#x27;t super sharp its very kind on my skin (which is a bonus considering I have sensitive skin).    </li>
            <li>It has a nice feel in your hand, lightweight and makes a high pitch wine when turned on, it&#x27;s pretty neat!    </li>
            <li>Nothing special or super-duper.</li>
            <li>Ya, I still have to scribble certain areas of my face to get  the closeness I desire, but, the comfort of the shave itself is much better and leaves my face feeling quite refreshed afterward.</li>
            <li>: I almost never shave up when using my blade unless special occasion-</li>
            <li>- it doesn&#x27;t seem to make sense to buy a shaver with the special cleaning apparatus that you need to put cartridges into.</li>
            <li>It also needed more than one shot at certain areas, but that was what I was hoping to avoid.</li>
            <li>No matter how many times I pass over certain areas of my neck, this shaver just does not pick up the hairs.  </li>
            <li>but not any thing special</li>
            <li>It uses liquid soap and water and cleans itself with a special turbo mode.</li>
            <li>recommend this to anyone, unless you&#x27;re looking for that &#x27;special&#x27; gift to your father in law.</li>
            <li>All of the reviews were right!</li>
            <li>A switch on the Braun shaver broke off right out of the box: plastic!  </li>
            <li>I am happy with this shaver, it cut closed and clean.</li>
            <li>- this one give a good clean shave, and is comparatively quiet; for about $80, seems a no brainer.</li>
            <li>The end result is a fast clean smooth shave every time!</li>
            <li>You can also take it in the shower and clean with soft soap, which is nice.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic is a decent shaver, a much more high-tech and precise instrument compared to the Remington.</li>
            <li>Near-perfect smoothness with no irritation, redness, or bumps.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that I get the best shave by using very, very light pressure on the initial passes while keeping the machine perpendicular to the area being shaved, and then gradually pressing just a bit harder while varying the angle of the shaving head.</li>
            <li>So I was able to move on to the main contender, the \\&quot;Panasonic\\&quot; with Panasonic technology!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially nice to prep my scalp for shaving by going over those pesky areas that are hard to get at with the blade.</li>
            <li>It charges very fast and is easy to clean.      </li>
            <li>He has tried many of the more expensive razors and he is always complaining that they don&#x27;t do a very good job.  </li>
            <li>(so I went ahead and bought 2) :P, still a bit over the top for a &#x60;shaver&#x27;, but, even on the low end they have been priced at over $150 and on the high end, over $500.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reliable, portable, comfortable, high quality, and super easy to clean / super easy to replace the foil and blade.</li>
            <li>The ergonomic design is very comfortable to hold and the foil head follows the contours of my face every bit as good as the triple floating head design I previously used.</li>
            <li>sure the Panasonic Arc 4 is an amazing product but is the extra blade worth $50?</li>
            <li>Edge trim is pretty basic as well and doesn&#x27;t do that great a job.</li>
            <li>Shaves cleanly and closely with no irriration,  Easily cleaned by running hot tap water on cutter head.</li>
            <li>The ES8109S is great, if you are willing to spend the extra $50 - $70 for the drying dock, but not a necessity.  </li>
            <li>It shaves super close to my skin, has an LCD to indicate how full the charge is, and lets me know when I need to clean it.</li>
            <li>in my first shave, it felt so smooth &amp; light that I thought it was not working</li>
            <li>THIS IS A GREAT SHAVER YOU CAN SHAVE IN THE SHOWER OR WHERE EVER DONT WORRY ABOUT GETTING IT WET</li>
            <li>in all I&#x27;d say this was definitely worth the price, and I&#x27;m overall very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this was definitely worth the price, and I&#x27;m overall very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>I liked the first razor so much I bought another one for my house upstate.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery life seems pretty good so far.</li>
            <li>The ES8109S is great, if you are willing to spend the extra $50 - $70 for the drying dock, but not a necessity.</li>
            <li>This machine is very satisfying, I use it generally when I drive to office in a car.</li>
            <li>Really a great product and still working great a few months later.</li>
            <li>I thought the wet shave would be great.  </li>
            <li>It greatly reduces drag and allows the shaver to do its job easier.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I took much more than 3x the time to shave as with my wife&#x27;s and 1.5x as long as my own norelco.  </li>
            <li>It is a joy to shave in the shower, when your beard is wet, it works like a charm.</li>
            <li>This model is a great price point, and it works fine, though I wouldn&#x27;t go for one that has a speed of less than 13,000 (which is what this model has).  </li>
            <li>More like 1 week&#x27;s worth of shaves (3x/week) which is pretty sub-standard.&lt;br /&gt;-Need</li>
            <li>More like 1 week&#x27;s worth of shaves (3x/week) which is pretty sub-standard.&lt;br /&gt;-Need</li>
            <li>Bought it for the ability to get it wet(use sensitive skin shaving cream) which is a nice option</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d like to think that it&#x27;s true with this one.</li>
            <li>Definitely does not shave as good as a razor blade.</li>
            <li>liked my old Braun better.&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic</li>
            <li>Panasonic is faster, cuts whiskers closer, and is not painful (as the rotary shaver was to my skin).</li>
            <li>As with most electrics has a real problem getting under your jaw line.  </li>
            <li>The swivel ability of the shaving head also is a nice improvement from my old razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives a very close shave, more when shaving against the grain.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d probably replace it at full price if I had to.</li>
            <li>Also the reviews for the current Brauns are not that good.</li>
            <li>Works well with shaving around a full beard and mustache.  </li>
            <li>I was in the market for a rotary shaver, but read some very marginal reviews of them, including Norelco&#x27;s latest product.  </li>
            <li>I found that both shavers did a relatively good job overall.  </li>
            <li>With a safety razor, I could go a full day plus.</li>
            <li>I still spend a good 5 minutes shaving, about the same as the circular triple-head units I have used before, but this one shaves a bit closer.  </li>
            <li>I recommend you spend the extra money to get a good shaver, but no need to get a ton of fancy features.  </li>
            <li>At 77 years old, I do not have a difficlut beard but no matter how I lathered, or how many passes I made, I could not get anyway near the close shave of my good-&#x27;ole Remingtons plus the ES8103 irritated my face.</li>
            <li>I would have preferred a full size trimmer.</li>
            <li>but it was good enough for when I needed to look semi-presentable in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t ever let your razor get filled with days/weeks worth of whiskers, foam, lotions, etc.</li>
            <li>and it cut bear deep inside, which is a good point.</li>
            <li>but really is true.</li>
            <li>It shaves nicely and I have no complaints thus far.</li>
            <li>The blades and outer foil are supposed to last a year, but are fairly inexpensive to replace even if they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>For the price, this is one sweet razor.  </li>
            <li>for a full charge.  </li>
            <li>I still find myself quickly going over my neck area with my Fusion razor when I want to get a close clean shave on my neck.</li>
            <li>The Fusion or Proglide shave is much superior but at the exhorbonant price per blade using a good quality razor such as this Panasonic (especially at the discounted price paid) is both an acceptable tradeoff and</li>
            <li>It gives a nice close shave without any irritation (he has sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>The trimmer on the back works surprisingly well for an edge up or rouge hairs.</li>
            <li>The ES8103 charges to full capacity in 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Battery is good enough for about 4 shaves.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, just to be fair, the product seemed well built and solid.</li>
            <li>It is the only one I&#x27;ve owned that does a good job on neck hairs.  </li>
            <li>Very affordable and has many features.  </li>
            <li>Actually, having switched to razor for three weeks, I realized how much I loved the ES8103S and had started taking it for granted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve still never found a shaver that does as well as a blade, but this shaver is pretty much the best I&#x27;ve used in a long time.  </li>
            <li>Good ratings in CU especially at this price.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be a good shaver with all the features at a very middle of the road price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good shaver, provide close shave, only thing I don&#x27;t like about</li>
            <li>The clean, quick performance makes shaving a breeze.</li>
            <li>You cannot shave in three minutes; it takes about the same time to shave with a Panasonic as it does with any good electric shaver ... about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Good production the same as description.</li>
            <li>He is very well pleased with his gift &amp; the Price at the time, one just could not beat it.  </li>
            <li>I usually own modest priced shavers.</li>
            <li>I have tried various electric shavers over the years and NEVER found a one to be really as good as shaving creme and a Gillette Razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also good for mid day touch ups.</li>
            <li>It does a good enough job to get me through the day.</li>
            <li>This reasonably priced shaver has all the performance of the more costly versions with \\&quot;drying</li>
            <li>But that is true of any electric that I have tried, so that is just par for the course.</li>
            <li>In a short, it&#x27;s a good shaver.</li>
            <li>Time wise, this shaver will take about the same time as shaving with a blade-</li>
            <li>The charge hold well and it does a good job with multiple growth levels.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that any electric shaver is efficient like a regular razor, but for this price I shouldn&#x27;t have to go over my leg five times in order to get a good cut.</li>
            <li>I guess Electric razors are only good for getting missed hair after shaving in the shower.</li>
            <li>Shaves quickly and cleanly.  </li>
            <li>Charges fast and the charge lasts through many shaves.</li>
            <li>The only good thing is that the 8103S is quieter.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>Plus the trimmer is full sized and works, unlike the Remington which has a &#x27;toy trimmer&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Panasonic ES8103S (Arc 3) is an overall good shaver for the price.</li>
            <li>Fully charges in about 2 hours and a full charge will give you about 60-90 minutes of shaving.  </li>
            <li>i really don&#x27;t know when i need a replacement will i be able to find it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had and the least I&#x27;ve ever paid for one.  </li>
            <li>If he comes home shaved next time, I&#x27;ll know it was a good deal.</li>
            <li>But it is good enough.  </li>
            <li>A full charge takes about 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Love the speed and the battery really doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;fade&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>With this straight line, apparently it&#x27;s SO much better.</li>
            <li>Recharge time is short, dual voltage good for intl travel.</li>
            <li>Charge last a long time, easy to clean, also very attractive design.  </li>
            <li>Provides a very close shave though i notice the curved hear may require more passes to hit all of the areas.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  quick and clean.</li>
            <li>and I get about 10 shaves on a full charge</li>
            <li>This is not a bad shaver at all; just know that you won&#x27;t get 14 shaves on a full charge.</li>
            <li>He did not want to use disposables, and I wanted a good quality product with all-in-one options to take care of his facial grooming needs.</li>
            <li>If you want to take a chance with this product, I recommend you buy it from a store that has a more reasonable return policy...</li>
            <li>I decided to go back to using an electric after years of using a blade after getting a good deal on the Panasonic</li>
            <li>Plug it in for about an hour to get a full charge</li>
            <li>If you have a full beard you will need to work at shaving with the shaver</li>
            <li>Snap the head back on, and you&#x27;re good to</li>
            <li>Good for several shaves.  </li>
            <li>This is true of your electric razor or throwaway razor.</li>
            <li>I get 8-10 three minute shaves out of a full charge.</li>
            <li>I liked that this one could be used wet/dry, but it wasn&#x27;t as close of a shave as I had been used to with my old razor.</li>
            <li>Overall this shaver is good for the $70 price, so with the price factored in I&#x27;ll give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, for those with a protruding jawline, you will need to stretch your skin quite a bit to be able to get into those corners, whereas some shavers, regardless of expense, can do a much nicer job of this.  </li>
            <li>Seeing people say they are not as good as regular razors.</li>
            <li>I have noticed it does need to be brushed out every day in order to keep a good performance</li>
            <li>/&gt;The build could be better, but for $90 I really have no complaints.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This shaver does seem to get good reviews, so it&#x27;s obviously working well for some guys.</li>
            <li>It charges for a good 12 shaves in only 40 minutes.</li>
            <li>Still good value for the money and a solid machine that keeps on going.</li>
            <li>I went from a full beard to a close shave and had reservations as to the ability of this razor.  </li>
            <li>OVERALL A FAIRLY GOOD SHAVER FOR THE PRICE.</li>
            <li>NEED FULL CHARGE FOR AN EFFICIENT SHAVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I get about 10 shaves per charge, though I do have a full beard and</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised how effective the shaver is around the mouth/chin area.  </li>
            <li>: Quiet, good close shave,</li>
            <li>But I have to shave for a while and it seems just good enough on that front...</li>
            <li>the battery between %30 and %80 full</li>
            <li>Whether you think 5 years is a good run or not is up to individual opinion.</li>
            <li>blades will last about a year for a good shave.</li>
            <li>The shave is not as close as it gets with a razor, but definitely good enough.</li>
            <li>I used to look at people on TV and in movies and feel I could never be as cool as they are.</li>
            <li>i was told the the shave is never as good as i can get with a regular razor</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;the shave is not as good as a regular razor</li>
            <li>Would have been nice to include some type of stand to use while charging (my old mode charged inductively).  </li>
            <li>I considered several razors, but selected the Panasonic ES8103S -- and I am delighted that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes the Noreloc cost more but shaving is so much easier.</li>
            <li>No fooling around with blades, shave cream, sink full of water, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands and this one I really like.  </li>
            <li>The shaver is good for a morning or evening touch ups but doesn&#x27;t get as close as a razor especially on the neck area.</li>
            <li>This is a cool feature.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s true with every shaver I&#x27;ve tried thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good quality product that will last.</li>
            <li>am also satisfying about the battery I use it in my cars and its battery good enough whole week.</li>
            <li>I purchased this given the recommendation from The Sweet Home.  </li>
            <li>My husband really likes this shaver but he doesn&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li>so maybe if you don&#x27;t let your stubble grow much it will do better.</li>
            <li>, I feel this model is a sweet spot for value and performance and</li>
            <li>Strengths:&lt;br /&gt;*Very fast charge to 100%; better than advertised.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, its a good razor.</li>
            <li>It is definitely a good product, but I am gonna review it somehow different!</li>
            <li>If I forget, a 5 minute charge would give me one full shave  </li>
            <li>Neither shaved or held up well, despite the specific models getting good reviews/ratings here and in \\&quot;a well known consumer magazine\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I finally decided to dump those brands after reading that Panasonic and Braun were superior.</li>
            <li>Numerous websites gave this Panasonic model a good review for a value shaver.  </li>
            <li>Good solid feel.  </li>
            <li>Quick and clean.</li>
            <li>only good on one.</li>
            <li>I get about 7 shaves from one full charge.  </li>
            <li>It is closer, the motor is faster, and the battery lasts much longer - one charge lasts more than two weeks even after use of almost two years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does not irritate my skin as much as the Norelcos that I have used for many years.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this Panasonic wet/dry rechargeable electric razor.</li>
            <li>Not as good as regular razor.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much knowledge about electric shave but after comparing many products, I chose this one.</li>
            <li>Battery is good for a week if fully charge and with indicator showing % left.</li>
            <li>I was not terrible on my skin, but was still a bit rashy after the shave much like the newer model phillips/norelco.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I am not getting nearly as much inflamed acne anymore caused by irritation, mostly just hormonal acne now.</li>
            <li>full charge lasts me about 6-8 shaves, but I also take longer to shave than what the instructions recommend, which is just 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Charges quickly and is fairly easily to clean.</li>
            <li>Even after a full shave the battery is still at 100%</li>
            <li>overall a good buy for $60</li>
            <li>This is absolutely true.  </li>
            <li>love the battery display and shaves very well.</li>
            <li>Still works good after several years of use.</li>
            <li>It gives a very close shave, infact better than a manual razor.  </li>
            <li>OK is about as much as I care to contribute now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still the same well built shaver, good quality.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Really, I would expect a better build quality.</li>
            <li>value overall, I think, and it looks good, too.</li>
            <li>I read that this one gives a much smoother shave than Remington, even though Remington works better in the neck area.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s twice as quiet , another good feature</li>
            <li>Did not do a good job,so sent it back.</li>
            <li>even though I recently bought a replacement foil and blades I have not replaced them as I am still getting as good a shave</li>
            <li>Does reasonably good job especially when used with shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>and I love it as much as the 5 blade model.</li>
            <li>I mostly use clippers, but they sometimes leave too much hair</li>
            <li>A full charge holds for 5-6 FULL shaves.</li>
            <li>The price for the Panasonic was not bad for the quality at all.</li>
            <li>Each shave uses around 7% of the charge, which is not bad at all.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>This item is not bad at all.</li>
            <li>It does not pull or irritate my sensitive skin, its pretty good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it is not a bad electronic shaver thingy.</li>
            <li>But not bad..</li>
            <li>I know some people can not go that route, so this is not a bad alternative.  </li>
            <li>This one is not bad, but requires soaping and dis-assembly into separate parts.</li>
            <li>have no bad points about this iteam</li>
            <li>For the money, it&#x27;s not a bad product.</li>
            <li>in all, not a bad purchase, and I would do it again.  </li>
            <li>But not a bad shaver.</li>
            <li>The battery was wearing out on that so instead of investing in a new foil I decided to get something new, Very happy with it so far!</li>
            <li>the charge easily lasts 2 weeks (maybe more as I haven&#x27;t really paid that much attention which means it&#x27;s not annoying).  </li>
            <li>Boy, was he glad right from the first use.</li>
            <li>Light weight, shaves VERY close, clean-up is easy</li>
            <li>/&gt;This shaver is fast, smooth, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Wanted a shaver that&#x27;s easy on the skin, easy to handle, doesn&#x27;t overheat, doesn&#x27;t burn, and gets the job done decently.  </li>
            <li>This shaver left tons of irritation, cuts and was super time consuming and didn&#x27;t even do a good job.</li>
            <li>Price was good and provides better performance than the brand I was using previously.</li>
            <li>: FAST, perfect shave in less than 3 min (including goatee trimming)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does a good job, certainly better than the brand I was using previously.</li>
            <li>PRETTY COOL!</li>
            <li>I should mention, however, that I have a very light beard, both in color and in density, and therefore don&#x27;t need a particularly close shave.</li>
            <li>and it wades right and gets things smooth.</li>
            <li>have a light beard and this shaver doesn&#x27;t just cut right through.  </li>
            <li>The shave from the Panasonic isn&#x27;t as good as a new disposable blade, but it&#x27;s pretty close and is a lot better then an old used blade!  </li>
            <li>So, in conclusion, wet shaving with a blade might be better with a cream, and wet shaving with an electric Panasonic seems fine, plus it makes a pleasant humming noise to indicate that your hairs are being ground up effectively (use them as fertilizer).</li>
            <li>It shaves me closer than a razor blade and pretty easy on the skin also.</li>
            <li>The only suggestion I would make is be sure to clean the razor thoroughly after each use and it will perform even better than razors selling for three times the cost.</li>
            <li>Change the foil every year and the blade every 2 years according to the manufacturer/ and that said you can have many many years of high quality fast electric</li>
            <li>Other than those two things I liked everything else, it was very easy to clean, built well, nice battery display, and most important little to no irritation.</li>
            <li>What a great shaver, I should have ordered the new blades &amp; foil several months ago, but it still shaves very well, it will just be more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Good clean shave, long charge, no complaints.</li>
            <li>Right away you will notice a very positive feature: the ES8103s charges very quickly, going from 0% to fully charged in about an hour.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am quite happy with it and would certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li>This electric shaver is exactly what I was looking for: 1) economical, 2)efficient, 3) easy to clean &amp; maintain,</li>
            <li>Other than the fact that the shave is not that great</li>
            <li>But other then that it works great.</li>
            <li>Amazon seems to be having problemss with their order processing and delivery lately as I experienced on this and other orders (which has caused me to start shopping elsewhere), but that is another issue unrelated to this shaver.</li>
            <li>great razor just a overpriced 80 bucks for something that should be going for around 40 other</li>
            <li>I love gadgets - so she thought it would be a great birthday gift - within the first few years our marriage.  </li>
            <li>After reading the reviews, I was excited that electric razors might finally be worth using.  </li>
            <li>Bought this due to all of the great ratings but when my husband tried to shave it did not even shave is stubble.  </li>
            <li>Works good and the battery actually last a good long time.</li>
            <li>I had better results than all the others, but not quite as good as a standard razor; however, no razor burn which I normally have problems with regardless of the razor.  </li>
            <li>This one does a good job on the neck, you have to work it a little more because lets face it</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a good razor and it performs better than the flatter-faced Norelco I was using before, but it does take a little getting used to.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic works the best: close shaving, fast, and comfortable;   The Braun also works well, though the noise is a little too loud;   The Norelco gives close shaving, but would leave me with some razor burn most of the times after shaving.    </li>
            <li>Although I always dry shave, it&#x27;s nice that you can use it in the shower and clean it easily without worrying about water damage/rust.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic has a nice wide trimmer for longer hair, and the shaver makes for a smooth easy shave.</li>
            <li>Powerful and clean effect.</li>
            <li>He said it shaves very close and is super easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>electric shaver is super convenient to use, and gives a shave almost as close as the mach3.  </li>
            <li>It charges quickly and I can about a week of use before needing to charge again.</li>
            <li>First time elctric shave user, great product, long life battery</li>
            <li>For a decade or more I stuck with one of the classic block-shaped Remington shavers.</li>
            <li>Quick charging time - goes from 0% to 100% in about an hour for me.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>It made quick work of my beard which I tend to let go 3 to 4 days.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was quick, and was everything I hoped for in a shaver for my head.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used most everything over the years, including a number of Remingtons, 2 Brauns, Gillette razors (blades), and, most recently, 3 different Norelcos.    </li>
            <li>i was lucky to get three shaves from old(8 mths) panasonic.  </li>
            <li>ES8103S is the best shaver I&#x27;ve owned, WITHOUT being the most expensive.  </li>
            <li>I would pay more for the same shaver that was built better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick.</li>
            <li>That said,this thing charges up extremely quickly.</li>
            <li>Shaves close and recharges quickly.  </li>
            <li>Most of the reviews will say the same thing, and there&#x27;s nothing more I can say that hasn&#x27;t been said.  </li>
            <li>It is an updated version of an older model which I had for many years.  </li>
            <li>but it does charge quickly.  </li>
            <li>Before I have been a loyal customer to Philips equipment.</li>
            <li>I would not buy Panasonice again, I might rather stay loyal with Philips.</li>
            <li>It gives a very close shave and is easy to clean without a cleaning dock.</li>
            <li>If you stop off at home for a shave and quick change before an appointment or occasion and the battery is drained, you will need a backup razor or have to show up unshaven...</li>
            <li>A more comfortable shave than my 15 year old Braun.  </li>
            <li>I like this for a quick once over when needed or when I don&#x27;t feel like getting all lathered up.</li>
            <li>The charge is quick @ ~1hr</li>
            <li>My latest, the ES8103 (the product currently reviewed), does not fare much better.  </li>
            <li>Interestingly the difference in the quality of the actual shave is more incremental then one would imagine when comparing the two shavers.</li>
            <li>Wow...had an older electric razor that was top rated some years ago.  </li>
            <li>It charges super quick, and the charge lasts longer than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had been using an older Panasonic wet-dry shaver for many years.</li>
            <li>It does shave well and close, but it is not as quick as others here have stated.</li>
            <li>It charges up quickly ( 1 hour).</li>
            <li>This gives a quick close shave.</li>
            <li>Two days growth can be handled fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried shaving wet with the Panasonic yet, but it will be nice to be able to shave in the shower.</li>
            <li>Quick charge</li>
            <li>I use this razor with shaving cream for a wet shave and it is by far the smoothest and best shave</li>
            <li>Recharges quickly.</li>
            <li>Charges quickly.</li>
            <li>Panasonic ES8103S will serve best for a last minute touch-up, rather than the regular morning shave.  </li>
            <li>I ordered it and got it in about 4 days with the Super Saver shipping.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I shave whenever I want, as I work from home</li>
            <li>if I&#x27;m lucky).  </li>
            <li>Holds a charge quite a while, and recharges quickly.</li>
            <li>I have been a loyal Braun user for decades.</li>
            <li>Next time I will pay more for a better shaver.</li>
            <li>Oh, well I guess a perfect product is more expensive.</li>
            <li>Charges up quickly.</li>
            <li>Like the readout of the percentage remaining and how quickly it charges.  </li>
            <li>Using this for quick leg touch-ups</li>
            <li>I was getting older 70, I needed something better and easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>The charging is quick</li>
            <li>Never found an electric razor that would do an adequate job.</li>
            <li>charges quickly</li>
            <li>Returned it quickly.</li>
            <li>Recharges quickly, blade and screen lasts about three years.</li>
            <li>Battery drains quickly too but recharges quick as well.</li>
            <li>I am sure most electric razors with this technology will have the same result.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stay with my razor blades for now (habit, I suppose), but will be using the Panasonic ES8103S more and more, especially when I travel.</li>
            <li>It recharges quickly.</li>
            <li>Charges quick.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully the battery does not wear out too quickly.  </li>
            <li>It charges quickly.</li>
            <li>All the others I&#x27;ve used have also died dismayingly quickly.</li>
            <li>The wider trimmer that slid straight up on the ES8097 was far superior.</li>
            <li>This is an absolutely tremendous instrument.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a month now - needed all that time to familiarize myself adequately -</li>
            <li>Took a chance having good success with prior Panasonic shaving products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And with quick shipment.</li>
            <li>The charge lasts fora week and recharges quickly, as advertised.</li>
            <li>Overall this has been a great purchase and at this point much cheaper than going with Gillette&#x27;s overpriced cartridges.</li>
            <li>thought was quickly followed up by: &amp;#34;Oh</li>
            <li>Charges quickly and the charge lasts for days.  </li>
            <li>Much better than my older one.</li>
            <li>Charges quick and holds</li>
            <li>The foil has been remarkably durable, more so than the remington micro foil shavers I had in the past.</li>
            <li>Hoping it would be really quick once it is set well.</li>
            <li>This one seemed sturdier and to have overall better reviews than most of the designed-for-women shavers</li>
            <li>Great shaver, recharges fast (in about 1 hour at 220V) but the LCD display is dying with segments disappearing only after 6 months of use.</li>
            <li>It shaves cleanly, quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>It works very well and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I cleaned the foil and blades daily, with soap and warm water (and sometimes rubbing alcohol), and lubricated them with light mineral oil (baby oil).</li>
            <li>This shaver is lightweight and charges quickly.</li>
            <li>The noise level was acceptable and the shaver charged quickly.</li>
            <li>For the money, this product performs an adequate job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast, light, and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Charges quickly and lasts for about 6 shaves on one charge.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it in the shower but it is nice being able to wash it off and wet it to shave with.</li>
            <li>Quick Charge.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband he has told me several times how much he loves its and how great it works</li>
            <li>QUICK.  </li>
            <li>Like most electrics, it definitely gives a better shave on me when not in the shower (does work if that&#x27;s what you are in to).  </li>
            <li>Gives a quick and close shave.  </li>
            <li>I got a closer shave with this razor than I have ever had with an electric and it charged quickly.</li>
            <li>area!&lt;br /&gt;- quick charging&lt;br</li>
            <li>If he spends a lot of time shaving then he gets a super close shave, but even spending 5 minutes</li>
            <li>I like this razor as a quick get up and go shaver.</li>
            <li>It took me about 3 weeks to get the hang of getting some of the spots like under my neck but after that it has been a joy to use and much easier on my face than a regular razor.</li>
            <li>It charges from 0 to 100% rather quickly.</li>
            <li>Charges quickly.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean and cleans up very well.</li>
            <li>It charges rather quickly.</li>
            <li>One will need to perfect their technique since all razors are different but pulling the facial hair against the grain will make it easier for the blades to bite.</li>
            <li>Fairly quick.  </li>
            <li>Fairly quick charge.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, charges quickly, display battery power and have a turbo cleaning mode.  </li>
            <li>, I am completely stunned by how good this unit gets your whiskers off, much closer than Norelco</li>
            <li>a quick update....to get the best possible shave I try to keep the charge at 70% or above and remove the shaving head and brush beard remnants from around the cutters once a week.  </li>
            <li>I would call the battery life extraordinary.</li>
            <li>Super shipping</li>
            <li>On the plus side, it does recharge quickly, and keeps shaving for a couple of weeks before it needs another charge.  </li>
            <li>Quick charging and holds a charge longer than any razor I have owned.</li>
            <li>This shaver also recharges super quick.</li>
            <li>So easy to clean, the wet/dry feature is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>My Remington died and I quickly got on Amazon.com and picked this Panasonic brand.</li>
            <li>however whenever I need a quick shave to tun out somewhere</li>
            <li>The batter lasts for 4-5 shaves and recharges quickly.</li>
            <li>was getting a bit slow and not doing that good of a job and since that model which I liked was no longer being made</li>
            <li>It recharges quickly.  </li>
            <li>I get a close shave quickly.</li>
            <li>What I do expect is for the electric shaver to do an adequate job on off days</li>
            <li>It charges quickly and for those stubborn whiskers that don&#x27;t want to get zapped (the ones beside the throat)</li>
            <li>I was expecting a close, quick, and stubble-free shave.</li>
            <li>is quick.</li>
            <li>battery is amazing for me, I have light amounts of facial hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;Efficient - It does the job quickly.  </li>
            <li>Gentle on my husband&#x27;s skin, easy to use, and delivers a clean and close shave.</li>
            <li>a quick 5 min charge is possible.&lt;br /&gt;-Nice</li>
            <li>/&gt;We couldn&#x27;t afford the (Arc5), I believe it was rated as Best &amp; most expensive.</li>
            <li>, this one came on sale so I could afford it, &amp; I snatched it up quick like too!&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>I have managed to drop mine twice while cleaning it (luckily without damage).  </li>
            <li>Works well enough, gives me a razor smooth shave and is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>remaining, nice little popup trimmer, easy to clean, charges fast, good grip--pretty much everything I could expect in a razor.  </li>
            <li>I could not be happier with this product and highly recommend it :).</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this model, I can&#x27;t see spending any more than the cost of this shaver, even though there are newer models out there.</li>
            <li>But this shaver has so many high reviews for a reason.</li>
            <li>A very reasonably priced.move smoothly across the skin.</li>
            <li>At this time, I highly recommended this shaver to those who have many side burns and neck hairs like me.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend giving this razor a try because if it works for you I think you will love it.</li>
            <li>It has high quality and better style.</li>
            <li>Being able to use it in the shower is highly recommended when shopping for a shaver.  </li>
            <li>I have used a Panasonic shaver in the past and it was very good.  </li>
            <li>By contrast, the first shave with this model was amazingly close and the high-speed motor is pleasantly smooth, though the high-pitched sound is reminiscent of a buzzing wasp.</li>
            <li>razor shaves very mild hair adequately, but not thick or filled  areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was very well pleased with this Panasonic shaver right from the start.  </li>
            <li>According to CR and my own expierence, foil shavers shave a little closer, Norelcos are a bit more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Very nice and lives up to all the ratings provided by other reviewers.  </li>
            <li>the instructions say to give it 2 weeks for your face to get used to the unit, and they are pretty accurate.</li>
            <li>I bought my first Panasonic shaver about seven years ago and have become a huge fan.</li>
            <li>The first shaves were comfortable but not too close.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure this one will last the same, great quality.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased</li>
            <li>I recently bought Panasonic ES8103S and very pleased with the closeness and comfort.</li>
            <li>I finally purchased the Panasonic and am very pleased.</li>
            <li>It generates a noticeably higher pitched sound than any electric shaver I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>However, the Panasonic performed slightly better on the flat cheek areas whereas the Norelco did slightly better on the curved areas around the jaw bone and neck.  </li>
            <li>Overall I have been very pleased and recommended it to my son-in-law.</li>
            <li>If it holds up, then I will be very satisfied with this shaver, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>the very first shave this shaver</li>
            <li>Some electric razor really are noisy, but this on hums so fast, it sounds like a bee buzzing or an electric tooth brush instead of like a barbers clippers like most razors sound.</li>
            <li>and so I listened to some friends and bought the Norelco rotary type (2 0f them), from the very first</li>
            <li>It is light in weight, feels good in the hand, holds a charge well, and tells you how much charge you have left.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with its first performance test: zero discomfort, very efficient and a really close shave too.  </li>
            <li>The pitch of the sound it makes is also much higher.  </li>
            <li>, time consuming.will not want to recommend this, better to use the normal blade.</li>
            <li>Fits the hand well, provides a close shave (although multiple passes help insure this),has excellent battery life and clearly shows how much charge remains.</li>
            <li>Just replaced the blades because it wasn&#x27;t as smooth as when I first got it.</li>
            <li>Very fast recharging (one hour maximum)!</li>
            <li>I have a pretty light beard, and I got used to how close the Norelco could shave without causing irritation.</li>
            <li>I purchased this razor knowing I like the other kind of head better</li>
            <li>so am finally pretty comfortable with it.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this razor for about 18 months and although in its first weeks its job was not that great, I can say that nowadays its performance has been pretty solid.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty light beard.  </li>
            <li>Great shaver so far - fast motor, fast charging time, upscale look and feel.</li>
            <li>First of all it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li>I received the product quickly as usual with amazon,and at an incredible price.</li>
            <li>THE MOST QUIET, SMOOTH, EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE SHAVE I HAVE EVER USED.</li>
            <li>If the noise (my biggest peeve) is not a problem, definitely a great buy (on sale, NOT worth $100+).</li>
            <li>The very first shave I did with this unit</li>
            <li>If you have a king tag on your face or neck and have to shave smooth every day, that is what you have to use exactly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it twice but am very pleased with the purchase.  </li>
            <li>Shaves are pretty close and smooth.</li>
            <li>Wash your face first or not, it&#x27;s so smooth.</li>
            <li>First impression of the Panasonic is the sound.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find the top of it can shave any where other than the face and neck effectively.</li>
            <li>Not so, first shave was painless, no redness, and surprisingly smooth.</li>
            <li>I received the product quickly as usual with amazon,and at an incredible price.</li>
            <li>If my dad says it is comfortable and valuable (also cheaper than higher level model)</li>
            <li>I bought both and the Panasonic is significantly cheaper, shaves better, and is no where near as noisy as the Braun.</li>
            <li>but so far I liked my old Norelco better</li>
            <li>As I said before, is not ss good for a long bear.  </li>
            <li>I hope it lasts a good long time.</li>
            <li>When I am done, I give it a good long rinse with the razor running.  </li>
            <li>what and own a shaver that might last me 20-30 years if I took really good care of it.&lt;br /&gt;I found one corded only powered shaver made by Norelco for about $30</li>
            <li>The Remingtons do the best job shaving my fairly heavy beard, and their trimmers are nice and wide for a bit of a trim around the ears.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s asking himself why has he waited so long to use a good product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cuts close, visible charge content, able to alternate between fixed &amp; floating head, good trimmer&lt;</li>
            <li>I used this shaver yesterday for the first time and no irritation at all, super close shave, and very powerful motor.</li>
            <li>Nice use left display and tells when to clean it.  </li>
            <li>I mixed my own cleaning solution for some time until I saw this razor that you clean by throwing some liquid soap on it and rinsing it off.</li>
            <li>Really appreciated the ability to use for water cleaning which is quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I never really got a good shave and needed to manually clean up my neck with a handheld razor.</li>
            <li>It fits in your hand nicely and makes a clean, close shave without having to go over and over the same spot.  </li>
            <li>Works great for people without a lot of facial hair, decent buy.</li>
            <li>decent battery life, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Your face adapts gradually until you get a fast, smooth and clean shave in one or two passes.  </li>
            <li>Currently owned an older model (ES7035) and was reasonably happy with it.</li>
            <li>The ultra-sonic cleaning feature (with the reminder to clean the blades when necessary) is handy.</li>
            <li>and the shave is great all the way down to 10% of battery charge.</li>
            <li>After reading (somewhere) foil razors shave closer (and are louder) than rotary, I researched up and down on for a great razor for under $100.</li>
            <li>With its original screen and cutter, I liked the Braun 1775 a little better as a shaver.  </li>
            <li>Although it was OK, the new Panasonic was a far superior shave with more comfort, less time and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>On the first shave it took a few extra minutes to find the best postions to hold it, but it gave a very clean and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>over three years old and going strong!</li>
            <li>It flips open from the back and looks nice, but it doesn&#x27;t really do that great of a job.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do the best job on soft neck hair, but with a little persistence you can get a perfectly clean shave.  </li>
            <li>Given how simple, yet powerful and useful it is (faster and more precise than a three-head rotary shaver for me.), I could not resist the super sale!</li>
            <li>but it is still way better than this new Panasonic piece of junk.</li>
            <li>Much better with new blades</li>
            <li>With a new head and blades, it can still rival the latest Panasonics.</li>
            <li>So, when it came time to purchase a new one, I thought I would try the new Braun with the \\&quot;odd-shaped\\&quot; holes in the screen that were supposed to give you the best possible shave because this screen captured the hairs from all angles.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m stunned how much better this feels than when my Braun was new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it more time and hoping that my beard will adjust and get used to the new shaver, so it can shave even closer.    </li>
            <li>I love this new shaver.  </li>
            <li>The shaver requires going over my face many times, may need new blades already?</li>
            <li>I love my new razor.  </li>
            <li>That said, the batter life is VERY good and when it&#x27;s down to 10% it lasts much longer than you would expect.</li>
            <li>here again the next time you buy&lt;br /&gt;Shaving is very comfortable, easy care</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the performance and the price was exceptional due to a limited time offer.</li>
            <li>Since I previously used a foil shaver, there was no \\&quot;adjustment period\\&quot;; it did not irritate my skin and it gives a great shave every time.</li>
            <li>: Easy to clean, very quick to charge (and so far it holds the charge pretty well)&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Anyway, this shaver still rocks, I just need to be less of a killer when using it, lol.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic had great reviews and was on sale half price.    </li>
            <li>I purchased this shaver on Amazon because I had had a previous Panasonic that had performed well, and the price was attractive.</li>
            <li>/&gt;inverter-charger plug adapter for the U.S. will use the current turkey must take&lt;br /&gt;state-machine charge is not trivial rather cheap does not shave habit of the previous machine was doing was being charged more beautiful bustled tried ..</li>
            <li>I have owned several electric shavers and this Panasonic ES8103S is FAIR at best in shaving my skins smooth in a few passes, when used daily..........</li>
            <li>a great product none the less.</li>
            <li>But those are minor issues considering the amazing shave and smooth skin that results.</li>
            <li>Overall I think it&#x27;s pretty good.    </li>
            <li>Although it takes multiple passes this razor cuts pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Fast close and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, either buy a higher level model or just a low end model which works as good as this one.</li>
            <li>Overall a pretty good deal for its price.</li>
            <li>Dry shaving is still good, but not as close.</li>
            <li>Very close shave, charge lasts for 8-10 shavings, easy to wash/clean.</li>
            <li>This shaver was delivered quickly and was worth even a longer wait.  </li>
            <li>Recharge time is quite quick, useful to know if you forget to recharge, as you can not shave with it while it is being recharged.  </li>
            <li>I considered returning it, but it is useful for trimming the nose and ear hair, I guess, or a quick non-shower shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just my neck hairs that are very resilient or if the shaver is not the greatest</li>
            <li>I have been using Panasonic Wet/Dry shavers for the past 25 years or more and have nothing but good things to say about them.  </li>
            <li>This is much gentler, even though it still does cause very mild irritation.</li>
            <li>BUT this Panasonic is actually doing a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>Good balance but need electric shave for a smoother dry shave.</li>
            <li>So first I  went ahead and bought the top of the line Norelco a month ago, with the auto cleaner and all that, and what I found was that it didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>Does not seem to be as good dry as a rotating razor.</li>
            <li>I tried wet shaves, but prefer a dry shave, although it&#x27;s nice to be able to clean the blades operating and under warm water flow with the cover/comb headpiece removed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very ergonomic, and easy to control.</li>
            <li>Great electric razor, fast recharge, keeps its charge for a long time, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling like I just got</li>
            <li>Much smoother shave than with the Rotarys, cleans easily, and I have used it 8 times before it  needs to be charged.  </li>
            <li>To be totally fair in the process, I thought I should test each razor in both advertised modes, \\&quot;wet\\&quot; and dry.</li>
            <li>The ES8103 does give a very close shave and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to use, well made, shaves very close (which the Braun didn&#x27;t do).  </li>
            <li>If you slowly go over your face and make sure to rinse the blades every so often, the shave is quite remarkable.</li>
            <li>I was worried at first that it was going to be different but diferentes is good</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works good dry as well-</li>
            <li>About the only thing I can think of that would make this aspect of it better would be if there was a very easy way to replace the battery with a reasonably priced replacement.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I originally thought the numeric display was overkill, but it turns out to be a handy way to tell how many more shaves you can get before recharging (approximately, it shows percent charge remaining).</li>
            <li>this is something I have never been able to do since I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It has been very hot here in the Pittsburgh, PA area, as many are probably aware, since ti has been pretty hot all over the US.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;d be nice if the battery is run down to be able to plug in and have a &amp;#34;tethered&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure more is better (a 4th cutting blade), but it isn&#x27;t worth $30 more for the shaver and 17$ more for the rebuild kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>A single charge is good for ~7 or 8 shaves.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, clean close shave safe, fast charge, quiet and smooth!</li>
            <li>I will probably never go back to shaving cream and a blade after this because its so easy, quick and the clean up is SO easy.</li>
            <li>Unless you find very light foam somehow, I found it more useful use it on dry skins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>NEVER have I had such an easy, quick, comfortable shave...and so smooth.</li>
            <li>First electrical shaver that works on me!</li>
            <li>Going by first impressions, this shaver kicks @ss &amp; chews bubble gum!  </li>
            <li>THIRD time I used it, I freaking love it!</li>
            <li>It didn’t shave as close as a blade, but was pretty darn close!</li>
            <li>Only been using this thing about a week now but absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After my first Panasonic, I changed to a Philips and I realize Philips tri-cyclone style does everything the same but much more comfortable!  </li>
            <li>It gives him a really close shave!!</li>
            <li>First Panasonic!</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and looks new afterwards.</li>
            <li>so I wanted a fresh new out of the box razor and thought this might be worthwhile.  </li>
            <li>Switching to a new shaver takes some getting used to, but after a few weeks it is an awesome shaver</li>
            <li>The three blade razor cuts close and provides a good close shave for loose skin types.</li>
            <li>This shaver works with short stubble, but if I wait a day or 2 (over the weekend, for example), the shaver doesn&#x27;t shave very well, and it tends to snag on beard hairs around my neck (which aint pleasant).</li>
            <li>Previously I owned a good Braun and a cheap Remington.  </li>
            <li>He is very happy with the closeness of the shave and has only needed to use it dry.  </li>
            <li>The only downside with this shaver is that it will nick or burn more easily than the others.  </li>
            <li>your skin doesn&#x27;t get hured.it is very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>But this new one cuts very close and comfortably and is better in every way.  </li>
            <li>It shaves my moustache and my chin fairly cleanly and on the first pass.</li>
            <li>Seems to work best dry, and needs charging every few days, but I&#x27;m quite pleased with this device.</li>
            <li>But when it arrived I took it out of the box (didn&#x27;t even clean it first) and gave it a go--</li>
            <li>/&gt;Right away I was happy with the fact that it was perhaps half as loud as the Braun was, and had a much more tolerable tone.  </li>
            <li>I really like how fast, easy and precise it is.</li>
            <li>Found this for less than $75 - excellent value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Nice little shaver which gives me a smooth, fast shave with no nicking.  </li>
            <li>Great shave, very easy to clean without a complicated cleaner and solution - just soap and water</li>
            <li>The shaver is also washable, making it very easy to clean and stay fresh (big plus!).</li>
            <li>The new razor seems to shave better and with less noise for a good clean shave.  </li>
            <li>As far as electric shavers go, I don&#x27;t know that I find this one to be the best, but it is completely acceptable - for much less money than any of the better ones I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, Panasonic has done a great job with this little wonder.  </li>
            <li>This means it would be a task for any razor, but with just a little bit of time it has great results.)  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great little shaver</li>
            <li>great little shaver.</li>
            <li>great little shaver.</li>
            <li>Great little shaver, which exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>This little gem cleans up great, using water as per the instructions.</li>
            <li>: I have now had this razor for a little over 5 months and it is still great.</li>
            <li>Shavers take a little longer to shave with than razors, but it does great job.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a quick shave, and this thing&#x27;s pretty quick, though it cuts so close that I manage to cut myself almost every day.</li>
            <li>Nice blade, quiet enough, easy to use, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The shaver also has a very fast recharging rate with it receiving a full charge in under 30 to 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Sure the case could have been more substantial, but I improvised, using a heavy duty pouch I had lying around, which works fine in protecting the shaver while traveling.    </li>
            <li>I had a Synchpro which, while large and heavy gave a great, close and smooth shave.</li>
            <li>On days I want an impeccable shave I do have to touch with a conventional razor.</li>
            <li>So I purchased this Panasonic and now I&#x27;m back to a very quick, very clean shave.  </li>
            <li>Works great, long lasting battery, clean, smooth shave every time.</li>
            <li>It does a very good job, but I do find that need to go over my face several times to get all spots, especially on my neck and under my chin.</li>
            <li>After comparing the two (the only difference is an extra head on the 8243), I decided on the 8103 and have to say that it is a very good shaver.</li>
            <li>but really, something being lighter is not necessarily indicative of lower quality and might be a good thing to you, i personally enjoy a certain heft.</li>
            <li>HUGE plus, so I don&#x27;t mind giving up a little bit more closeness for that)&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning: 9/10 (stupidly easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my old Panasonic razor, which had given me more than a decade of good shaves but now needed a new battery, foil, blade and trimmer blade (All were original, and had performed above and beyond the call of duty).</li>
            <li>It might be the first razor that I can honestly left my face smoother than a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the quality of the shave, there are a few good things about this razor; it&#x27;s very comfortable and light in the hand, making it easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li>The trimmer works great but is a bit on the narrow side, and when deployed it sticks out and away from the shaver&#x27;s body at an angle that takes a bit getting used to.    </li>
            <li>and I get a very close and comfortable shave with no irritation.  </li>
            <li>So I really like it, shaves smooth and close.</li>
            <li>Also, &amp; again,unlike the Norelco, I can get a smooth, very close shave in the neck area with no irritation at all.</li>
            <li>Once I learned how to shave with this model, I started getting some very close comfortable shaves.</li>
            <li>It was much faster and my face is smooth as a baby&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I have a medium heavy beard and it is great.  </li>
            <li>Takes a few shaves for your skin to get used to it, then it cuts great.</li>
            <li>Works great on the face, but has a lot of trouble on neck hairs, so I still need a regualr razor to finish the job.</li>
            <li>It is smooth, fast, and no irritation at all.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really give you a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, it has an indicator showing how much battery life remains before it needs to be recharged.</li>
            <li>No shaver burn, just fast, smooth, no hassle procedure.</li>
            <li>cheap and very suit my taste!!!&lt;br /&gt;automatic</li>
            <li>it is very lightweight&amp; comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>Really gives a close shave leaving you with a smooth face....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and shaves very close.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Remington, Norelco and Braun before and although the Braun worked well, I really like the smooth shave this Panasonic delivers.</li>
            <li>The foil is smooth and the blades are fast, and it contours to my face well.</li>
            <li>The shaver gives a very close, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Been using this for about a month now and no lie, it shaves very close and comfortable with no burn.  </li>
            <li>My husband loves this razor and he says it gives him a very close, aggravation free shave.</li>
            <li>The unit is very lightweight and the rubber grip is comfortable to hold at all angles.</li>
            <li>I love the ability to have a wet shave and easy clean up.</li>
            <li>For over 50 years I have been a confirmed blade shaver, although at various times the nicks and cuts that I experienced led me to try various electric shavers.  </li>
            <li>It shaves fast, close, and comfortable, almost like a blade shave, and has an LCD displays that always gives &amp;#34;percentage remaining&amp;#34; for the battery.  </li>
            <li>Smooth and fast.</li>
            <li>but this comes very close and leaves maybe 2-3 spots lightly haired.</li>
            <li>razor is comfortable and shave very closely.</li>
            <li>It is quite, runs smooth like a Honda car engine, and shaves very clean.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I will now know how much power is still available</li>
            <li>This shaver will give you a very close, smooth shave and it never burns or chaffs your skin at all.  </li>
            <li>It is so fast and smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave a rash or burn.</li>
            <li>I get a really close and comfortable shaves when I use it with gel cream and water.</li>
            <li>Provides a very close and smooth shave.</li>
            <li>The shave is fast and comfortable.</li>
            <li>My 10 year old Norelco shaver still has better battery life than this unit after 1 year of use.</li>
            <li>Speaking of my old Norelco, it still gives me a better shave and shaves while charging.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s useful and fun.</li>
            <li>so far ok.  </li>
            <li>So if you buy this razor be sure to keep your old razor because you may be without a razor for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li>shave is just as good as a wet shave</li>
            <li>your face will most likely be baby smooth.</li>
            <li>Nice and quiet.  </li>
            <li>I felt like I got my money&#x27;s worth out of that beast.  </li>
            <li>The razor performs on par with my old razor and since I&#x27;ve been using an electric microscreen razor for many years my face is used to it</li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>i just bought the $50 version again, since it has a more reliable old school lcd display instead.  </li>
            <li>update:  for what it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>It charges fast, is easy to clean and very lightweight, making it an exellent choice for home or traveling.  </li>
            <li>I am totally satisfied with the purchase so far.  </li>
            <li>Only drawback I see is its a bit loud but who cares it works great.</li>
            <li>I changed the blades to make sure I did not get an old blade with the razor.    </li>
            <li>I had to upgrade from a 4 year old Norelco since the replacement blades cost more than the razor was worth.</li>
            <li>I liked the cleaning system but a short time after buying the razor the stores stopped selling the cleaning solution.</li>
            <li>Pop-up trimmer works well, also, which is rarely the case for the pop-up trimmers.  </li>
            <li>I think rotary types will never be as good as straight heads, as a technical matter.</li>
            <li>I guess I should start by describing the kind of facial hair that I have.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly quiet and has a nice balance.  </li>
            <li>I did extensive searching on the internet for electric razors, liked the reviews of this product and bought it.  </li>
            <li>It was only $18, and included a nice, hard-shell carrying case.</li>
            <li>It was only $18, and included a nice, hard-shell carrying case.</li>
            <li>More than surprised and a Panasonic concert.</li>
            <li>Is it worth the money?</li>
            <li>was well worth it.</li>
            <li>So far i&#x27;m satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>Bought it in December for my husband to replace an old panasonic shaver that he had used for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li>I do think it requires a more frequent charge, as it seems to use about 10% of its power when I use it.  </li>
            <li>Stop making fun of me now.</li>
            <li>Stop making fun of me now.</li>
            <li>As a dryer shaver its great, but where it really stands out from the rest is when you use it for a wet lather shave.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t felt my husband&#x27;s this soft in years, I&#x27;ve missed being able to get close to him without getting beard burn.</li>
            <li>After one shave it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Carrying case would be useful.     </li>
            <li>But - that seems normal these days with most higher end shavers</li>
            <li>The closeness of the shave is nice and the unit feels solid.</li>
            <li>Nice close shave (especially for an electric shaver.)&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>Love it so far.  </li>
            <li>The only issue is the on/off button, I keep hitting it when shaving, not a deal breaker but would have been nice if located somewhere else.</li>
            <li>more like a couple of loud bees.</li>
            <li>I have not tried it with a wet shave and cannot determine if any of the pre-shave lotions do any good or if they just smell.  </li>
            <li>The product was worth its price and recommendable.</li>
            <li>WOW it is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>Early June I ordered a replacement hoping to fare better this time.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed that the more frequently I use it, the closer the shave and the cleaner</li>
            <li>The trimmer works far better than my Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t even tried it yet in wet mode because the results have been so good.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have been using an electric shaver on my legs for many years.</li>
            <li>So far I love this shaver.  </li>
            <li>If you want to save your money, I recommend growing a beard, as I&#x27;m currently doing (keeps you warm in the winter, saves on shaving supplies, and makes you look wiser).</li>
            <li>We selected this item based on prior reviews at this site, and now add our own \\&quot;5-star\\&quot; review based on our dad&#x27;s feedback.</li>
            <li>And, I&#x27;ve been more than pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>The old Braun used to spread most of those all over my sink.  </li>
            <li>Now the good part, I found in a coutry wide drugstore a product tha</li>
            <li>Going from a blade to this shaver did take some getting used to, but it was worth it.</li>
            <li>This shaver is well worth the money, and at sale prices it&#x27;s a steal.</li>
            <li>The digital readout is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>I guess the plug in AC motor on the old Braun is just better.</li>
            <li>The Panosonic ES8103S is by far a much better shaver.  </li>
            <li>Started out okay, but over time it&#x27;s become more rough on my neck.  </li>
            <li>I did some checking on various shavers and liked the wet/dry aspect of the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>Much better than with my old razor.  </li>
            <li>When I started shaving my head daily, I decided to get a nice electric razor.</li>
            <li>so well, I&#x27;m curious if the cleaning system is as good as the razor..</li>
            <li>This fact alone is worth the price of the razor..</li>
            <li>Of course a blade will do one better, but as far as electrics go in this price range</li>
            <li>I also have a Norelco and a Braun, and this is far and away my favorite.  </li>
            <li>This is a rare thing anymore and needs to be the norm again not the exception if quality brands want to survive.</li>
            <li>I also noticed the shave I got was not as close as my old shaver on top of the longer shave time.  </li>
            <li>My husband had never used an electric razor before, but had to go on blood thinners long term, so we purchased the Panasonic and he is very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;To be honest, I had rather low expectations about the shaver.  </li>
            <li>On scale of 1-10, I would rare the Panasonic an \\&quot;8\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I called Panasonic customer service to see if this upgrade would be worth it.  </li>
            <li>it is useful for you.plerse try it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it\\</li>
            <li>very much worth the money.</li>
            <li>Cuts close like a razor and has a handy trim tool on the back.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it though and recommend it especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so useful for me.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t seem quite as close on one day&#x27;s growth, but it was every bit as good as my old Braun (before it got old).  </li>
            <li>Like most electric razors it doesn&#x27;t get my face smooth even after several passes in every direction.</li>
            <li>Pleased so far.</li>
            <li>Maybe I just got a defective unit, but my 3 year old razor still shaves better than this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The razor motor sounds powerful, but...</li>
            <li>My favorite Braun unexpectedly died so</li>
            <li>and this is by far a better shaver.</li>
            <li>Shaves and performs much better than my old norelco.</li>
            <li>This shaver is even better than my old one.  </li>
            <li>This is the 4th and 2nd 8103S I own.</li>
            <li>, you get about 10 days worth of shaving before you need to charge it again.  </li>
            <li>better than my old norelco.</li>
            <li>&quot; I don&#x27;t think the HydraClean Dock is worth an additional $60 to the cost of this shaving</li>
            <li>Rechargeable batteries need attention to how you care and charge them to give you the longest useful life.</li>
            <li>(another way rechargeable batteries useful life can be shortened).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(another way rechargeable batteries useful life can be shortened).    </li>
            <li>This model is worth the price increase over model ES-SL41-S.</li>
            <li>So far, I really am enjoying this shaver.  </li>
            <li>It was worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The shaving head gets a bit warm, though not enough to burn the skin.</li>
            <li>Now after getting used to it, I like it as much or more as my old model.</li>
            <li>Powerful</li>
            <li>It seemed hazardous in potential.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So this one wins the &amp;#34;best so far&amp;#34; award.</li>
            <li>is a much better shaver than my old Braun.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Takeaway - If you&#x27;re looking for an affordable, wet/dry travel shaver, this is worth looking into.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews on thIs razor, and decided it was worth the try.</li>
            <li>Overall, a nice shaver.</li>
            <li>I grew tired of not being able to take razors in my carry on luggage when I fly.  </li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t remember the last time I had an irritated face or an ingrown hair.</li>
            <li>Two different types of cutters in the head tackle whiskers effectively.  </li>
            <li>Own a similar model.  </li>
            <li>The size is good because anything wider ( like the 4 or 5 blade razors) would be too wide.)</li>
            <li>Far better than the Braun shavers I used to have.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth Since it doesn&#x27;t seem flimsy.</li>
            <li>The hairs will have absorbed water and will be softer and fatter.</li>
            <li>light pressure when hair is longer, then at the end use more pressure to cut short hair shorter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far and works great.  </li>
            <li>The shave as such is really smooth, love that aspect of it.</li>
            <li>I have to go over most areas at least twice to get rid of all the stubble, and I seem to get the best results shaving in multiple directions instead of always with or against the hair&#x27;s grain.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for about a month, and get about a week&#x27;s worth of shaves per charge.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Final thoughts, totally worth the price in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I heard that foil shavers are much better for those with sensitive skin than rotary shavers.  </li>
            <li>With the cost of razor blades continually raising, this is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>My face is soft and smooth!  </li>
            <li>However, the trade off in closeness is worth it because the razor never cuts my face.  </li>
            <li>Gives a nice, close shave in a very short time.</li>
            <li>this price point that is economical to do.</li>
            <li>Consumer Reports rated this Panasonic shaver near the top of its ratings</li>
            <li>The ability to lock the head or switch it to pivot mode comes in handy for different areas of neck and face.</li>
            <li>It had also gotten really loud (more about that below).  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>After reading reviews, I thought it would be worth the money.</li>
            <li>I satisfied completely now.</li>
            <li>Worth of buying.</li>
            <li>So far, I love it.</li>
            <li>He always complains that everyti,e he buys a nice electronic shaver, it pulls on his facial hair.</li>
            <li>It is worth the price.</li>
            <li>I gave this a good month to come to this, I wanted to like it after i spent 140 on it</li>
            <li>Bought this on a whim and wow am I glad.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly easy to clean, the battery lasts about 5 shaves, and so far I haven&#x27;t nicked myself or had any irritation.  </li>
            <li>I own the Panasonic Body Groom and thought I would stay in the same family of razors.  </li>
            <li>This razor is so much better than my old Remington</li>
            <li>and I can use it in the shower too (rarely)</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s still worth it in the $70.00 range.</li>
            <li>I used to dread the pain of trying to shave 3 days worth of scruff....</li>
            <li>It definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>The first time I shaved with this razor, I did so with a full beard.</li>
            <li>nice extra features onit.</li>
            <li>This actually DOES shave close and comfortable and recharges real quick.</li>
            <li>The Arc3 is okay so far.  </li>
            <li>fair and not what I expected for a closer shave, and does not hold the charge for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li>I am sure that it is much better than PHILIPS shaver nice cutting, able to use during taking a shower, price etc.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not that powerful of a shaver, I guess.  </li>
            <li>Battery lasts just about all week, and I rarely replace the foil and blade more frequently than once per 12-16 months.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and not as loud as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>, the quality of the shave is obviously the most important aspect of the product.  </li>
            <li>The time and work just aren&#x27;t worth it to me.</li>
            <li>My husband was not crazy about this shaver.  </li>
            <li>The shaver works very well, by far the best shaving method I ever used but does leave some rough areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the soft setting to get around the nooks and crannies of my neck.</li>
            <li>but, it was well worth the investment)</li>
            <li>but, it was well worth the investment)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very pleased that these have lasted as long as they have (with periodic blade replacements).  </li>
            <li>I guess its worth buying.</li>
            <li>This is one of those rare products that truly delivers on the hype.  </li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve had all smooth, close and comfortable shaves.  </li>
            <li>I am surprised and quite pleased.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s as good as expected. .</li>
            <li>Certainly worth the price</li>
            <li>I am simply doing this because I would have appreciated someone telling the truth and not just giving good reviews.</li>
            <li>I then bought a second for my own use.</li>
            <li>the battary is powerful.</li>
            <li>Panasonic&#x27;s hi-end models are my favorite by far.</li>
            <li>Worth what I paid, and would buy again.</li>
            <li>This model ES8103S shaves better than my old Panasonic model.</li>
            <li>after like 8 shaves found not cutting close to my moustash and had to use a manual blade.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at the Sensotouch, but as I used the three circular blade arrangement on a Norelco shaver before I moved to Braun, I had found that the razor&#x27;s blade arrangement worked far better for me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I like the shaver, and am pleased with how it has worked for me so far.  </li>
            <li>I think its worth it IMO.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I have used Braun and Norelco for years with varying degrees of success.  </li>
            <li>Hope the Li-ion battery lasts 7 to 10 years like the old shavers, but probably NimH batteries are more durable.</li>
            <li>I got my money&#x27;s worth on that shaver.</li>
            <li>And to top that off, you can shave with shaving cream, in the shower or dry and you just rinse off to clean it!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and feels high quality.</li>
            <li>Very very close shave and quickly as well.</li>
            <li>It still operates strongly after eight years however which speaks highly of the brand.</li>
            <li>I was happy with my first Panasonic, happier with the 2nd, and this new one surpasses both, each progressing in enhanced usage and performance.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this shaver because i shave my head and read very positive reviews.</li>
            <li>The vibrations in the hand are pretty strong compared to not feeling much with the norelco.  </li>
            <li>I got a good shave, via the dry method, on the first shave.</li>
            <li>but I usually dry shave on my way into work and still receive a pretty good shave.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t seem to understand why it can be so great on all the other hairs, but not be able to get those last</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m always nervous that wetting metal is bound to dull it quickly) - and it really does shave closely with a small bit of foamy soap rubbed in to the heads, best after a good hot shower so the beard is nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product and cleans easily, is compact for travel, can be used wet or dry, and a cheap alternative to the $100+ electric razors.</li>
            <li>I love that I can pop it open and run it under water to clean it, and I&#x27;ve even used it in the shower a few times and it always gives a great shave,</li>
            <li>First, the head is so large that shaving above a mustache is more challenging.</li>
            <li>I purchased this particular shaver after researching the best shavers for African American men.</li>
            <li>Only time will tell, but seeing as I&#x27;ve had wonderful experiences with other Panasonic/Technics products over the years</li>
            <li>have also used this electric dry and I am very pleased with those results as well.  </li>
            <li>The shaver overall is nice because of the outlay of it and how fast it charges plus the speed that you can clean it using water.</li>
            <li>A fine shaver at a decent price.  </li>
            <li>job.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t stick a blade to my upper leg, due to the sensitivity of my skin, but the ES8103S achieves wonderful results without my needing to resort to a blade.</li>
            <li>I wish there was a way to lock the outside piece in place, but other than that I have been thoroughly impressed.</li>
            <li>and it does it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>The screen also began to malfunction pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my boyfriend its his first electric razor and he loves it says it gives a quick close shave</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using this electric shaver for the first time, I quickly asked &amp;#34;Why</li>
            <li>tl for turkey (varies according to the exchange rate), and you give comes as soon as six days rather expecting it pretty quickly</li>
            <li>The razor does get hot, which does not feel nice in more sensitive spots (upper lip, under ear).&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It does fine dry, but shaving with it using shaving cream makes for a very comfortable and close shave.</li>
            <li>Shaving in the shower doesn&#x27;t necessarily give me a closer shave, but it sure does keep the shaver clean, so I can shave after I&#x27;m dressed</li>
            <li>Soft, smooth, clean shave even on neck and adams apple.</li>
            <li>clean fresh shaving just like manual blade and very mobile and flexible to use.</li>
            <li>I wore a beard for many years but recently decided to go clean shaven.</li>
            <li>It is easier to clean then an old razor and comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Seriously, I dont understand why it has so many good comments.</li>
            <li>Way more than enough to get a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Finally after 2 years the top piece that fits over the blades, which you remove to clean, broke off and can&#x27;t be reattached.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good shaver and a decent price.</li>
            <li>There is a newer \\&quot;ARC 4\\&quot; model which I guess has an extra set of blades, but it had fewer reviews and they weren&#x27;t as good as the reviews for this shaver, so I stuck with this older model.</li>
            <li>Clean up is very easy, a drop of liquid soap and a little water on turbo clean and a quick rinse.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how close it shaves and the cleaning is very easy and it charges fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In general, a great product to invest in your personal grooming needs and even worth the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In general, a great product to invest in your personal grooming needs and even worth the price.</li>
            <li>other design features that I would change is that the charger indicator goesdown fairly evenly until 10%.  </li>
            <li>I decided on this Panasonic shaver due to the good reviews [...]  </li>
            <li>It is easy to clean, not terribly loud, and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Its performance in shaving was comparable with other electric shavers--OK, but not as good as manual razors.</li>
            <li>Due to the shape of the head, the shaver is not as good at getting the area under the nose as a Norelco triple head.</li>
            <li>my goodness, the Panasonic cost 1/3 as much, and the difference in performance is just not that significant.  </li>
            <li>It can be a tab bit messy, but I&#x27;m not late for work anymore and the BEST thing about it was no razor burn and still felt like a very close shave.</li>
            <li>The razor still gives a very close, very fast and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>The razor still gives a very close, very fast and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>So it may have been my overly high expectations or the limitations of the product, but I didn&#x27;t think it provided me with an adequate \\&quot;clean shave.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, especially for people who have never had a good razor.</li>
            <li>My shaves are now as close as they were when I dry shaved, and even more comfortable and smooth thanks to the steam.</li>
            <li>I got a special offer from Panasonic for a different model, but this one was better and cheaper, with faster shipping from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I paid around $60, so the price was right for me also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the price was right.</li>
            <li>I now can shave right in my hootch with no water or anything.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having problems with my right hand.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>It says it right on the box.</li>
            <li>Use it right after or in the shower you will be amazed.  </li>
            <li>thats right, Merry Christmas) gift from my wife.</li>
            <li>, right?  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying one as soon as I find one at the right price..</li>
            <li>right though all of it.  </li>
            <li>Dad was right.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m convinced this was the right purchase.</li>
            <li>This shaver&#x27;s head seems just the right size.  </li>
            <li>right after I shower - never with water or in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Right out of the box</li>
            <li>The price was right</li>
            <li>the price was definitely right.</li>
            <li>Panasonic has got it right.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I just use a Gillette 5 blade shaver, which cuts right through it and gets the job done even closer than these fancy machines.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s waterprod and has a sideburns trimmer and the price is right.  </li>
            <li>With this, I can go right over my lips.</li>
            <li>Like right at the bottom of my nose.</li>
            <li>With this, I can go right over my lips.</li>
            <li>Like right at the bottom of my nose.</li>
            <li>(I used it right out of the box with just 10% power on it)</li>
            <li>and this goes right through it.</li>
            <li>I was right.  </li>
            <li>yes you read that right.</li>
            <li>The repeated passes means skin irritation, so I put on moisturizer or coconut oil right after the shave.  </li>
            <li>Seemed just right.  </li>
            <li>I bought the shaver after breaking my right hand.</li>
            <li>Use it in the shower, or in your car right before a date or interview&lt;</li>
            <li>Well I did the right thing and purchased this as</li>
            <li>A convenient rechargable razor that is easy and quick to use with no mess.</li>
            <li>In about 10 days I received a new unit back, and guess what, it was the model ES8249, a much more sophisticated unit.</li>
            <li>But most of the new Panasonic shavers are bigger and heavier with more heads.</li>
            <li>I think you will be writing a positive review like I just did!</li>
            <li>On the positive side Amazon returns are a breeze!</li>
            <li>But for being ok he sure seems to like using it very much, put other one away and has been using this one ever since.  </li>
            <li>It will really save me a bunch of time and waiting for a free sink and no chance of hot water.  </li>
            <li>I particularly like the easy cleaning process - a few drops of liquid soap on the screen and blades , running at a higher-than-normal, cleaning vibration mode, cleans the screen and blades within a couple minutes - much easier and more effective than manually cleaning Norelco shavers.     </li>
            <li>It is fast and it has a pretty quite sound.</li>
            <li>and I still enjoy it as much as the first.  </li>
            <li>First, the shave cuts very close and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only able to get about 3 full shaves out of the unit before it needs to be recharged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only able to get about 3 full shaves out of the unit before it needs to be recharged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In contrast, my rotary razor does the neck area much faster, but its not as clean in comparison to this razor -</li>
            <li>If I ever get another Panasonic wet/dry shaver, I&#x27;m pretty sure I won&#x27;t use it near water again.  </li>
            <li>It has everything I was looking for in a shaver, Clean, Close, FAST &amp; no \\&quot; neck burn.</li>
            <li>to clean and charges very quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is such a beautiful system that I can now even shave my private parts without fearing any cuts and my wife loves it now!!    </li>
            <li>Super easy to clean (doesn&#x27;t require cleaning fluid or anything) just rinse with water.</li>
            <li>but it gives a very close and clean shave.</li>
            <li>Had an older Panasonic model before with a wider handle and that seemed to fit my hand better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not sure how much more effective it makes the shaver.  </li>
            <li>Very well built and cuts really clean.</li>
            <li>It cleans easily and the clipper is powerful and precise enough for my needs.</li>
            <li>I really pushed it against my skin, but the shave was never even close to as clean as it would be with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It cuts fast and clean.</li>
            <li>Virtually no pressure is needed to ensure a very close clean shave.  </li>
            <li>Unit is very quiet, easy to clean and battery charges quickly.</li>
            <li>It recharges quickly and is easy to clean with simple running water and soap.  </li>
            <li>I wanted something that was easy to use, could get wet in case that were to happen, easy to clean and works well.</li>
            <li>It is fast and shaves clean.</li>
            <li>The shave is fairly close - typical of most electric razors - but it is really loud.</li>
            <li>and I really like clean close shave</li>
            <li>It charges quickly and it has a nice display that tells you how much power it has left.</li>
            <li>It took way to much time to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li>I find that it works the best when my beard is no more than one day old although it will handle longer stubble.</li>
            <li>It is light years ahead of my older Panasonic shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used Braun, Norelco, and Remington in the past and this is by far the best I have used.  </li>
            <li>a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The docked it one star because it&#x27;s not easy to clean in a hurry</li>
            <li>model offers a wet shave option which works great - super close with no irratation.</li>
            <li>He really likes it and Mr. Scruffy is now Mr. Clean shaved.  </li>
            <li>If you are a clean cut guy who does not like the been up for 5 days straight rock star look, then avoid this since you will have to grow it like that for this shaver to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only discomfort is noise, but you not need use the shave more than 5 minites each time, so it &#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>The unit is very easy to clean -- simply pop off the foil and rinse under the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;The absolute biggest drawback of this shaver is the pop out trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Received item very fast - easy instructions - husband has used only once so far - but seems to enjoy it:)</li>
            <li>It shaves through a 1-2 day stubble very easily (admittedly, I don&#x27;t have the thickest facial hair)</li>
            <li>Cleaning is very easy and charge last about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I experienced very little (new shaver) skin irritation, and wet/dry ability allows thorough and easy cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The blades were not sharp and skipped more than they cut.  </li>
            <li>I have been using electric shavers for over 25 years and have tried most major brands.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that gets razor burn and cuts very easily when using normal fusion razors.</li>
            <li>Besides the high pitched sound of the nano tech motor (it sounds like a mosquito on steroids)</li>
            <li>As others have mentioned, it makes a high pitched buzzing sound when turned on</li>
            <li>high pitched sound -</li>
            <li>It has a high pitched sound that my wife can&#x27;t tolerate.  </li>
            <li>the Panasonic was a very acceptable alternative, not quite as close as a wet shave, but very comfortable and way, way better than a Braun i received as a gift before that.</li>
            <li>Noise levels are on par with my old shaver and should be fine for all but the most sensitive ears.  </li>
            <li>I am surprised it does not come with hose attachments to clean my house while shaving!</li>
            <li>They worked great overall as long as you replace the blades every 1-2 years and clean it after each use. .</li>
            <li>There are so few products today that really measure up that it is a pleasure to fine one this good.</li>
            <li>(I alternate right and left), and the charge status and fast recharge are very good.</li>
            <li>Since the cost of replacing them is more than the cost of a new electric razor, I began to look for a modern replacement and hit upon this</li>
            <li>The shave is clean and quick, probably because it is new also.</li>
            <li>I purchased the whole razor since it wasn&#x27;t much more money that a couple of new blade and foil sets.</li>
            <li>It is only an OK shave in my opinion far from great, and far from even a decent disposable razor.</li>
            <li>The initial shave took much less time, but the results were just as impressive.  </li>
            <li>I especially love the fact that I have the option of shaving wet or dry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used it both wet and dry and have gotten excellent results both ways.  </li>
            <li>The shaver works perfectly either dry or wet.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed that it can be used wet or dry.</li>
            <li>For many, this may be no issue, but my shave locations tend to be adventurous and unpredictable</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it wet but dry it is the best!  </li>
            <li>The best part is it works dry or wet, you can use it with or without shaving cream as well.</li>
            <li>A charge lasts for ten or more shaves and it recharges quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love the close shave, the quick charge, and the overall quality and build of their razors.</li>
            <li>Charges quickly and lasts me several shaves (usually 5 or more).</li>
            <li>The new one works fine.</li>
            <li>Holds a charge for about 20 normal close, smooth shaves.</li>
            <li>but I definitely think the Panasonic is giving me a closer shave much quicker and definitely MUCH more comfortably.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic has more power, charges faster, shaves closer &amp; cleaner, a more comfortable head, cuts flat laying wiskers, and has a % digital battery charge indicator.</li>
            <li>My past experiences with the circular rotating heads wasn&#x27;t great, as it didn&#x27;t provide a close shave and irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li>I got exactly 2 weeks worth of shaves and as of today I still get exactly 2 weeks worth of shaves.</li>
            <li>True to form it shaves very close.  </li>
            <li>That is no more sillythan finding a great deal on a BMW and finding out you can&#x27;t afford to fix it.</li>
            <li>Now I find myself going back to my $45 old shaver (ok a Remington) more often than I would care to admit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what is so incredibly great about this shaver, whether it&#x27;s the nanotechnology that produces a closer shave</li>
            <li>One good thing about the charger though is that it is relatively compact, and curiously is almost shelf-like when plugged in to the wall, which allows the razor to sit on top of it while charging, almost as if it were designed that way.</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t usually use it in the shower because I don&#x27;t have a mirror in there but works great either way.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had several electric razors over the years from Norelco and Remington and the Panasonic ES8103S is by far my most favorite that I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>Except for replacing the blades the Norelco was great until in the past 2 years it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t generally have many problems.</li>
            <li>Both fell short of shaving with a razor but with aging skin that has become much more sensitive to nicks and cuts, there is a greater reliance on electric razors.</li>
            <li>flip out trimmer is nice for sideburns and for those long hairs on my toes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shave is not bad - a very close shave</li>
            <li>He used it the other day for the first time n loved it.</li>
            <li>The good things about this product are that it&#x27;s quiet, light, it charges very quickly (an hour or less), and has a battery percentage monitor on it.</li>
            <li>Light, quiet motor, and a very smooth cut is provided by this particular shaver.</li>
            <li>In total I still find using an electric shaver a trade off which is acceptable for every day use, but for special occassions or just when I want to get a really close shave a blade is far superior.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this particular one for about three years now, after dropping my original in the shower and breaking it.</li>
            <li>At first, I was mildly pleased by the shave, but the blades faded quickly over the following months and it became a grinding chore to do my morning shave.</li>
            <li>While the ES8103 weighs a little more than the women&#x27;s models, it is actually much better balanced and</li>
            <li>recommend this for a person who wants to try out electric shaving or someone who primarily uses a manual type razor, but is looking for an affordable and quick shave in between their normal routine.</li>
            <li>gave it a 1 star because it&#x27;s a cute little mousy shaver :)</li>
            <li>Over three years later this razor is still going strong and shaving close!  </li>
            <li>easy to clean, quick and long charge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li>so I did a little more research to make sure and bought this.  </li>
            <li>Update at the 4.5-year mark (April 2017): This same razor is still going strong!</li>
            <li>great shaves could also be due to the cutters being brand new</li>
            <li>Agile - does a good job with tough spots on your face</li>
            <li>Battery life is not so great and have to charge very few days.  </li>
            <li>This unit also seems to lose charge on batteries much faster (without use) than other brands and models, so be prepared to go out unshaven more often with this razor than with many others.</li>
            <li>Unlike the new Cheap@$$ quality made by Panasonic Eletric Works Wanbao (Made in China).</li>
            <li>This new Panasonic that I just purchased from Amazon.com is FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>Every thing feels light and plastic with this new unit.  </li>
            <li>I am now back to my 8 year-old norelco that i have never ever even cleaned or replaced a head on (just the occasional rinsing under water) - it no longer provides a great shave either and the battery is dying</li>
            <li>It charged quickly and shows you how much percentage battery is remaining.  </li>
            <li>Sound - the sound is like a cross between an amplified mosquito (80%) and an electric grass shear (20%).  </li>
            <li>Clean up is so simple and easy by just putting a drop of liquid soap on the shaver head, turn on, let it foam, shut off and rinse.</li>
            <li>This one&#x27;s going strong after nearly a year</li>
            <li>So when my last Panasonic wore out (needed head parts, cost more than it was worth)</li>
            <li>time seems quick for a fast recharge&lt;br /&gt;overall</li>
            <li>So far, so good after several weeks of use.</li>
            <li>Not as good as my previous Remington but that razor jumped its price to $300.00.  </li>
            <li>Good shave (subject to limitations below)  </li>
            <li>super fast shipping</li>
            <li>I was going to replace the rotary with another Braun of some type, but they are kind of expensive, and this Panasonic had good reviews.      </li>
            <li>It is really easy to clean an works especially well in the shower.</li>
            <li>I was pleasently surprised by the great level of shaving and the machinery sound so much quiter than my previous one.</li>
            <li>So all in all - if you choose to purchase this product - you can expect to buy a good performing razor that is easy on your skin but has a tendancy to smell musty if you don&#x27;t dry it properly.</li>
            <li>My old Panasonic wet/dry lasted forever, and the battery still easily holds a charge for over a week.  </li>
            <li>not as good as my old norelco, trimer is in too low location.  would not reccommend.</li>
            <li>Like all foil shavers, you have to go over the same area again and again, and finish up with aftershave and a razor to get the few spots you missed, but I am very happy with this and plan to get one for my son for Xmas.</li>
            <li>So far it has worked very well on the top of my head.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clear under running water&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Have used for several weeks and so far a good shaver.  </li>
            <li>shaver is easy to clean and the batteries last for five or six shaves without recharging.  </li>
            <li>Cuts smoothly, quickly, and charges fast.</li>
            <li>Part of the irritation may be from the fact that the blades get quite warm on this with dry shaving after 2 or 3 minutes of use.</li>
            <li>and i really got pissed off, threw the whole thing away, thank you panasonic for being a cheap bastard for quality of your products</li>
            <li>It indicates how much power remains and it charges quickly.</li>
            <li>I want quick fast shave in the morning, to mitigate the process of using razor and cream.</li>
            <li>After a great deal of research and reading reviews on several different razors I decide on the Panasonic ES8103S.  </li>
            <li>Razor is easy to clean just follow simple directions.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean, and is relatively silent.</li>
            <li>However, it does shave quickly, so it hasn&#x27;t really been a problem.</li>
            <li>Ultimately I wanted something that was cheap to maintain (replacement blades/foils), comfortable and durable.</li>
            <li>It charges ridiculously fast and it gave him a super close shave; almost as if he had used a razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much quieter does not vibrate, and charges quickly.</li>
            <li>an unfortunatly its not as good as my previous shaver</li>
            <li>Unexpected benefit is that since I&#x27;m not running a blade agains my skin any more, my skin is much smoother than with the razor.</li>
            <li>It is fairly quiet, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>(these areas are sensitive and get irritated easily when I use a blade</li>
            <li>I get a really close shave and really quick &amp;#60;5 minutes (as opposed to ~10 minutes with manual shave).  </li>
            <li>Short shaving times, long-lasting battery, no irritation, and it&#x27;s still easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I liked the LCD screen showing how much battery is left.</li>
            <li>I would have to say the only downfall I have experienced is that occasionally I have had to do some touch-up with a manual razor.  </li>
            <li>The shaver head is easy to clean, but sometimes the foil falls out when you remove the head - the tabs to release the foil are in the same location as the tabs to remove the head.</li>
            <li>It kept a charge for several days and was easy to clean.</li>
            <li>people with sensitive skin issues and allergies don&#x27;t have much choice, it&#x27;s either this or waxing which adds up to a lot more over time...</li>
            <li>and I think they can make an even smaller, more powerful unit for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I think they can make an even smaller, more powerful unit for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Drop few shampoo and switch on vibration then wash it clean under running water, very convenient and remains a good smell.</li>
            <li>Light to moderate light pressure is all that is needed.  </li>
            <li>after I&#x27;ve spent more time with it, but feel free to make any comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ease of use, more comfortable when wet.</li>
            <li>I get five to six shaves per charge; and the razor performs much like a mild DE razor like Gillette&#x27;s vintage Tech razor; and it shaves closer than Feather&#x27;s AS-D1 razor.</li>
            <li>I like this design as it is quite small compared with the 3-head rotary shavers, and is therefore much more suitable for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>then a quick 1 hour charge and its ready again, no problem.</li>
            <li>This was an Amazon deal-of-the-day special, so I feel particularly satisfied with the then very low price and the remaining very high quality of this shaver.</li>
            <li>I generally use panasonic, and I am happy with it, this year, I was surprised by the $30 discount and rushed to buy it for $66 (padded it with other panasonic eligible products to be able to use $99+ discount).</li>
            <li>His skin is very soft and smooth after using this shaver.</li>
            <li>My first one lasted 15 years (would have replaced the blades and kept using it but was almost the same price to get a new one on sale and got the swivel head as a new feature -which works great BTW)</li>
            <li>First, I wanted to see how it would fair against my old electric shavers from different manufacturers (Braun &amp; Remington).</li>
            <li>I spent a lot more money to buy!  </li>
            <li>cleanup of any shaver out there (Panasonic in general), very cost effective (soap/water) and very quick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was my second Panasonic shaving product which I purchased because I liked the first one so much</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of facial hair, nor does it grow terribly fast, so the top recommendation from The Sweet Home seemed overkill.  </li>
            <li>The head moves in and out as you our more pressure on and it pivots from left to right.  </li>
            <li>Light weight and easy to use and maintains the charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>This razor is way more economical to keep clean than having to buy the cleaner cartridges to keep my previous Braun clean, and the replacement screens don&#x27;t cost as much as a replacement razor.</li>
            <li>Make sure you clean regularly with good mineral oil, such as any baby oil and the foils and cutters will last longer.</li>
            <li>After two Braun shavers that were good but not special, read the Amazon reviews and decided to try this.</li>
            <li>Thus, a clean, close, comfortable shave is particularly important, since nicks and other problems associated with shaving tend to get magnified.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean, shaves clean and close (takes a few passes though), charges quickly and works well on my neck.</li>
            <li>very (VERY)</li>
            <li>You can now find my ES8103 on eBay at a VERY reasonable price.</li>
            <li>With this Panasonic shaver, cleaning is very fast and efficient.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>I am very light on facial hair</li>
            <li>I very much like this shaver.</li>
            <li>With a very comfortable, the next will buy.</li>
            <li>I like this shaver very much.</li>
            <li>i had!&lt;br /&gt;The battery is charged very fast and lasts</li>
            <li>Very reasonable price, too.  </li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced on Amazon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shave itself is very, very nice.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is a gift and my friend likes it very much.</li>
            <li>Like all razors, under the chin and neck take multiple passes, but very smooth with no skin irritation</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a pretty heavy beard and this is the first shaving solution I&#x27;ve really been happy with.</li>
            <li>And very reasonable price...  </li>
            <li>Therefore, I settled on this version for a very reasonable price</li>
            <li>Charges very fast.  </li>
            <li>Charging is very fast.</li>
            <li>This is a very good shaver as it can reach places under your nose and around your neck that a razor with the three spinning blades are unable to cleanly shave.   </li>
            <li>Your shave will be so smooth that you may be able to get by shaving every other day as I have, and 2)</li>
            <li>it is clean and soft, and you can clean it with water, it&#x27;s very convenient.</li>
            <li>So far, after one week, working fine.</li>
            <li>Have not owned an electric since I was 20 years old or so, now 68, since I never could fine one that worked as well as blade shaving.</li>
            <li>This is a great razor wet with cheap shaving creme or dry.</li>
            <li>Before I ordered the Panasonic though, I pulled out an old ( but still in fine shape) Norelco/Phillips triple head that I used to use.</li>
            <li>off more than 1/2 of the time off of my previous shaving time, and does it much cleaner and more consistant than my disposable shaver.</li>
            <li>The shaving experience is not as sensational as described in the ads, I would rate it average.</li>
            <li>Previous shaver did not do a great job (always had patches that were a more rough than others).  </li>
            <li>The blades are so sharp, so fast, and the design so good</li>
            <li>How easy and so quiet, fast, light (Already mentioned</li>
            <li>To be honest though I still have to use a regular disposable razor blade very quickly to get that last bit of smoothness.</li>
            <li>My previous Panasonic wet/dry electric shaver finally gave up the ghost after many years of good service</li>
            <li>An added benefit to this would be that the manufacturer would be able to determine if the razor could be refurbished with a new battery and new parts then sold and used again.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>It shaves as close as a blade, gets long hairs on the neck and is very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good little razor...</li>
            <li>thanks so much!!</li>
            <li>Shaves very close and FAST !!</li>
            <li>This shaver does fairly well with cheeks and the neck, but struggles a little with the spaces in between.  </li>
            <li>The PROS: very reasonably priced; fast, ridiculously close shave with no nicks or pulled hairs; very easy to clean with the high speed cleaning feature; charges quickly; light weight &amp; easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>It runs good and has simple-looking features, and can take a little water for cleaning.</li>
            <li>but it took a week to get familiar with the new brand shaver.</li>
            <li>The sound is much lower than my older Bruan...</li>
            <li>It is super quiet and cleans easily.  </li>
            <li>the blades are easy to press and make your daily routine quick &amp; simple!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cleanup is easy and it holds a charge through multiple shaves and charges fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>husband loves it and delights in such an easy and quick way to shave</li>
            <li>It gives better results when it is moved several times over the same spot if required applying very light pressure, which agrees with the passport recommendations.  </li>
            <li>Charge running a full week--easy to clean--very high revolution motor.</li>
            <li>very good (but not great) shave</li>
            <li>This is very easy to clean and it says when it needs charging, which takes less than an hour.  </li>
            <li>, I highly recommend the property.&lt;br /&gt;panasonic travel bag to use as a rag-bag against external impacts ridiculous the situation is more stylish and good imiş</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would highly reccomend this product to all who want a nice middle price shaver.!</li>
            <li>The high pitched sound is very annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this shaver it has to be the best around and it wont take you to the poor house either, priced at under $80</li>
            <li>Not as good as a regular shave, only use it for a fast shave, but have to keep going over until its clean, and uses up all the charge</li>
            <li>but, this razor, so far, is by far the best little razor I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>12/13/2015 Six 1/2 year update: After more than six years of daily use, this razor still works and looks almost like new with the original foil and blades.</li>
            <li>it was awesome for buzzing down facial hair - i often don&#x27;t shave clean but just do the stubbly look, and the very wide trimmer made that easy.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic cost less than my original shaver and is far superior to it.  </li>
            <li>Because of the speed of the blades, the moveable head, and the option of wet /dry shaving, it does an amazing job.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s amazing to me that we as a civilization are so aware of what kind resources are wasted by making such disposable products</li>
            <li>I promise you, allowing your skin to rest a day or two between shaves will make a huge difference in the condition of your skin, especially on those more sensitive areas (face, underarms, swim zone)...</li>
            <li>The pretty lcd display stopped functioning after 6 months of use.</li>
            <li>the same close shave as with a razor takes more passes than it would with a razor.</li>
            <li>Could not believe how close it shaved on the first time.  </li>
            <li>Two months later did this again and made sure i got a confirmation on the panasonic website and still no response.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric razor.  </li>
            <li>More than a month later I still don&#x27;t like how it feels or shaves.  </li>
            <li>is how much closer it cuts!</li>
            <li>My husband said it felt like it was yanking his hairs out for the first two months.</li>
            <li>I use it with shaving soap and for the most part it works well enough for me...</li>
            <li>The difference with my last Braun feels like, for lack of a better metaphor, the difference between a scalpel and a scythe.</li>
            <li>it does shave pretty close when i use it in the shower.  </li>
            <li>i actually spend more shaving now.  </li>
            <li>With this model, you simply add some liquid soap to the top of the foil, add some water, turn the shaver on and let it run for under a minute.</li>
            <li>The Remington had alot more vibration vs the solid Panasonic.</li>
            <li>Especially the area over my top lip for some reason.</li>
            <li>Obviously the wet options are best, but It does a fine job dry, too.  </li>
            <li>This is my first razor</li>
            <li>It seems to do about 8-10 shaves on a full charge, so I normally don&#x27;t have to take the charger on trips.</li>
            <li>It also required many passes on the same area to remove all of the hair.</li>
            <li>I have been using the shaver for about a month, about 4-5 times per week and still on the first charge.</li>
            <li>so you have to make sure to charge it regularly.  </li>
            <li>each minute shown that is left because it gives the user greater control over when to re-charge in my judgment.  </li>
            <li>And no it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade, but it&#x27;s pretty close.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Minus 1 more star because of overall product reliability.</li>
            <li>He guesses it will last about two more years.</li>
            <li>This razor is much more quiet than the Braun and gives a close shave without irritation.</li>
            <li>First Panasonic was bought in 1980.</li>
            <li>The first one I bought six years ago.  </li>
            <li>My first electric shaver was a Philips 3 head rotary model, switched to Braun 3525, Braun 3-2-1, Braun 7525, and Braun 8575.</li>
            <li>After charging the Panasonic up I had my first shave and let me say to any one thinking about purchasing an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>couple minutes more, no big deal)  </li>
            <li>Shipping as always was lightning fast from Amazon!</li>
            <li>So when I saw the Panasonic ES8103S Pro for close to $50 I got interested.</li>
            <li>But the next in line of the Panasonic  (ES8243A and ES-LA63-S) use 4 blades which I would prefer to stay away from, plus I don&#x27;t know why to expect that they are built any better.</li>
            <li>This is my first wet/dry shaver.  </li>
            <li>(TV&#x27;s, stereos, etc), I&#x27;m pretty confident the company put the same quality work into their shavers.      </li>
            <li>This is the first foil shaver I&#x27;ve tried, having used nothing but rotary types before.  </li>
            <li>This was the first electric razor I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li>The results were always the same, and no matter how many days I allowed for my skin to become accustomed.</li>
            <li>I received this razor today and just had my first shave.</li>
            <li>I have had many different brands of shavers over the years and none can compare with this shaver.</li>
            <li>and power light stopped working completely.</li>
            <li>The Braun is definitely the better razor but the $195.00 price was the reason I decided to try</li>
            <li>I love this shaver, and will NOT go back to Phillips/Norelco.....ever!</li>
            <li>The reviews were saying that it gives a pretty close shave</li>
            <li>Instead of nicks though, they&#x27;re more like tiny scrapes.  </li>
            <li>I have one area that no shaver has been able to cut close and this is no different.  </li>
            <li>I have tried 3-4 different brands earlier but this specific model is awesome.</li>
            <li>After cleaning the blades and replacing the foil, the foil many times does not \\&quot;catch\\&quot; and will fall off the next time I shave.  </li>
            <li>I had grown a beard for many years and had only used a blade the times that I had shaved.  </li>
            <li>And third, I love the cleaning feature.  </li>
            <li>It is now safe to say that I have purchased my LAST Braun shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One big bonus: spare parts are available!</li>
            <li>It is now safe to say that I have purchased my LAST Braun shaver.    </li>
            <li>One big bonus: spare parts are available!</li>
            <li>/&gt;In summary, the Panasonic rated higher than the Norelco in all areas with the exception of the warranty.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried it I was amazed at how close the shave is, almost as close as when using a razor.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much better than the last one</li>
            <li>This is the first review I have made on a purchase</li>
            <li>My foils and blades last well into 2 years and more.</li>
            <li>There are a couple of things to be aware of however.  </li>
            <li>First, don&#x27;t believe the number of uses the shaver literature</li>
            <li>It was the first time for me to purchase a Wet/Dry shaving system.</li>
            <li>You wouldn&#x27;t think one higher digit would make that much difference, but it this case it makes all the difference in the world!</li>
            <li>I broke the first one by dropping a couple stories when I was moving.    </li>
            <li>This is the first Panasonic shaver I have owned, I was always a Remington user.  </li>
            <li>I actually grow SO many fewer beards now, because I don&#x27;t dread</li>
            <li>Daily head washers are just more stuff to fiddle with and supplies to buy.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many over the last 25 years.    </li>
            <li>I knew I had to go back to the Panasonic razor that had lasted me for so many years of service.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this razor from Amazon and am finally again pleased with the shaves I am getting.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Panasonic!</li>
            <li>The first time I used the PANASONIC ES8103S</li>
            <li>My nine year old son says my face is as smooth as his.</li>
            <li>I get a close shave every time and the battery maintains a consistent charge.  </li>
            <li>From the first day it gave a close shave.</li>
            <li>8 months I am married to this shaver.</li>
            <li>That would be hot.........</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this to be much more affordable than my last 3-head rotary Remington.</li>
            <li>I found this to be much more affordable than my last 3-head rotary Remington.</li>
            <li>It not only does a great job shaving but the rechrageable battery holds a charge for a rather long time.</li>
            <li>The battery has performed exactly as advertised-</li>
            <li>The first week of shaves have been close.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this every day since I got it a month ago, so whatever it&#x27;s going to do, I&#x27;m fully aware of.</li>
            <li>and this is the first non-Braun razor I buy.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>he first time use it.  </li>
            <li>Stubble on your scalp is smaller and more even.</li>
            <li>Also be aware that this model will NOT allow shaving while it Charges.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is pretty awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does do a better job than my last</li>
            <li>Digital battery life remaining display (many shavers don&#x27;t even have this feature anymore).</li>
            <li>This is my first wet/dry shaver.</li>
            <li>but I would try different model to get a lot better experience.</li>
            <li>For the first time ever, I didn&#x27;t have to do that.</li>
            <li>First time, out of the box, closest shave I ever had.</li>
            <li>but I wanted to share my first thoughts.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only about 1.5 years since I&#x27;ve been using it, and while it worked, it worked ok.  </li>
            <li>My beard is regular and I&#x27;m pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li>I have used manual razors for many years and I finally decided to try an electric model.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to give the BIG razor companies any more of my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After choosing one from each in a specific price range I read as many reviews that I could find.</li>
            <li>First electric shaver for me.</li>
            <li>I have been extremely pleased for several months now with the Braun wet/dry 5040s.  </li>
            <li>It is the REAL DEAL folks!  </li>
            <li>Love this razor, would recommended it to anyone, especially guys who get razor burn.</li>
            <li>but you will have to make more than one swipe to get the job done  and it will take you about the same time as it takes to shave with a razor blade.</li>
            <li>I like the ease of this shaver ,cuts pretty close</li>
            <li>I shave with Panasonic and Braun most the time, and occasionally with Norelco.</li>
            <li>My first Braun lasted about 6 years.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic gives off a high-pitched hum - kinda like an electric mosquito - but is still more quiet than my Brauns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did a lot of searching for what would work for me (first time electric razor user) and with my thinner, lighter colored hair I needed the foil razor.</li>
            <li>This works pretty well.</li>
            <li>This one works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>If you use it with the Nivea Gel, the skin is so soft and smooth, that my wife keeps gliding her hands over my cheeks over and over again.    </li>
            <li>It is enjoyable and it appears to give facial skin a rejuvinated look.</li>
            <li>This is my second Panasonic, and I love it.</li>
            <li>smooth, but not harsh for skin.</li>
            <li>Look, it will hurt at first.</li>
            <li>However, at first, your sleeping partner may think that the alarm clock has gone off.</li>
            <li>To make sure that I wouldn&#x27;t run out of power mid-shave, I was constantly charging the women&#x27;s models.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t irritate on the first day and it still hasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>-Constantly misses hairs no matter how many times you try to shave them</li>
            <li>The first time I used this shaver</li>
            <li>I still prefer it over the Norelco, but may need to spend more in the future on a Braun</li>
            <li>It shaves better than the last 2 shavers I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a mid 60s-year-old man who has used a blade razor for more than 40 years.  </li>
            <li>It shaves close but is never uncomfortable on my face.</li>
            <li>All in all I am pleased with the experience and do not plan to move back to razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the screen that tells you the percentage of battery left.</li>
            <li>I think my usage may go back twenty years...possibly more.</li>
            <li>These many passes leave the skin all chafed and red.</li>
            <li>This is my first go at an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Got the razor, charged it up and used it the first morning I could.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic is a step up in technology and made a noticeable difference the first time.    </li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it four stars is not because of the shaver, but because the manufacturer promises more than the shaver can deliver.  </li>
            <li>first electric shaver</li>
            <li>I think it works even better on the upper lip.</li>
            <li>I suppose this caution is a bit unrepresentative of most users, as I shave my entire head, not just my face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a Panasonic wet/dry shaver user for many years now; this is my 3rd model</li>
            <li>It gets pretty close on my face but doesn&#x27;t at all on my neck.  </li>
            <li>First electric shaver I have used EVER.</li>
            <li>The head is smaller, easier to use and just does a better job.  </li>
            <li>Would be better yet if it were American Made.  </li>
            <li>This morning I finall got the shaver here in the Bahamas, Charged up and had my first use.</li>
            <li>For example, at first, I couldn&#x27;t shave my neck.</li>
            <li>If you are in the market looking for a smooth shave that will not irritate your face for those of us with sensitive skin keep on looking.</li>
            <li>This is the first razor that has left me razor bump free!</li>
            <li>No matter how many times I went back and forth over my neck area I would have stray hairs all over that I needed to get with a blade.  </li>
            <li>I also appreciate the ability to set closeness (&amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;) and the speed of the motor (&amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>this is my first item purchased at amazon</li>
            <li>If you do not already know, shaving is different for most every man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although the shave is pretty close on the face, for me it struggled on the jaw and neck area.</li>
            <li>I guess I was hoping it would do a tad better since I shave daily</li>
            <li>So for under $90 its a solid performer, and many people here have given it glowing reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s because the blade frequency is much higher than my Braun.  </li>
            <li>I never write reviews on Amazon (this is my first I believe).</li>
            <li>It gives a pretty close shave-</li>
            <li>Thanks, Panasonic !</li>
            <li>and it did an okay job, but for the most part, for the past 40 years I shaved with a blade.</li>
            <li>I first used the razor</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was interested in this model and the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>My beard is such that it needs a gel and blade most of the time.  </li>
            <li>Bought one for my son, and then bought one for me to replace my almost 20 year old Braun (which I love, but after a rebuild and a final death, I was ready for a more modern shave).</li>
            <li>Pros: the first shaver that worked on me.</li>
            <li>When the Panasonic ES8103S (Arc 3) was on sale, I decided for the first time to try a foil shaver.</li>
            <li>He has just now used it for the first time.</li>
            <li>I have tried the circular shavers for many years, but finally switched to this version.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what I want.  </li>
            <li>The blades are shot - the motor is making a funny noise.</li>
            <li>For the convenience, I was glad to go back to the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>but it burn out on me since i used it out of the country with a higher voltage.</li>
            <li>Glad this works internationally.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>My first one was still working well</li>
            <li>Very well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li>If you let it die (it gives you way more than enough notice with the display)</li>
            <li>I recommend at the discounted price, but at regular price there are better razor options out there.</li>
            <li>Exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>First one I dropped in the shower and broke a piece of the head.</li>
            <li>Pretty soon the line between a close shave and and hair extraction will be blurred.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone interested in purchasing an electric razor.</li>
            <li>I first got it</li>
            <li>at present it is better.</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, I even skip using aftershave lotion most days because it&#x27;s not necessary.  </li>
            <li>I love the digital battery life display.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to use it without the need for a touch up with regular shaving razors.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s an improvement on the first.  </li>
            <li>When I first received this shaver it worked well.  </li>
            <li>So I was pretty disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received my Panasonic ES8103S the first week of June.  </li>
            <li>Initially I was quite pleased.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time to use an electric razor in 40 yrs of shaving with lather.</li>
            <li>but this one was close from the first shave.  </li>
            <li>When i first received the product i thought it will not work well on my skin</li>
            <li>This was my first electric shaver.</li>
            <li>smooth shave 10 days use after full charge would recommend to anyone looking for shaving satisfaction and very quiet performance</li>
            <li>Exactly as ordered.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric shaver.</li>
            <li>This is my first wet/dry shaver</li>
            <li>It is still holding up pretty well.  </li>
            <li>They do not recommend cleaning under hot water.  </li>
            <li>The key is shopping online for blades and parts because if you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll end up spending the price of the shaver or more for each replacement set.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty compulsive about shaving -</li>
            <li>but my first Panasonic made me a convert, and the upgrade to linear deepened my enthusiasm.</li>
            <li>As electric shavers go, it&#x27;s pretty quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Reliable razor - my first electric.</li>
            <li>The Braun had a bigger name and more blah blah to it.</li>
            <li>it is what a shaver would be if Apple made one ;-)</li>
            <li>This is my first electric shaver in over 20 years.  </li>
            <li>This was and is my first electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>I think my review would be higher.  </li>
            <li>shaver isn&#x27;t the most silent one</li>
            <li>I used it first time in my life, I been hesitating to buy it</li>
            <li>I call this a &#x27;finishing&#x27; razor because if you have only one day of stubble, this will shave your face to razor-closeness, or even better.</li>
            <li>Being able to replace the battery is another big plus.</li>
            <li>say it gets uncomfortably hot.  </li>
            <li>think a lot of one&#x27;s reaction to the first use of this (or any) electric shaver is affected by what one has been used to.  </li>
            <li>First, I used safety razors.  </li>
            <li>I just now used it the first time.</li>
            <li>Had to make too many passes over the same spot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve shaved for 50 years, mostly with a razor, and I&#x27;ve finally found an electric shaver I like.</li>
            <li>whereas the Braun has a pleasing hum, the Panasonic sounds more like a giant hornet.</li>
            <li>I rinse it out after shaving and wipe it off, blow through the foil and the cutters to get rid of most of the water, and leave it open on the counter to finish drying.    </li>
            <li>This is by far the best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric, and I&#x27;m using it with cheap Barbasol, not some expensive cream, by the way.  </li>
            <li>If you have a thick beard(like my husband)you probably won&#x27;t be happy with it.</li>
            <li>i am a first time electric user.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty.</li>
            <li>But after a couple of weeks of using it, it started to work pretty well, even around the neck and adam&#x27;s apple area.   </li>
            <li>I have balding clippers that i use first</li>
            <li>First thing out of the box was to plug in the shaver to charge it.  </li>
            <li>So much nicer than the Panasonic it replaced!</li>
            <li>pretty frequently.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;This will be my first electric razor.</li>
            <li>I am thinking many are being too critical of electric shavers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll probably add more later.</li>
            <li>I am thinking many are being too critical of electric shavers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll probably add more later.</li>
            <li>If this exact one comes out with longer battery life and it works with the cord plugged in when the battery runs out of juice</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, long charge, close shave.  </li>
            <li>pretty much exactly what he was looking for.</li>
            <li>All shavers for some funny reason dont allow me to shave when plugged in.</li>
            <li>I love the digital readout and the wet/dry ability of this shaver.</li>
            <li>Compared to an old school razor, this is light years more convenient for almost the same exact results.</li>
            <li>Works OK but display syarted acting up within 3 months</li>
            <li>First thing</li>
            <li>Charges pretty fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was shipped promptly, but the first one I received would not charge so</li>
            <li>Based on the reviews, I bought the Panasonic ES8103S and tried it for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li>Much better than my last Panasonic model.  </li>
            <li>Battery charge last for more than a week.</li>
            <li>The first one, I ordered to replace an electric shaver I used on my legs.  </li>
            <li>you NEED to use the trimmer first.  </li>
            <li>It would probably work better in the shower, but there are non-shaver related reasons which make that impractical.  </li>
            <li>Have had an opportunity to use this shaver over the past several weekends, and I am impressed.  </li>
            <li>It makes a humming sound that is not too loud.</li>
            <li>Unlike the Braun electro-foil shavers, this Panasonic seems to oscillate at a much higher frequency, I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>rarely write reviews as my review history will show, but this is such a good shaver that I actually felt compelled to write a review about it.  </li>
            <li>rarely write reviews as my review history will show, but this is such a good shaver that I actually felt compelled to write a review about it.  </li>
            <li>First of all, they already have the fastest motor (13K RPM when you buy the Linear models) out of any shaver out there.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric shaver ever, and I just received it today</li>
            <li>Probably not terrible for the time it is in use each day shaving that big head of mine.  </li>
            <li>COSTING MORE DOUBLE THE PRICE.</li>
            <li>Having formerly used a Remington two-blade Titanium electric razor for many years, I feel qualified to review this Panasonic</li>
            <li>/&gt;Razors in general with a straight head design are just comical to me.  </li>
            <li>Plus they actually pivot with your face and make so much more sense.</li>
            <li>and I am pleased with the actual shaver.</li>
            <li>I have not had it for long but so far so good.</li>
            <li>the only thing I dont like about this product is that you cannot use it while charging it, my concern is that with time, when the battery starts to wear off I may not be able to use it.</li>
            <li>but I was pretty sure that it was a piece of junk that wouldn&#x27;t last but a couple years</li>
            <li>Although many of the shavers I looked at, bought and took back stated they would work corded as well as cordless, they will not work without a functioning battery.</li>
            <li>It is pretty close to a razor shave without all the prep.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hot creamy shave in the shower.</li>
            <li>My son needed his first razor.  </li>
            <li>Nice close shave with minimal touch up with a hand razor.</li>
            <li>and I also am getting a pretty close shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This also recharges pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I charge it about once each week and rinse it under the hot water</li>
            <li>At first it felt funny</li>
            <li>The shaver have a digital led screen can show you how many power remaining so it is convinent.</li>
            <li>Very close shave without the nicks and burns!  </li>
            <li>When I first turned it on the display showed 10% charged</li>
            <li>Anyway, I&#x27;m going back to the rotary type, It did a much better job for me.</li>
            <li>I see the first review of this item is from 2011.</li>
            <li>On top of that the charge only lasts for about three days of usage and  you can&#x27;t run it off of the cord; it has to be charged.  </li>
            <li>The only difference between the two is that the newer model has a travel lock switch like most Pannys.</li>
            <li>spend the extra money on a better shaver.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, keeps its charge a long time and doesn&#x27;t pull or knick my skin.</li>
            <li>Our first one lasted 4+ years and then the electronics went out, so we had to replace it.</li>
            <li>Took my skin a couple of weeks to completely get used to it, but after that it was smooth sailing.</li>
            <li>It also runs a top speed, even with just 10% left in charge.</li>
            <li>For a much higher cost mind you.</li>
            <li>it does exactly what it says it can do.</li>
            <li>so they tend to last longer, which means in most cases</li>
            <li>I first got the product, I would have rated it a 4.8 out of 5.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- indicator of how much battery left in the shaver and If u need to wash it or not!&lt;br /&gt;- easy to clean</li>
            <li>After using Norelco rotary razors for more than 30 years, I decided to try something different when replacement time arrived this time.</li>
            <li>After a moment or two of getting accustomed to the different grip and different shaving motion required, I found that it was both comfortable and highly effective.</li>
            <li>I think that it is a good deal because it has some great features and it isn&#x27;t as expensive as the bigger name competitors.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have is that the plastic cover on top is pretty fragile, and if you drop it 4 or 5 feet, you better be praying that murphy&#x27;s law doesn&#x27;t land it on that spot that makes it crack and break.</li>
            <li>I have found the Panasonic Razor to be fast charging, quiet, reliable, and easy to clean after shaving.</li>
            <li>pretty sooth shave.</li>
            <li>I have owed many different electric shavers in my 83 years!</li>
            <li>Its better to use the regular stick instead of shaving with this.</li>
            <li>Shaving doesn&#x27;t hurt and I don&#x27;t have to take a hot shower to soften up my beard</li>
            <li>really smooth, and my 71 year old face can use it!&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>why the price here is much higher than it on the Amazon.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The Arc3 is my first electric shaver; I&#x27;ve been sticking it out with a Gillette Sensor Excel but wanted a change in my shaving routine.  </li>
            <li>When finished with Norleco, just pop the top and blow out the shaving \\&quot;dust\\&quot;, then put it back in the charging cradle until tomorrow.  </li>
            <li>The only reason he doesn&#x27;t love it is because it doesn&#x27;t have a stand to place it while it dries.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d make a guess that anyone who shaves their head regularly would be glad to have this.</li>
            <li>A gift for my son, his first shaver.</li>
            <li>As others have mentioned, the shaver gives a very close shave and the pivot motion is useful.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>But in the last 3-4 years, I haven&#x27;t been satisfied with my shaves.  </li>
            <li>First Experience</li>
            <li>Cuts pretty close.  </li>
            <li>and I was only able to use it dry.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first charged this baby up and shaved with it</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also used the machine on my legs and it does a pretty dandy</li>
            <li>Always against the grain of hair growth at first.</li>
            <li>pros of this machine most definitely outweigh the cons.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>My first Panasonic brand</li>
            <li>I have had it for 2 years now, and the battery still holds a charge for well over a week of consistent use before needing to be recharged.</li>
            <li>This shaver really does the job!</li>
            <li>Though higher priced made in Japan shavers (ES8103S is made in China)</li>
            <li>But, I threw that one away after using this one for the first time, and I will tell you why.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first got this shaver, I plugged it in to charge, which it did within a couple hours from 20% to 100%.  </li>
            <li>should point out there is one thing to be aware of.  </li>
            <li>I was pretty underwhelmed with this razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used multiple brands of Electric Shavers and this one is by far the most comfortable and battery efficient.</li>
            <li>However, for a shaver at this price, I&#x27;d expect that it would be more quiet.</li>
            <li>First off: I&#x27;m 17</li>
            <li>however, this razer gets very close, much closer than my old $20 Norelco (of course it was 3x more)</li>
            <li>Wish I could have kept my first one, would have, but the parts were discontinued</li>
            <li>I have no buyer&#x27;s remorse with this shaver, which is a first for me.</li>
            <li>It does struggle with some of the longer hairs, but it&#x27;s a pretty infrequent problem.  </li>
            <li>I would say that the shave I am getting is pretty close to what I would expect from a razor blade.  </li>
            <li>Just received this shaver yesterday and used it for the first time today.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love it.</li>
            <li>At first I thought the Panasonic was a toy.</li>
            <li>It literally is like using a hot knife to cut butter.</li>
            <li>switched from a rotary to get a closer shave &amp; this does that so overall I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li>First off, before this I was using a $20 trimmer.</li>
            <li>This was my first electric shaver I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>but it is pretty darn close.</li>
            <li>This is my fifth panasonic shaver, the first one made in China, and I have stubble four hours after I shave.</li>
            <li>Price was pretty good&lt;</li>
            <li>I love it immensely.</li>
            <li>This is the second Panasonic I have had and love it.  </li>
            <li>Finally, we found an electric razor that gives a close, smooth shave and doesn&#x27;t irritate!  </li>
            <li>:  The battery doesn&#x27;t last for more than about 5 or 6 shaves.  </li>
            <li>Cuts pretty close albeit not like a blade.  </li>
            <li>My first shaver lasted four months before it would no longer hold a charge.</li>
            <li>I have been using electric shavers for over 30 years, and tried many different brands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a Norelco and this and have to say that they&#x27;re pretty even.  </li>
            <li>It shaves pretty close</li>
            <li>This was the first one I put in my wish list</li>
            <li>: They cost too much!</li>
            <li>and then maintain the areas with the shaver, it might make it easier the first time you try it on your bikini or speedo zone</li>
            <li>Was difficult picking a razor for my husband, but this one works perfect.  </li>
            <li>a bit longer to wash, and requires both hands to take apart before cleaning (most of Philips only requires one click opening up for rinse!!!!!!!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love Japanese products</li>
            <li>If you use it with the Nivea Gel, the skin is so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s to sad ( with this feature it would be a best electric chawer)</li>
            <li>I have a pretty protruding adam&#x27;s apple, and not even that gets irritated when I glide over</li>
            <li>Is his first electric razor.</li>
            <li>Just open the top, add some soap, run under water, rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned many of them and the same thing happens</li>
            <li>THIS IS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH AN ELECTRIC RAZOR, AND FOR ALL INTENSIVE PURPOSES I FIND IT</li>
            <li>I have tried many more expensive razors and they don&#x27;t do any better.</li>
            <li>I have had it for 6 months now, and feel I have gotten my moneys worth for how much I shave my legs.</li>
            <li>I have tried the Norelco Shavers a couple of times and they were okay, but I kept going back to the razor for a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>The first lasted over 5 years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many men&#x27;s razors and this is the only reasonably-priced one that works on the contours of a woman&#x27;s leg.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean too, and a charge lasts pretty long.</li>
            <li>This is my first.</li>
            <li>First product I have found that does no leave razor burn.</li>
            <li>But I find it gives me a close enough shave not to look scruffy from a distance, but if I am meeting with people I need to look fully respectable in front of, I need to get out the lather and razor blades.  </li>
            <li>but when my $$$ Braun gave up the ghost after just 2 years I decided to break ranks and go with Panasonic after reading  pretty favorable reviews.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I started using a electric shaver</li>
            <li>My husband has been using this razor since it first came out, and just loves it.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I didn&#x27;t buy a Braun</li>
            <li>Overall, I am satisfied with the ES8103S.</li>
            <li>Got exactly what i expected and does nicely.</li>
            <li>My sons first electric razor &amp; he loves it.</li>
            <li>Top 10 because different site have different reviews, but the ones I saw, this one was in there, within the top.  </li>
            <li>for a low- to medium-priced electric razor it shaves OK.</li>
            <li>the battery does not last for more than a week for me.  </li>
            <li>The sound level is a bit higher in pitch than my old model.</li>
            <li>This is the first electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used so</li>
            <li>I bought this almost exactly 2 years ago.</li>
            <li>After several passes over one area, it wouldn&#x27;t give a smooth shave, it might eventually but gave up as my old foil shaver worked much better.</li>
            <li>buy into all the gimmicks - Buy this razor first -it</li>
            <li>An now, many months later, it works as well as the day I first used it.</li>
            <li>I still use my Norelco for the first time around, and the Panasonic to finish the job.  </li>
            <li>It takes more than multiple passes to shave.</li>
            <li>I would say that the quality of the shave is appropriate to the price level (which is in the middle).</li>
            <li>sooth cut &amp; soft sound</li>
            <li>as when I first bought it.</li>
            <li>most likely will be using an electric razor on my head for the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However, I do not believe that it is better than a pre-shave oil and a shaving cream such as Proraso.</li>
            <li>under chin are pretty dense.  </li>
            <li>I am willing to learn\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am willing to learn\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I thought I&#x27;d try an electric, the first in my 68 years.</li>
            <li>This is my first Panasonic and</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it is suppose to, shaves as close or closer than&lt;br /&gt;any</li>
            <li>I wound up first using my Norelco to cut the longer hairs and then finishing with the Panasonic for a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this shaver really takes the prize!</li>
            <li>The first one lasted 5 years at which time the battery would not keep a charge.</li>
            <li>Even if it would last two or three years I will be pleased.</li>
            <li>Granted the sores are few &amp; superficial, but maybe using \\&quot;aftershave\\&quot; is a good idea to help serialize the area after shaving.  </li>
            <li>It is a good shaver, but for my hand the shaver shape is not comfortable.</li>
            <li>if not closer (since you can go opposite way much easier) than my Gillette fusion, which was surprising and unexpected.</li>
            <li>but the neck and chin are some trouble spots for the shaver but all and all good shaver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this a few months now, its good.  </li>
            <li>is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a cradle; the one thing I liked about my old Panasonic razor was that it had an inductive charging cradle which was very convenient, and because the charging was inductive it meant the shaver was completely sealed.</li>
            <li>I had trouble finding a good shaver at this price point.</li>
            <li>These Panasonic models will give you a good shave if you plan to use them for just a few months and them throw them away.</li>
            <li>For the price, this is a good value if it lasts a few years</li>
            <li>I was expecting this model ES8103s to be better than my old ES8066 model which was rugged, good quality, and long lasting (10 years).</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the wet function becomes very useful - after each use, you can actually clean it under running water!</li>
            <li>The Panasonic is very easy on my face and never irritates my skin but shaving dry doesn&#x27;t give the closest shave I ever had.  </li>
            <li>This is a great shaver and beat my old Braun 7 series hands down.</li>
            <li>I have a very tough beard and this is hands-down the best shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I am not interested in using it in the shower, but still pleased that I can rinse it under the faucet to clean it.  </li>
            <li>it seems that I do spend a bit longer with this model, doing several passes to get my face just right, but that might just be my own idiosyncrasies and getting used to the floating head (the old Braun would just pivot).</li>
            <li>single charge lasts for over a week and the razor is very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to buy this razor as an open box item for $45 (yay me) and I am very, very pleased with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a new series 3 Braun as a gift which I probably would have bought myself, since I was satisfied with my old Braun.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I decided to use these due to the reviews promising a more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts a very long time, it is relatively quiet, and gives a great shave.</li>
            <li>Very powerful compared to my old Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty good but slower than my almost 25 year old Braun single blade plug in razor.</li>
            <li>To clean this razor the manual shows several steps you should take to clean including the use of a hand soap and running the razor with the sonic speed.</li>
            <li>The technology is much more advanced than the previous model.</li>
            <li>This shaver effortlessly gives me an incredibly close shave whether I use it wet OR dry.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and dry.  </li>
            <li>It is quiet, the swivel head is comfortable, and the shave is quick and close.  </li>
            <li>Oh yes, incredibly easy to clean, rinse and let dry</li>
            <li>I have been shaving with a similar Panasonic for about 5 years and my pleasant experience was key in selecting this one for him.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it, it&#x27;s durable, easy to use and has stood the test of time so far.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and works better than I expected.</li>
            <li>You can clean it with soap and water instead of any expensive solution, the upfront purchase cost is reasonable, and the quality of the shave is very good.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer blade opens out at a 90-degree angle, which is more practical for shaving necks and sideburns than other shavers he has owned, where the blade simply rose above the foils.</li>
            <li>It also charges very fast and the indicators are very useful in telling you how much power is left and when it needs a clean.</li>
            <li>Even having been using an electric shaver for 20+ years, it still took about 3 full weeks for my face to get fully used to the new shaver.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to matter how much you spend, you just have to keep looking for the right combination and for the moment anyway, I think I have found it.</li>
            <li>However, right out of the gate, it did give me a much closer shave.</li>
            <li>shave my head bald and have a very angular face if it does me right</li>
            <li>The battery life leaves something to be desired, but right now, it works very well.</li>
            <li>I liked the results so much I started using it on the little blonde hair on my face, too, and am loving the results.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with my new Panasonic ES8103 arc3 Electric Shaver wet or dry.</li>
            <li>After a year and half of having this shaver, I am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>If the blades don&#x27;t last more than a year, then, I am not sure it is worth paying more than the cheap Norelco.</li>
            <li>No less than 10 passes to get a smooth mustache area.</li>
            <li>I find that different parts of my face are best served by using different modes, and it&#x27;s a quick flick of the switch to move from one to the other.</li>
            <li>I took it a little easy with the first shave (dry) and applied more pressure today and had very smooth results.</li>
            <li>Nice razor gives a better cut than my braun but my braun blades are very dull.</li>
            <li>Anyone else who is tired of cheap plastic &amp;#34;make believe&amp;#34; products from China (no disrespect for this great country or its people), I highly recommend the Braun series 5.</li>
            <li>My beard is mixed between very light and very heavy and the Panasonic does fairly well in all areas.  </li>
            <li>It shaves closer and in less time than my prior older model Panasonic that did good service for many years.</li>
            <li>I can use it half up getting one good shave whereas my older heavier one will last a week and do a better job.</li>
            <li>I have owned 12 or more shavers in the last 20 years, and this is one of the better ones, very close shave, I think closer than Braun&#x27;s big one I also have.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with both products, but thought that the components would be a little more interchangeable--this new shaver will not recharge in the cleaning/charging station with my first shaver, and even the power tips are different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unless you use it all the time you&#x27;ll find that is gets kind of a moldy smell and quite frankly you can clean this razor just as well if not better with soap and water than the cleaning station can.</li>
            <li>It provides a really nice clean shave and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like others have in the past.</li>
            <li>While this Panasonic ES8103S gives a better face / neck shave under the chin, the Skull Shaver Bald Eagle does a better job for skull / entire head (especially for getting around ears and easily reaching around to do back of head and neck).</li>
            <li>Used the product both wet and dry - only did a fair job in removing leg hair - for light surfaces it worked better.</li>
            <li>but I had higher expectation for this product after all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>This little jewel has given me the most comfortable and closest shave that I have had in decades.  </li>
            <li>As long as I don&#x27;t grow too much of a beard, I can get a clean face very quickly</li>
            <li>The shave is close yet gentle, it holds a long charge, and it is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Shaver works very well with the nonotech blades system and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and turn it all red like my old norelco rotary shaver , very satisfied with purchase if the shaver holds up for a couple of years</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;ve read that the blades get the mesh warm due to friction</li>
            <li>I get a nice close shave on my face but the other areas are an issue.  </li>
            <li>The only issue is its battery, although still pretty good, not the same as it was advertised.</li>
            <li>Blades nice and sharp after about 6 months of use.</li>
            <li>It cuts better on the flat surfaces of the face than it does on the curves.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Agree with other reviewer it would be nice to have a stand</li>
            <li>someone with sensitive skin, I was excited to see how this would work.</li>
            <li>Due to the high cost of replacement razors for Gillette Fusion and the inevitable nicks and cuts that come from using even very good cartridge razors, I started looking around for an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>I find the unlocked position gives me the best shaves, and the wide head gives you a lot of beard real estate to mow down with one pass.  </li>
            <li>I am also finding that as I get more familiar with an electric razor it takes less time.</li>
            <li>though this model is hypoallergenic, the friction against the skin of day-to-day shaving can still cause some degree of irritation, so again, as previously stated, it is best to adopt a 4-day-to every other day shave regimen (M W Fri Sa), instead of every day.</li>
            <li>The other thing I love is the quick charge of this thing in about an hour</li>
            <li>It does not irritate the skin and is able to reach most of the hard to reach spots.</li>
            <li>Owned this for a couple of years and still has great battery life and provides quick electric shaving dry or wet!</li>
            <li>I did a quick math and realized that for the money I spend on the replacement cartridges, I can buy a new electric shave every year.  </li>
            <li>As soon as I get the new shaver, I was happy to see that it finally came, but at the same time nervous as hell to use it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this one because of the longevity of my last one and expecting this new razor to be as good as my old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tested it wet with shaving later, and it worked great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and empty.  </li>
            <li>I had a 15 year old Braun which worked, but wasn&#x27;t particularly fast or comfortable.  </li>
            <li>However the on/off switch is way to easy to press while in use - Panasonic need to either relocate the switch or make it less easy to press by accident.</li>
            <li>The only thing that does not hold up to Panasonic&#x27;s claims is the battery life on a charge - it is 3 to 4 shaves for me compared to the 12 or more promised, but I do not really care about this - it is quick and easy to recharge.  </li>
            <li>Not only was it quick, the shave was much closer than I have ever experienced with ANY of my previous razors.</li>
            <li>Really nice to be able to use it wet or dry.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH more comfortable than my old Philips Norelco dry shaver.</li>
            <li>It definitely worked better in the shower than dry, and even better with shaving</li>
            <li>The only criticism I have is that this shaver does not do a good job on the upper lip.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t travel abroad that much, and when I do, I bring a converter, so being able to plug into a wall outlet directly in essentially any country isn&#x27;t that valuable of a feature to me.  </li>
            <li>Almost a work of art - fine instrument  Holds a long charge  Charges quickly  </li>
            <li>I love that you can see how much charge is left.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would recommend buying this product if you don&#x27;t have problems with ingrown hairs and don&#x27;t mind spending some time shaving (which is ironic because I thought the point of an electric shaver was to shave more quickly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My suggestion is to give it a good 3 weeks of regular use and if you don&#x27;t like it send it back.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;I really love this neat razor, so much that I won&#x27;t go back to hand razors.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it, a good option even just to pick up if you&#x27;re looking for an occasional alternative to using your blade w/o breaking the bank.</li>
            <li>If you let your facial hair grow out more than a day, this shaver will not do very well.</li>
            <li>Found this model almost as close as 3-4 blade devices, much easier to use, and better at handling spots where hairs grow in different directions.</li>
            <li>Super simple to clean.</li>
            <li>the only reason it got 4 stars instead of 5 was because the &amp;#34;clippers&amp;#34; on the back aren&#x27;t good at all...</li>
            <li>so I decided since the overall shave wasn&#x27;t good enough</li>
            <li>The floating head feature can be disabled, but I found it to make the shave more comfortable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The four row shaver is only good if your face is totally beard free.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Only thing good about it from my perspective is that it is quiet.  </li>
            <li>I used to have a Braun and this is far, far better, smoother, faster, closer.  </li>
            <li>I do not know why my shaving is better than I found initially, and I really don&#x27;t care.  </li>
            <li>not as close a shave as with a regular bladed razor with shaving gel, but good enough when in a hurry,</li>
            <li>This razor gives a shave near as smooth as a straight edge.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works far better then my old Norelco shaver.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks now, and I really love the smooth shave.</li>
            <li>While I miss the sensuous design of the old razor, I have to admit that the quality of the shave with the floating head is significantly better than old model.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not gonna be quite as close as a razor, but truthfully, the difference is so minimal that the trade-off is worth</li>
            <li>7/10 (The shave itself is great as far as machines go, but the fact that it misses a few hairs and doesn&#x27;t do my neck as well as I&#x27;d like lowers the rating a bit.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of different shavers lately, and this is one of the best.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t use the shaver while it is plugged into the charger.&lt;br /&gt;Neither of these are a deal breaker and if I can ever get over my old habit of shaving for 5 minutes like I did with my old shavers just to get all the whiskers, I should be able to increase my battery life.</li>
            <li>Husband has looked at more expensive ones, but I saw the good housekeeping seal.</li>
            <li>The price was fair and the replacement blades are not as expensive as many others out there.</li>
            <li>There are similarly priced 3-blade models that I think give a closer shave, so I think the retail price on this is very inflated, and I would be hard-pressed to pay more than $50 for this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It produces a good shave, is quiet, and simple to maintain.</li>
            <li>Shave is about the same when used daily, maybe not as good.</li>
            <li>At least I got a good laugh.</li>
            <li>Also, I found a fantastic review someone wrote about the different electrics under Sensotouch &amp; the Arc 4 review section...which is worth a view if you want to go deeper.  </li>
            <li>Almost the same, good battery status and solid performance.</li>
            <li>hard to get my neck right, but all and all a good razor.  </li>
            <li>Far superior than all other razors available.&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic really cares to make the design and quality they are known for.&lt;br /&gt;BEST BUY!</li>
            <li>The high speed motor really cuts the stubble quickly.</li>
            <li>With very gentle pressure against my skin, it quickly and completely shaves off all my whiskers.</li>
            <li>very close shave charges very fast</li>
            <li>Shaves fast, very fast.</li>
            <li>Highly reccomend this unit and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sparse facial hair that doesn&#x27;t grow too rapidly and isn&#x27;t very coarse, but I still have to go over and over most spots to get a *relatively* smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>The performance-to-price is high, so it is really worth to buy this model.</li>
            <li>I still get a fine shave, just not as close as a wet shave with this razor, but far better than acceptable.</li>
            <li>While it works great in general large spots on the face, the head on this shaver is so big that I can&#x27;t really get to the harder spots on my neck as easily as my Norelco did.</li>
            <li>Certainly there are other models out there for more money (including the higher end Panasonic) but for the money this is WELL worth it.</li>
            <li>I shaved dry with this at first and was pleased.</li>
            <li>The first one has served me well for over 4 years with one change of blades and foil and is still going strong, but I plan to stop changing em and use it only for travel.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a considerable decrease in razor burn which I am super grateful for, however the first 2 shaves</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks: After first use, I started doing dry shave, and just love the result.  </li>
            <li>First one is used almost daily and is still going strong after almost 3 years.</li>
            <li>The first one was still going strong after 10 years, but I replaced it only because I had the urge.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, and I like the new feature telling me how much charge I have left in the battery.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband based on all the positive reviews. . .</li>
            <li>so I decided to try this one after all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>After reading the mostly positive reviews, I decided to purchase this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband after reading all the positive reviews about it.</li>
            <li>Coming from a cheaper brand, which is no longer as efficient after 2 years of use and a blade replacement, I thought I was getting an upgrade after reading all the positive reviews on this brand &amp; model.</li>
            <li>I read the positive amazon reviews and decided to take a chance.</li>
            <li>Amazon is always a positive experience.  </li>
            <li>But as my neckline was getting irritated and based on a sale and generally positive reviews I bought this and have been trying it for 3 weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When it was time to purchase a new one (rechargeable batteries weren&#x27;t holding a charge any more), I was surprised the same model was still available.</li>
            <li>I use it dry and it gives me a very smooth shave, with no skin irritation.</li>
            <li>Until my purchase of this electric razor I have used a combination of blades and a trusty Braun 7000 Series that was adequate for a second shave if needed in the evening (fast growth) but was too much work to use as a primary shaver.</li>
            <li>It was about as cheap to order this new unit at the special price rather than ordering a new battery, head and cutter for the old one.</li>
            <li>This razor is easy to clean, comfortable in the hand, and I can get six to ten days of shaving on a single charge.  </li>
            <li>Extremely close shave, easy to use and clean.    </li>
            <li>The cheap Remis were hurting my face, but the Panasonic is real smooth and makes a soothing &#x27;angry mosquito&#x27; sound.  </li>
            <li>The quality of the shaving is very close to a blade and maybe even higher considering no nicks, cuts, irritation, etc.</li>
            <li>On the first shave I really thought I wasn&#x27;t going to like this unit, but the manual says stick with it to allow your face to adjust to it.</li>
            <li>I have used Braun electric shavers in my 20&#x27;s, also with some irritation and in-grown hairs on the neck pretty much all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is pretty much a &#x27;one pass&#x27; shaver.  </li>
            <li>It will remove some hair but it takes many, many passes over the same area to do even a partial removal.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic gets all the hairs on the first pass and it shaves really close.</li>
            <li>First you will have to shave with a real razor and then just try to keep things trimmed up with this one, which defeats the purpose.  </li>
            <li>It does okay as long as you don&#x27;t let your beard get beyond a stubble.</li>
            <li>It used to be that a quality product cost more but paid for itself in the long run.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure Panasonic is not wishing that it lasts that long either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The higher RPMs of the motor made shaving much easier.</li>
            <li>#34;had it for 15 years&amp;#34; Would recommend this to anyone who wants a close shave, fast!</li>
            <li>This is a much lighter weight shaver compared to my Braun shaver and it has a much higher speed motor inside.  </li>
            <li>I am glad that I spend a little more to get a little more.</li>
            <li>I also found that it feels much warmer, almost hot, as it passes over my skin.  </li>
            <li>This is the first that didn&#x27;t and was a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;s been working, but I continue to love these electrics.</li>
            <li>So I wet my face, dabbed some shaving cream on, and was pleasantly surprised to get a smoother, more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>At first use I didn&#x27;t like it much.</li>
            <li>Recommend it for first time electric shaver users or anyone who wants a replacement.</li>
            <li>This is my first modern day panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li>give it four stars for, \\&quot;I like it\\&quot; because it pretty much does everything I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>If I let my beard grow too long, I have to use the trimmer (which is top notch, by the way) before shaving.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really judge it from the first time.</li>
            <li>This panasonic shaver I really love when I let my beard grow too long.</li>
            <li>even better is that it actually cuts through my clark kent-like facial hair and gives me a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>No missed hairs here and there, as with his old razor, easy to clean and moderately priced too!</li>
            <li>Takes to long to shave with it to be able to shave in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shaves pretty fast</li>
            <li>than these few cons, I am really enjoying this shaver, and my sensitive face is even more thankful that I made the switch!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>With all electrics, if you let your stubble get too long it takes longer to shave and you will get more irritation.</li>
            <li>Evidently does not need charging very often.</li>
            <li>love it and battery life is truly long.</li>
            <li>This goes a long way at making me feel better about my shave.</li>
            <li>it really works very well,I like it!</li>
            <li>and I have to wait an extra day to shave again, but other than that the razor has been great.</li>
            <li>The battery seems to go pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I loved Braun, but they are excessively over priced.</li>
            <li>I have had one in the past and was a good product.   </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually share, but my buddy is a good friend.</li>
            <li>The trimmer works good, but I think the slide switch is a bit too small.</li>
            <li>I have no trouble with the number of shaves that you get with a full charge.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure how this has any good reviews.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as good if not slightly better.</li>
            <li>when I find something good, they usually quit making it or &amp;#34;improve&amp;#34; it (not).  </li>
            <li>I chose it because Consumer Reports ranked it near the top and yet the price is fairly modest compared to the very best-ranked models.  </li>
            <li>Also cleans up quick and easy without special equipment, the Braun had a bulky cleaning tub that required regular refills of a cleaning fluid.  </li>
            <li>It requires many, many, many passes over and over the same area in different directions (even upside down) pulling my skin this way and</li>
            <li>I was so happy to have a decent razor, and read in the manual  that you should use it wet for the first several times.  </li>
            <li>After going through the reviews ,i have bought this and after first use \\&quot;WOW ! ! !</li>
            <li>Unless you&#x27;re OK with needing 10 minutes to shave (and having to clean up afterwards with a safety razor), don&#x27;t waste your money on this model.  </li>
            <li>stubbornly continuing to dry shave for many years with my Panasonics, I have for the last 5 years enjoyed better results by wet shaving (with Aveeno shave gel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it miiiight help with trimming down some before shaving, but honestly-</li>
            <li>Quick quiet and adequate.</li>
            <li>Does not shave as quickly and close as previous Panasonics I have owned but works better than a Norelco and Remington.</li>
            <li>Does a decent job, can quickly look decent in couple of minutes.  </li>
            <li>Since this razor had a seal of approval from Consumer Digest and we own other Panasonic brands, it was a slam dunk!  </li>
            <li>I can shave her even if she hasn&#x27;t recently had a shower, but I get better results when the skin/hair is still soft and damp right after bathing.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to hold in the hand, and has a selectable flex head, or keep it fixed, I like both settings for different parts of my beard.</li>
            <li>This has been a pretty good shaver, though I should note that the battery life is less than my old Braun.  </li>
            <li>, I decided recently to try the Panasonic ES 8103s based on the strong positive reviews on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>When my most recent Braun died I looked around and this Panasonic kept coming up with high reviews.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor for top, back, sides, and front of any head.</li>
            <li>I had used Norelco Phillips for a long time, but this one delivered a very close, smooth shave from the very first time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve rotated the blades once to be sure that they weren&#x27;t dulling, but I really think I could have gotten another few months out of their original position.  </li>
            <li>Shaves my tough old Italian beard like it was peach fuzz, close, smooth, fast  and in perfect comfort.</li>
            <li>and it looks and smells fresh as new.</li>
            <li>reviews here are pretty accurate overall in terms of the quality of the shave you get.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I have my trusty old Norelco or I would be growing a beard with no razor.</li>
            <li>I think it works better when it is dry.</li>
            <li>Especially like the curved head design, easy to get under the chin.</li>
            <li>I like how I can use it dry if I&#x27;m in a hurry, or can take more time and use water and shaving creme to get a closer shave when I have time.</li>
            <li>Easy to use pop out trimmer same as Norelco.  </li>
            <li>The digital screen in addition to indicating remaining battery life (6-7 confortable shaves per charge) also tells you when to wash the unit with handsoap and water which is quite easy.  </li>
            <li>I mostly shave dry, works well for me.</li>
            <li>but I hit those with a dry razor real quick</li>
            <li>Granted, this is also the first electric ive ever spent more than $60 on</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also used to a coiled cord, which takes up less space in a bag and doesn&#x27;t require a twist tie to keep it tidy.</li>
            <li>we have too many minerals in our water for me to trust that it will dry without leaving deposits on my blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upshot: any shaver purchase will be hit or miss.</li>
            <li>He has really sensitive skin and is super finicky about everything.</li>
            <li>so I have some thicker stubble after this thing mows through it and leaves my face super soft.</li>
            <li>No more skin irritation, works great so far been using 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I prefer using it dry, but it did ok the one time I used it in the shower.    </li>
            <li>Cleaning is easy, you just open the unit up and run under water.</li>
            <li>I find it works better dry than in the shower.</li>
            <li>The sideburn trimmer is nice, plus less irritation of your skin over blade shaving.  </li>
            <li>I love that you can use it in the shower, with shaving cream or dry.</li>
            <li>Surprised how quickly it charges.</li>
            <li>It charged quickly, and runs quieter than any electric I&#x27;ve used by far.</li>
            <li>My previous Panasonic had a nice recharge stand</li>
            <li>So if you are super noise sensitive you may want to get a quieter one.</li>
            <li>With norelco the blade keeps falling off, but here it stays put and even cleans easily with simple tap water.</li>
            <li>Using shaving gel made it less effective for me and didn&#x27;t help reduce irritation.  </li>
            <li>Very decent price for the quality of the shave.  </li>
            <li>My previous razor was a nice Braun.</li>
            <li>The head of the unit can be put in to \\&quot;soft\\&quot; mode with a tremendous amount of pivot in two planes of motion, or put in to \\&quot;lock\\&quot; keeping the head perfectly fixed.</li>
            <li>Charges very quickly and the charge last over a week.</li>
            <li>Easy enough to clip off with the built in clipper.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Close shave in a quiet razor, lightweight and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Only \\&quot;complaint\\&quot;, is that Amazon makes is too easy to buy.</li>
            <li>I easily get 10 shaves per one charge if I want, but in the future I plan to charge all my electronics on Sundays.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not easily impressed and think that&#x27;s pretty incredible.</li>
            <li>Cleanup is very simple and charging is very quick.</li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s Hypoallergenic, shaves close (only a razor will give you a closer shave, so no complaints here), can be rinsed clean, and unlike disposable shavers, does NOT leave a trail of razor burn/bumps, and it can be used to safely shave your entire body (as well as a man&#x27;s face)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t use it for a quick shave and does not do a complete job.</li>
            <li>Easy to care for; no extra cleaning products needed, just hand soap.  </li>
            <li>I get a much closer shave thanks to the higher blade speed.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to shave and this really works very well, holds charge and can be used in the shower when the hair has been softened by the hot water.  </li>
            <li>Most days I use it dry</li>
            <li>Although I like the way this razor handles and recharges quickly, bottom line is it does not give as close a shave as my old Norelco.</li>
            <li>At first, you feel kind of worried water will destroy it</li>
            <li>I would not compare it to a straight blade (the king of all shaves , but takes a good amount of skill, time, and upkeep), but I would say with 100% confidence that it beat my fusion blade by a small margin.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely rate this a strong 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic shavers for a long time now with good results - only thing I don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li>Overall, a good value as long as you&#x27;re not in a hurry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another year goes by and the (2nd) razor is still going strong.</li>
            <li>Charge last a good long time.</li>
            <li>If the quality of the shave was not so strong this one thing would be enough to cause a return.</li>
            <li>Happened to find one a little less at Best Buy.</li>
            <li>The motor is very fast and the foils get very close to the skin, leaving me with a smooth shave in a relatively short amount of time.</li>
            <li>Overall, it felt very good in the hand, and seemed to be of a durable construction that would last a long time.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic is hands down the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned!arge, but the indicator predictably drops by 10% intervals every morning that you use the shaver.  </li>
            <li>It goes more than a week on a single charge.  </li>
            <li>So, a year ago I tried a Panasonic model ES7103 (which had received largely favorable reviews).</li>
            <li>but the head is large and cuts a close shave.</li>
            <li>and I certainly don&#x27;t find it noisy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m keeping mine and certainly recommend the product.  </li>
            <li>But, if you had to make a choice, this would be a smart move.</li>
            <li>I have always had certain areas of the face and neck that I can not get a close shave.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone and would certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li>I just assumed a certain quality for electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Why are a certain number of words required.</li>
            <li>In my opinion you dont need a five blade unit or even four unless you have a large head/face because the amount of razor head surface would be too large around rounded corners.</li>
            <li>but when it died I decided to try this one, based in large part on some of the reviews here.</li>
            <li>do recommend product to someone not wanting to spend large monies to get the task done.</li>
            <li>to shave off certain hairs on my chin.</li>
            <li>I wish I could remember the brand and model, as it would certainly help with the comparison I am about to do.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m saying an ELECTRIC RAZOR of all things is overrated, but I&#x27;m really boggled by the positive reviews of this thing.</li>
            <li>On a positive note, I still have this shaver and it shaves very well.</li>
            <li>It is light, does a fine job with its pivot action system, and holds a charge for a very long time.  </li>
            <li>it is amazing product, the first electric shave that gives the same result as regular shaving blades, except no irritation or bleeding</li>
            <li>I have been shaving most of my life (and no one cares how long that is) and have primarily used the Braun suite of electric shavers at multiple price levels.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve pretty much tried all the different brands and models over the years and none of them have given me as close or as comfortable of a shave as this.</li>
            <li>because most retailers only give you a month to return these things back to them for a full refund.  </li>
            <li>Having said that, I am on my second razor of the exact same kind and would not trade it for anything.</li>
            <li>I hope this shaver lasts a good long time, at least until something better comes along, which I doubt.</li>
            <li>It has a loud but not unpleasant buzz noise when</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned four Panasonic shavers because it has made more sense a number of times to buy a new shaver instead of buying replacement parts - one of my only complaints about Panasonic -</li>
            <li>This new one didn&#x27;t even last more than 2 months.</li>
            <li>The most recent Braun never seemed to shave well, even with a new replacement shaver head.  </li>
            <li>So every time when I am shopping for a new electrical shaver, I still will try both Panasonic and Philips units before making my decision; and just in my last two purchase, I do believe the tri-cyclone style shaver works better with me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A good shave can take a very long time and even then with my neck I&#x27;d need to use a regular razor to truly remove the hair.</li>
            <li>Seems to be a little better wet shaving (with foam) as opposed to dry, and it does take a week or two for your beard to adjust, but after that the shave is very good.</li>
            <li>Works great wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>The shave is great wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>It shaves closer than the Braun, I use less time in shaving, and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Works great wet or dry.</li>
            <li>It does a great job wet or dry</li>
            <li>Have used it both wet &amp; dry, either way, great shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to use it for dry shaving or for use on a wet beard and washing the shaving block off under the sink.</li>
            <li>This is great dry, wet or with shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Works great dry or wet.</li>
            <li>Have not tried it wet yet, but did a GREAT job dry.  </li>
            <li>Has a great wet to dry option.</li>
            <li>I told him the reviews said a wet shave will be a closer shave, but he said he is perfectly happy with the dry shave.  </li>
            <li>It works great as a wet or dry shaver.</li>
            <li>Works great wet and dry.</li>
            <li>I clean this with liquid dishwashing soap, takes about a minute, let it dry and hit it with a quick shot of Remington Shaver Saver.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t shave even half as good as my old Remington Microscreen.</li>
            <li>A previous model of the Panasonic ES8103 had given me excellent service since August 2008, but it stopped working a few days ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the way the head moves and glides freely across the face, the easy cleaning method, the directions and the closeness of the shave (I have a heavy beard).</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be fair, I have a pretty coarse beard, I have to buy the &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; disposable razor blades because the regular stuff is also completely ineffective.</li>
            <li>Very smooth shave, minimal skin irritation.</li>
            <li>Even though the electric is significantly more expensive, the time saved, for the great look and feel, gives me the impression that it&#x27;s worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li>I can do a final shave with a good razor without having to throw it out after a single use.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly, the blades are very sharp, and as a result I haven&#x27;t yet had an incidence of ingrown hair, something that my old razor was doing a lot.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I&#x27;ve had four of these is that I&#x27;ll replace the blades once after about 18 months or so, but then 18 months later I&#x27;ll just buy a new one if it&#x27;s a good price.  </li>
            <li>I research electric razors, and found that most guys had success with the Panasonic Linear series, mainly due to the high speed of the blades.  </li>
            <li>Working fine after 3 years, however, the digital display has stop working</li>
            <li>It still cut fine, but the batter could only hold a charge for 1 shaving, so</li>
            <li>However, I have always had a problem with fine facial hair and getting a close shave with the Braun.  </li>
            <li>I only used the trimmer side once for this review and it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>I only used the trimmer side once for this review and it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>I feel that the foil is really fine and stubble on your face is larger than that on your head.</li>
            <li>My last shaver was a Braun and it still works fine</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower with only water and it works fine.</li>
            <li>long as you keep a sharp blade in the shaver, I think this machine is a great value.  </li>
            <li>Love this shaver; it does a better job dry than wet, but that&#x27;s to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since this is my first electric shaver, I don&#x27;t have any other brands to compare this shaver with, but I am pleased with my purchase and the results it gives me.</li>
            <li>I love being able to shave wet or dry.</li>
            <li>The shaver seems to struggle a bit and requires multiple passes, but in the end it does a fine job on the moustache area.</li>
            <li>When I first got this razor, I thought it was decent quality.  </li>
            <li>The entire system is worthy of praise!  </li>
            <li>decided to give this particular razor a try after reading some  stellar reviews about them.</li>
            <li>I found that the customer satisfaction with the Panasonic shaver was very high</li>
            <li>This was very highly rated in Consumer Reports Mag.  </li>
            <li>, it is a very high quality razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cleaning is not hard - a quick rinse and air dry does just fine.</li>
            <li>My old Braun has a similar style trimmer, and when new, it was far superior to this razor&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>, if you plan on shaving at least every other day, want low cost replacement foil/blades, and are satisfied with a 80% clean shave, this is probably great bargain.</li>
            <li>I have only used it dry, however I suspect that a wet shave will be just as good, maybe better.</li>
            <li>But this little thing does an amazing job.</li>
            <li>have a nice little Wahl trimmer that I&#x27;ve used on my sideburns.</li>
            <li>The price is pretty good, and the quality is equal to any other electric shaver I have used.</li>
            <li>You need grow it out a little before it becomes effective.</li>
            <li>The convenience of shaving wet or dry is nice and it seems easy enough to clean.    </li>
            <li>I can now shave my neck area where i have never been able to before with an electric because it caused irritation and was never able to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li>Great product; shaves tough beard without skin rash from blade shavers.</li>
            <li>It replaced an older Braun that I was finding more difficulty getting replacement blades/foil for (tells you how long I had it around).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty high pitched humming noise</li>
            <li>i would highly reccomend this product to anyone that is interested in an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>The pop-up trimmer is nice for the when the leg hairs are a bit longer than other times, as it whacks them down better in that mode.</li>
            <li>The fact that you can use it wet or dry is a very nice feature.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to clean with just a little liquid soap and and water.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to clean up, with a little Comet spray bathroom cleaner  and a rinse under the tap.  </li>
            <li>and I loved it for the mustache area because I have a hard time shaving this area without pulling and pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a very thick, stubbly face and really didn&#x27;t expect the shaver to perform a great job on my neck.</li>
            <li>, I figured it was better to get a whole new one with a new battery for pretty much the same price.</li>
            <li>It is very loud!!</li>
            <li>The second one though was better and probably a little faster and certainly more convenient.</li>
            <li>It takes a little more time but is quite a bit better than I recollect from my last encounter with an electric razor.</li>
            <li>I have no idea when I need to charge or clean (although I tend to clean it every other use anyways).</li>
            <li>There is no base for the shaver to set in, and so the charger is a separate charging device (much like a cell phone charger) which plugs into the bottom of the shaver, so the net is, another charger to keep track of.</li>
            <li>I wanted a shaver that was wet/dry capable and would provide a comfortable and close as shave as possible to a hand razor.</li>
            <li>The digital readout on the handle is a plus as well in telling you how much battery life is available in addition to indicating when it should be cleaned.</li>
            <li>and I realize that many individuals may get a great shave with an electric shaver and as such my specific issues are based upon a person with sensitive skin and a fairly heavy beard.</li>
            <li>I would say those sources are generally accurate, and I&#x27;ll add the following comments.  </li>
            <li>Visual charge % is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>During the first week of use I did get some minor irritation on my neck area under chin and around adam&#x27;s apple, but after that it was smooth sailing.</li>
            <li>Wet gives a much better shave, meaning in the shower when your skin is very moist.</li>
            <li>I have still to use it wet in the shower as many have said provides a closer shave since I can&#x27;t fathom wasting that much water.</li>
            <li>The local shopping clubs (ones that require membership to get in, they offers better deals) has better deals because their shavers frequently come with an extra replacement head!  </li>
            <li>This is great for vacations, summer camp, music festivals, or just daily green living.</li>
            <li>I own cheaper and more expensive electric shavers</li>
            <li>LCD screen is really a great feature for letting me know when to recharge instead of it going dead in the middle of shaving.</li>
            <li>I have a coarse beard so ingrown hair is a huge issue with me.</li>
            <li>Maybe I asked too much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very disappointing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It holds a charge well and gives a reasonable shave.</li>
            <li>fits the hand very well.</li>
            <li>plugged in, but it charges fast if you forget to charge it.</li>
            <li>Charges fast too...</li>
            <li>and if it really keeps the blades fresh&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>VERY close face shave if you use shaving cream -</li>
            <li>really waterproof - use it in the shower with no fear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t do my neck very well- even with shaving cream</li>
            <li>Charges fast and holds charge well.</li>
            <li>We would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>But as I said before, it is a much closer shave than the Remington, and it is an electric, not a blade</li>
            <li>Its easy enough to clean, so no need to spend extra $ for it.</li>
            <li>The shave was also much faster.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Charges fast and lasts a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>I scanned Amazon.con reading review after review and settled on my ES8103 Wet/Dry shaver based on the reviews and reasonable cost.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, I really like this razor.</li>
            <li>it cuts very close to the skin, and I like that.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product!</li>
            <li>So I decided to spent more and get a the Braun Series 7 720s.</li>
            <li>Very close shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve replaced the blades three times but they really should be replaced every 6 to 9 months.  </li>
            <li>Knowing the time left before needing to re-charge in minutes or percent of battery life remaining is important to me.</li>
            <li>I tried it in the shower but didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in closeness</li>
            <li>After a month I&#x27;m really liking it.  </li>
            <li>so light that you might think you only got a shell with nothing inside</li>
            <li>really like the wet/dry option.</li>
            <li>I had a Norelco before which gave a closer shave but really tore up my face.</li>
            <li>Then after much research I found the Panasonic ES8103S.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this Panasonic foil shaver, In part because of the reviews-(also $[...] off $[...] instant rebate, got free spare blades).</li>
            <li>in my case, I much prefer using cream to shave.  </li>
            <li>and I would have to say that this shaver really dose hit the mark.</li>
            <li>And reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic ES8103S Arc3 has given me the closest shave since I shaved with the straight razor.</li>
            <li>The pop-up trimmer works very well on sideburns and does not nick the skin like the Braun.  </li>
            <li>It give a fast and close shave every time.  </li>
            <li>The linear motor is fast and efficient and there are virtually no mechanicals to wear out.  </li>
            <li>It is also much lighter than the Braun.</li>
            <li>The LCD that shows the amount of charge available only shows when the shaver is turned on.   </li>
            <li>Once out of the box, it was charged and ready to run in under an hour.</li>
            <li>Razor works very well.  </li>
            <li>I really like the waterproof design--makes clean-up a snap.  </li>
            <li>About 2 years ago I bought a Home entertainment surround sound system and after a couple months the dvd player started acting up.  </li>
            <li>For those times when I want to head shave without using a Mach 3 blade, I really like this razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely baffled.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>I cannot tell how much power on the charge is remaining</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s delivery was very prompt also.  </li>
            <li>My husband has done very well to get 3 or 4 before it poops out.  </li>
            <li>I used the pro glide, which works VERY well, but  the blades are too much money.</li>
            <li>Second, the shave is exceptionally comfortable.  </li>
            <li>It is much louder than the Norelco but</li>
            <li>not so much so that I would return it.  </li>
            <li>just replaced both the foil and the blades and it really made a difference.  </li>
            <li>just replaced both the foil and the blades and it really made a difference.  </li>
            <li>In easy-to-shave areas there was no clipping sound during the second shave in both orders; so neither shaver had a closer cut in these areas.  </li>
            <li>Very close shave and no burning feeling at all.  </li>
            <li>the very close shave</li>
            <li>using it wet is even better.  </li>
            <li>The motor is much faster.  </li>
            <li>It is so fast I can hear the whiskers being clipped.  </li>
            <li>I really like the close shave I get with this shaver.</li>
            <li>And it is fast.</li>
            <li>really breaks you after a while</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>it charges fast.</li>
            <li>This razor just really gets the job done.....</li>
            <li>He really likes that it can be used in the shower</li>
            <li>None, really, but don&#x27;t believe any claims about \\&quot;one pass shaving\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Charges fast, 5 - 6 shaves per charge.</li>
            <li>If between showers you use an Electric Pre-Shave like Williams Electra shave, you will notice a shave as absolutely as close to a blade.  </li>
            <li>Been using for three months and it works very well.</li>
            <li>This model doesn&#x27;t have the automatic cleaning system, but that was a plus to me, because I didn&#x27;t want to keep paying for cleaning solution and have to go through the whole cleaning ritual.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave your face, so much as it plucks it.</li>
            <li>and it is much lighter.</li>
            <li>The percent remaining feature on the display for the battery is very helpful to determine whether or not I am going to run out of juice.</li>
            <li>The quality difference between the products was absolutely incredable.</li>
            <li>It works well and cuts as close as a straight razor.  </li>
            <li>Therefore when I do use it, it gets a real workout.  </li>
            <li>I was asleep at the time and he took my razor into the bathroom while he was getting ready for work.</li>
            <li>He loves this razor so much that I bought him one as a gift.</li>
            <li>and he wants to meet my shaver too, since he hates using a blade.</li>
            <li>so I really don&#x27;t care.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It charges fairly fast, but when you plug it in at night, who cares?</li>
            <li>so I really don&#x27;t care.  </li>
            <li>It charges fairly fast, but when you plug it in at night, who cares?</li>
            <li>This rechargeable razor works very well.</li>
            <li>It gives me a completely smooth shave the same as my Fusion 5 blade razor but without the irritation!</li>
            <li>shower before I shave and this cuts thru the damp hair really well.</li>
            <li>It produces so much noise when I use it.</li>
            <li>to get a reasonably close shave, shaving can take longer than desired, but it will get the job done.</li>
            <li>Cleaning is very convenient; much easier than Norelco.</li>
            <li>I can shave on the go or use shave cream either way it works very well.</li>
            <li>Almost as close as my 50-blade-or-more Gillette and so much easier.</li>
            <li>really like the idea that you can wash this item under running water with soap.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s got a 13,000 RPM motor, so it really hums along.  </li>
            <li>He absolutely LOVES this shaver.</li>
            <li>it absolutely does not irritates my skin, even under chin.</li>
            <li>This shaver works well on my head with a really close shave without that feeling on your scalp.</li>
            <li>If you shave just your face, you might not have as much enthusiasm.</li>
            <li>will say that the razor was light, but sturdy, and ran quietly.  </li>
            <li>Really liking this shaver.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic Wet/Dry shaver does very well.</li>
            <li>It was my experience that regardless if the shaver is Panasonic or Braun it doesn&#x27;t really matter that much.  </li>
            <li>which isn&#x27;t really a problem.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>It does not shave as close as razor, but it works better than I expected.</li>
            <li>His face did not break out and it is so much faster.</li>
            <li>I have a very heave beard</li>
            <li>Not as close as a manual razor, but very close still (some people may not notice a difference).  </li>
            <li>I think when this one wears out I will go to a straight razor.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I am very satisified with the Panasaonic ES8103S.</li>
            <li>It cleans up with just a water rinse and really cuts close.  </li>
            <li>so I use a straight razor afterwards.</li>
            <li>Very close shave to a razor.</li>
            <li>This razor is as close to a straight razor I have felt.</li>
            <li>Oh, and in case you&#x27;re wondering; I do treat stuff gently and with respect.  </li>
            <li>Fast Charging.</li>
            <li>and the product works really well.</li>
            <li>but he tried it out and was amazed by how much closer the shave was.</li>
            <li>It is quite and gives a very close shave without razor burn.</li>
            <li>Fast charging also.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get much easier.  </li>
            <li>Very well thought out/designed product.</li>
            <li>Really fast charging.  </li>
            <li>The on-screen LCD showed 100% charge in about an hour...pretty darn fast.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic really seems to glide over my face and neck with virtually no pull.  </li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and get one,They are reasonably priced.   </li>
            <li>The battery charge lasts for 8 to 9 shaves and the recharge is quite fast.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t improved much even after use.    </li>
            <li>Never had much luck with electric shavers, and this one didn&#x27;t raise the bar much.  </li>
            <li>Ergonomic design and a really close shave.</li>
            <li>and it really works well.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband and he really likes it.  </li>
            <li>He shaves his whole head and face with it.  </li>
            <li>very close shave</li>
            <li>it may work even better wet.</li>
            <li>There is a display (100%, 90%, 80%...) of how much charge is remaining.</li>
            <li>therefore, I find it much easier to use.</li>
            <li>Safety razors were a real pain</li>
            <li>Produces fast close shave and at reasonable noise levels.  </li>
            <li>I just add the sizes of blades to suit the height of the cut, because the cuts are very close to the skin.   </li>
            <li>/&gt;This shaver has been much different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This razor also has a fast re-charge time, it&#x27;s done in an hour.</li>
            <li>It is so much hyped about one pass shaving.</li>
            <li>It uses a lithium battery, so it&#x27;s display always shows how much of a charge you have in percentage.  </li>
            <li>It gives him the shave that he wants and it charges in a hurry.  </li>
            <li>I really like my razor.</li>
            <li>It shaves close and fast.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient.  </li>
            <li>He really seems to like it and it is gentle on his acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>It even has a sideburn trimmer which he really likes.</li>
            <li>The motor vibrates so fast there is no tugging or pulling on your skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this Panasonic razor!</li>
            <li>A very Close shave  .  2)</li>
            <li>All in all I really like this razor</li>
            <li>Looking at the price, I must admit I really didn&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li>I have had issues with the battery and screen; however, given the benefits that I mentioned above, I am comfortable purchasing this shaver</li>
            <li>I have been much more careful about not letting it drop</li>
            <li>The screen lights up but does not display a legible value.</li>
            <li>The screen started to turn partially legible during the year</li>
            <li>Just wet the top a bit and put some liquid soap on it.</li>
            <li>This product is made really well, but does not shave as close as a razor for my liking.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic shaves much, much closer; almost disposable razor blade close.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a reasonable pricesince you&#x27;ll probably want to switch out every 6 to 8 months.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine the shavers costing four times as much can perform any better.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>Now my husband wants it too.</li>
            <li>I have used Norelco shavers for 45 years and found them very dependable.</li>
            <li>It charges remarkably fast as well.</li>
            <li>I guess because it vibrates so fast, I</li>
            <li>That said, it still is a fast shave.</li>
            <li>&amp; He just told me He absolutely loves this shaver,</li>
            <li>Worked very well.</li>
            <li>After some tests I can say that both units perform very well</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fast.  </li>
            <li>It works very well on my cheeks but not that much on my neck.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t care that much.</li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>The water restistant feature makes it very convenient for washing the shaver, and gets an even closer shave.</li>
            <li>It does charge remarkably fast though - about an hour.    </li>
            <li>This really pleases me.</li>
            <li>Cleans very well.</li>
            <li>The real beauty though is in cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;D REALLY MISS IT</li>
            <li>Very close.</li>
            <li>And this electric shaver will still cut me if I go over a area too much or press too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I needed a replacement fast.</li>
            <li>chambers\\&quot; etc at a much lower cost.     </li>
            <li>but it does cut really close to the grain.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very convenient for him to use before going to work.</li>
            <li>He gets the close shave he wants without irritation.</li>
            <li>However, I like it so much</li>
            <li>my whole life</li>
            <li>But, I really had to get used to it and its disadvantages.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my father, and he really loves this gift.</li>
            <li>Gives very close shaves and I would recommend this item.  </li>
            <li>im at 100%, really fast, but</li>
            <li>we all really like it.</li>
            <li>i guess i didn&#x27;t really know shaving until i got one of these</li>
            <li>and he says it works really well.</li>
            <li>But it cuts really well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much closer than I got with the rotary shavers.  </li>
            <li>I found I really like this shaver when I use shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>I also like the way it shows me how much of the battery charge remains.  </li>
            <li>This one will shave with three or four days growth -- although I imagine that depends on the person and how fast</li>
            <li>He loves it so much I decided to buy one for myself.</li>
            <li>After he used couple days, he said he really like it</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve decided to check the modern technology.</li>
            <li>Shaver is much rugged now, can be cleaned using running water, but it is still noisy and does not shaves well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very convenient to wash by water.</li>
            <li>Too much sound and takes different angles and movement</li>
            <li>&quot; is very true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>seems to work better as a wet shave</li>
            <li>I have owned this razor for about two months now and wanted to really get used to it before giving my opinion of it.</li>
            <li>this razor comes as close to a blade as I have ever had, much closer than the braun I replaced.</li>
            <li>He can shave very close without getting in-grown hairs or breaking out, which has never happened before.</li>
            <li>IT LEAVES TOO MUCH BEARD ON MY FACE AFTER SHAVING</li>
            <li>several rotations over sections of the face are required for a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>trimmer feature is not as beefy as the Braun trimmer.</li>
            <li>My primary shaver is a regular blade.</li>
            <li>Very comparable to blade/razors.</li>
            <li>I really like this shaver however:  </li>
            <li>It is also very noisy.</li>
            <li>Much easier on the skin, charge holding well.  </li>
            <li>We really like the razor.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t recommend this electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I find that this foil razor gives a much closer shave.  </li>
            <li>My RF41 4-head model works very well</li>
            <li>It shaves really well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>so much I bought another one for my son.</li>
            <li>It also really holds a charge.</li>
            <li>Also, it comes with a cord for fast recharge.</li>
            <li>check the quality and it is working very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually really like this shaver.</li>
            <li>It is much easier around the neck</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li>This gets a very close shave and with no irritation.</li>
            <li>Maybe I expect too much -</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Very quite too.</li>
            <li>The Li battery should be a real plus too.</li>
            <li>only gripe I had about it was that there was no indicator light when you plugged it in.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice to see a green or red light to let you know that the unit is charging.</li>
            <li>Gentle pressure gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li>it handles very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is really horrible.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Have never gotten such a smooth shave as with this shaver.</li>
            <li>Charges fast, shaves closer than any shaver I&#x27;ve owned before (namely Norelco/Panasonic electric shavers).</li>
            <li>And he says it really shaves well.</li>
            <li>my face is very sensitve.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic really does what it is advertised to do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It recharges to 100% in roughly 1 hour if most of the power has been drained.</li>
            <li>He even lets me shave him sometimes (as he can&#x27;t see very well).</li>
            <li>I do not like the Panasonic shaver because it does not shave close and it makes too much noise.  </li>
            <li>He said he really likes the shave.  </li>
            <li>When I decided to purchase this, I had spent years looking for a shaver better and cheaper than blades.</li>
            <li>And it is ready to use at alltimes.</li>
            <li>It runs much quieter than the Braun, but it is not faster nor does it give a closer shave.    </li>
            <li>Seems to work reasonably well but doubt made by Panasonic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a blade for many years because I like the closeness of a wet shave.  </li>
            <li>This shaver has no problem handling 3 days of growth with no pulling, and gives a real close shave.  </li>
            <li>This item gets the job done without putting too much pressure on your skin.</li>
            <li>been using cordless/electric razors over 20 years, this one was costly but works really welll</li>
            <li>I bought it when it was a lightning deal, and figured it was cheap enough to risk it.  </li>
            <li>If you shave with an electric razor you really need to try this one.</li>
            <li>Very noisy and misses a lot of hair.</li>
            <li>Birthday gift for hubby was better than expected.</li>
            <li>I get a very close have with it</li>
            <li>Really dont use a blade much anymore as this shaver does</li>
            <li>I would have returned this shaver but the 30-day window had expired before I could really try it out.</li>
            <li>If you give this one a chance you will find that it shaves very close once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>I really want to return this thing</li>
            <li>Very quiet.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>It does allow you to shave very close...closer than my Norelco did.  </li>
            <li>Charges fast.   </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t very noisy.</li>
            <li>it leaves so much hair on my face and I have to go over it with a razor blade.</li>
            <li>I got this on my budget and is very useful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really like this.  </li>
            <li>and it cuts very close.</li>
            <li>Where the Panasonic cuts much closer.  </li>
            <li>It gives a reasonable shave.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a reasonable priced electric razor that would still get the job done.  </li>
            <li>and then I used the shaver for 16 straight days before the charge indicator showed 10% remaining.  </li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t expecting much for a wet/dry for fifty bucks</li>
            <li>Received my shaver yesterday, charged it overnight and was ready to go this morning   </li>
            <li>I have been getting very close shaves.</li>
            <li>Fast &amp; very close shave.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>one straight razor like the barbers used to use, which I got on eBay.    </li>
            <li>So fast.</li>
            <li>My husband has had one for years and is very please with his razor.</li>
            <li>Can get at places on the neck that straight razor misses.  </li>
            <li>He prefers a much closer shave than this provided.</li>
            <li>Like it so much I recommended it to my son.</li>
            <li>Very close shave.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend purchasing this shaver!</li>
            <li>If you travel I also would add on this item as it is very inexpensive but</li>
            <li>The price of a foil and cutter was reasonable given replacement every 18 to 24 months.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>After one year now, the razor still runs very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The trimmer isn&#x27;t very convenient.</li>
            <li>The razor looks big, but is actually light and well balanced in your hand.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive or prone to chronically irritated skin like mine, this product is worth every penny.    </li>
            <li>Fast charge.  </li>
            <li>Wish Panasonic would have spent more money on a case.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t holding a charge and didn&#x27;t shave my neck very well.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the scent of any of the easily available commercial pre-shave preparations.</li>
            <li>This razor is gentle on the skin</li>
            <li>but he doesn&#x27;t use it much because it leaves it not well shaved.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this shaver for 3 years which is about as much as you should expect for a product that costs $80.00  </li>
            <li>I really like the handle and the battery time indicator.</li>
            <li>I have a real beard not some fuzz you need the sun in the background to notice.</li>
            <li>And much faster.</li>
            <li>I thought about buying a much cheaper model because once healed</li>
            <li>The razor works very well</li>
            <li>really like that it has a Lithium-ion battery.</li>
            <li>Very happy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I gave this shaver a cousin who absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>He finds it very convenient and has nothing to complain about.</li>
            <li>price&lt;br /&gt;Charge indicator is very usefull to me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
            <li>of a pain not being able to use it plugged in, but it makes sense, since you can get it wet.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor for women and men, alike!</li>
            <li>The attached trimmer works very well</li>
            <li>This thing shaves close and smooth, and it&#x27;s very quiet!</li>
            <li>Almost as much as the razor itself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving for some 55 years and really like the design of the shaver and give it five stars for its performanace.  </li>
            <li>He just had radiation treatment to the face/neck, very tender skin.  </li>
            <li>I have to admit that taking an electricial appliance into the shower was an unnatural act, but it works very well.  </li>
            <li>He really likes it.  </li>
            <li>It cleans under water, and the trimmer works very well without blocking your view when using it</li>
            <li>The only con might be the lack of a zippered, protective catrrying case (it comes with a cheap drawstring pouch)</li>
            <li>Linear motor really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>Not the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned, takes a while to get a semilose shave, some what disappointing.</li>
            <li>This is a very reliable shaver.</li>
            <li>Moving it gently over skin leaves, basically, semi-long stubble that the shaver has a much easier time with.  </li>
            <li>Two, the clipper is the only thing about this shaver that feels cheap.</li>
            <li>Yet still, it&#x27;s a very close shave, and feels like a well designed, thought out product.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The difference is marginal; it still cuts very close and clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, It shaves very well</li>
            <li>Received item as described, thanks ...</li>
            <li>The shaver is very</li>
            <li>Reasonable price for what you get.</li>
            <li>Quiet; Excellent battery life, enough for ten shaves before recharging is necessary.  </li>
            <li>I bought another one before but didn&#x27;t work as much as this.</li>
            <li>I guess, I should get used to instructions that say nothing in 14 languages - written by the legal department.</li>
            <li>Husband loves the razor and the price so much he bought another for a spare.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Cuts really close but does not irritate skin.  </li>
            <li>and I can tell how much I missed having an electric.</li>
            <li>This razor uses a straight, linear motion and provides a fast, close shave.  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s the front that really matters.</li>
            <li>If you have reasonable shaving expectations from an electric shaver then this product will not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>am really astounded that all the shavers made now are basically disposable.</li>
            <li>This is important to me because I can&#x27;t carry around one of those cleaning pods especially when traveling out of the country.</li>
            <li>The shaver is fast and has a meter indicating the percentage of battery charge remaining.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t go straight at it, but angle the blade a bit and take your time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had Braun shavers for years with the cleaning bases, and having to buy the cleaning solution things all the time was really hurting my wallet.</li>
            <li>My husband really likes this shaver.</li>
            <li>I would be very hesitant to buy another Panasonic w/LCD display or otherwise and must face Xmas day with stubble.</li>
            <li>Lots of missed hairs even though I spent more time shaving.</li>
            <li>really don&#x27;t want anybody to pay money for something that they will never get.....</li>
            <li>Re-charges fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks and have foound the razor to cut well, easy to clean and holds a charge for several days.</li>
            <li>Shaves smootly without much effort.</li>
            <li>He says &amp;#34;its really nice&amp;#34</li>
            <li>It charges fast and does the job.</li>
            <li>I really recommended.</li>
            <li>I like these so much that I&#x27;ve purchased one for each of my sons.</li>
            <li>and it is very nosie..</li>
            <li>but neither of those show much improvement.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Holds a charge for 6 to 7 shaves and is very lightweight.  </li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>He really likes it.  </li>
            <li>Gets really close</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t work very well in the shower, but works well with or without the cord so...</li>
            <li>He likes it so much</li>
            <li>I use really like this Razor</li>
            <li>With almost 1400 reviews of this venerable old-timer already posted on Amazon, there isn&#x27;t much I can add.</li>
            <li>However, the fact that it constantly runs neck-and-neck with Braun&#x27;s 790cc as the number one seller of foil shavers at Amazon tells me there are two types of electric shaver buyers out there; those who are prepared to lay out the big bucks for what is often heralded as the best shaver money can buy (it isn&#x27;t) and another group who think that about $80 is the proper amount to pay for such an item.</li>
            <li>really like this shaver.</li>
            <li>Works very well on my face, neck and head.  </li>
            <li>Better for me as a wet shaver.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my son and he really likes it.</li>
            <li>Husband really likes electric razor.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>I have the face soap that I use with my straight blade</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t enjoy shaving with a blade because it irritates my skin, especially under the jawline.</li>
            <li>this is a perfectly reasonable product and price, however.</li>
            <li>And Panasonic really seems to have hit a home run at balancing the size for this shaver.</li>
            <li>It does shave really close...</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting this much battery life after reading some reviews saying it lasts about 3-5 shaves.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Much easier than my Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had to re shave the same spot over and over to get a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>skin is not at all irritated by this shaver, and the smoothness of the shave feels as close to a real razor as I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li>Even if you do get all of the hairs it absolutely destroys my skin even after the 30 days it suggests you take to get used to it.</li>
            <li>He still wants to lubricate it before each us.</li>
            <li>THANKS.</li>
            <li>Now, after two weeks of use, I&#x27;m ready to report in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one works really well.  </li>
            <li>The outer foil is much thinner and allow for a closer shave.</li>
            <li>VERY close shave and pivoting head makes it a snap.  </li>
            <li>Also, I purchased a shaving gel which really helps the razor shave closer.  </li>
            <li>Of course it will not get you the &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; shave that a straight edge will give you</li>
            <li>Except in SonicClean mode, which I&#x27;m not convinced really does much.</li>
            <li>Significantly better shaving wet.  </li>
            <li>Quiet, fast, close enough and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It works very well and quite fast</li>
            <li>so it is also very convenient.  </li>
            <li>That really put a dent in my wallet.</li>
            <li>I really dislike when that</li>
            <li>He is very picky about razors.  </li>
            <li>and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>really good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&gt; The real advantages of this shaver are...</li>
            <li>significantly better wet</li>
            <li>I get a very close shave and it gets the difficults places like under the chin very well.</li>
            <li>The surprise was that the battery lasted for whole two weeks -</li>
            <li>face was smooth and I could go out in public without looking like I landed face-first in a patch of poison ivy.&lt;br /&gt;Being that this is a machine</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s understandable concerting how fast it is moving.  </li>
            <li>I really like the shaver</li>
            <li>This is a very well-designed product.  </li>
            <li>Is ok product but for the price I expected it to get a closer shave</li>
            <li>it really is just hit and mis</li>
            <li>Fast and reliable.</li>
            <li>Does not give a very close shave.</li>
            <li>He said that it works really well.  </li>
            <li>I am very please with it</li>
            <li>With that being said, it doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; the hair up.  </li>
            <li>the compartment that stores the hair doesnt really work all that well.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic products always seem to perform better than expected.</li>
            <li>I really like this shaver.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>A bit pricey, but performs very well.</li>
            <li>But with the Panasonic ES8103S Arc3 Electric Shaver Wet/Dry, I have found real perfection.  </li>
            <li>It also charges fast.  </li>
            <li>It holds a charge well and shaves very close.  </li>
            <li>The pop-up trimmer works very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not as close a shave as a razor, but after you get used to it, you can get a rather smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really worked well for me.  </li>
            <li>This Panasonic shaver was better than I had expected.</li>
            <li>Much quieter than the Braun.</li>
            <li>It is very portable.</li>
            <li>This produce really works.</li>
            <li>I really like this Panasonic.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t shave much</li>
            <li>He uses it with soap and water (no shaving cream) and absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Will have to try the wet shave to see if it&#x27;s even better.</li>
            <li>Lives up to expectations, and a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been nearly as careful with it as I should have; my dog chewed up the charging end, and I&#x27;ve dropped it more times than I&#x27;d care to admit.  </li>
            <li>SHAVES CLOSE  AND FAST.  </li>
            <li>RECHARGES FAST</li>
            <li>It really does get close!&lt;br</li>
            <li>battery holds charges very well</li>
            <li>The battery does hold charge very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very close shave.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to trim before I start the real shaving.</li>
            <li>It is also much slimmer than Norelco rotary</li>
            <li>Excellent shaver for my needs, would buy one for my father too.&lt;br /&gt;Powerful and quiet, one charge last for three weeks of everyday usage.</li>
            <li>very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fact that they encourage you to use it wet speaks volumes about how confident Panasonic is in this product, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It charges fast, and it does provide a very close shave as promised.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s performing very well.  </li>
            <li>Never thought he &#x27; get such a smooth shave from an electric razor.</li>
            <li>I have purchased Panasonic ES8103S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Silver and it is very usefull.</li>
            <li>But, Panasonic is getting very close with the ES8103S!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving</li>
            <li>The straight edge is efficient for my sideburns.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The description, also tells you what replacement foil accessories you need, which is very helpful as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My previous Panasonic razor, model ES8043, which is just an older version of this current razor, also worked great for about 6 years.</li>
            <li>Gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Dennis</li>
            <li>and he said it worked really well</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know why Panasonic, a Japanese company, wants to use Chinese manufactures instead their own plants, but time will tell if this shaver will continue to perform well.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I really like it; would recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have send it to my friend as a gift, He is  very like this watch.</li>
            <li>It shaves very close.</li>
            <li>This machine does not shave very close.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We can still order parts for it and separately not the whole head.  </li>
            <li>This is the most I&#x27;ve ever spent on a shaver.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic provides a closer shave , better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>That means to me he likes very well.</li>
            <li>is also very good，Some still do not understand icons</li>
            <li>the shave isnt very close</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cause ME any razor bumps on my neck and is still a very close shave.</li>
            <li>I do not get razor burn like with the straight razors, and still have to shave just as often.</li>
            <li>my husband said it&#x27;s very convenient to use.</li>
            <li>My head became very tender because of the bumps resulting from the use of the shaver on my head.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>and he wants another for travel......</li>
            <li>It cuts very close and doesn&#x27;t give me razor bumps.</li>
            <li>Gives a close, fast shave.  </li>
            <li>This shaver works very well...</li>
            <li>Very noisy but it up well.</li>
            <li>I recommend it for anyone who appreciates a very close shave.</li>
            <li>I completely got my money&#x27;s worth, and themsome.</li>
            <li>Razor works very well, shaves very close with no irritation.</li>
            <li>The Braun brand seems to have gone very high-priced and with features</li>
            <li>I really like the longer lifetime of the cutter and foil vs. the Braun.</li>
            <li>It is now ten hours since I shaved with this razor, and my face and neck are still smooth.</li>
            <li>cleaning is very effective……</li>
            <li>I have had it for over a month now and it works very well.</li>
            <li>Very close shave.</li>
            <li>Even gets the jaw line and neck really well</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Product very good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I  owned a panasonic razor before and it was one of the best cutting razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>This gives you a closer shave like using a straight razor.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really recommend this at all.</li>
            <li>It is very close to a blade shave</li>
            <li>This device can&#x27;t be for the whole body</li>
            <li>I like it so much.</li>
            <li>I have the 4 blade razor and just know how much he will appreciate it.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t always deliver a smooth shave and sometimes have to shave over areas several times to remove hair.  </li>
            <li>It is not as fast as I would like</li>
            <li>and I really l like it.</li>
            <li>I also really like the wet/dry feature.</li>
            <li>It is also much lighter and easier to obtain that close shave.</li>
            <li>So much time saved.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t really need any cream either.</li>
            <li>My neck hairs grow at a very close angle to my skin, so I always have some sort of irritation regardless of the shaving method.</li>
            <li>The battery power lasts one week, and charges fast.</li>
            <li>and it pulled the hair out as much as it cut,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much to compare it too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very close shave too.</li>
            <li>It works VERY well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For one thing, it is very noisy.  </li>
            <li>It gives a very close shave, but not as fast as my Norelco.  </li>
            <li>Reasonably close.</li>
            <li>I transitioned to a 3 straight blade foil system.</li>
            <li>The razor also charges fast.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Not as close as shaving with a razor but also not as much of a hassle.</li>
            <li>and he really loves it .....</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower , wet, and just love it</li>
            <li>It shaves almost as close as a blade (no electric has ever shaved 100% as close as a blade, but this one comes very close).</li>
            <li>The technology has really improved.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic ES8103S  produces a shave that is very close to that of a razor.</li>
            <li>w/h/b the same as a cheap one of this Brand).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clear cover useful for travel.</li>
            <li>I had tried another model before this one, and this one was MUCH easier on my skin, no pinches or nicks which was a plus.</li>
            <li>Better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Nothing of real note.  </li>
            <li>Very close and fast shave.</li>
            <li>the display tells you how much charge remains in percentage.  </li>
            <li>This is very convenient for me.</li>
            <li>My husband really likes this product.</li>
            <li>The blades move so fast and the trimmer gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I dont have the thickest hair in the world, but I think its ready for just about any hair type out there.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pivot (soft) action is great for uneven terrain.</li>
            <li>I find it FAR better than a Norelco rotary shaver I tried at the same time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you only have to do one pass over, it takes 2-3 on some sections on my neck where the hair grows at differ angels, but that&#x27;s better than my old razor</li>
            <li>Compared to the Norelco, it&#x27;s also pretty loud and feels hot on my skin.</li>
            <li>but I think these types of razors get warm on the foil after a few runs across the face.</li>
            <li>I am sure I&#x27;ll move on to a newer Panasonic model in the near future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks, and so far, so good.  </li>
            <li>- Fairly silent (but loud compared to razor :)).    SEMI-CONS:  </li>
            <li>When you factor in the initial cost plus the cost of replacing the blades yearly and the foil once every two years, it cost more than a blade razor, and didn&#x27;t shave nearly as well.</li>
            <li>The rotary was OK, comfortable, but not as close and so slow.      </li>
            <li>I did not get the cleaning system, that part seems kind of gimmicky to me.</li>
            <li>To give you my background, I am the kind of guy who has to shave everyday.</li>
            <li>The LED battery level display is a nice practical touch the prevents surprise dead batteries.</li>
            <li>My last couple of razors have been Braun&#x27;s and this one so far has been better than both of them.</li>
            <li>If your beard is very coarse, you may need to do it more frequently.</li>
            <li>Kind of a waste of money.</li>
            <li>So far, several months later, it seems to be a wise purchase.  </li>
            <li>If it had failed within the two-year warranty I would be good for a free replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My old Braun was on its last legs when I decided to start checking out shavers on this (my favorite) web site.  </li>
            <li>I was not that into a shaver, the last I had didn&#x27;t make me smile, I have to admit this worth the buy</li>
            <li>Shaves OK, but, I&#x27;ve had to replace the blades several times over the nearly 3 years I&#x27;ve had it . . .</li>
            <li>This is my fourth Panasonic of the same kind.</li>
            <li>I liked that shaver but had a few reservations about it</li>
            <li>I am curious how much abuse the ES8103S will be able to handle with extended use.</li>
            <li>have tried it wet with shaving cream once, and I feel like if I&#x27;m going through that much effort, a razor blade is just better hands-down.</li>
            <li>The battery life has been consistent with each shave using 10% of the battery (i.e. up to ten days on one full charge).</li>
            <li>for whatever reason, this shaver has poor performance for me, though obviously many others are satisfied.  </li>
            <li>As a military man, I am required to shave on a daily basis so the panasonic gets alot of work in and provides me with a good shave without the &#x27;burn&#x27; marks that I would receive using a rotary head razor.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice to know that I won&#x27;t damage it with a few drops of water here and there.</li>
            <li>I am female and this is far better than any electric shaver I have found that is marketed toward women.</li>
            <li>but I have yet to own an electric shaver that didn&#x27;t require two passes over my heavy beard to get all the stubble.  </li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t think it is as good as a wet shave</li>
            <li>With only 10% remaining on the charge, I was able to do a complete shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Electric razors have gotten slightly better since the last time I used one which was in the early 1960&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>(the one I bought has basically the same specs as the ES8249S model that we also own, so I expect it to work similarly).  </li>
            <li>I need to go over my face at least 3 times and still don&#x27;t get a good shave.</li>
            <li>It shaves better than my prior twenty year old Remington electric shaver.</li>
            <li>The rotary was good for at least 20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this shaver after I lost the power cord for my rotary shaver.</li>
            <li>Then I was catapulted into the present and was amazed at how quiet and effective this electric razor is.</li>
            <li>However, the shave lasts only one day and you will need to use the shaver more frequently than when shaving with a blade.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and a beard that grows in many different directions.  </li>
            <li>Not a huge problem as you can kind of see it</li>
            <li>but it is still not as good as my old dead Remington.</li>
            <li>In comparison with foil electric shavers, I have found the Panasonic shaver to be much sturdier; the foil in previous foil shavers seemed to break very easily.</li>
            <li>Works as advertised with a little patience a fine clean shave.  </li>
            <li>; easily shaves virtually all hairs growing tight against the face, unlike previous frequent exceptions  Long-lasting charge: as claimed, charges last about two weeks with no slow-down toward the end - best I&#x27;ve ever had in this respect; fast charge too  </li>
            <li>I like this shaver very much, and will buy new heads when it needs it.</li>
            <li>understanding is high RPM&#x27;s is a main characteristic to seek for a great electric shave and this certainly is much higher than any other I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li>at least its easy to clean!</li>
            <li>(I usually spend about 5 minutes in the morning for a shave.)I primarily use this razor for dry shaving (although it works well with shaving foam or gel), and it has been great so far.</li>
            <li>Having been a loyal Panasonic razor owner for many years, I have learned that you can keep these relatively inexpensive guys going a long time and they work really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>During those forty years I did not notice any significant change in the quality of the shave or the pulling, picking and burning that came from shaving certain facial sections over and over again.  </li>
            <li>It does well with long and short stubble, and the trimmer is more than adequate.  </li>
            <li>and it was clearly used!!!</li>
            <li>Even though it is hypoallergenic, people with sensitive skin will still get some irritation if used every day, so it&#x27;s still best to use up to only every other day (M W F, Sat), or 3-4 days per week only to avoid skin</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use shaving cream, just dry, and does a fantastic job the first pass.</li>
            <li>This seems typical of most consumer gauges these days including car gas gauges; however, I would prefer one that meauures consistently at all levels.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>This one works and looks essentially similar to the older model, which is fine.  </li>
            <li>I took the first shaver apart and it was filled with corrosion trying to keep this one extremely dry even though I&#x27;ts advertised as Wet/Dry.</li>
            <li>Previous model died after a long life and was happy with its performance.</li>
            <li>I find the dry shave pretty comfortable and it seems to get a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My whiskers are not tough, but they tend to lie along the skin</li>
            <li>Re: ES8103S : I have had MANY Panasonic razors, originally because they were the only one that would do a wet shave.</li>
            <li>still highly recommend this shaver for the quality of shave and positive experience with Panasonic.</li>
            <li>It came promptly after the first attempt to deliver it came to naught because some nit-wit would not deliver it to the apartment house where I live in Anchorage, Alaska.</li>
            <li>And be aware that Panasonic does not make replacement cords, so if you lose yours packing for a trip you will have to buy a new shaver.</li>
            <li>After 8+ years I said time for a new new and found   this at a local store and love it.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s pretty new</li>
            <li>I have always been a fan of Panasonic electronic items right from the days of the old tape recorders, VHS players, and it&#x27;s HDTV  and cordless phone sets.</li>
            <li>Not only can they shave in and out of the shower, but when you grab all the dirty clothes off the counter by said shower and throw them in the washing machine, said razor has a very good chance of surviving the endeavor AND coming out squeaky clean!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t plan to use it in the shower [wet] and likely won&#x27;t do any more than &#x27;brush&#x27; it out to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The battery lasts a long time, and it is even easy on the ears too.  </li>
            <li>, there&#x27;s not really any other problems, but then again if the shave isn&#x27;t that great who cares about the rest?  </li>
            <li>I can easily see brining this shaver when I go on long weekends and holidays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Really like the way it tells you how much charge is left and when you have to clean it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I have absolutely no problem shaving on my neck like other reviewers have experienced.</li>
            <li>It may not have the most blades or other bells and whistles, but I can get a very close shave with it.  </li>
            <li>The battery is strong and lasts long and the blade cuts close.  </li>
            <li>So, I purchased this one and it is still going strong and has a long battery life.</li>
            <li>The LED indicator is very easy to read and makes it very obvious how much charge you have left.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the design of the foil and blades, or if it&#x27;s simply that the motor continues to run at full speed, but it&#x27;s comfortable enough that I end up with a very close shave because I don&#x27;t mind going over an area until it&#x27;s cut.  </li>
            <li>A fast close shave, easy to clean, and stays charged long enough to get about 7 or 8 shaves before recharging.</li>
            <li>My old Braun had new razors and screen but was a dog in comparison how quick and close this shaves.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic on the other hand gives a pretty good shave when dry</li>
            <li>Norelco razors are much easier and timely to clean by just holding the open head under running water.</li>
            <li>Not only is it way lighter (Li-Ion battery), but it is so much easier to clean since you just rinse in water when it tells you to.  </li>
            <li>Although under the chin takes some effort to get it close and clean, overall its fast and neat.</li>
            <li>With this razor he can use it in the shower without the aid of any irritating cleanser and get a nice clean shave.  </li>
            <li>He had the kind that has round shaver blades before and would sit around buzzing away forever and still not get a decent shave.</li>
            <li>I purchased the shaver and quickly realized it was well worth the price as a dry shaver.  </li>
            <li>I clean it more than needed to try to improve performance and go slowly</li>
            <li>I used to have to brush my old shaver out, and even go so far as to use a compressor on it to get it clean.</li>
            <li>The display makes the level of available charge easy to see at a glance and it charges quickly for single shave use if you let it run down.  </li>
            <li>Cleaning is very easy using a little liquid hand soap and a rinse under the faucet.</li>
            <li>Washing this model is also very easy too; a little soap on the blades, turn it on, and let it shake it all off under the running water.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>The battery charge seems to last a long time, and it seems to be easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The 2nd shave was better than the first and by the 3rd time I knew what I was doing.  </li>
            <li>I agree with most of the other reviewers, this razor works quite well.</li>
            <li>It shaves my neck better than any other razor and shaves just as close as my Mach 3.</li>
            <li>The razor does require more than one pass, and as in other reviews, it is louder than a rotary.</li>
            <li>I have owned Panasonic electric razors since they came out on the market and have converted many other friends to them as well.</li>
            <li>Now to the shave, it is smooth as you can imagine almost as good if not the same as with a regular blade, it is fast as well, I liked it so much that afraid</li>
            <li>Quicker and more thorough than either of my other electrics.  </li>
            <li>much better than a safety razor or any other electric i have owned or tried.</li>
            <li>Panasonic makes my favorite other electric items like a camera and also a cassette \\&quot;Panasonic Walkman\\&quot; music player that I used to use (with Panasonic \\&quot;tapes\\&quot;)</li>
            <li>It is much better than their other shave creams since you can see your face.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Bought it for senior relative who dropped and broke his original.</li>
            <li>I have used the Panasonic now for about a month and am glad that I selected it over the other shavers I researched.</li>
            <li>The normal razor is far better actually.</li>
            <li>All in all, excited about my purchase and still have about 20% of battery life left after a week of use.</li>
            <li>; XMAS day 2013: This is a follow-up to my original 4-star review as shown above.</li>
            <li>After my latest Braun&#x27;s battery ceased holding a charge I decided to look at other companies products.</li>
            <li>Replacement of blades and screen are required more often than other razors I have owned.  </li>
            <li>But it was better than any other I have used.  </li>
            <li>Best of all, this ins&#x27;t even that expensive in the realm of electric shavers!</li>
            <li>have read reviews stating that there are other shavers out there that are better.</li>
            <li>Or maybe the other razor is supposed to also be able to get close to your skin, but as a result of it being a part of this wretched machine, can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is noisy; but I am okay putting up with it for 10 minutes every other day.</li>
            <li>No redness noticed and each shave seems to be better than the last one, can now properly shave areas that I couldn&#x27;t at first.</li>
            <li>I originally bought my Panasonic razor, identical to this except the digital display part, in Japan.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s not one to say anything other that it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>.It is suit for me.much better than other one.de.rserve</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, wet/dry gives it more versatility than other razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the Panasonic better than any other razor to date.</li>
            <li>I originally got the one with only 2 foils, but found it didn&#x27;t cut several-day-old stubble.  </li>
            <li>I do have to go over certain parts a few times to get everything, but overall it is a very comfortable and smooth shave.</li>
            <li>First, the electronics are outstanding on two counts:  1) it fully charges in less than an hour, and 2) it continues to run at full speed even as the battery discharges--the motor has the same output at 10% battery reserve that it does at 90% battery reserve.  </li>
            <li>It gives a nice close shave with very little effort and holds a charge for a reasonable amount of time.  </li>
            <li>Keeps a charge for a very long time and cleans up easily.</li>
            <li>This new razor is 5db more quiet than my old one.</li>
            <li>On the top of the head I can buzz over the bumpy scalp smoothly and easily without cutting anything.</li>
            <li>I bought this for husband for Father&#x27;s Day this year as his old Panasonic was pretty much toast.</li>
            <li>This product is just the opposite--it cuts facial hair cleanly and without pain.  </li>
            <li>You HAVE to clean it constantly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using various non-electric razors for the past 45 years or so and would be happy to continue to do so</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get some of the long and fine hairs on my neck, but the trimmer does get them without burn.</li>
            <li>Clean up is very simple just soap and water.</li>
            <li>This shaver will actually remind you to clean it before each</li>
            <li>For the first few times it takes time, but shaves really smooth and no cuts and no irritation!</li>
            <li>As others said, it&#x27;s also not real good at catching clippings.  </li>
            <li>The problem I had was getting a clean shave all over without doing several passes over some contoured areas.</li>
            <li>To complicate my use approach, I have a full facial beard that I trim to a very fastidious level using the trimmer.  </li>
            <li>After much research, I settled on this particular shaver.....</li>
            <li>When I was cleaning it recently, I did decide to take the blades off and clean around in there a bit with a Q-tip.</li>
            <li>It requires a lot of work to get a clean shave, and even that only comes at the expense of my skin.  </li>
            <li>It still takes time and multiple passes to look clean.</li>
            <li>Had it now for several years and it is durable and provides a clean shave</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t clean the blades with a brush, and that is probably why they last longer.  </li>
            <li>Simple to use, clean.</li>
            <li>But above all, clean it after you use it.</li>
            <li>I read the many good reviews from others who have a similar beard problem as I do; easy to shave face but very difficult to shave neck (hairs don&#x27;t grow straight and skin is somewhat sensitive).  </li>
            <li>Works fine but takes 4 times as long to shave than razor.  </li>
            <li>Overall, generally well satisfied and would recommend this to others with the caveat</li>
            <li>The same way I monthly clean my houses sewer pipes....</li>
            <li>This razor lasts pretty long after a full charge.</li>
            <li>They had the plastic in the middle to push and clean between the two blades.</li>
            <li>I had to clean it a couple of times to get her back in shape.</li>
            <li>The battery technology is much improved over older shavers.</li>
            <li>dry feature for easy cleaning</li>
            <li>I also end up using a standard razor anyway to clean up whiskers that the Panasonic misses.</li>
            <li>I have been diligent with rinsing and keeping it clean (hot water + dish soap, as the instructions suggest), but if I don&#x27;t disassemble the unit to dry.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin, and this razor is very gentle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;ve missed a neck area for 2-3 days, I have to use the trimmer blade before the shaver will cut those longer coarse hairs cleanly.</li>
            <li>I only clean mine before recharge cycles.</li>
            <li>you want a clean shave, especially on your neck, this is not going to work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had basic Braun shavers in the past and was happy with those shavers at the $40-$50 range.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my boyfriend as a gift and it won&#x27;t clean properly</li>
            <li>I generally replace it once a year, which is actually cheaper than buying most razor blades.</li>
            <li>: To cheaply, easily clean, I bought Gillette fluid refills for their razor&#x27;s cleaning system.</li>
            <li>pulled apart outer foil blades [following insructions] to clean.</li>
            <li>I wish, however, that I got a clean shave without having to use a second razor.</li>
            <li>please let me know (particularly shaving below side burns and creating a straight side-burn end).  </li>
            <li>please let me know (particularly shaving below side burns and creating a straight side-burn end).  </li>
            <li>Very low maintenance - just clean.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean and nice to know how much battery life is left before the motor fails part way through a shave.</li>
            <li>It gives a very close wet shave and a dry shave is good with a couple of passes.</li>
            <li>I shave dry and my first shave was quick and close and left my face smooth.  </li>
            <li>As far as the shaver itself, it&#x27;s a very good shaver, good quality, although the trimmer on the back of the unit is worthless.  </li>
            <li>The device does heat up when using it dry, and it is not the smoothest run over the skin, but because it is a wet/dry shaver, I recommend using it with a little shaving cream and rinsing, works great.</li>
            <li>It quickly cuts through my beard and leaves my face smooth and with relatively little burn.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely agree with most of the positive reviews, but want to make a few remarks.    </li>
            <li>The Panasonic model had several more positive reviews than the Braun in the same price range.</li>
            <li>The only con I see is the battery life; which does a good 9 shaves and will probably go down to about 6 after a year of usage.  </li>
            <li>Unlike most electric shavers that ask you to shave with theirs for a few weeks to get use to the shave(most likely so that you will forget how much better your old shaver was than theirs);from</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pull the hair at all, and the high rpm on the blades is very reassuring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also bought the wahl shaver which I don&#x27;t use very much because that one is a lot noisier and pulls my 4-5 or 6 day old beard.</li>
            <li>i suppose it would be ok at trimming that, but it&#x27;s much more difficult to use for buzzing your whole face, and because it flips up instead of sliding up, you have to prop it up with your thumb to really use</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t like the high whine of the Panasonic motor and much prefer the lower pitch of the Norelco when shaving.</li>
            <li>Maybe a brand new disposable on the first half of my face was better?</li>
            <li>For this kind of money, you should at least get a decent shave within a reasonable amount of time!</li>
            <li>A lot closer a shave than any women&#x27;s shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned, has a higher RPM, easy cleaning and fast charging (less than an hour).</li>
            <li>Companys with a reputation for quality need to keep quality and the end user experience as their number one priority to survive in the new world of global cheap products, customers want quality; and if we know that is what we will get we will pay for it</li>
            <li>Bottom line is that I just put a new blade set in the Norelco Arcitec and will probably go back to that as my primary shaver.</li>
            <li>It was fragile, noisy, does not shave well and require special care.</li>
            <li>, I tried unlocking the pivot head and shaving, shaving right after hot shower, razor fully charged, different angles to shave the hair, etc.</li>
            <li>A little loud but overall great value for the cost.</li>
            <li>Just making sure to use a light touch and a little extra time.</li>
            <li>I have only had this for a little over 2 weeks, but so far it is a great shaver.  </li>
            <li>My 10 year old Norelco did a better job while dry.</li>
            <li>I have used it wet and dry and get a good shave either way.  </li>
            <li>So I do need to shave more often but it gets a much closer shave than my previous electric.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;Edit- Razor had a decent long life (&gt;2 yrs) and took replacement blades just fine, but it stopped working one day.</li>
            <li>It recharges so quickly and really goes deep with no irritation..</li>
            <li>Works good wet or dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this shaver for nearly 2 years, and after recently replacing the blade and foil it is still going strong.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get to the upper lip near the nose easily because of the bulky head.</li>
            <li>I also have a mild case of psoriasis, with patches of affected skin near my sideburns and on both sides of my neck near my larynx.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth cutting and gliding across each contour of my face, with no pulls to my skin, makes shaving pleasant and not a chore.</li>
            <li>Performance good wet or dry shaving.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a loyal Panasonic shaver user for about 25 years but am really dissappointed to watch the quaity degrade in the recent models.</li>
            <li>It gives me a very close shave, it charges in less than an hour, and the charge lasts more than a week.  </li>
            <li>This machine isn&#x27;t particularly cooperative when it comes to styling your facial hair, but I prefer to be clean shaven anyways, so it&#x27;s not a problem for me)&lt;br /&gt;Overall:</li>
            <li>Although the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; shave feature is a nice novelty, neither it, nor the standard dry shave experience</li>
            <li>My old Panasonic shaver was still going strong after almost ten years of use but decided to purchase this upgraded version and boy</li>
            <li>In fact, this shaver is superior to my recently purchased Braun, and is almost half the price.  </li>
            <li>half off I definitely recommend this product as it should work much better than other conventional shaving methods but do not expect a 100% perfect shave after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was excited that I was finally going to allow myself to spend more than the $49.99 I paid for my previous shaver,</li>
            <li>It delivers a very smooth shave and it does it in less time than the Norelco I used for years.  </li>
            <li>I tried getting by with cheap shavers for a long time but they kept yanking out hairs and not giving me a close shave.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it in the shower but it works fine when shaving dry.</li>
            <li>It puts out a sound that seems to be of a higher pitch but not louder than other shavers I have had, and is not annoying.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Great battery life; been using it a few months and only had to recharge once so far.</li>
            <li>And by far, after the first time I used this razor (</li>
            <li>/&gt; The second shave two days later went much faster and the shave was indeed much better and smoother.</li>
            <li>One full charge will last me about a week of every day shaving.</li>
            <li>I saw this shaver on a steep discount and I decided to try electric for a first time in my life (35yrs old).    </li>
            <li>and I did notice that the first time, but I&#x27;m not that sensitive and haven&#x27;t noticed it since.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin prone to razor rash, irritation and burn.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only getting 4-5 shaves out of full charge.</li>
            <li>I soaked the head of the shaver in mouthwash, which helped a lot for about two weeks, but then the odor was back, full force.</li>
            <li>At first they had fixed shaving heads and since Li batteries hadn&#x27;t been invented yet, NiCd batteries instead.</li>
            <li>My past ES8065 and ES8092 had nice velvet bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have somewhat sensitive skin &amp; this has basically accompished exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was that the ES8103S took longer to shave with than my 5 year old Panasonic Linear shaver ever did.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric razor and I was pleasantly surprised at how close a shave this razor can provide.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the more expensive versions of Panasonic shavers do, but this model is plenty good enough in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>The first experience was WOW.</li>
            <li>Thus, I only get 6-8 shaves out of a full charge.    </li>
            <li>You normally see this as traces of rust but stainless won&#x27;t show you this and</li>
            <li>Only get about 6 - 8 shaves out of a full charge since the batteries are aging</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Brauns and Remingtons in the past - and liked them -</li>
            <li>I used enough force to burn my skin but did not get a shave even as good as my pretty ordinary shaver gives me.</li>
            <li>A full recharge with 10% left takes about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>One time full charge can last for a while.</li>
            <li>But definitely not worth more than $39.95</li>
            <li>ONLY TWO FULL BLADES.</li>
            <li>I figured that with the cost of maintenance for these shavors, its not worth it to get the most updated version.  </li>
            <li>aware that this shaver is loud.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually kind of surprised that it just suddenly stopped charging yesterday out of the blue.</li>
            <li>It did however get pretty darn close to the skin which I was surprised with.</li>
            <li>This razor is stellar as I get close shaves without hurting my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The razor is pretty far from anything I&#x27;d recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The noise this thing makes is pretty loud.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see more blade cutters like on the more expensive model helping much.</li>
            <li>It actually keeps full power until discharged AND</li>
            <li>My first ever electric shaver (I&#x27;ve been shaving for nearly 30 years with a manual razor up to now)</li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s a bit loud.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried elec razors thru the years ( 60 yrs old ) and this the first that shaves well.</li>
            <li>But maybe it&#x27;s just never possible to get a full shave without lathering up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned Braun electric shavers that were three times this price that didn&#x27;t do as good a job, which is why I didn&#x27;t replace my last one for several years and used a regular razor with disposable blades.  </li>
            <li>My skin is pretty sensitive</li>
            <li>/&gt;In reality, you won&#x27;t get a very close/stubble-free shave, and you will need multiple passes over the difficult areas, but as an electric shaver it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>Gives me a nice, close shave without all of the irritation that I usually get from going &amp;#34;against the grain&amp;#34; with a manual razor.</li>
            <li>It is pretty dam loud.</li>
            <li>Now, it has some downsides, first of all it&#x27;s LOUD AS HELL compared to the Norelco.</li>
            <li>So I end up using a disposable blade if i actually want a good shave, kind of disappointing.</li>
            <li>and it not bad enough to bother.  </li>
            <li>Long hairs were a problem with other razors but this one does a good job with them.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s first tune up with new foil and blades, the display still operates like new and now the shaver does</li>
            <li>He has very sensitive skin and is very particular about the closeness of his shave.  </li>
            <li>It shaves better than Norellco and most of all I can clean the shaver with regular liqid soap and water(no need expensive cleaning solution).  </li>
            <li>Now granted this was my first experience with an electric shaver (I use the old school straight razor), but I thought it took a long time to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li>It shaves fast, clean, and holds a charge much longer than my old Braun, plus it only takes about an hour to fully charge.  </li>
            <li>Charges quickly, and I love that I can see how much charge is left so it doesn&#x27;t die on me half way through shaving.</li>
            <li>Probably an easy fix, but it gave me an excuse to buy a new razor.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic is amazing and although it&#x27;s a foil razor, it performs just fine on my neck where the foils of yesteryear failed.</li>
            <li>This is a current model of my old razor  and is working fine.</li>
            <li>Better than the Braun hands down.....</li>
            <li>I just love going to work, looking down at my shirt and seeing clipping dust from shaving that morning.</li>
            <li>I need a better way to shave because I couldn&#x27;t look up, down or twist my head while shaving.</li>
            <li>Just need to make sure you don&#x27;t run the charge way down and forget to charge it.</li>
            <li>It seem to make the hairs lie down, and made it more of a pain to get them.</li>
            <li>Technique is critical, and it will take time to figure out the best way to use it on different parts of your face.&lt;br /&gt;The battery charges quickly and usually gives me 3 to 4 long shaves before recharging.  </li>
            <li>those who have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use razors, I highly recommend this machine, or the ES-LA63-S (for those with a slightly higher budget).&lt;br /&gt;The zero-irritation factor is something that I just can&#x27;t speak highly enough of.&lt;br /&gt;Add convenience into the mix and that makes this machine a true godsend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mean that I had a few bumps, primarily by the throat area, but on my cheeks &amp; chin the shave was great.</li>
            <li>The only way I could ever get the skin to feel smooth to the touch required many passes pushing pretty hard.  </li>
            <li>This one seems to clean just fine with minimal time and effort (and no extra expense).</li>
            <li>only downside is that it discharges relatively quickly, but fortunately it doesn&#x27;t take long to charge up, either.</li>
            <li>I have not reviewed many electric shavers, and my old faithful Remington Rotary 460D titanium sounds tame and calm by comparison</li>
            <li>I was really hoping that this shaver would perform a little better.</li>
            <li>I find that it takes a little more time to shave in the shower than the Fusion blade number, but it is much safer.  </li>
            <li>I only bought this new one because of the sale price, and I figure the batteries in the original may be getting close to the end.</li>
            <li>I received my replacement shaver today and to my surprise Panasonic sent a brand new ES8243A!</li>
            <li>I hope the new one serves me well for years to come!</li>
            <li>It was easier and cheaper to just be a brand new one!</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m in the market again for a new shaver (not quite 3 years after buying this one!)</li>
            <li>Save the money and buy NEW!</li>
            <li>It looks almost like new; I HAVE NOT CHANGED THE FOIL OR THE BLADE IN THAT TIME!</li>
            <li>you have a tough beard and sensitive skin, you might not be 100% happy.</li>
            <li>I have a tough beard and shaver gets reasonably close (not as good as a blade) to give the appearance of close shave.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product, it may cost a bit more than your average shaver</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty loud as far as electric razors go, but doesn&#x27;t really bother me too much.  </li>
            <li>It just seems like with the flat blade it is easier to get your whole face quickly.</li>
            <li>website says to call an 800 number, and the 800 number says to use the website.&lt;br /&gt;If a little less than two years is good enough for you the shaver is ok.</li>
            <li>First up was the regular razor, which was the generic twin blade kind I get at \\&quot;Pay Cheap.\\&quot; Shaving in dry mode seemed really not the most efficient.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only ever used Panasonic wet/dry shavers, so I have no other manufacturer to compare to, but I find these razors to be a perfect blend of the closeness gained from traditional wet shaving with the general lack of skin irritation associated with electrics.</li>
            <li>The Braun did better in tight concave areas and the Panasonic better in tight convex areas.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recall this being as much of an issue when the shaver was new.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recall this being as much of an issue when the shaver was new.  </li>
            <li>It takes two to three weeks of use to become accustomed to the new shaver which may reduce the number of passes required to get a really close shave.</li>
            <li>but I was ready for something new.</li>
            <li>I am new to modern wet/dry shavers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hubby loves this razor so much I&#x27;m buying him a new one for Christmas.</li>
            <li>Upon receiving the new ES8103S, I immediately noticed how much closer each shave was in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I assume though that this will cost one about as much as just buying a brand new shaver.  </li>
            <li>It was time for me to replace the blade on this ES8103S anyway, and since I really don&#x27;t care for it, I decided to just put that money towards a new shaver</li>
            <li>For that price I may as well buy a whole new one.  </li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t care, you buy something brand new</li>
            <li>if you are on a budget the norelco is a good shaver for the money it will do the job, but a little slower , i highly recommend es8103s especially if you get it on sale, around christmas k mart wanted 99$ for it, but i found one at target on clearance for 60$.</li>
            <li>I have used my Norelco rotary with 3-year-old blades to clean up stubble left over from a shave with the brand new Panasonic.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely amazed at how comfortable a wet shave (with lather) is.  </li>
            <li>these are way better than those that are like $30 or less.</li>
            <li>If it can have less noise, that will be even better.  </li>
            <li>He thinks it works better than Norelco which was the shaver he had previous to this before it broke on him.  </li>
            <li>Sure, there are features that some people might like to have modified this way or that, but that is no reason to give less stars.  </li>
            <li>I previously had a Panasonic that lasted many years.</li>
            <li>Much more than my previous shavers had.</li>
            <li>Much more than my previous shavers had.</li>
            <li>Still its better than the Braun and Norelco shavers I had previously.</li>
            <li>I have primarily used it in the dry mode and a couple of times after wetting my face with tap water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great razor to use when you don&#x27;t want to take a chance at cutting yourself with a blade, or when you just want a quick dry shave to clean up before going out, without the hassle of shaving cream, etc.</li>
            <li>I find it&#x27;s easier to clean when i use it dry, and only need to apply soap and clean under running water about once/week.</li>
            <li>smooth dry shave  </li>
            <li>It shaves as close as a blade, and can be used when the hair on your face is longer than most shavers; i.e., two days growth was the maximum length of my previous shaver.  </li>
            <li>More than half off list.</li>
            <li>I tried more than fourty minutes but also could not shave half of my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also 2 settings for the head to allow more or less pivot.  </li>
            <li>But this shaver does the job in half as many attempts and with almost no irritation whatsoever.</li>
            <li>previously owned electric shavers from Remington, Norelco and Braun, all of them but the Remington cost more than this Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>although I did not like to use it under the shower (it is not as smooth as when your face is dry).</li>
            <li>I replaced my previous Panasonic shaver (ES8103), since I had dropped it in the bathroom one too many times.</li>
            <li>Much better than his previous three head razor.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product in September 2010, after being highly satisfied with previous Panasonic shavers.</li>
            <li>It took my half an hour to shave with (more time than disposal</li>
            <li>Seems they&#x27;re just lightening and cheapening them up and charging more for less these days.</li>
            <li>However, it generates much more noise than the previous one I had.</li>
            <li>Top of the line Remington foil and Norelco rotary razors relegated to the linen closet after abysmal performances from previous years.</li>
            <li>This one cuts better and with less discomfort.  </li>
            <li>My previous razor was the panasonic 4 blade and this product is even better.</li>
            <li>I can easily say that it beats any shaver, including a wet blade razor.  </li>
            <li>gives you easy cleaning or the ability of a wet shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Though with the very quick charge time, it&#x27;s not much to complain about.</li>
            <li>If you enjoy a dry shave, it helps a lot.  </li>
            <li>My husband chose this razor for several of the features, the quick recharge time,the built-in trimmer and that it is dual voltage.</li>
            <li>Often this quickly exceeds the cost of the actual shaver.</li>
            <li>I got this to replace an older Norelco</li>
            <li>Hope this would replace my older 4 blade panasonic</li>
            <li>This does the job but not as quickly or as easily as my older razor.</li>
            <li>I need a shaver that I can use while plugged in, and don&#x27;t want a shaver that if the battery is low I need to charge it quickly and wait around while it does so.</li>
            <li>- These comments are from my initial shave, I&#x27;ll try to remember to update later when I&#x27;ve had more experience.  </li>
            <li>Bought razor to replace an older Remington.  </li>
            <li>So I decided to give this a try, mainly because of the wet-dry feature.  </li>
            <li>I SHOULD have purchased another Panasonic, but I needed a replacement quickly and could not find anything locally.</li>
            <li>Overall, I give the edge to Panasonic for a better overall shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After more research and the reading of umpteen reviews on several different shaver brands, I decided to give Panasonic another chance and ordered the model ES8103.</li>
            <li>Main cons :</li>
            <li>There are a lot of in-depth reviews already, so I&#x27;ll make mine short and quick.  </li>
            <li>When I use the Shave Soap, the motor and blades create enough aggitation that it will actually foam the soap, making the shave even more</li>
            <li>The main part of the shaver head doesn&#x27;t shave, but the trimmer does.</li>
            <li>No electric will provide the closeness of a blade, so in that sense be realistic when you buy one of these.  </li>
            <li>I am using Remington classic to cut the rest of the hair with backside motion.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent, if not the closest shave.  </li>
            <li>this will be big issue in a year or so when the battery can&#x27;t hold the charge, I used my last razor for more than 2 year after battery stop holding charge by just connecting to plug and use it.</li>
            <li>but I keep buying this particular one because i like how it shaves.</li>
            <li>I switched from an older remington model.  </li>
            <li>and I needed to replace my older version as it no longer held a charge and the model itself was phased out.</li>
            <li>and then whip out my regular Gillette razor and just quickly hit the problem areas rather than spend 10</li>
            <li>It provides a decent shave but</li>
            <li>/&gt;- my hair is not \\&quot;kinky\\&quot; but more like in between mixed and coarse</li>
            <li>My older [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Also, there is no carrying case furnished, but I have an adequate one from a former razor.  </li>
            <li>Gives a reasonably close shave, especially when fresh from the box.</li>
            <li>battery doesn&#x27;t last all that many days, especially compared to my Braun shaver.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent shaver.  </li>
            <li>The razor charges quickly and the charges seem to last for 7-8 uses.</li>
            <li>main thing it saves you a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Had considered the more expensive Panasonic models, but I&#x27;m perfectly satisfied with this one.    </li>
            <li>I have tried many brands cheaper &amp; more expensive than the Panasonic ES8103S</li>
            <li>Like that it provides decent shave for ~90% of the face.</li>
            <li>but since Amazon only gives a 30 day window, which, when counting the day of receipt and time required to charge and then adequately go through the trial period, you pass the return period.      </li>
            <li>/&gt;It replaced his older Panasonic.</li>
            <li>Particularly around the neck.</li>
            <li>Any whiskers older than two days are quite rebellious to the shaving attempts made by the Panasonic ES8103S.</li>
            <li>I have one from an older razor, but this should be a part of the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product as far as I can tell is only available on line.</li>
            <li>Tried all the brauns starting from the 1990&#x27;s models all the way to their most current 7 series shavers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes a decent amount of shaving for me to achieve that (10+ mins for me), but it&#x27;s convenient.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an older guy</li>
            <li>Inevitably, I&#x27;ve found the electrics notably inferior to blades and have switched back.  </li>
            <li>it actually reduces the underlying day-to-day irritation that accompanies mild cases of psoriasis like mine.    </li>
            <li>This is a replacement for an older weaker razor.</li>
            <li>When turned on, ES8103S is louder than my another older model ES4026.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I thought it would, because the charger has a decent length of power cord connected to the shaver.</li>
            <li>Some older models have.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my prior six year old Panasonic shaver that I use primarily when I travel.  </li>
            <li>The LCD display on the older model stopped working</li>
            <li>They lasted a decent time.</li>
            <li>Finish of course with the main blades.</li>
            <li>Even if it were the same performance, that one is more value for money as it comes with an extra head.</li>
            <li>I can only use a bladed razor to shave my legs about twice a week, even when using the super lubricating venus spa blades.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had an &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; razor, like the older version coveted Brauns with which to compare to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a big deal for me, because it again it&#x27;s really quick, but I mention it in case any one else needs</li>
            <li>This one is almost identical to my older one which I used for about 5 years without replacing anything.</li>
            <li>Gives a decent shave, but rather noisy.</li>
            <li>After my older Panasonic razor didn&#x27;t cut it anymore (after almost 3 years).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already getting a decent shave.</li>
            <li>This does a decent job</li>
            <li>Wet shaves are another story, often catching the hair and needing multiple passes to get anything resembling a acceptable shave.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer works as expected and it&#x27;s a nice simple design.</li>
            <li>Only problem is musty smell from washing and replacing cap to quickly</li>
            <li>quickly you can shave if your beard is short (see below)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Replaced an older Panasonic foil shaver.</li>
            <li>Alright, so as a razor this works... decently well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Panasonic gives me a much closer shave than the old Braun was capable of</li>
            <li>He has quite a bit of growth for a teen and shaves once or twice a week, if we are lucky.</li>
            <li>A main decision factor was that you could use it wet/dry.</li>
            <li>IS MORE NOISE,AND 1150 SEEMS TO BE A MORE EXPENSIVE ONE</li>
            <li>I need to shave quickly if I want this battery to last me 5 shaves.</li>
            <li>The reviews mainly swayed my purchase.</li>
            <li>The particular Braun and Remington models I used could not be cleaned in water.</li>
            <li>Having owned and used both and many others, I&#x27;m starting to think the latter group has it right.(As an aside, this model has been replaced by the LT41-K, which is currently selling here on Amazon for only $6 more than the 8103S.</li>
            <li>I recommend this shaver for older men.</li>
            <li>then use my Philips Norelco Bodygroom Shaver to make the whiskers short enough for the Remington to cut or else it would just skate over the top of my beard about after 15 minutes of shaving and loads of razor</li>
            <li>Faster and closer than Norelco and an older Braun.</li>
            <li>I have had various Braun shavers for years (most recently a 5885 model).</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shave Quality is only adequate.</li>
            <li>So if your charge is low, you can give it a quick charge to 20% in about 5 mins.</li>
            <li>I am not using since 6 months classic blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BATTERY</li>
            <li>but it took an age to get a decent shave with this</li>
            <li>IT IS NOISY - yes, particularly when you do your cheeks/sideburns</li>
            <li>This razor replaced the older model #8103.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it was a decent razor.</li>
            <li>I have had to use the rear trimmer to get my neck almost every time, as the main blades miss 55% of that area      </li>
            <li>Once I felt comfortable and got to know the shaver, I developed enough confidence to use it.</li>
            <li>Over the years I have tried  to find an electric shaver that was at least as good as an old fashioned blade.  </li>
            <li>I guess the difference is mainly the nanotechnology.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my older Braun 5000 series razor and never got the closeness and comfort from the Braun that I am getting from the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be able to go back to regular shaving.</li>
            <li>Gives a good shave but have to do multiple passes over my trouble spots.  </li>
            <li>Super quiet and efficient - I can even talk to my wife while shaving.  </li>
            <li>This is a decent shaver.</li>
            <li>If one is looking for a decent shaver, I recommend this one.</li>
            <li>(though it still works decently).</li>
            <li>I got a Braun 380s-4 last christmas that did better but still required multiple passes.</li>
            <li>So about late February, I remembered my old electric razors and thought maybe a good foil razor would be the answer to my problems.</li>
            <li>I purchased this one because it was on sale (around $60) and it had decent reviews.</li>
            <li>BUT FOR A RETIREE ON A DAILY BASIS IT&#x27;S CERTAINLY ADEQUATE.</li>
            <li>and I cannot imagine one of the more expensive ones doing a better job.</li>
            <li>Came the next day for  minimal charge and my husband was thrilled.</li>
            <li>It does a decent job for an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>Bought it to replace an older Panasonic shave with a dying battery.</li>
            <li>It looks and feels like decent quality</li>
            <li>some reason, I began to break out on my face and the sides of my head (non-razor bumps, mainly acne).  </li>
            <li>husband has had a Panasonic for more than a decade +, and I have hunted for the same Brand and type with same I.D. Number to no avail.</li>
            <li>Far better than expected.  </li>
            <li>Overall satisfied with this shaver as I have only had it a couple of months.</li>
            <li>Loved the old razor, and had been able to buy replacement cutting heads to keep it fresh, but this year the battery finally stopped holding a charge.  </li>
            <li>The batter is still holding a solid charge (uses about 10% per shave, so I can easily get 8 days worth of shaving on a single charge).  </li>
            <li>The batter is still holding a solid charge (uses about 10% per shave, so I can easily get 8 days worth of shaving on a single charge).  </li>
            <li>It provides a very close shave and leaves the skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>long story short, i bought norelco 7310x for 35$, shaved good but felt underpowered and trimmer felt the same, i&#x27;d rate the shaver 4.4 stars, then i bought panasonic ES8103s very powerful motor and trimmer, it got 3 heads on the trimmer, i liked it especially the trimmer vs norelco,, plus you can use it wet or dry</li>
            <li>razor, charge lasts a long time, close shave, easy to clean, can get wet</li>
            <li>Amazon replaced the first unit (with free return shipping), and the second one had the same problem.</li>
            <li>Because it get to hot for my confort, I started shaving with the wet option but in order to get a close shave then you have to spend more time going back and forth to get a desirable shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used electrics mostly for convenience of not having the mess of cream and also not getting cut.</li>
            <li>I recently went electric for the first time in 18 years and this is better than expected.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be weak in power and not cut good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Braun, Norelco, Remington, pretty much all the top ones and this razor cuts the closest and gives me the least irritation.</li>
            <li>but unfortunately I didn&#x27;t care for it, it was still better than any other razor, but the dry shave is just superb.</li>
            <li>you DON&#x27;T rely on the long hair pop-up trimmer, it actually does do a pretty close, decent shave, leaving my skin smooth without much irritation.</li>
            <li>It really lubricates and keeps the blade cool and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out..</li>
            <li>I have owned these razor&#x27;s previously and i am very satisfied with the shave i receive daily  from this electric razor .</li>
            <li>It has a narrower head, so it is better and getting into tight places.  </li>
            <li>I get a clean, comfortable shave every time - and it doesn&#x27;t grow back with sharp ends like I get with a blade.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is easy to like, because it works as advertised, has the percentage remaining charge displayed, recharges in less than 1 hour and has the detail trimmer conveniently located on the back side, easily accessible.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>

            <li>I do think the price is too high.</li>

            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re in the market for an electric razor I highly recommend this model.</li>
            <li>The high pitched whine it gives off is indicative of its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I can recommend this unit highly.</li>
            <li>Over the years, I tried several different styles and brands of shavers, but I kept coming back to old faithful, my beloved Remington MicroScreen 3.  </li>
            <li>I shave my head with this and can get 2 full face/head shaves off of a single charge and still have 10-20% charge remaining depending on how much growth I had.  </li>
            <li>Gives a very comfortable shave, though not nearly as close as a Braun shaver of older but similar design.  </li>
            <li>The little pop-up blade on the back is ideal for small areas and a quick touch-up of the neck area between haircuts.</li>
            <li>He had another one which was fairly new which gave a poor shave, so I paid for fast shipping to get this one which had good reviews.   </li>
            <li>But now that ive used several times and the new factor has worn off, it doesn&#x27;t do as well as I thought, but they work, I use them almost till the battery is dead tho each use, so that isn&#x27;t to good</li>
            <li>I had tried Norelco and Braun and it would take a long time to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li>Instructions not clear on how to \\&quot;wash\\&quot; under water, so I just brush clean.</li>
            <li>Now it works great equally well wet or dry.</li>
            <li>Works well,easy to clean and holds charge a long time.</li>
            <li>Versatile use dry or wet and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>So far, I am pleased with the performance of this shaver and, based upon my experience with other Panasonic models, I am not concerned at all about the light-weight construction.</li>
            <li>These are especially on my upper lip, and perhaps are laying more flat?</li>
            <li>My first one, and I&#x27;m near 75 years old!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it with shaving cream, only dry, but I&#x27;ve been very happy and have used it for at least two years now.</li>
            <li>but the wet option was fine.  </li>
            <li>The build quality is reasonable, and it shaves well enough, though requires more &#x27;passes&#x27; in these early weeks to give a clean shave than my, admittedly, far more expensive Braun.</li>
            <li>FAR BETTER THAN OTHER BRANDS</li>
            <li>I purchased this shaver to replace a 5 year old, top of the line, other manufacturer&#x27;s shaver.</li>
            <li>However, rather than get new blades for it (which is all it really needed), I got a new razor.  </li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive hearing, and I can say for certain that the ES8103S is not damaging my hearing.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>This new shaver is identical in design, but works much better and is slightly quieter.</li>
            <li>The price that I paid was a little better than WallyWorld.  </li>
            <li>It shaves a little closer, feels better in my hand, and moves easier over my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a top-of-the-line $300 shaver, so I understand if it&#x27;s got some flaws, but I was expecting a little more.</li>
            <li>The trimmer could be a little better</li>
            <li>I always spray a little cologne before I leave to the office and there is no awful burn after shaving with this panasonic.</li>
            <li>each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second use, a little better.</li>
            <li>I decided to spend a little more on a razor than the cheapest option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shave takes a little longer than the higher-end unit, but that&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>like not having to get my face lathered up and then shave with my razors for a quicker shave, but I would expect it work a little better with my neck and under-jawline</li>
            <li>All I can say is wow!!</li>
            <li>trimmer could be a little better.</li>
            <li>Took a little time to get used to this razor as I was using a rotery for many years.</li>
            <li>Little lamps would be more reliable than a LCD display, now i wait for it to die before plugging it in.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m 89 yrs old!!  </li>
            <li>I mean Heck-- for that price I&#x27;d probably just be better off buying a new one with fresh blades!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However, daily use of this electric razor keeps me looking clean and my face clear.</li>
            <li>(With my old rotary blade razors I would get a clean shave with only one or two passes.)  </li>
            <li>to clean it, I merely remove the head &amp; hold it under running warm tapwater for 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li>First of all, I can only compare the Panasonic ES8103S to the crappy Walmart Remingtons I kept buying out of pure laziness.  </li>
            <li>I already have had one of these for several months, and I enjoy its ability to provide close shaves of three-day growths as easily as one-day growths of my moderately stiff beard.  </li>
            <li>It is only adequate and very loud.  </li>
            <li>It cuts closer than any other shaver that I have ever used, fits the hand well, and cleans easily.  </li>
            <li>The option to use Panasonics wet with shaving cream provides remarkably close shaves with little irritation.</li>
            <li>Shipped very quick due to being a prime member.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic also has the incredible ability to miss single hairs and leave very uneven, patchy shaves that I can&#x27;t really fix because the hairs are too short.  </li>
            <li>I can use it to take down some stubble, but still need straight edge for that super date!</li>
            <li>I have purchased replacement batteries on Amazon and replaced them myself, but these cheap China replacement batteries don&#x27;t last very long and are easily dislodged with regular use.    </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a little lazy, busy and smart like me :), I strongly recommend this product !</li>
            <li>My Norelco of many years was getting pretty dull</li>
            <li>(it has this neat little sideburn groomer feature that can also be used to prep/remove those longer personal hair areas before shaving and manicure/shape the outline if you prefer to retain a modesty patch, -- and on the QT, it can even gently remove hair from a lady&#x27;s upper lip) :P ...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s better in any other way, but this is all the difference I need!!</li>
            <li>This one does I really cant hardly believe it I am quite surprised and thrilled too&lt;</li>
            <li>I am aware the new razor has new foil and blade but my old razor with new foil and blades never got this close.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the end I simply returned this product and chose to go with the single bladed disposable razors and so far those have been the best for my sensitive skin and have eliminated nearly all my previous problems with razor bumps and acne.</li>
            <li>Even after buying all the new blades and foils for my remington MS2 300, it still didn&#x27;t give me a decent shave.</li>
            <li>I bought this because my es8243a has a decent number of years on it, and this shaver cost about as much as a new block &amp; cutters for the es8243a.</li>
            <li>However, I will say that my last shaver - an 9 month-old Braun that cost me $30 more than this Panasonic model - felt more solid, but literally fell apart in my hands after very little, light-duty use.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this shaver gives a very close shave without irritation.  </li>
            <li>It shaves much closer than his old one.</li>
            <li>Says it fits contours of face better than old more expensive razor.  </li>
            <li>It does cut much closer than my old panasonic.</li>
            <li>This razor is much lighter in my hand than my old one.  </li>
            <li>This gives it a much cheaper, flimsier feel than the old razor.  </li>
            <li>$80 is far too much to pay for this product.</li>
            <li>His old one was made in Japan and the material was real metal.</li>
            <li>After shaving a clean dry face there is no need to even activate the cleaning mode.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why a consumer protection agency has not forced a recall or issued a warning.  </li>
            <li>A much smoother shaver compared to my old</li>
            <li>not so much the pivot action even though this model has an intricate pivot mechanism.</li>
            <li>I have had Remington shavers my whole adult life.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this has been doing very well for me.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and remembered years ago really liking a Panasonic travel shaver I had.  </li>
            <li>great ES8065, mediocre ES8092 and problem-plagued ES8243A were made in Japan.</li>
            <li>My old Norelco was ready for replacement when it would not hold a rull recharge.</li>
            <li>Wow, it really does replace my blade and saves alot of time.</li>
            <li>My old electric shaver would not shave the neck no matter how much I asked it to.</li>
            <li>and it was much quieter than my old Braun.  </li>
            <li>It performs much like my old Norelco.</li>
            <li>Early models caused irritation and never gave me a really close shave.  </li>
            <li>Which he has sensitive skin with no breakouts thanks to this</li>
            <li>I am happy with it, it is not perfect, but does the job.  </li>
            <li>This ES8103S is much sleeker and lighter than the old model.  </li>
            <li>I find the ES8103s makes fast, nearly effortless work of my beard.  </li>
            <li>I primary used wet with shaving cream.</li>
            <li>And no messy sink from a straight razor.</li>
            <li>It gave me a clean shave usint the Dry application.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over a week for wet shaving, using shaving cream and already find that it delivers as comfortable and close a shave as I have ever had from a blade.  </li>
            <li>Battery could have lasted a bit longer as it seems to run out of charge much quicker than my old Panasonic charger of 3.5 yrs</li>
            <li>My old blade  &amp;#34;Braun&amp;#34; was much  noiser.</li>
            <li>It is much easier to use and shaves a lot closer than his old Norelco.  </li>
            <li>The sideburn trimmer works really well compared to my old unit.  </li>
            <li>and he really likes it so far</li>
            <li>I clean it by rinsing off in the faucet, shaking the water and leaving it on the counter to dry.  </li>
            <li>The transition from a straight razor was seamless.  </li>
            <li>It shaves much faster and closer than any of my old shavers and doesn&#x27;t chew up my face like the Braun shavers.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with the overall product and future upkeep cost providing it lasts me a few years.</li>
            <li>If you want more, Panasonic offers a 30 day guarantee and you can try one of their more expensive self cleaning units.  </li>
            <li>Although, it doesn&#x27;t work that smooth on a wet face.  </li>
            <li>So far it works really well.</li>
            <li>Like the higher \\&quot;rpm\\&quot; and the general feel and ease of use and cleaning.</li>
            <li>Dry is a plus for clean up by</li>
            <li>The foil casing is quite smooth and when it is wet it can be a tad slippery.  </li>
            <li>The extra 20 bucks will be worth it.</li>
            <li>be buying a few more as Christmas presents for my family.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this shaver for a few months.  </li>
            <li>At first, because of how quiet the Panasonic was, I was debating if it was really even working - since I was used to the buzz saw Remington.  </li>
            <li>On 1 full charge, I get about 7 shaves, and it only takes 1 hour to completely charge.    </li>
            <li>8168 wet/dry shaver finally gave out after 6+ years of pretty intense use -</li>
            <li>As far as the shaving, I can&#x27;t say I really see much of an improvement over my 7 year old razor.  </li>
            <li>This item shaves no better than either of the two low-end shavers I currently own, one of which is an old, crappy Remington with a Nickel Cadmium battery.</li>
            <li>Many of you may think, \\&quot;Why should I go to the trouble of using lather when I bought an electric shaver?\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Have to do a few more over the neck area</li>
            <li>Not only is the maintenance effortless it gives a fantastic shave with no drag.</li>
            <li>After using various Phillips/Norelco rotary shavers for most of my adult life, I finally got tired of replacing a perfectly good shaver because the battery died.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not top of the line, but it&#x27;s good enough to where I&#x27;ve bought two of these -</li>
            <li>For the most part you just won&#x27;t do it everyday because of that.</li>
            <li>I am coming up on 5 months with mine and needed a replacement blade set for it which I feel is resonable considering that I shave about 5 times the area as a normal shave of your face might have.</li>
            <li>I normally shave with a blade and still prefer that method.  </li>
            <li>, however, it is only so useful in the sense that it displays in 20% increments.</li>
            <li>No feeling of hypersensitivity after shaving, no irritation and most importantly, no nicks and cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this razor use it everyday.</li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s third or fourth shaver, and by far his favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve normally used basic razors and $40 electric shavers, but this is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>As I continued to use this razor I found that the electric razor irritated my skin more than my 3 blade razors ever had and my acne only got worse rather than better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had Norelcos and felt it was normal to use a Gillette every couple of days to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li>I think its useful for some people, but definitely not for everyone.</li>
            <li>The one draw back to the Panasonic vs. the Braun is the Braun has a better long hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Personally I wasn&#x27;t too concerned with the trimmer and rarely use it</li>
            <li>As an old man, I have probably used almost every brand of electric shavers, and Panasonic is head and shoulders above the others in terms of true value.  </li>
            <li>Although I didn&#x27;t notice it while shaving, it appears the shaver has the ability to shave a few microns off the top layer of \\&quot;bumpy skin.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I can get about a weeks worth of daily</li>
            <li>The Lock/Soft switch produces a noticeable effect on comfort &amp; performance - useful for different areas.</li>
            <li>I buy them for father,i  think it is ok for use everyday .hope</li>
            <li>This does not look normal.</li>
            <li>Former blade user with rare exceptions.</li>
            <li>I guess it might work better if I shaved everyday.</li>
            <li>It seems to be working better everyday</li>
            <li>It is more comfortable, but it also take 3 times as long to shave my face than it has in the past.</li>
            <li>Husband has not complained.</li>
            <li>(I use this one locked) and exotic cleaning systems are a waste of time and money for me.  </li>
            <li>Most rechargeables require a long initial charge to ensure the battery will work well.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>*( Just keep in mind that all shavers are meant to be discarded over time and replacement parts are normally priced extravagantly no matter what shaver you get, so don&#x27;t pass this shaver by just because of the cord issue, this is an industry reality)</li>
            <li>If you have just a few hair-you might be satisfied.</li>
            <li>When you skin dries under normal air humidity</li>
            <li>The unit doesn&#x27;t vibrate much at all, and is pretty quiet, though I would still say it&#x27;s going to wake up the spouse if used in a nearby bathroom.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally post reviews, but had to comment on this one...</li>
            <li>This baby lasts me about 10 shaves per charge and provides a close enough shave to be useful.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it,  but give it an honest try for at least 30 days.</li>
            <li>They warn you it&#x27;ll take 30 days for your face to get used to the switch, and maybe that&#x27;s true for a lot of people, but I don&#x27;t think it took that long for me.  </li>
            <li>(but no more than most others)&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t give as close a shave as real razor (but no electric shaver does)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since gone back to my old Norelco (battery charge lasts a full month).</li>
            <li>The cost for a 12 pack was about the same for this, so I figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a more heavy duty product.</li>
            <li>If you let the beard grow any longer than that, this shaver will start missing hairs and require more passes.</li>
            <li>but it just isn&#x27;t as good as they&#x27;ve been in the past for the same money.</li>
            <li>so normally just charge it on the weekend.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for a few months now and my neck has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>In terms of battery life, I get about a week&#x27;s worth of shaves out of it before it dies, invariably in the middle of shaving on Monday morning.</li>
            <li>Very quite, very close shave, long lasting battery life and the shaver is extremely light weight.</li>
            <li>but I was careful to nearly discharge it every time and occasionally fully discharge it as suggested for this kind of battery.</li>
            <li>I really love this shaver but after just a few months it&#x27;s not working well.  </li>
            <li>Normally about a week on a charge for my 4-5 minute shaves.</li>
            <li>exactly how much battery life is left.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have much success, and I vastly preferred a razor blade.</li>
            <li>the 3-Arc is waay smaller than the (albeit more powerful) 4 and 5-arc series which makes it literally much easier to handle for women&#x27;s body or/and facial hair issues, or those men with lighter facial and body hair issues in general.</li>
            <li>I still use my first (nearly 20 years old) as a travel shaver, now retiring it</li>
            <li>A few more things about the razor:&lt;br /&gt;-After</li>
            <li>I use this shaver everyday and love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But all in all it does a good job not great.</li>
            <li>The razor has good power behind it.</li>
            <li>Good not great.</li>
            <li>Little did I know that this new Panasonic was far superior in how it cuts for a truly razor close shave with total comfort.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overwhelming like the Panasonic four head blade shaver, essentially this is a trimmed down version of the best shaver Panasonic sells.  </li>
            <li>I had considered buying a new Braun (I&#x27;d owned two already), but I was a bit put off by the cost of the cleaning and lubricating cartridges for the high end models (</li>
            <li>But I would highly recommend this to anyone considering buying a new wet/dry rechargeable razor.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a new electric razor, I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>So hot that I have to let it cool down, to  avoid burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It charges very fast, typically an hour from 10% to 100% full, and</li>
            <li>I came here to order a new assembly, then saw that I could buy a completely new shaver for the cost of 1.5 new foil assemblies!</li>
            <li>My Remington was very loud, and the Panasonic has a much lower noise level; The Panasonic has a high pitched buzz to it, but it&#x27;s still about 1/2 as loud as the Remington, and took some getting used to.    </li>
            <li>This is somewhat less convenient, but the razor works very well, did not require a charge during a full week long trip, and is comfortable both in hand and on the face.</li>
            <li>Obviously, the charge lasts long as do most new razors.  </li>
            <li>If they designed it as a shelf while charging, that was pretty smart but because it&#x27;s flat and the body of the razor is curved</li>
            <li>If they designed it as a shelf while charging, that was pretty smart but because it&#x27;s flat and the body of the razor is curved</li>
            <li>The Panasonic 13,000 RPM motor cuts right through with no grabbing or tugging, whereas my last Braun would freeze up because it wasn&#x27;t powerful enough.  </li>
            <li>I have used Panasonic wet and dry shavers ever since I first saw one in a hardware store maybe forty or more years ago.</li>
            <li>I have a criticism, it&#x27;s that there is no hard case with it.</li>
            <li>Seriously, saving time can offset so many things!</li>
            <li>I would get 60% or better charge after a long shave in the beginning, but soon this dropped to about 40% or even 20% after a single shave following a full recharge.</li>
            <li>I have  occasionally use a manual razor to either give myself a fresh shave or a touch-up from that provided by my new</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed Braun shavers for a very long time and thought this one would be no different.</li>
            <li>I advised it for the old lady because her hands shake too much to shave herself and none of us, her caretakers, are confident enough using a razor on the rather loose and wrinkly skin on her</li>
            <li>Fast and smooth shaves in half the time are the norm.  </li>
            <li>Most of us are only going to use an electric shaver dry.</li>
            <li>While less that thrilled with that nugget, only time will tell whether that affects its longevity.</li>
            <li>so I will most likely stick to the dry shave.</li>
            <li>convenience of the option to use this shaver wet or dry is nice when I want to shave in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a nice feature because i&#x27;ve been caught before with a razor out of energy and only half way done with my shave.   </li>
            <li>Today I used my old Norelco and I got a better shave in half the time.</li>
            <li>I previously had a Norelco that worked fairly well, but never really gave me a close shave</li>
            <li>If I use the razor with a freshly whipped lather, the shave is very close; when I use it dry, with the assist of a pre-shave powder (Remington SP-5 Pre-Shave Talc</li>
            <li>I thought an electric would be nice for a quick shave, but boy was I wrong.  </li>
            <li>My last one lasted for over 5 years and was going strong, I simply wanted the &amp;#34;latest and greatest&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This is a good shaver, but like many other reviewers have noted, the shaver&#x27;s display failed after about 8 months.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m 32 yrs old) due to my inability to use any kind of razor without incurring massive skin repercussions.  </li>
            <li>The ES81035 shaves quietly, quickly, and closely, and stays sharp much longer than the older Panasonic razors I have had.  </li>
            <li>Success varied with these different approaches with the double edged razor giving me pretty decent results.</li>
            <li>With the foil removed, the blade vibrates at a faster speed than normal to facilitate easy cleaning; switching it on under warm running water immediately clears any debris from the blades, and any surrounding mess has a hard time adhering to the plastic beneath.  </li>
            <li>But when I tried the new Panasonic on one side of my face after shaving as normal, I could tell the difference - the electric got what the blade missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My son&#x27;s both have MicroScreen 3&#x27;s yet, but one of them recently suffered a fatal fall, so we decided to buy 2 more of these Panasonic&#x27;s to centralize on a single shaver blade to have to buy.    </li>
            <li>It was definitely the right choice to get the ES8103S.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve cleaned the unit multiple times according to the instructions, and even right after cleaning the shavings still fall out.  </li>
            <li>Assuming that&#x27;s right, you won&#x27;t need 2 sets of replacement inner blades.    </li>
            <li>Given the time it takes, one is better of using a plain razor and shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>I think you just need to experiment in different directions until you get the right one for each section of your face.</li>
            <li>It was definitely the right choice to get the ES8103S.</li>
            <li>I was amazed.&lt;br /&gt;For under $ 100, but to me that worn-customs iparcell came in the mail from abroad, says five-tana have a right to purchase following our progress with tc etc etc etc with no identity ....&lt;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using blades for years, and while this shaver does leave a few hairs uncut from time to time, it is smooth, effective, has a long lasting battery, and is really easy to clean!</li>
            <li>I had the old model for many years but to replace the blade it costs about half of buying a new one</li>
            <li>First with the Panasonic electric shaver , formerly Philips products are used after shaving think this product is very fast, the only drawback is shaking too much.</li>
            <li>This shaver enables me to trim my mustache close, smooth &amp; quick which wasn&#x27;t possible with my previous Norelco.</li>
            <li>have gained a closer shave, the ability to know how much battery charge is left (via an LCD readout) and a prompt to clean the razor when necessary.</li>
            <li>It still holds a charge for a long time and recharges quickly.  </li>
            <li>The shaver is quick &amp; does not leave long hairs on neck like some shavers.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to go super cheap or super expensive.</li>
            <li>Again keeping the state of charge % between %80 and %30 is the trick to getting super long life out of the battery.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get the hairs within any contours and even the hair on flat surfaces where the skin can be stretched the shaver requires many passes.</li>
            <li>Gives my guy a clean soft shave with out the red burn marks that he got from his old shaver</li>
            <li>I looked at, and a little time searching around the web confirmed my suspicion that I would be FAR from the first woman to use a man&#x27;s razor to shave her legs.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got very sensitive skin, and wanted to get away from using normal bladed razors because of what it was doing to my skin.</li>
            <li>The clean up was simple, love the wet dry feature for cleaning</li>
            <li>it is really easy and just requires a little liquid soap squirt onto the top of the shaver, a little water and then the push of a button.  </li>
            <li>I always shave fresh out of the shower, and clean the heck out of the razor, not sure why I&#x27;m so irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The neck area around the adam&#x27;s apple required a few passes, but all around was pretty close and clean.  </li>
            <li>Not as close of a shave as a blade, but certainly better than older electric razors that I used in the past.  </li>
            <li>It was better than the Remington, but similar problem in that it took a long time to shave and did not shave as close as my old Braun 2000.    </li>
            <li>This Panasonic is so smooth and quite compared to the other shaver.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it is cheap than other shop.</li>
            <li>I have found that using the soap on lightly wetted skin is enough lubrication to let the razor move smoothly, and does not clog the razor or foam excessively.</li>
            <li>However, you could buy other advanced model with cleaning system with 80 bucks.</li>
            <li>Since I have owned Braun razors for many years, I was a little surprised they doubled the price after being sold to P&amp;G.  </li>
            <li>Shaving your head with it really wears out the blades and foil a lot more than average because your actually pressing against skeletal bone rather than just a cheek or neck.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning the razor is simple and effective (a little liquid soap and running water), making it even easier to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine, but not right for me.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it if you currently have a rotary blade shaver or its just your first shaver.</li>
            <li>But - five or ten minutes of charging will be enough to let you finish - and a complete charge is pretty quick, too.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s because I was new to electric shaver and didn&#x27;t get used to the handling.  </li>
            <li>Before committing to a new shaver, look at the price of the replacement foil.</li>
            <li>I figured I&#x27;d try something new.</li>
            <li>I figured it was time to get a new one and see what new technology has to offer.  </li>
            <li>, it works like new.  </li>
            <li>Will make it shave like new again.</li>
            <li>Rather than buy another set of replacement blades and a screen for over $30, I decided to buy a new shaver altogether for about $65.</li>
            <li>The new shaver&#x27;s PROS are that it is lighter and quieter.        </li>
            <li>This system still works as new.</li>
            <li>It was bought to replace a 4Blade ES-RF31which needed new blades and screen.</li>
            <li>It still shaves as well as when it was new.  </li>
            <li>I have a Braun 6520 that needed new batteries so as an interim shaver I purchased the Panasonic ES8103S from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Just received my new shaver.  </li>
            <li>so I decided to get something new.</li>
            <li>Two thumbs up and 5 stars from this new convert.</li>
            <li>Each new razor was a Norelco, some spendy and some not.  </li>
            <li>so I thought it was time for a new razor.  </li>
            <li>It holds a charge like new, shaves like new and I&#x27;ll update you guys in another couple of years.</li>
            <li>like the closeness of a razor, but at $14-15.00 for 4 razors, I&#x27;ll live with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After my Norelco quit I began researching for a new shaver.</li>
            <li>Somebody new what they were doing when they designed this shaver.</li>
            <li>Knowing that I needed a new set of blades, which BTW are pricey</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe the difference this new razor makes.  </li>
            <li>Oh well, live and learn.    </li>
            <li>It was time to buy a new one again</li>
            <li>I have requested a refund for this item and will buy a new Braun shaver.</li>
            <li>I just bought this shaver 4 weeks ago based on lots of reviews on this site and some new technology.</li>
            <li>After about three weeks I received a brand new ES8103S in the mail.</li>
            <li>I went on-line to find a new one and saw the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>My new ES8103S is made in China.</li>
            <li>so I figured it was time to buy a new shaver.  </li>
            <li>The new Norelco specializes in yank-and-pull shaving, and takes 4-5 passes to catch all the bits.</li>
            <li>My new Panasonic Arc 3 razor changed all that.</li>
            <li>They seem to find a way to please me with each new iteration.</li>
            <li>Even with new blade razors I still have to go over and over my face to get the beard.  </li>
            <li>The instructions say to shave with it for about a month so that your beard&#x27;s growth patterns can adjust to a new shaver.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone who needs a new electric shaver.</li>
            <li>My husband was looking for new shaver, we was gonna buy from Costco.  </li>
            <li>And in fact, this new unit gives me razer burns and bumps on my neck where the ES8043SC didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably get a new screen</li>
            <li>so I can replace it in a year as recommended and then eventually get a new blade set to replace after 2 years of service.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to try this new technology</li>
            <li>It is brand new</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;I don&#x27;t have my shaved.&amp;#34; I suggested he use my new one.</li>
            <li>I replaced the rechargeable batteries and put a new shaver foil on it</li>
            <li>and it was like new again.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten a new set of blades (this season I got the blades and foil).&lt;br</li>
            <li>When it was new</li>
            <li>I would like a new shaver or a refund.</li>
            <li>so I tried to allow sufficient time for my face to get accustomed to the new foil razor.</li>
            <li>I have been using the shaver for about 3 months &amp; the blade still works like new.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t about to shell out $200 to try one of the new electrics, but the $60 price on this one seemed reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received my new razor 3 day ago.</li>
            <li>Like any new electric shaver, it did take a while for me to adjust to it</li>
            <li>I am still in the market for a new shaver.</li>
            <li>I bought this almost 2 1/2 years ago &amp;  just ordered new blades &amp; foil.</li>
            <li>They contacted me immediately and sent me a new one - an upgrade, even.  </li>
            <li>As with any new product there is an adjustment period.</li>
            <li>I needed a new shaver and noticed this was the &amp;#34;Deal of the Day&amp;#34; so I decided to purchase it.</li>
            <li>For Christmas now we send rebuild kits (new foil and cutters), one to each of them and one to me, part of our end of year</li>
            <li>I had to try a new brand.</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t until I started using my new ES-8103S</li>
            <li>after years with another brand i needed to get a new one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m searching for a new shaver now</li>
            <li>When it was new 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>This new Panasonic puts it to shame.</li>
            <li>Now I am on here once again looking for new clippers.</li>
            <li>I did not hesitate to order a new one.</li>
            <li>My Norelco took a dive so I was looking for a new one.</li>
            <li>no problems with the new one.</li>
            <li>It takes me longer to shave now than it did when new.</li>
            <li>It´s been 5 months and it works just as new.</li>
            <li>my wife got me a new razor.</li>
            <li>it helps with this new shaver.</li>
            <li>I gave it a couple of months thinking maybe it was just taking my face longer to adjust to the new razor, but it never improved.</li>
            <li>Not knowing a lot about men&#x27;s shavers, I knew my husband wanted a new one</li>
            <li>So I am returning it and buying new blade&#x27;s for my Norelco.</li>
            <li>He has been saying he wanted a new shaver and when Amazon had this on the deal of the day I bought it for him.</li>
            <li>I have always been a Norelo guy but the new models don&#x27;t have the pop up trimmer anymore.  </li>
            <li>but i dont live there.</li>
            <li>The wet/dry experience is new for my father(83y/o).</li>
            <li>I wish I had just paid for new blades for the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I live on the road so that&#x27;s why I carry an electric razor.</li>
            <li>Probably time to start looking for new blades and screen.  </li>
            <li>I live in Viet nam and had my friend buy this for me.</li>
            <li>He through it in a drawer and bought one for 10 dollars and when it wears out, he throws it out and gets a new one.</li>
            <li>So, I thought I&#x27;d check on the price of a new one:</li>
            <li>Foil was new to me and I was a bit cautious.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never owned or used an electric shaver before, so this was new to me.</li>
            <li>So I bought this new Panasonic Model ES8103S</li>
            <li>and it works as it was new.</li>
            <li>I will  be needing new blades soon.</li>
            <li>and I bought it at a garage sale for $1.00, bought new blades for it</li>
            <li>I decided that I needed a new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using a Braun for years, and yes I have put new rotary blades in it, but nothing shaves me as close as this Panasonic Electric Shaver.</li>
            <li>It gave me a closer shave than a brand new Fusion cartridge.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m shopping around for a new one for him.</li>
            <li>ordered a new one as a gift for my Dad.  </li>
            <li>, i change to new</li>
            <li>so I have to buy a new set of blades.</li>
            <li>its new I replaced&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on new shaving heads</li>
            <li>The Panasonic blades are cheaper and it cuts like a brand new 5hp lawn mower after using a push mower to do your yard.</li>
            <li>the shaving in the hard to shave areas like the point of the chin and along the jawbone is very easily done.</li>
            <li>Lets keep this short and simpe:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Wet/Dry, motor, floating or locking head, the foil appears more rugged than other foil shavers, decent for the price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>very sensitive skin and Braun is too sharp for me.&lt;br /&gt;Wet &amp; dry is nice</li>
            <li>After a year of use and the blades a still quite sharp and the battery is holding up nicely, I get 4 or 5 shaves on a single charge.  </li>
            <li>The bottom line is I was able to purchase the new model for far less than a repair plus new blades for the old model would have cost.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t take very long for me to give a quick once over</li>
            <li>The cost of the new Panasonic shaver was just a few dollars more than the replacement head for my old Philips so that is why I bought it</li>
            <li>Too bad the manufacturer isn&#x27;t more honest about the product.  </li>
            <li>I have used it in the shower with a light shave cream, at the sink with a light cream, dry with Williams&#x27; Lectric Shave and dry with nothing when time is short.  </li>
            <li>The shave is not as clean as others and is rough to use.</li>
            <li>I like the littel icon reminding to clean it, the wet feature</li>
            <li>I will ever get it wet, even to clean it.</li>
            <li>I will ever get it wet, even to clean it.</li>
            <li>Just be careful with the piece that comes off when you want to clean it.</li>
            <li>Lasts for about a week of shaving on one charge.&lt;br /&gt;- Very quick to charge - less than an hour.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>While this razor has capabilities that I do not use, such a being able to shave a wet face,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really like having the display that shows how much batter power is left...</li>
            <li>Panasonic wet shavers have been better, but with this current model ES 8103</li>
            <li>However, I had to go over the same spot numerous times in order for it to be smooth</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although this shaver will wet cut, I have not tried this feature, though it  sounds interesting enough to try soon, so I cannot comment in this</li>
            <li>The unit charges up fast and is considerably lighter and quieter than my 3 year old Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li>but after a couple of tries with my regular razor I figured that I would give electric a try for the top of my head.     </li>
            <li>I have a light beard and still it requires multiple passes over the same spot.</li>
            <li>I find modern life pretty empty and pointless without the possibility of a good shave looming in the future like a raccoon under your bed, so I thought I would try an electric Panasonic.</li>
            <li>I have shaved dry or with afta pre-electric lotion, and like how quick I can get done shaving, without using shave cream and water.</li>
            <li>Amazon delivered it earlier than expected and packaged appropriately.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mixed experience with Panasonic razors - the first one I had was great, the second was pretty mediocre.</li>
            <li>Works great for wet shaving and thick beards.</li>
            <li>I would have really appreciated ability to use standard batteries if Panasonic really didnt have intention to milk customers for supplies and spares.</li>
            <li>It cut my facial hair very close but never did very well on my neck.  </li>
            <li>thinner 3 foil (2 blade) unit is better for curved facial surfaces than its 4 foil wide cousins.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves the shaver and can&#x27;t say enough about how much he appreciates it.</li>
            <li>This shaver has done exactly i hoped, given me that close shave without the burns and irritation i normally got when i used a standard razor.</li>
            <li>They engineered this to fit along the back of the shaver and is tiny.  </li>
            <li>I have to go over the same spot several times to get a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I have to go over and over again to get a decent shave, I never had to do that with my old Remington</li>
            <li>It shaves very close and doesn&#x27;t tear up my face (sensitive skin) like my old Braun and Norelco shavers did.</li>
            <li>I really like the digital readout showing the battery life, and as I stated it gives a really close shave.  </li>
            <li>pop-up trimmer is very useful for neck &amp; other body hair.</li>
            <li>Always liked the cheaper single head Panasonic shavers and thought I would try the more expensive version.  </li>
            <li>The battery charges really fast (full charge in an hour) and it doesn&#x27;t lose power as the charge goes down.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic shaver charged quickly, cuts smoothly and quietly and the price was 20% less than Target!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of electric shavers, other than that they are a bit more convenient than normal ones.</li>
            <li>After my face got used to the new shaver, I found that I am consistently getting a much better dry shave than with my previous rotary blade shaver.</li>
            <li>Braun used to be a fine shaver company with quality support - I think they&#x27;ve fallen down a bit (IMHO).</li>
            <li>The razor is loud, with a high pitched squeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and often cut myself with the blade razor.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li>My husband has very sensitive skin and refused to shave closely before receiving this razor.</li>
            <li>This Electric shaver was bought for my son who has very sensitive skin &amp; cannot shave with a blade</li>
            <li>The razor I was replacing (another brand) was very old</li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin and the Doc recommended I switch to electric.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was very surprised.</li>
            <li>it gives me a bit of razor burn/rash, but i have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>shave is very nearly as close as a Gillette Fusion or Mach 3, no noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>high speed is a must have, do not waste your time with lower speed</li>
            <li>It makes a very loud noise.</li>
            <li>This model met the requirements at a very reasonable price, about the same cost as 36 pivoting razorblades,</li>
            <li>His skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li>Very surprised at the quality.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband of whom has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I got this for my husband who has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Purchase this as a replacement for a very old Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very loud, like turning on a lawnmower.</li>
            <li>It is very soft on the skin and follows every contour.</li>
            <li>and I have very sensitive ears.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Shaving was something I dreaded to the point where I got fired from a job because I wouldn&#x27;t shave everyday (as if guys who work in lumber yards need to be clean shaven!)</li>
            <li>This is his second one -- the first lasted for almost two years before it needed new coils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will come right out and say no...this is nowhere near as close a shave as an actual razor.</li>
            <li>This is exactly just right for the average face.</li>
            <li>Flip up trimmer is a little flimsy feeling but does a good job tackling the longer hairs and doesn&#x27;t get jammed up like my old one.  </li>
            <li>After about a month the cutting performance has declined a little, presumably as the fresh edges lose their perfect sharpness.</li>
            <li>Cleanup is simple and easy and the charge on the device lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Minor annoyance is the sound it produces; a high pitched whine similar to a lawn trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Now, that&#x27;s an exaggeration, but the somewhat high-pitched noise at a decently high volume is something to be aware of, as some people are sensitive to such things.  </li>
            <li>It was a real pain using one of those little brushes to try to get the shaver half-way clean.    </li>
            <li>Based on the fact that this model is sort of an entry-level model for the Panasonic line, I can only imagine how well the higher end models perform.</li>
            <li>As the days passed, they got better and my beard wasn&#x27;t growing back sharp, like it did with the gillette.</li>
            <li>the replacement foil/blade cost is not excessive.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is cordless since our apartment bathroom is so small.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed with this shaver, is how quiet the Panasonic is versus the Remington.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted several years before breaking.</li>
            <li>I fully charged on January 11th and today February first, I shaved and still have 10% left as per the LCD.</li>
            <li>From the first shave, I was instantly WOWed.  </li>
            <li>This is the first electric shaver I have ever owned that actually works as it claims.  </li>
            <li>(a squirt of soft soap and water, rinse, run it on \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; mode, DONE!)  </li>
            <li>I tried a Norelco rotary-style shaver first, which left a lot of stubble and pulled the whiskers.</li>
            <li>I always had Braun shavers and this will was my first and will be my last Panasonic.</li>
            <li>realized this shaver was different when I first turned it ON.</li>
            <li>The higher vibration rate of the Panasonic did not seem to make any difference relative to the Braun 6520 vibration rate.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>It was a gift and it seems to be working well so far!</li>
            <li>My first Remington was a gift from my grandfather when I had peach-fuzz, but lasted about 20 years all total.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as a replacement for the exact same model that was stolen out of my luggage, so I have used it for about 2 years now.  </li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW!  </li>
            <li>Overall, this is exactly the type of shaving experience I was looking for.</li>
            <li>And that is no small feat.      </li>
            <li>When you think of shavers, Panasonic isn&#x27;t the first name that pops into mind, but before you make your next shaver buy, I would recommend that you give them a close look.</li>
            <li>Before then, I used my Braun and Remington (both of which had the MSRP of well over $100) for most of the past decade.  </li>
            <li>I gave it to him early and he loves it!</li>
            <li>although i&#x27;ve tried a higher end phillips and have had the same results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other pros I&#x27;ve noticed: The shaver is pretty quiet and not quite as jarring/heavily vibrating as some of the others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I definitely would recommend this product to anyone who is interested.</li>
            <li>I had to send my first one back as defective since the display went out after 2 charges.  </li>
            <li>BUT only if you&#x27;re willing to shave all your skin off with the hair    </li>
            <li>It may not equal the shave of a blade razor for closeness - but the Panasonic ERS8103s comes pretty close.</li>
            <li>but it replaced a 8 year old Braun 5601 and man o man, what a performance difference!</li>
            <li>This is a first shaver for my teenage son.</li>
            <li>My first shaver began to show problems with the screen after about six or seven months of daily use.</li>
            <li>Generally pleased with the shaver, especially in comparison with other electric shavers I have had over the years.</li>
            <li>He had been using his fathers, I think more for sentimental reasons then for practicality.  </li>
            <li>I wash it regularly with hot soapy water and then use a spray lube after it dries off.</li>
            <li>Wow, what a difference!  </li>
            <li>No small bristle brushes to rid the device of remnants...</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I use it when my face is required to feel baby soft and it does after using this shaver!</li>
            <li>Overall, it gives me a very close shave!</li>
            <li>so the shaver screens being to small, and non- cord use,  the shaver is ok.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this razor to anyone who is either buying one for the first time or for anyone who is dissatisfied with their current razor.</li>
            <li>I have been shaving daily for 3.5 years and the battery still holds a charge like the first day I got it.</li>
            <li>: I did not figure out how to use the trimmer properly for the first 2 years of use.</li>
            <li>I found this Panasonic that advertised the same features as the higher end Brauns.</li>
            <li>This is my second ES8103S which I purchased because I like my first one</li>
            <li>I like the style, but it only does an OK job of shaving, and I have to continually go over some areas several times till they finally get fully shaved.</li>
            <li>I have pretty coarse beard and the ES8103S is doing the job even if I skip a day</li>
            <li>The head snaps on and off, and from there it&#x27;s simply rinse with hot water.</li>
            <li>but if you aren&#x27;t in any hurry and are willing to go over the same spot 100 times it works.</li>
            <li>Overall, if this were my first razor without a frame of reference</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used an electric razor after 45 years of various blade systems.</li>
            <li>When I wanted to replace that last one, I was hesitant to get another Panasonic but the reviews seemed better than the other options (except perhaps those the $200+ range)</li>
            <li>This one was for my teenage son, it&#x27;s his first one</li>
            <li>if you have a coarse beard like me, this thing is pretty useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A simple hot water rinse while the razor is running will keep the razor performing well.</li>
            <li>I did not follow that advice on my first one and actually cut myself with it.</li>
            <li>several shaves.&lt;br /&gt;It picks up almost every hair at the &#x27;first strike&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>just Ordered a Remington Shaver, I&#x27;m hoping that I can get more than a year of use this time :-/</li>
            <li>The first two the batteries self destructed after 1 year, and the next, six months.  </li>
            <li>If you can get this razor for anywhere close to the price I paid, I am not sure why you would spend more on anything else.</li>
            <li>This machine doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to cut small hairs that get stuck to the skin, and I have to use the razor to remove them.</li>
            <li>The charger is a small wall-dongle, not built-in, so you have more to carry when traveling than with the Remington.</li>
            <li>so I can probably get away with this pretty basic model.</li>
            <li>I had sent a wish list of several that I was interested in</li>
            <li>The cleaning process is pretty simple and taking it apart for cleaning is a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll probably never go back to a straight razor again!</li>
            <li>This is my second electric shaver, the first I had left my skin irritated during the first week of use.</li>
            <li>, I forgot profits first and the living planet and future generations</li>
            <li>I was hesitant about purchasing at first but pulled the trigger and do not regret it, especially when Amazon had a $15 coupon.</li>
            <li>I was able to use it plugged in (which I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s suppose to do?), but worked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used electric shavers for decades and this is the first that didn&#x27;t have the option to run off of household current.  </li>
            <li>This is my first Panasonic electric shaver, since I was using Philip-Norelco shaver for the last 25 years.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>I have used both brands and they are pretty much equal.</li>
            <li>pretty soon it gets red and irritated.  </li>
            <li>And this is more of a backup/last minute device as I usually use a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>but this was my first and will be my last.</li>
            <li>This is my 2nd electric shaver I&#x27;ve purchased in my life and my first was about 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li>I wore the first one out and bought the second one</li>
            <li>I bought a second one in case the first ever wears out or breaks.</li>
            <li>its my second shaver, the first one was a remington</li>
            <li>Quiet and charges FAST!</li>
            <li>Despite this, and having used it daily for three years, it does as well now as it did the day I first used</li>
            <li>My reason for giving only four stars instead of five is because I have not experience using it during the summer when humidity levels are higher than now in February.  </li>
            <li>No complaints so far!</li>
            <li>The original blades almost sharp as the replacement blades.</li>
            <li>If i have to do it again, i will get exactly the same one.  </li>
            <li>I have used a Braun electric razors for the past 12 years, and have been quite pleased with how they worked.  </li>
            <li>This is usually an issue with most electric shavers, but this one take A LOT of passes.</li>
            <li>It works well with a pre-shave oil, Proraso, and my badger brush, though I would recommend making the lather a tad bit more watery than usual to allow the razor to glide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first lasted four years with no problems but suddenly died.  </li>
            <li>It shaves pretty close but obviously not as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li>Pretty plan and simple.</li>
            <li>I wash mine under hot water using the regular motor speed then into turbo speed to finish up.</li>
            <li>Works well as a wet shaver; I use it once a day so at a full charge of 100% I can get</li>
            <li>When my old Panasonic needed new blades and foil, I decided to shop for a new shaver.</li>
            <li>The new ES8103S measured at 52 dB, my almost new ES8077 measured at 54 dB, and my old, retired ES8077 measured at 75 dB.  </li>
            <li>I have used Braun shavers ever since my first shave and they always did an adequate job, though not stellar enough that I when it came time for a replacement I couldn&#x27;t be swayed by the high reviews Panasonic shavers were getting all over the web.    </li>
            <li>Pat a little water with a trace of soap on, and it does the job in an easy minute.</li>
            <li>But if you are African American, don&#x27;t expect a clean shave.</li>
            <li>Of course they don&#x27;t build them like they use to, but then again it&#x27;s also MUCH cheaper than the older panasonic ES model i had before the battery finally gave out.</li>
            <li>20 seconds later you rinse it clean with another 20 second cycle.  </li>
            <li>It gets close enough that he can shower at night and still look clean shaven by the next afternoon.</li>
            <li>In comparison with rotary electric shavers, I have found the battery to last much longer; recently, it seems that I am not getting as many shaves per charge, but in my previous experiences with rotary electric shavers, I have had battery problems much sooner.</li>
            <li>This shaver works decent, it comes with a clipper that works very well, but the actual shaving part tends to miss a lot of hair.</li>
            <li>Yeah, I might have to shave with this Panny every 2-3 days now because it doesn&#x27;t cut as close as a traditional razor, but it only takes me a couple minutes to shave my face clean with this thing.</li>
            <li>You have to go over the same area several times in order to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li>I simply submerge the head of this into that fluid and use the clean mode.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is no way a Braun can compete with this shaver, also the cleaning is incredibly simple and the shaver is always clean for the next shave.</li>
            <li>so I am please that this one is now a year and a half old and still going strong.</li>
            <li>Taking longer than other razors to get a clean shave--for an electric.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll</li>
            <li>Again, these cons are super minor, and really don&#x27;t impact my overall feelings about the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only get about half the shaves from a full charge as Panasonic claims I should, but that is worth it for the close shave.</li>
            <li>This product is one of a very few items that actualy do what it says it will in many years.</li>
            <li>I guess i have been lucky, every shaver i buy is a little better than the previous one.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic ES8103S provides a nice dry shave, but it leaves a mess below where you shave.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;d like a little more bell/whistle factor, get ES8243A, essentially the same thing gussied up, but costs roughly twice and according to one review the renewal parts (screens and cutters) cost much more than the</li>
            <li>So far, I am pleased with the performance of this shaver and, based upon my experience with other Panasonic models, I am not concerned at all about the light-weight construction.ll related spare parts.</li>
            <li>I own several electric shavers, one old-type SHARP, one Braun (bought last month) and this Panasonic.</li>
            <li>This razor started out strong, but the high quality shave started to deteriorate after 2-3 months, even though I was following the suggested cleaning protocol (and even though the foil and blades were supposed to last two and one years, respectively).  </li>
            <li>I guess when these things get old they get pretty mechanical loose and subsequently very noisy.  </li>
            <li>So instead of paying another $40 or so for a new battery and blades for the old Norelco, I tried this panasonic es 8103s.</li>
            <li>For this reason, I have deleted my old review and replacing it with this new review.</li>
            <li>The new blades would have cost me nearly $40.00 to replace, so I figured what the heck?</li>
            <li>I have been apprehensive about getting a new shaver because I need one for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>In fact, one of the reasons I decided to get a new model was because the battery on the old one was beginning to diminish in strength and duration of usefulness.  </li>
            <li>I needed a new electric razor to replace an old one that had stopped working.  </li>
            <li>My 16 yr old is new to the electric razor.  </li>
            <li>If your razor is old, if you&#x27;re considering a new one and thinking (I&#x27;ll just replace the cutters and screen\\&quot; - don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The shaver no longer shaves as it did when new, and the foil/blade assembly buzzes so loudly now that it is almost</li>
            <li>a new ES8077.&lt;br /&gt;I have to comment about some reviewers saying this shaver is so loud that it hurts their hearing.  </li>
            <li>Replacement blades for the new razer are cheaper than my old razer.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>You would think this brand new shaver would beat out a 5 year old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The issues....</li>
            <li>so I bought this particular product due to much research and positive reviews.</li>
            <li>The shaver last about 10 days on single charge &amp; does not loose power at the end like most shavers.  </li>
            <li>It looks like replacement batteries are available for less than $20</li>
            <li>My husband has used the three blade rotary style razor for 20 years and was not getting the smooth results with the typical brands, and it took a lot of time to shave.  </li>
            <li>replaced my previous panasonic shaver, that was over 10 years old and still working fine.</li>
            <li>I can easily get a usable charge, from totally dead, in the amount of time it takes me to shower.</li>
            <li>I do have to feel to find a few spots that are easy to miss.</li>
            <li>The charge lasts for about a weeks worth of shaves ( once a day) and charges quickly ( an hour or 2 tops)&lt;br /&gt;Ive used it in the hower with no issues, though I prefer the dry shave as opposed to wet with this razor..</li>
            <li>The first one I purchased (probably five years ago) lasted for nearly two years and only broke because I dropped it.</li>
            <li>Just a couple of notes: some reviewers mentioned the noise, and that was my concern at first, but it&#x27;s only as loud as a Norelco.</li>
            <li>am 70 yrs old now and lazy, so I can do a respectful job while watching TV.</li>
            <li>At first, the display started to fade and go in and out, and then the razor completely stopped working and the only thing I can think happened is that it got water inside</li>
            <li>normal routine is to shave with the electric and pass back with cream and a straight razor.</li>
            <li>this is my third Panasonic shaver, the first one is over 12 years old and still works.</li>
            <li>ran it over my face and several passes later, my face was still full of hair.</li>
            <li>I bought exactly the same model to replace my two year old razor.</li>
            <li>but I actually received a closer shave with this than my normal straight blade, and I wasn&#x27;t even using the wet-shave option.</li>
            <li>would strongly advise not to purchase it, as it will be waste of your money.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, these are WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!!  </li>
            <li>like I&#x27;m trying to massage it and no pulling, no pain, no raw feeling.</li>
            <li>In terms of shaving comfort and closeness, this model is very much the same as the Braun with the exception that it does create more neck irritation (at least for me) and the trimmer that comes with</li>
            <li>My now 5 year old Braun 9565 was beginning to fall apart and was always very loud.</li>
            <li>There is a tiny plastic gear nub (for lack of a better description) that vibrates the trimmer blade, and the nub either wore down or broke.  </li>
            <li>Limited success there.  </li>
            <li>Because of this price difference and rave reviews, I expected something special -- or at least something better than a $30 electric razor.    </li>
            <li>Even so, I still use Lectric Shave since I like its very light conditioning of the skin as opposed to something like Edge which would make it hard to see what I was doing.</li>
            <li>One positive, it is very quiet.</li>
            <li>In the product description the last line says, \\&quot;When you&#x27;re done shaving, simply rinse clean under water, click the shaver into the HydraCleanTM dock, and your razor will be ready the next morning.\\</li>
            <li>Once you get used to the feel of it, it only takes a light hand with only a few passes to manage a clean shave.</li>
            <li>Very close shave, easy to use either wet or dry!  </li>
            <li>the razor does not shave my beard on the first pass, the second pass, third pass, I really have to dig the razor into my face to get the hair off, I have tried shaving cream, shaving gel, shaving oil and nothing helps.</li>
            <li>The digital readout is also helpful in knowing exactly how much power is left in the battery.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty fast as compared to using the Braun, and is quiet enough as well.  </li>
            <li>I have had several models for women, mostly from Panasonic, but they aren&#x27;t as well made and just do not last as long in my experience as the men&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>This has been true with other electric shavers I have used.</li>
            <li>One criticism of this shaver is that it&#x27;s noisy and hums along at the same frequency as one of those big municipal wood chippers at full rev -- not as loud, of course, but I do have to turn it off to have a conversation.</li>
            <li>But everything seems to be pretty much disposable anymore, even the more expensive models.</li>
            <li>With my other electric razor, my skin was not this smooth right after the shave, let along ten hours later.</li>
            <li>The new one works very well and battery charge lasts ten plus days.</li>
            <li>My last one was noisy, didn&#x27;t shave very well and when the screen started to go, I went looking on Amazon for a new shaver.</li>
            <li>The new razor is so much lighter in weight and gives such a trouble-free shave that I can&#x27;t wait to use it again.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I don&#x27;t like the popup trimmer angle, and that it emits a tiny high pitched whine when charging that you can hear if your hearing is good.</li>
            <li>but I think the wet dry shave option is so much better</li>
            <li>Currently, I am using a flexible (yet stronger / more durable) travel case from a previous razor to hold this razor, and this razor&#x27;s travel case to hold the power cord.  </li>
            <li>I am 63 and my skin is a lot more tender and subject to cuts than when I was younger.  </li>
            <li>Against my better judgment I purchased several, each time going up in price after the previous one stopped working.</li>
            <li>He had that previously and it was such a hassle and more money for cleaners.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Press and briefly hold the on/off button until the razor enters the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; mode (a digital indicator will show, plus the blade sound is clearly different), wet the foil (bladecover) under running water, apply liquid hand soap to the foil and allow the razor to clean itself.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with the razor both in wet shave and dry shave.  </li>
            <li>I have tried both wet and dry and I am completely satisfied with both.</li>
            <li>It worked well enough, better than my previous shavers.</li>
            <li>but this razor doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate my face like most razors (wet and dry) do.  </li>
            <li>Finally, though the manual says you&#x27;ll get \\&quot;about 14 shaves\\&quot; to a full charge, I was already down to 60% after the first 3 shaves.  </li>
            <li>The shaver is quiet, charges quickly and has a readout which shows the amount of charge left and when the razor needs cleaning.</li>
            <li>Charges quickly, and holds enough to last all week.</li>
            <li>He says it&#x27;s easy and painless to use and goes right through his tough beard.</li>
            <li>Using this on my legs I can get the skin smooth to the touch, but the stubble will be back the next day as opposed to using a razor which usually leaves my legs feeling smooth for closer to two days.  </li>
            <li>Shaves take more than teice as long as aren&#x27;t very close even with extra time spent going over the arrea.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Battery seems to last long enough (haven&#x27;t counted yet, but seems to last the week)&lt;br /&gt;-The pivoting head is a nice feature to contour to face/neck&lt;</li>
            <li>He has thick growth and this makes his face very smooth without any pulling or abrasion.</li>
            <li>If you take the time to do it right, you will get a shave virtually as close as a blade in the dry mode.</li>
            <li>It works really well for my light whisker type both wet and dry.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: My last \\&quot;FOIL\\&quot; type shaver seemed less loud and was able to charge and shave</li>
            <li>No one has made a better wet and dry so far.</li>
            <li>wet or dry better than my old Braun</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ok, so it says wet-or-dry shave (which I liked, and ordered for that reason), but you definitely get a better/closer shave dry than using it wet or with shave</li>
            <li>But this model is far better wet and dry.</li>
            <li>Razor generally works well, I particularly like the wet/dry option.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as other shavers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>It still keeps its charge surprising well, unlike a lot of other electric razors I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>And my braun, which is in desperate need of a new primary blade, still does a far better job than this razor.</li>
            <li>It is not only a very reasonable price, but I can comfortably get an extremely close shave which can only be exceeded by a razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can only hope that this shaver will last me through a decade of shaves like my old Remington, because I&#x27;d love to keep it for a very long time.</li>
            <li>The blade is very dull and it does not shave smoothly on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the money.</li>
            <li>very smooth shaving, has two net blades and trim, light weight, rubberized handle grip, battery charge indicator 0 - 100, also little sign appears on the screen when it needs to clean, the shaver head moves up and down slightly and left and right to avoid extra force on the skin.</li>
            <li>A little light in weight</li>
            <li>Smooth shaves with little heating and face soreness.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really need a new one but saw this one and bought it on impulse since I figured the old one would just give out some day and leave me high and dry.</li>
            <li>My biggest complaint about any and all Panasonic razors is they work fine for about a year, then they quit working or start really having lots of problems.  </li>
            <li>The battery lasts a long time and it is simple to clean.</li>
            <li>Mine is a few years old and still working fine.</li>
            <li>tried it once as a wet razor with shaving cream, it did a fine job and the instructions for cleaning were simple and worked well.  </li>
            <li>Still working, also never as good as my previous Panasonic Wet/Dry one, feels a bit clunky and the LED that shows the loading status has given up on me, only two sections lighting up making it rather difficult to read, also you can if you hold it against the light and look very closely.</li>
            <li>I thought perhaps I got a defective device, but that is not the case because I gave to my dad to try (who has fine straight oily beard, that grows in one direction and isn&#x27;t as thick as mine.....</li>
            <li>It is smooth and very delicate on my skin (which is also very delicate lol).</li>
            <li>One final point the new shaver feels very light and delicate not like the older model.</li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, the actual shaving head and overall shave is close and actually closer on my face than i can get with a mach 3 , and leaves less irritation than my old norelco but leaves more irritation than my old braun series 1 (which i replaced with this panasonic as it was on sale here on amazon for $55 at the time).</li>
            <li>Gets most of the facial hairs with little effort.  </li>
            <li>It works a little better with daily use but still not good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better than throwing dull blades every week or two.&lt;br /&gt;-Shave</li>
            <li>However, I doesn&#x27;t get the hard to shave whiskers any better</li>
            <li>In some hard to shave areas, I think the triple heads may be better.</li>
            <li>The blades can get dull but it&#x27;s nothing that a replacement won&#x27;t fix. :)</li>
            <li>It was hard to decide which Panasonic Shaver to buy from Amazon because there are so many models to pick from.</li>
            <li>I do have a hard time understanding why anyone would spend more than this...</li>
            <li>Granted my last Norelco was an older model but what can I say-this razor rocks!</li>
            <li>Requires pushing hard and alot more time to shave.  </li>
            <li>My facial hair is fairly soft and not very thick, but it doesn&#x27;t take much to cause the trimmer to hang up.  </li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t sure how this shaver would work with me having a tough beard.</li>
            <li>Remington was too flimsy, the foil broke not long after replacing it - right in the middle of a shave.</li>
            <li>I grow pretty heavy stubble very fast, So I returned to this brand hoping the quality hadn&#x27;t declined since 2006</li>
            <li>If not using it wet, it can get a little warm near the end of the shave.  </li>
            <li>It provides an amazing, close shave, with hardly a need to go over the same area twice.</li>
            <li>The only department where this shaver gets due credit is in that it is easy on the skin.</li>
            <li>this is a great product it gives a close shave with hardly any irritation and no razor bumps (if you use it everyday).</li>
            <li>I decided to try the ES-8103s due to the high ratings and significant price difference from the current Braun 5.</li>
            <li>Since I can&#x27;t wait that long on most work days, I have to finish my shave with a conventional razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>While it may not look as fancy as many other electric razors it is easy to handle and provides a close shave without irritating the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even after a good shave with razor however this thing cuts closer especially for hard to reach areas like upper lip.</li>
            <li>That is not such a big deal to me though since it has a quick 5 min charge for a single shave and takes only an hour to get a full charge.  </li>
            <li>No soap, no cleaning, no lather/re-lather/re-lather to get all of the angels covered, no mess, and no raw skin.    </li>
            <li>huge waste of $65.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately you really do have to shave every day since it doesn&#x27;t get as close to the skin as a manual, bladed razor, but it is still an amazing shave.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and it has done a great job on my thick stubble.</li>
            <li>All in all, it will take less time and clean up is a breeze.</li>
            <li>The results seemed nearly the same no matter how much I paid for each one.  </li>
            <li>It will rattel sometimes, but it is in a whole different league than my old shaver.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts about a week for me, as compared to 1.5 to 2 weeks for the Norelco, but I really don&#x27;t care since this shaver is a class above anything I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic&#x27;s is good for light touch ups but the Braun&#x27;s could really do some heavy cutting.  </li>
            <li>It is clearly well made.  </li>
            <li>it is well worth the price of more expensive shavers that do not work as well.  </li>
            <li>I like how this shaver tells you how much juice it has left (my old shaver just died).</li>
            <li>Not only does it provide me a FAR closer shave, it does it much, MUCH faster than the ES8103 ever could, and</li>
            <li>Do yourself and the wife a favor and stay clear of this.</li>
            <li>I was shocked that for the first time he liked something I bought for him!</li>
            <li>&#x3D;one clear area.</li>
            <li>With a close shave you can clearly see every hair that isn&#x27;t cut.</li>
            <li>Note: if you are switching from using a blade-razor such as Gillette Fusion to using an electric shaver, be aware that the electric generally does not give as close</li>
            <li>So far he loves it especially when he needs to get a fast shave in.</li>
            <li>When my facial hair grows in, it comes in fast and wild.</li>
            <li>Its a bit different than my 25 year old Braun which served me very well - no complaints there.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-Loud, too loud in my opinion, that it actually heats up fast</li>
            <li>Smooth shave especially if you wet your skin and use shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s no big deal, but if guys are REALLY that sensitive, this makes some noise.&lt;br /&gt;Charge</li>
            <li>With my old norelco, I had an issue with it getting switched on by accident in my luggage.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t expect how loud it is.</li>
            <li>So now it dies mid shave while getting ready for work.</li>
            <li>but so far he loves it for&lt;br</li>
            <li>Went to blades and used them for nearly 20yrs.</li>
            <li>The old Remington still shaved closer.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>ES8103S shaves as close as my old Remington, closer than the Braun -</li>
            <li>and I have not had any irritation of my face thus far.  </li>
            <li>He has extremely sensitive skin and just can&#x27;t do a strait</li>
            <li>And I must say that his face is now cuddly soft, even hours after shaving.  </li>
            <li>by far...</li>
            <li>Also, it is loud...</li>
            <li>I also have tried this with shaving cream while in the shower, and was I surprised once</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s really the opposite of \\&quot;convenient\\&quot; for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shaver does not cut any faster than the Remington, and it still takes about 5 minutes for a complete shave.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind how loud it is.</li>
            <li>have not had an instance where the razor died when in use because there&#x27;s a power meter that the power meter informs you how much juice is left.</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s cleaning action.</li>
            <li>But this shaver is the least irritating, the closest shaving, and the most effective I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>so you knew how much \\&quot;life\\&quot; was left before re-charging.  </li>
            <li>but so far it is a thumbs up item in my book.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, he is going to break the (now two year old)</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, you may not have a problem</li>
            <li>If you forget to charge one night and don&#x27;t have much time in the morning to wait for it to charge, this could be a big issue.</li>
            <li>The blades last much longer because of the lubrication the lather provides.  </li>
            <li>My Norelco needed blades again, I&#x27;m not knocking Norelco, the razor still works (probably 4-5 years old)</li>
            <li>I have been a Braun user for nearly 16 years</li>
            <li>So, in short, it really depends on the structure of face and neck region.  </li>
            <li>I had an old Panasonic that I upgraded to a Braun 8595.  </li>
            <li>Close shave nearly all over.</li>
            <li>Had this since before Christmas, no issues so far.</li>
            <li>Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Rechargeable Linear Pivot Action Shaving System, Silver]]    </li>
            <li>It was almost $40 and battery would be still the old one.   </li>
            <li>Plus, I&#x27;m now having to make multiple passes on all planes of my face just to get a reasonably close shave.        </li>
            <li>I also looked at &#x27;value&#x27; lines like Remington, but reviews sounded like what I would have said about my old ones.  </li>
            <li>An LCD display shows how much charge is left.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and they have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The latest Braun I have been using is the 7570, and I have been using it for at least seven years.</li>
            <li>The shaver is loud.   </li>
            <li>seems kinda loud when shaving&lt;br</li>
            <li>My last Braun lasted well over 10 years and felt much heavier/solid than the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>When my old shaver broke I read the user comments here on Amazon</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m unimpressed with the quality of Panasonic products.</li>
            <li>It is very quite compared to the traditional electric</li>
            <li>Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Rechargeable Linear Pivot Action Shaving System, Silver]]</li>
            <li>It takes MUCH longer to get the same shave as with a rotary head.</li>
            <li>Think twice before replacing your old rotary type for this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 78 years old and figured I didn&#x27;t need a razor that lasted 15 years.so</li>
            <li>No so far</li>
            <li>My old shaver would take three or four passes to \\&quot;gitterdone.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So much for the \\&quot;solid</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the razor for nearly 6 years now and the battery is kaput.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic has an A/C adapter that can be plugged directly into the shaver and the shaver can be used with the cord attached.  </li>
            <li>I have been experimenting with different shave conditions and it has done very well.  </li>
            <li>The slide switch on the side of the razor allows you to let the head pivot for flexing around your face, or it locks the head in a fixed position.  </li>
            <li>Replacement blades are a very inexpensive $17 considering they only have to be changed every two years.  </li>
            <li>I really tried to give this shaver a chance, but I found that it did NOT give a close shave with only two days in between shaving.</li>
            <li>I have thrown my old razors away.</li>
            <li>Obviously, probably not a real challenge, but the Panasonic I definitely like better than the Remingtons I&#x27;ve been using.  </li>
            <li>With or with out sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My husband does not have sensitive skin and it did this to him.</li>
            <li>I had philips electro shaver old model.</li>
            <li>this panasonic model don&#x27;t have any advantages compared to my old philips shaver .  </li>
            <li>My old model ES8066 was made in Japan.</li>
            <li>Too early to tell.    </li>
            <li>I bought this razor looking for a replacement for my old Braun.</li>
            <li>He stays over frequently and I told him he could try it out, but</li>
            <li>My buddy will love me for letting me share, not that I won&#x27;t expect at least something in return...</li>
            <li>This baby shaves me completely to where I can&#x27;t feel any hair on my face at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also read that it is loud.</li>
            <li>Bought for my boyfriend for xmas and he can&#x27;t really use it because it cuts his face, especially under the chin.  </li>
            <li>I can get a complete shave in about 3-1/2 to 4 min.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also had a lot of problems with getting cut frequently because of a less-than-great water softener.  </li>
            <li>have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m way too old for breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The motor on this is also rather loud and you&#x27;ll notice it if you&#x27;re trimming near/around your ears.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Audible (I&#x27;m told) in the far reaches of the house.</li>
            <li>In fact it is so gentle that mid day or evening</li>
            <li>This gets so close as to feel baby skin soft with NO shadow at all when I am done.</li>
            <li>With this shaver, I can have a close shave, and no ingrown hairs, so it&#x27;s really the gold standard for me in terms of shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like my old Braun.  </li>
            <li>a traveler).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 69 years old.</li>
            <li>With the linear speed, I am surprised that it takes me a bit longer to shave than the old Panasonic this one replaces.  </li>
            <li>If you live/sleep with a companion, and your bathroom is anywhere near your bedroom, door-closed or no-door-closed</li>
            <li>Also, the shaver is incredibly LOUD.</li>
            <li>Some reviews had mentioned this, but even I did not believe it could be so loud.</li>
            <li>But as a replacement to Braun this has worked well so far...</li>
            <li>quite frankly all the reviews on Amazon written about different models really helped me decide.  </li>
            <li>My old Panasonic died after 5+ years of service</li>
            <li>I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 because after reading the reviews I had expected the shaver to do a better job with short facial hair; but it takes a bit of effort to do so.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin I recommend trying this razor</li>
            <li>So far the word is still out on performance.</li>
            <li>Look no further if you want a \\&quot;straight razor\\&quot; shave with an electric.</li>
            <li>and I take the blades of the shaver and soak them overnight in isopropyl alcohol and so far it has been 4 weeks</li>
            <li>I use the soft switch position.</li>
            <li>Well the Panasonic ES8103S completely changed my mind.    </li>
            <li>Wow, quality stuff</li>
            <li>I am 75 years old and have had about 50 electric rzors in my lifetime.</li>
            <li>Had some problems with my chin breaking out using old electric razor as well as bladed razor.  </li>
            <li>although not too loud - draws away from the shaving experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Based on my use so far, a charge should give me 7-10 shaves per charge.</li>
            <li>None of the women&#x27;s models lasted anywhere near that (if I recall maybe 12-18 months).</li>
            <li>Cons: -Loud</li>
            <li>to the point the noise hurts your ears when you shave any part of your face or neck near your ears        </li>
            <li>I have struggled with sensitive skin with shaving ever since I began shaving.  </li>
            <li>This review is for the Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Rechargeable Linear Pivot Action Shaving System,Silver.  </li>
            <li>Problems are it is very noisy, leaves hair on the outside of the razor, and the travel case is a cloth bag.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m much happier with this.</li>
            <li>battery lasts a long time and the digital percentage guage tells me exactly how much battery I have left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I replaced an old Braun shaver with this one (Braun Series 3 340 Men&#x27;s Shaver) in May of 2011 and paid a premium price for it.</li>
            <li>I chose the Panasonic ES 8103s wet/dry shaver directly from Amazon for $79.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my dad after his old one (9 years old) quit working.  </li>
            <li>The old one had a stand that you dropped the shaver into.</li>
            <li>I replaced my old razor with this gem.</li>
            <li>if you are busy .  </li>
            <li>Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Rechargeable Linear Pivot Action Shaving System, Silver]].</li>
            <li>I used to get burns on some parts of my neck from the Norelco, and I thought it was just my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>But, I have no idea how much battery power is left.</li>
            <li>He is 88 years old and marvels at the close shave he gets from this...</li>
            <li>I have been pleasantly surprised with this razor.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s easily fixed by using the retractable trimmer.</li>
            <li>As for the shave, I have a medium beard and a sensitive neck.  </li>
            <li>I just bought another one for $59.00 instead of replacing the head set for $30.00 for the old shaver.</li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive skin when shaving, using either an electric or manual blade...</li>
            <li>That being said I use this razor 2-3 times a week for nearly 1.5 years....</li>
            <li>This shaves nearly as close as a blade but with none of the irritation.</li>
            <li>If I had known that they had improved them this much I would have switched back years ago.  </li>
            <li>then my old Norelco did.</li>
            <li>Then tells me how much charge is left.</li>
            <li>He uses it frequently.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Panasonic uses stainless steel blades that are just sharper and last longer than Braun&#x27;s nickel blades.  </li>
            <li>I just assume using my old razor in the shower - one pass</li>
            <li>At 49 years old, I read the review of this unit on Consumer Reports and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I have not had this happen once so far with this shaver.</li>
            <li>An electric razor seemed to be faster and easier than my old Fusion blades.</li>
            <li>I am 61 years old.</li>
            <li>Wow....</li>
            <li>After 1st charge the shaver worked very well, but on the second charge the LCD display stopped working</li>
            <li>This is BY FAR the closest shave</li>
            <li>Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Rechargeable Linear Pivot Action Shaving System, Silver    </li>
            <li>I have resorted to using my old shaver to do this area.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had an electric shaver since I was 13 years old.  </li>
            <li>You really have to go back and forth a lot.  </li>
            <li>AND... with no irritation compared to my old shaver.    </li>
            <li>My old ES8047 gave up the ghost after about five years</li>
            <li>And as far as their stating it gets longer hairs, thats</li>
            <li>Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Rechargeable Linear Pivot Action Shaving System, Silver]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I like all the features on it so far.</li>
            <li>And as for &amp;#34;downstairs&amp;#34;, unless you are completely bald and want to keep it that way EVERY DAY, it does not work well either.</li>
            <li>He has since donated the old razor to a men&#x27;s shelter.</li>
            <li>The 5 year old Braun still outperforms it</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who has sensitive skin and/or razor bumps.</li>
            <li>Probably works find on skin that isn&#x27;t sensitive.</li>
            <li>I bought this one to keep in a suitcase for frequent trips.</li>
            <li>I especially like Panasonic prolducts, and this razor has held up very well.</li>
            <li>Like others who have reviewed this, I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>my skin is relatively sensitive (caramel in</li>
            <li>I can sit 20 mins in direct sunlight and get a noticable tan&lt;br</li>
            <li>Despite being using this shaver already a month, as manufacturer suggests, I still need at least 5x more time to shave with this, than with Gilette Mach 3 system.</li>
            <li>, if you are shaving with rasor blade, even don&#x27;t think about electronic shavers, do not waste your money and</li>
            <li>This razor gives closer shave than old shaver did for my husband.</li>
            <li>He has had no trouble with it and it works as well as the day it came out of the package.  </li>
            <li>Also shaves well by using a gentle daily cleanser.</li>
            <li>I replaced an old Panasonic with this one</li>
            <li>This shave 2-3 times faster than my old Braun.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a middle-aged woman, replacing an old ladies&#x27; razor.  </li>
            <li>So far the Panasonic has exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>Complete convert to an electric razor now....</li>
            <li>Panasonic seems to put this as a secondary feature and it rarely shows the same kind of careful design as the rest of the shaver.  </li>
            <li>Really like the digital battery level indicator.</li>
            <li>Battery lasts several shaves and charges fast.</li>
            <li>It replaced a ten + year old remington electric 3 round head razor and it does a better job.</li>
            <li>Because the motor of this shaver IS SO LOUD</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin on my neck and nothing;</li>
            <li>I had an eight year old Braun shaver that refused to die.</li>
            <li>I can shave much faster now and the shave actually does approach that of a blade shaver.  </li>
            <li>I keep another old shaver around for trimming.</li>
            <li>Replaced a 7 year old linear Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve never received a really close shave especially under my chin/neck and mustache area.  </li>
            <li>I think my 9-year old shaver still works</li>
            <li>It holds a charge for 7-10 days, just like my old one.  </li>
            <li>I may purchase a blade set for my old model and use it for travel.</li>
            <li>It takes longer to shave than with my old &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; Panasonic razor.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, but I&#x27;ve had no &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; from this guy.  </li>
            <li>It is two years old now.</li>
            <li>and it comes in a very close second.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this razor doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li>I got it to replace my old Panasonic shaver, which I had bought refurbished, that lasted almost a decade.  </li>
            <li>It gives you a really close shave and has the wet feature that allows for ease of cleaning and clearly shows how much charge is remaining.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Shaves really well and fairly quiet.</li>
            <li>(the old panasonic had it built in).</li>
            <li>(I have sensitive skin and this product didn&#x27;t cause any irritation.  </li>
            <li>I use my old Phillips for this purpose.   </li>
            <li>I bought this 2 months to replace my 2 year old Norelco rotary.</li>
            <li>My old Remington, while still running well, has never had a change of blades in 35 years.</li>
            <li>WOW what a shave.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised to find the shave as close as the blade.  </li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>actual shaving, however, leaves MUCH to be desired.</li>
            <li>I am finally retiring a 10-year-old Panasonic because its battery is not holding much charge.  </li>
            <li>VERY QUIET AND SHAVES FAST.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to shave quite as well as my old panasonic from years ago.</li>
            <li>The hubby loves it so far, no complaints.</li>
            <li>Especially at the price now, it is a REAL steal IMO.</li>
            <li>It died completely a week or so before the shaver croaked.</li>
            <li>It does have trouble with neck hair, though persistence will get the neck smooth.</li>
            <li>But it is by far the loudest razor I have ever used!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used my old one again</li>
            <li>The ES 8103 shaves even faster and closer than my old one.</li>
            <li>and it was ready to go for the next use.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skins and am a fussy customer when it comes to shavers.  </li>
            <li>I next planned to move onto the straight razor but realized I&#x27;d accidentally thrown the whole thing away with the shipping box because it was \\&quot;recycle your boxes\\&quot; week at my local garbage establishment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So if you rely on the trimmer, (like I did from my 4+ year old Braun)</li>
            <li>My old razor died and i bought this during the amazon sale for ~50 bucks.</li>
            <li>Then i have to use a old school razor to shave my jaw line and neck.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used foil razors and needed a replacement for an old Braun series 5 model.</li>
            <li>and it really takes care of my daily grooming</li>
            <li>I have used it for nearly a week and it still has 70% charge.  </li>
            <li>This razor was rated highly in nearly every site that I researched.</li>
            <li>When it was time to replace my old one I went for the an upgrade</li>
            <li>I really like the digital read out showing % of charge remaining.</li>
            <li>As another reviewer has said, if you have sensitive skin this is the shave for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Just unpack it, plug in the detachable charging cord and when the digital display reads \\&quot;100%\\&quot; it is ready for use.  </li>
            <li>that I realized how worn out my old razor had become.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m upgrading from my 3 year old Norelco rotary type shaver.  </li>
            <li>Now there&#x27;s no need to retrieve the tiny brush, and the results are much cleaner.  </li>
            <li>Period.[[ASIN:B001DNE3KQ Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Rechargeable Linear Pivot Action Shaving System, Silver]]</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>I bought this for a 99 year old man.</li>
            <li>This razor is very well made and recharges is only one hour.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s too early to say.</li>
            <li>Once out of the box, I charged it up and got busy on my face.  </li>
            <li>Shaves smoother, lasts longer and tells me how much battery power is left!</li>
            <li>My primary method of shaving was \\&quot;old school\\&quot; double edge wet shaving with vintage razors.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a young guy and have always had an issue with irritated skin and ingrown hairs in the neck area.</li>
            <li>I have tried just about every multiblade razor on the market as well as learning to use old school DE razors (Merkur HD).</li>
            <li>Not knowing when it needs charging has led to a couple of times using the old fashioned method.</li>
            <li>the speed of the shaver is affected, then you are pressing far too much.&lt;br /&gt;Wash</li>
            <li>Gave it as a gift to 20 year old college son.  </li>
            <li>But so far no redness caused by it.</li>
            <li>i wash it under the tap water after use no issues so far.</li>
            <li>For my whole life I just used a traditional razor.</li>
            <li>My old Panasonic ES8018 shaver was about 15 years old and had never needed any repair.</li>
            <li>seem to accidentally hit the off button fairly frequently while shaving.</li>
            <li>no missed hairs like with my old Remington micro</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s works well enough, don&#x27;t really have any complaints.</li>
            <li>, use the case from your old shaver.</li>
            <li>It was just getting old and needed to be replaced.</li>
            <li>It holds a charge very well, and has an indicator with the percent of charge left.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that it doesn&#x27;t get as close a shave as my old rotary shaver, but that&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t pull the hairs up to cut them.  </li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;re at 10% it doesn&#x27;t indicate any lower, but in my experience it will shave at least 5 more times after it reaches 10%.  </li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;re at 10% it doesn&#x27;t indicate any lower, but in my experience it will shave at least 5 more times after it reaches 10%.  </li>
            <li>Loud noise, makes you nervous.  </li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>NEARLY AS CLOSE A SHAVE</li>
            <li>Clean-up is fast and simple using soap and water.</li>
            <li>and you have to work to get it open, and then turn the whole shaver 180 degrees to use it.</li>
            <li>It was incredibly loud.  </li>
            <li>The motor isn&#x27;t too loud, but this is a shaver I can&#x27;t endorse.</li>
            <li>Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Rechargeable Linear Pivot Action Shaving System, Silver]]  </li>
            <li>Replaced my old Braun with the Panasonic razor based on Amazon reviews.  </li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t that noisy compared to my 20 year old Norelco HP1122 that died.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Update Dec 2016: I&#x27;ve been using this razor for nearly 4 years.</li>
            <li>This unit just died today and is now completely unusable.</li>
            <li>Replaces my 10 year old panasonic razor that still works,but I couldn&#x27;t pass up the price....</li>
            <li>My husbands sensitive skin shows no signs of irritation.  </li>
            <li>have been very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Louder then my 30 year old Norelco.</li>
            <li>So far, no complaints; it operates as described and he gets a close shave.</li>
            <li>He raved about the 3 blades and swivel action.</li>
            <li>What a difference over my old shaver.  </li>
            <li>This is the second one of this model that we have had and we bought it again because we like it so much.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic gives a very close,quick (2 minutes if I shave daily)</li>
            <li>so far I&#x27;m getting 10 shaves a charge.</li>
            <li>The old Remington</li>
            <li>really wish they had just left the trimmer alone.</li>
            <li>I got this for my 21 year old son.  </li>
            <li>I replaced a 3 year old philips rotary shaver with this model.  </li>
            <li>Only time will tell but I do not , at this time see any real faults.</li>
            <li>Bought to replace a 15 year old Panasonic that still functions but won&#x27;t hold a charge.  </li>
            <li>But that buzzing is still loud...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m 70 years old.</li>
            <li>its not as loud as my panasonic rotary shaver.</li>
            <li>I like it because his early morning shaves</li>
            <li>: It takes 15-20 passes on my neck to get anywhere near done.</li>
            <li>: If you have areas where you let the hair grow (goatee, mutton chops etc), the razor pulls the longer hairs when you try to shave near them.</li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s loud.</li>
            <li>and I believe it to be of professional quality.</li>
            <li>do like the LED that tells you how much charge is left.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of those guys who shaves with regular razors and gets cuts and really red/sore neck.  </li>
            <li>My old Braun was worn out.</li>
            <li>I used an electric razor early on...but then switched to a safety razor @~30.</li>
            <li>Fast charge that last all week.  </li>
            <li>Also, immediately noticed it was LOUD, who wants LOUD when just waking up in the morning (or anytime), next to my ears.  </li>
            <li>, Panasonic is much heavier and larger).  </li>
            <li>but this one just has the cord that you plug in directly to the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>i was very pleasantly surprised with this product.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 87 year old father for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>I find it works very well in the back of my head</li>
            <li>, no matter how much I maneuver it, it always misses the same 3 or 4 hairs.</li>
            <li>It is very well made, solid and sounds like a quality shaver because it is....  </li>
            <li>Pertaining to the noise level, it&#x27;s a masculine razor.</li>
            <li>No coil-cord and old fashioned looking plug-charger.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic seems to require frequent recharging whereas the Norelco goes on and on.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my 10+ year old Braun 5414 electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>It shaved my sensitive skin without irritation and redness and it got every hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After nearly two years of use, this razor is still kicking it.</li>
            <li>I must add that I&#x27;m 78 years old.</li>
            <li>and I purchased 3 so far.</li>
            <li>At more than twice the price of the now discontinued Remington Titanium MS2 series shavers, I was hoping that this product could compete--at least match the level of closeness and efficiency</li>
            <li>The description lead me to believe that it was marked used because the box may have been damaged.</li>
            <li>It keeps its charge for a far shorter time than my Norelco.</li>
            <li>Old shaver lasted twice as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Nivea sensitive skin shave gel&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I bought this Panasonic shaver to replace an old Remington DA-307 shaver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all the sensitive skin shaving gels and after shave lotions.  </li>
            <li>I know that electric razors are very dependent on each individual&#x27;s beard type.  </li>
            <li>With the Panasonic, I felt it provied a close enough shave that I didn&#x27;t need to use my straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning feature</li>
            <li>None so far.</li>
            <li>Please do stick with if converting from the old fashioned shave.</li>
            <li>But, that&#x27;s a lot of time and money to invest in a 5 year old razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are only two parts, really: the body (including the blade), and the foil.  </li>
            <li>Cheap, but not cheaply made.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>It has not been 30 days but so far, it works well but not as close as a blade razor.  </li>
            <li>use it in the shower with a bit of shaving gel and in few weeks that I have been using it my scin got noticeably smoother and free from razor burns and bumps.</li>
            <li>(loud, but not too loud)</li>
            <li>/&gt;The razor is quite noisy, compared to my old Norelcos, and doesn&#x27;t shave as close.  </li>
            <li>Sort of loud, so I have to leave my tent if I don&#x27;t want to wake anyone else up as I shave.</li>
            <li>One charge lasts a really long time, and it shaves pretty close</li>
            <li>Display allows you to see how much charge you have left.  </li>
            <li>My Remington is quite old and decided to purchase</li>
            <li>This shaver has far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>Maybe my skin is that sensitive</li>
            <li>Andis 17010 Professional Profoil Rechargable Shaver (with Titanium Foils).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shaver is billed as a sensitive skin shaver and close shave.  </li>
            <li>prone 18-year old guy).</li>
            <li>(I attribute these to having sensitive skin and going through the adjustment stage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Loud.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave my upper lip/cheeks as close as I&#x27;d like, but it does shave my neck really close.</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t cut near as well as my Norelco did</li>
            <li>It has a digital display that goes in increments of 10, so you always know how much charge is left.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite loud.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ever tried so far.</li>
            <li>I have always owned Norelco, but my wife bought this Panasonic for Fathers Day (early gift).  </li>
            <li>I asked Santa for this shaver for Christmas and WOW.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it will continue to impress me (I am thinking it will), but so far I think that it is a winner.  </li>
            <li>I have stubborn Italian hair, and have to shave every day since my hair grows so freaky fast.</li>
            <li>Bought Philips for over 50 years, yes I am that old.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I really like this unit and would definitely recommend a Panasonic razor.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver for my husband, after his old electric shaver broke.</li>
            <li>Do not waste you money on this product.</li>
            <li>Soft touch on face and close shave.</li>
            <li>Early days were with Remington.</li>
            <li>The only unusual aspect is shaving the moustache area.</li>
            <li>Grandson 14 yrs old wanted a shaver for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I got this for my 85 year old father in law and he likes it.  </li>
            <li>The LCD screen shows how much charge is left [i.e., 90%, 80, 70, etc.]</li>
            <li>Just after one year [when the warranty expired, naturally] the LCD screen started giving me problems.</li>
            <li>From an old U.S.Marine, oooh rah.</li>
            <li>Husband had to get out old faithful razor to remove spots shaver missed.  </li>
            <li>My wife bought this razor to replace her old Remington R845.</li>
            <li>Oh it is loud, but at 75 who is going to tell him.</li>
            <li>I ordered the replacement Foil and Blade Set just to have on hand, but the foil is not showing any signs of wear so far.  </li>
            <li>It lasts about 10 shaves per charge for me so far.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s quite loud and my cat freaked out when I turned it on.</li>
            <li>do like the fact that shaver tells you how much battery you have left.  </li>
            <li>It does not seem to shave as close as with a razor, but it&#x27;s close enough and is much easier</li>
            <li>For nearly 30 years I&#x27;ve used electric razors -</li>
            <li>This Panasonic is like a Maserati compared to my old shaver (a dump truck).</li>
            <li>Ive used it once so far</li>
            <li>However, if you have sensitive skin I would stray away from the 4 foil.</li>
            <li>I also switch back and forth from straight razors to electrics, depending on time and how close I want to shave.</li>
            <li>I have used it three times so far and have not felt any pulling or irritation while shaving.</li>
            <li>this razor let&#x27;s you know how much of a charge is left</li>
            <li>Improvement over my old rotary.</li>
            <li>I have been shaving with a Panasonic ES8066 for the last zillion years and it has served me very well.  </li>
            <li>My bumps have completely cleared up in the three days</li>
            <li>I would recommend changing your shaving routine if you are still having problems, or have problems with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Let me start by saying that I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It works well in the shower or with a gel, and the shave is smoother than my rotary triple head - so far.</li>
            <li>Nor,apparently can the razor&lt;br /&gt;by run directly from the AC outlet then.</li>
            <li>This one is no different: they like it, well, as much as they like to shave.</li>
            <li>This razor surprised me.</li>
            <li>long hairs pretty well</li>
            <li>Holds charge well, needs only infrequent recharges, and recharges fast.  </li>
            <li>Not too loud as some have</li>
            <li>As instructed, you can wash it directly with tap water.</li>
            <li>This also doesn&#x27;t get anywhere near as close as a razor.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to start shaving the next time.</li>
            <li>just don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth the money if it only last 1 month or 2.</li>
            <li>Not only did it not get anywhere near all my facial hair (which was short, hadn&#x27;t shaved in 2 days prior), but it cut me up more than any razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>&gt; The Panasonic choice was made over the last year from reading reviews, but more so probably because of their heavy presence on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>, the charge lasts me three shaves or roughly a week&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t comment on its loudness, but my friend said this electric razor was much more quiet than the one he uses from a few years ago.</li>
            <li>battery last long also, like 9 full shaves.</li>
            <li>Con - Need wash after each wet shave; feels not as powerful as I imagined  </li>
            <li>Buying  anything more fancy  would be a total waste  of money.  </li>
            <li>I thought the cleaning unit was a good idea until I got it and realized that it was a waste of time and money, especially once I discovered wet shaving in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shaver is ok but slow.</li>
            <li>anymore good buy expensive disposable razors.</li>
            <li>It saved me a ton of money on disposable razor blades and helped me get a good shave without irritating my neck, which traditional disposables roughed up to the point of embarrassment.</li>
            <li>A few things I like and see improvements on, compared to my older model: it charges quickly; the motor is quieter; provides a closer shave; is lighter weight.</li>
            <li>It works good with shaving cream too, but the shave secret lotion seems to &#x27;hold&#x27; the blades to the surface with ease and get it extra close.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to buy an electric shaver, since they tend to be rather expensive, and I did not know how good they could be.  </li>
            <li>I did buy a 2-year protection since this is an expensive product, although I got an extremely good discount during the holidays.</li>
            <li>EXPENSIVE DAMNED THING that did not shave good.</li>
            <li>After using it for about a month I can say that its good but not perfect.</li>
            <li>hope my warranty is still good because it&#x27;s too expensive of a razor to not work after six months.</li>
            <li>This is far superior to expensive Brauns</li>
            <li>It has the features I need: 2 weeks worth of shaving on a single charge, quick 5 minute charge for a single shave, 1 hour total charge time, showerproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I get a full seven shaves though, and there is no noticeable change in the rpms, even down to 20% charge.  </li>
            <li>But Where it is excellent in this it is very bad at finishing my whole face and neck.</li>
            <li>The shaving head is impressively comfortable, not aggressive on the skin, very useful for shaving difficult parts like under the chin or below the jaw.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the wiry, stiff, Asian kind of facial hair.  </li>
            <li>That plus the fact the foil has such ultra tiny holes in it (glides right over the stubble)</li>
            <li>but it actually shaves my neck a lot closer and the pop up trimmer is right on the back.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe how much better this is than my old, noisy, heavy, hard to clean model.  </li>
            <li>Shaves MUCH closer and faster than previous razor and seems to hold a charge pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, I don&#x27;t need shaving cream for such minor touch up work.    </li>
            <li>I normally use it in the dry mode and it gives me a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>charges quick and last a long time.</li>
            <li>You can complete a full shave with less than 10% of the battery used.</li>
            <li>extreme satisfaction continued until about one year later, when I first became aware of a foul odor in and around the head of the shaver, and it&#x27;s plastic housing.</li>
            <li>Other than that and the fact that getting it completely clean is a little tough, it&#x27;s a great electric razor.</li>
            <li>The delivery was right on, as expected as well as the packaging.  </li>
            <li>They never really worked right.  </li>
            <li>If I let my hair, beard, and mustache grow out for a week, I need to use my Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System to trim back down to an easily shavable length.</li>
            <li>The first day I did a dry shave.</li>
            <li>I use this shaver dry, though I did try shaving with shaving cream when I first got it.</li>
            <li>I also used this as a dry shaver for my first time.</li>
            <li>First thing I did to test this one was to dry shave a 3 day growth.  </li>
            <li>The  first one was generallly used as a dry razor, and has lasted three years, with a replacement blade and foil at year one.</li>
            <li>And it recharges from 20% to full in less than 2 hours.  </li>
            <li>And it recharges from 20% to full in less than 2 hours.  </li>
            <li>At 20% charge, it takes less than an hour to get full speed.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I prefer the three round blade style better than this flat blade style.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t even get mad because he loved it so much</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get a full charge in under an hour but the machine dies after about half an hour into shaving.</li>
            <li>The older model is superior to the newer one in closeness of shave, and in the power of the cutting action.  </li>
            <li>I checked the price of a new one and it was almost the same as a new razor.</li>
            <li>This was bought to replace an old norelco electric razor and this one is so much better, it doesn&#x27;t pull your whiskers if they get a little too long.</li>
            <li>This was bought as a replacement for a solidly-built Panasonic which gave 10 years of service, but the new razor, unlike the one it replaces, has such a weak motor that I thought it was some kind of mislabeled toy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much quieter than my old razor (not a fair comparison, though, I&#x27;m sure Braun has also improved over the last 10 years).</li>
            <li>The Customer service is basically non existent: the attached beard trimmer (which worked more for trimming longer hairs before shaving than actually making lines) broke off several &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; around 6 months in and filed a warranty claim to panasonic through their website as it left my face with some long scratches and received no response.</li>
            <li>Have bought many different electric razors in the past 20 years and would always go back to a straight razor because of the quality of the shaves.</li>
            <li>This is my first Panasonic shaver and as long as they build them with high RPM motors it won&#x27;t be my last.</li>
            <li>A good shaver, but replacement blades are very poor quality.</li>
            <li>to clean, it provides the usage remaining, and a little protective cover and travel bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shaves very tight and I don&#x27;t have to go over the same spots more than twice.  </li>
            <li>No matter how many times I go over it, or hold it very tight to my skin, it will simply not cut these longer thicker hair/</li>
            <li>Though the power drop down by 10% after using for 2 or 3 times, it can charge itself quickly.</li>
            <li>Four and a half years later, and it&#x27;s still going strong (bought in May 2010).  </li>
            <li>Panasonic really lost points with me when they switched to the current charger and cord, a major step backwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shaves as close as a razor and shaving cream, with no mess or cuts.    </li>
            <li>The first was with the most facial hair and it did quite poorly.</li>
            <li>No mess after the shave.collects all the hair in itself.  </li>
            <li>So in other words this warranty isn&#x27;t worth the paper</li>
            <li>The newer ES8103 shaver is more comfortable to use largely due to the pivot action, the blade action is much faster (although it doesn&#x27;t reduce my shaving time appreciably), the battery lasts about twice as long per charge, doesn&#x27;t slow down as it discharges, and recharges in a much shorter time.  </li>
            <li>If I could go 4.5 stars, I would have, but I just couldn&#x27;t go 5, due to the fact that I think the old Remington did a closer shave, and after all, that&#x27;s what a shaver is for, right?    </li>
            <li>so maybe it&#x27;s just illusory and (3) other reviewers are right, this thing is noticeably louder than my old Panasonics.  </li>
            <li>We all put up with lot&#x27;s worse for less results so this shaver is absolutely a keeper and at this price I am thinking that it will make a great present for others.</li>
            <li>The initial break in period was the hardest since my beard grows back very fast.</li>
            <li>Second, the motor is very quiet and, as is advertised, appears to move very fast, allowing for a pull-free shave.  </li>
            <li>The motor does not seem as strong and the body seems a little cheaper, but for a third the price of the old unit I didn&#x27;t expect perfection.  </li>
            <li>I replaced a Braun which was ok, but didn&#x27;t give the same shave quality the same as the charge ran down.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather just buy the blades, get it done right the first time without red, raw, painful skin, and a short shave that is successful the very first time.</li>
            <li>Some parts of the face can get a little tricky specially the neck area, below the sideburns and under the lip leading to the increased shave time.</li>
            <li>No issues with the charger, no issues with the digital display, nothing.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is that it isn&#x27;t as easy to clean as advertised (and certainly not self-cleaning, especially if you try wet shaving with it).&lt;br /&gt;By</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re poor like me, you&#x27;ve probably purchased many cheap electric shavers that were $20-$30 or less.</li>
            <li>Overall would say it isn&#x27;t much better than my Panasonic cheaper razor, only slightly.</li>
            <li>The flip up trimer is small but seems to do a fine job.</li>
            <li>The wet shaving with regular shaving creme is easy on the skin and close enough.</li>
            <li>the messy clean up defeats the purpose of electric shavers.</li>
            <li>After about 15 to 20 minutes of working on my face (which had just a few days of growth), I was almost clean shaven.</li>
            <li>It is a breeze to clean, dont waste your money on the self cleaner.</li>
            <li>Razors aren&#x27;t my thing and for my job i have to be clean shaved everyday...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m truly glad I did, and encourage those looking to switch from blades to an electric razor to give the ES8103s serious consideration.    </li>
            <li>get the automatic cleaning stand, messy to clean with soap and turbo mode.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have only used it dry, and it may be that it works better wet, but I would expect it to shave well in either mode.</li>
            <li>But I like to clean mine everyday</li>
            <li>With my old turkey neck, it would be impossible to get a closer or more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Not only has it given me a closer, smoother shave with easy clean-up of the razor between shavings, but its motor is quieter than I had expected and it holds a charge for several weeks.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve always had trouble getting an electric to pick them up cleanly.</li>
            <li>Excessive pressure won&#x27;t necessarily yield a better shave)&lt;br /&gt;-Blades</li>
            <li>Overall, I like this razor a lot, particularly for the price.    </li>
            <li>So, I alternate between them hoping to extend the life of the older device.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic definitely outperforms my rotery, although it&#x27;s an older model.</li>
            <li>(The ES8109 is exactly the same shaver as the ES8103, but includes the automatic cleaner, which stopped functioning several years ago).  </li>
            <li>While it works fine as a dry shaver, I am appreciating the ability to shave with a wet soapy face.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace an older Panasonic shaver, which mysteriously died on a trip to Europe.</li>
            <li>(so do I, less hair in my sink)and that it recharges quickly.</li>
            <li>Quickly  -Used less than 10 percent of a charge to shave.  </li>
            <li>Wet dry and charges so quickly!</li>
            <li>Completely dry it gives a decent shave which is very uniform over the entire face, but it takes several passes to get a reasonably close shave.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the charger cord would no longer make a consistent connection which kept me from being able to charge the shaver.  </li>
            <li>This was the second one that I purchased, bought my first one back in 2011 which lasted me through college.</li>
            <li>It is relatively quiet when compared to the older Remington I had.</li>
            <li>This was never a problem with my older Panasonic, but it&#x27;s a big problem with this one.  </li>
            <li>He had never used an electric shaver (&amp;#34;You can only get a decent shave with a razor blade&amp;#34; were his thoughts and opinion for all of those years).  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic&#x27;s battery also does not last as long, but I can get a week&#x27;s worth of shaves between chargings.</li>
            <li>I went back to a Gillette razor, which really does give you a closer shave--but just barely closer.</li>
            <li>Having to go over the same spots countless times as the razor got hot and irritated my skin.</li>
            <li>I am an older guy who always had facial hair and</li>
            <li>I have used an electric shaver from another manufacturer through many different models over the past 55 years.</li>
            <li>The ES8103S takes the same time to shave as the older Panasonic shaver that I was replacing.</li>
            <li>It saves me the hassle of using a traditional blade and seems to be of decent quality for the price.</li>
            <li>While others have commented that its required back-and-forth motion for shaving makes it harder to shave their necks, I have found just the opposite to be true.  </li>
            <li>It provides for a realistic shave compared to a razor cut and gets closer around and above the lips.</li>
            <li>and it definitely shaves closer than my older Braun (mid-level price)</li>
            <li>first electric razor after trying many razors from disposable to expensive.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted several years even after being dropped numerous times.  </li>
            <li>It does not fully shave my facial hair, which I usually grow up to a quarter an inch at the most.</li>
            <li>I feel it pulling as it cuts, particularly on the upper lip area.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several shavers and s;pent a lot of money trying to find a decent shaver for my son.  </li>
            <li>The fact that it is small and inanimate are the only things that prevent me from making love to this shaver.</li>
            <li>if i could find the older one, i&#x27;d definitely buy that instead.</li>
            <li>I got a shave pretty much equal to what I get with my double edge safety razor!&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li>After I&#x27;m done carving away my face with the back razor, I switch to the main one:</li>
            <li>I need multiple passes, particularly over my lip, but it does the job.  </li>
            <li>This was a present for my son in law, though I have the exact same model.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m satisfied with this shaver because I have owned several foil shavers in the past</li>
            <li>It also recharges really quickly, so if you&#x27;ve forgotten to charge it just before a week-long trip, half an hour will do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also charges quickly and the charge lasts a week and a half.</li>
            <li>Dry shaving seemed fine until I used the wet shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>or it&#x27;s something about this particular model, but it&#x27;s definitely not the closest shave</li>
            <li>On your first, second, and third shave will give your face a tingling sensation.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-I don&#x27;t mind the higher pitch hum at all, definitely not noisy enough to complain</li>
            <li>I end up using a straight razor to get the 2 inches below my sideburns straight and clean every time since this is very poor at shaving in this area in particular.  </li>
            <li>I end up using a straight razor to get the 2 inches below my sideburns straight and clean every time since this is very poor at shaving in this area in particular.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t do that great a job shaving my face, especially the long hairs on my neck and those high on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>At 10%, the indicator seems to last twice, possibly more, as long as at any other level.</li>
            <li>After several weeks of use I found that the razor head consistently gave a \\&quot;razor burn feeling\\&quot;, did not cut flat laying wiskers well, seemed to lack power, and did not shave as well as my well worn out old braun.</li>
            <li>No other issues with this product so far.</li>
            <li>This is my second Panasonic shaver to purchase because my first shaver was taken by my husband, who likes it so much he has trashed his other razors.</li>
            <li>I keep a closely trimmed, lined out beard, and this razor actually lets me keep a sharp and clean trim line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other electric shaves and have always had to clean up problem areas with a regular razor.  </li>
            <li>I have a tough beard and very sensitive skin, so blades don&#x27;t work, and most dry-only</li>
            <li>If the other reviews are right, we have nothing to worry about.</li>
            <li>I looked at the new Arc 4 options for Panasonic, and while they have good reviews, I found out that the replacement blades were very expensive, and didn&#x27;t make a large enough difference in the shave to warrant the price.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this shaver, I was hoping to shave my head and face at the same time in the shower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched high and low and read all of the reviews that I could find.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this razor, especially if you&#x27;ve been shaving with an electric razor</li>
            <li>Someone said it would last for two weeks, but I highly doubt that.</li>
            <li>Someone said it would last for two weeks, but I highly doubt that.</li>
            <li>The high pinch noise is noticeable, especially comparing with Norelco.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s overall a really high quality product that I plan on keeping and using for years to come.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaver especially at this price.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using it in the shower with The Total Shaving Solution oil too.</li>
            <li>The low quality does not match the high price.</li>
            <li>which was very gentle and could get wet.</li>
            <li>4 stars, only negative to me so far is that I cant seem to get a straight line shave precise just under my side burns..</li>
            <li>The areas that were more difficult to shave, especially under the neck and along the jaw line back my ears take forever to come smooth</li>
            <li>built.&lt;br /&gt;I must say though that my $40.00 triple foil Remington shaved much faster and easier.&lt;br /&gt;The third cutter probably helped on the old one, but this shaver labors through my beard where the old one glided.&lt;br /&gt;Battery only lasts about 6 or 7 shaves also.</li>
            <li>It really cuts deep and the battery last pretty long.</li>
            <li>His brother has an identical one and highly recommended that I buy the same for my husband.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used various shavers for years and when my old Braun needed a new foil and cutter</li>
            <li>I had an old Braun that finally just died and was in need of a new electric razor.  </li>
            <li>In anticipation of the new razor arriving, I skipped shaving for three days to give it a proper test against my old razor.</li>
            <li>a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still later:  I told the company that I was dismayed by the early death of my shaver.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t want to go back to the old way for anything, except maybe permanent hair removal!!</li>
            <li>This shaver provides a comfortable and close shave reliably, with very little maintenance.  </li>
            <li>The bright side to that negative is that it is fully charged in less than an hour.</li>
            <li>- Fast, took less than 3min to shave my whole face   </li>
            <li>dry, wet, light shave oil</li>
            <li>Sensitive skin and thick, strong beard.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The high ratings led me to purchase this, more expensive razor over, say, the $30 ones I normally buy.</li>
            <li>and I kept it going with new batteries and old parts, but the screens were becoming very hard to find.</li>
            <li>It charges very quickly, and has a small digital window on the front telling you how much charge is left.</li>
            <li>, single blade, heavy vibrate, 8 hour charge and most of all.......</li>
            <li>A very smooth shave even in the hard to get places such as under the chin and at the jaw line.</li>
            <li>One in the car, one older one for initial cut, one new one for final pass.  </li>
            <li>The display will say 10% for weeks, so not sure how accurate that is.  </li>
            <li>comfortably in any direction (Moving a razor sideways usually meant 2 days of cleaning blood from my face.</li>
            <li>It tells you how much life it has lteft, so no unexpected shut downs.</li>
            <li>One charge is enough for 4-5 shaves (far from 10-13 they advertise), but it&#x27;s not a big deal, since battery charges in under 1h (I don&#x27;t know if the fast charge is going to kill battery faster).    </li>
            <li>It requires an esoteric level of technique for anything more arduous than a couple of stray hairs.</li>
            <li>* Cuts the long hairs as very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Did not like closeness of electrics in the past, even though I have light beard.</li>
            <li>My old shaver just had colored lights and would sometimes stop in the middle of a shave when it still had a green light.  </li>
            <li>To me, it&#x27;s not annoyingly loud so, the noise is really a non issue.  </li>
            <li>I have the most trouble getting hairs near the corners of her mouth and under her chin where her skin is very loose.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it does not give a very close shave; my old one did better.</li>
            <li>however, it is much lighter and thus feels a bit cheaper; not saying that&#x27;s the case, but we&#x27;ll see how long this one lasts.</li>
            <li>I guess it depends on how long your shaves are really.</li>
            <li>I generally need to recharge every 10 days vs. 14 days with my old Norelco.</li>
            <li>general note if you have sensitive skin or allergies:&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The first shaver I&#x27;ve ever had which I am allowed to get wet.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to normal razors.</li>
            <li>I use it as a wet shave with Zirh shaving gel and rinse the electric razor with hot water every now</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>I have a pretty rough beard and have dreaded shaving for years.</li>
            <li>How can it charge so quickly, last so long, look so cool but pull out my facial hair like tweezers?!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lastly, the noise level of this razor is normal, it&#x27;s no louder than a Braun, Remington or Norelco.....</li>
            <li>Being my first experience with a wet razor</li>
            <li>Ten days of using it everyday have only made me like it more.  </li>
            <li>I was pretty rough on the unit, keeping it in the shower, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the first electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used, but have been curious about getting one for quite some time.</li>
            <li>I scoffed at first about the wet shave</li>
            <li>I normally shave with a Braun Series 3 Model 8985, which is a terrific shaver.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what was described and expected.</li>
            <li>Now I checked first on using this wet with bar soap lathered up.</li>
            <li>But that is what these reviews are for, full disclosure to help other potential consumers make an informed choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>wish I could stop there and say this Shaver lives up to its other reviews, but it simply doesn&#x27;t shave close enough and requires many passes over the same area to get an acceptable cut.  </li>
            <li>Comparing these 3, the Panasonic is the best one for me as I have lots of neck hairs that were very difficult to be shaved with the SHARP or even with the Braun shaver.</li>
            <li>The battery is pretty solid, a full charge gets me at least 4 shaves or so.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the first two weeks I shaved wet with shaving gel.  </li>
            <li>MY ONLY SURPRISE IS THE LOUDER THAN NORMAL OPERATING VOLUME.</li>
            <li>Battery lasts about 2 weeks with normal use and only takes about an hour to charge.  </li>
            <li>Now, at fifteen months, the razor is completely dead, and will not even turn on after a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After six months of use, a part inside shook loose and now it buzzes loudly and the whole unit shakes in my hand.</li>
            <li>The only complaint is that the charging indicator isn&#x27;t very accurate.  </li>
            <li>you will definitely need to go over the same spot a few times if you want a super close shave (true with all electrics), but the irritation is minimal to non-existent, even with very sensitive skin like I have.  </li>
            <li>The short ones it gets clean, but leaves the longer ones, meaning you have to go back over the same area several times.  </li>
            <li>It is not efficient and you must spend so much time going the same spot back and forth until you get a clean shave, but you&#x27;ll destroy your skin this way!&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>Still, it is worth that small inconvenience since it gives such a great shave -- and I do mean as well as when I wet shave with a blade.</li>
            <li>It provides a close, clean shave, at least for my normal beard.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product very steadily for a few weeks, and I really regret purchasing this Panasonic electric razor.</li>
            <li>Used to get a week&#x27;s worth of shaving on a charge, and now it&#x27;s down to 2 days (3</li>
            <li>Charging lasts for about a week worth saves, recharge when it gets down to 30%.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However and having used several of these in the last 16 years, I wish they use metal instead of plastic for certain parts that are visible.  </li>
            <li>Expected a little more then what it does.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;d only recommend using it with shave cream, even the cheap stuff, just to give it a little lubrication and get as close as it can.</li>
            <li>Easy to cut skin if you push a bit too hard.</li>
            <li>I have used different electric razors through the years and this is the first that I have used that gave me a very close shave on 3 days growth in half the time of others.  </li>
            <li>Easy to maneuver into the hard to reach areas of the face and jaw.</li>
            <li>It may last 5 or 10 years if you&#x27;re lucky enough to have replacement parts that long</li>
            <li>It runs a long time on a single charge and recharges quickly.</li>
            <li>but it is hands down better than any of the others I have owned (all other major brands).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effortless to use, even with tough facial hair like my own.</li>
            <li>It is small but yet very powerful.  </li>
            <li>The charger/converter section measures about 2 cm wide x 6 cm long x 6.5 cm deep, which seems smaller than most.  </li>
            <li>Satisfied with the product thus far with one exception, the screen is too small and does not give me a close shave unless I go over the same area numerous times.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic makes lots of shavers and are less costly than most of the other +$100 shavers out there.  </li>
            <li>It did a much better job on my tough facial hair, but left razor burn on my neck, to the point I could only shave every other day at most.</li>
            <li>The other style with 3 circular blades covers so much more of your face at once and shaving takes half the time.  </li>
            <li>The extreme speed of the motor and the quick, close shave are totally unlike any shaver that I have used before.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I have to go over an area many times, but only once or twice if I stretch the skin (hard to do without a mirror in the shower).  </li>
            <li>This is the second Panasonic shaver I&#x27;ve purchased (first was several years ago -- they last a long time) and this brand beats others I&#x27;ve tried by a large margin.</li>
            <li>Requires lots of skin streching and passes back and forth over the same area to get down to a decent stubble.&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended for a QUICK touch-up and go.</li>
            <li>I just think it is harder to shave without a mirror - takes longer, more damage to your face by going over spots multiple times due to not seeing what you must shave.</li>
            <li>am not aware of any cons, but i own it only a few weeks...</li>
            <li>About 10 days later a brand new replacement shaver showed up on the doorstep.</li>
            <li>after years of virtually daily use, I think this needs a new foil block.  </li>
            <li>I finally decided to bite the bullet and purchase a new razor.</li>
            <li>When the battery finally went south, I started looking on Amazon for a new one.  </li>
            <li>it says in the manual if you ever lose it the only way to get a replacement is to throw away your shaver and buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product if your looking for a new electric razor.</li>
            <li>I hope I feel this way for next 1-3-5 years with this shaver (of course with new razors from time to time).</li>
            <li>My current one needed new blades and screen and the battery was going as was the motor.  </li>
            <li>new 3-blade ES8103S shaves almost as well as the 4-blade ES8243A, but without the extra weight and bulk.</li>
            <li>My prior shaver was a Panasonic ES4025 model, and it is this shaver that I will be comparing to my new Panasonic ES8103 model.  </li>
            <li>But their recent price spikes into the stratosphere led me to venture out to new brands.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase (brand new) of this model...</li>
            <li>The display on the razor started going out two months before the warranty went out, so I sent it back to Panasonic and they sent me a new razor.</li>
            <li>only plus I can give to new users</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions on proper handling, care and shaving technique in order to allow my face the recommended 30 days to get used to the new shaving technique.</li>
            <li>This panasonic last 3 years or so before it needs new heads, gives a close shave and never caused me a rash, etc.</li>
            <li>So my ultimate solution is to buy a new cartridge for my braun and continue using it and donating this guy to the salvation army.</li>
            <li>I had been using the ES7103S shaver for years and decided not to buy new blades or foil, since the battery was only holding about a 3-shave charge.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend it to everyone looking for a new shaver.</li>
            <li>I just bought a new one because it was a daily deal that I couldn&#x27;t pass</li>
            <li>I had the razor for several years and it was about time for a new one</li>
            <li>I am still new to using this devise but like the fact that I can shave wet/dry and daily.</li>
            <li>i keep buying the same one when I need  a new shaver.</li>
            <li>new shaver has performed well, and with several swipes, produces a shave that feels almost blade-like.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to anybody looking for a new electric razor.</li>
            <li>The only thing that I was dissapointed about was that it doesn&#x27;t shave any closer as my braun [when it was new].</li>
            <li>This new one does not give me as close a shave as I would like, even though I have given it 30 days and used only that razor, just panasonic instructed.</li>
            <li>If you are just starting new to use an electric shaver it will take 3 to 4 weeks for your beard to  get use to an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Even though I have small hands, there is enough tapering in the middle that it is very comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>My husband likes this very much and he says it holds a charge a lot longer than other electric shavers that he has owned.</li>
            <li>I love Amazon, never had a bad product and always the shipping is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It is quiet, does a great job cutting my beard.</li>
            <li>The battery on my current Norelco (8845xl) isn&#x27;t holding a charge any more and the current crop of mid range ($75 or less)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a far better razor and less than half the price of the Braun, I can&#x27;t recommend a razor with defective electronics.  </li>
            <li>it will let you get a close wet shave in half the time and leaves your skin without irritation or bumps, the name Cremo shaving cream, is not cheap but for me is a great product, it says that one tube will last for 90 days, that I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>I use it dry and it gives me a fast, close shave.</li>
            <li>Does a very neat close shave, both with lather, or dry with a shaving powder.</li>
            <li>It was a very close shave, but often left me with razor burn, so for years, I used it occasionally.  </li>
            <li>I have to go over some spots a few times to be smooth but a tiny bit of stubble does not bother me...</li>
            <li>The first week I used it, I had only minor irritation, nothing severe.    </li>
            <li>and I only have to charge it every few weeks with light use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, but heavy enough to feel like a quality</li>
            <li>I have fairly firm facial hair, but relatively smooth skin.</li>
            <li>The battery life lasts pretty long even though there&#x27;s only 1 lithium battery inside of it, but i guess that&#x27;s all it needs for days.  </li>
            <li>I especially like that it tells you how much battery charge is left.</li>
            <li>He has a heavy beard and this left his face baby smooth.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic is TERREFIC..and the price was at least 20% better than local retailers.  </li>
            <li>Getting a reasonably close shave takes time and multiple passes over the same areas, unlike a blade where two passes (one \\&quot;with the grain\\&quot; and one \\&quot;against the grain\\&quot;) produces a truly close shave.  </li>
            <li>I developed moderate adult acne &amp; shaving</li>
            <li>I had to go over it so much that it left me with tiny bleeding spots all over my scalp.</li>
            <li>I should note that I have a relatively light beard, so those with heavy beards might want to look for a review of this product by users with similar features.  </li>
            <li>shave after the shower, when your face has dried just enough for the shaver to run smoothly over the face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough to use on the bikini area, underarms, back of the neck</li>
            <li>The wet/dry feature is useful for cleaning, though I can&#x27;t figure out why anyone would want to actually shave with a wet face.  </li>
            <li>All things considered a reasonable basic shaver that performs the basic function of removing whiskers well.  </li>
            <li>Also, compared to Norelco it was much larger in the hand and overall and much heavier.</li>
            <li>One the plus side, one long shave seem to only use 10% of my first charge.  </li>
            <li>First it is very noisy with  excessive vibration</li>
            <li>but it does not cut nearly as close as my old basic Braun.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before ES8103S, I had a Braun 7 series shaver which I think was one of the most expensive shavers at that time and cost twice as much as ES8103S.</li>
            <li>I had read the reviews and purchased this hoping to finally find an electric razer that would actually work like a straight edge.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t even want to waste to much time with this review.</li>
            <li>The price was less than one year&#x27;s worth of Fusion replacement cartridges.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it was a discontinuted plug style, so I wasn&#x27;t able to find a replacement at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d read the reviews, which looked pretty good, but I&#x27;m disappointed.  </li>
            <li>a few minutes is all you need if you want a quick shave and do not want to wait.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also an option to plug it in for about 5 minutes if the battery&#x27;s dead and you need a quick shave.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s harder to get equally good results on my chin and just under my nose - a bit frustrating  </li>
            <li>but I use the outliner for any heavy duty detail work, it&#x27;s adequate in a pinch.</li>
            <li>For thick stubbles try a wet shave with foam and warm water.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a little low - good for probably a week long business trip (shaving every day) or perhaps a two-week vacation (shaving less frequently).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a little low - good for probably a week long business trip (shaving every day) or perhaps a two-week vacation (shaving less frequently).</li>
            <li>This shaves almost as close as a razor (big compliment) but is more work and takes a little too long for me.</li>
            <li>First, if you shave with it regularly (every other day at least), shaving is extremely fast, clean, and painless.</li>
            <li>minor downside is the cover comes off a little too easily.</li>
            <li>I was actually very surprised at how quiet it was compared to the one it replaced.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have a constant rash on my neck from shaving.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and to boot I not only shave my face but my head as well.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and very coarse hair.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m not being lazy and make time to share every day, this is a lot quicker than a razor because I can shave my entire face, clean it, half my head, clean it, and then finish up, whereas a bladed razor needs to be cleaned after</li>
            <li>and I noticed very little difference, if anything, but the dry was slightly better for me.&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li>Very loud and doesn&#x27;t cut as smooth as my previous Panasonic that I bought for $29.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the battery doesn&#x27;t last as long either.</li>
            <li>It took some work the first time due to not being used to a electric razor and my face being used to a blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I know other people would probably say it gets hot.  </li>
            <li>This shaver works well, but there is one major flaw - While charging you can NOT use the shaver.</li>
            <li>life seems a bit weak after one shave&lt;br /&gt;should be able to shave while charging</li>
            <li>The blade is small enough to get into that area, but the electric is more convenient (especially when traveling).  </li>
            <li>After trying just about every major brand of shaver I bought this Panasonic and was amazed to find how well it performed.  </li>
            <li>No regrets!  </li>
            <li>My other Panasonic is a higher end model that came with an automatic cleaning system as well, but I find this razor works just as well</li>
            <li>This little guy works well, as I said, it&#x27;s better, lighter and quieter than my other foil shaver.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only a 72 year old man who has been shaving for almost 60 years!</li>
            <li>I hope it has the durability to last me a long time, because so far I really dig this purchase;</li>
            <li>the first one for myself, the other two for my father and step-father...</li>
            <li>I bought my first one over 20 years ago and won&#x27;t use any other brand.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t line up my goatee with it without major effort.  </li>
            <li>(about 10-15 minutes in total, usually), and requires me to go over the same spots many times.  </li>
            <li>I have had no other complaints with the quality of the device.</li>
            <li>But even then, it seems to cut exactly at the surface and seemingly lacks the \\&quot;lift and pull\\&quot; technology in use by almost every other manufacturer, which cuts the whisker below the surface.</li>
            <li>The switch was a major hassle too as you had to push it 10 times and hope it stayed on once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve taken up using lectric shave for first pass, then lathering up for second, to get an actual close shave i need to go back over with a razor still though.</li>
            <li>No other maintenance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And this is true for the new one, but the battery loses charge while being idle at the rate 10-20% per week.</li>
            <li>The first was stolen and I&#x27;ve missed it everyday until the new one arrived.</li>
            <li>So far he has had no complaints other than the replacement coil costing almost as much as a new shaver (we opted for a new shaver).  </li>
            <li>Even though you can use this in the shower I do not because the hot water runs low by the time I shower and shave plus dry shaving</li>
            <li>Easy to charge and even has a small orange display that provides the current power percentage.  </li>
            <li>and it is cool that it can work wet or dry.</li>
            <li>My old one had no such indicator, and you only knew how much charge was left by the motor slowing down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On a one day old beard its fantastic, on a two day old beard you will find some straggler hairs it did not cut, and a three day old beard is worse.</li>
            <li>I typically shave right after I shower.  </li>
            <li>From day one the new shaver (Panasonic ES8 103S) failed to provide a reasonably close or comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Usually I shave with the blade and then clean up my face with this razor.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just big enough that you don&#x27;t have to go over too much ground, and yet it&#x27;s small enough to comfortably maneuver around the cut of your chin and under your mustache.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s a wet dry I can lather up wet me face and use it on the go mostly.</li>
            <li>I have moderately thick, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Can the cheap plastic vibration link really transmit sufficient ultrasonic energy through to the razor head to the point where it actually cleans, rather than just buzzing weakly?</li>
            <li>Before I leave the house I spend about 10 minutes with this powerful little guy</li>
            <li>I owned a Remington few years back, but quit using it because it was a pain to clean and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had shavers at less than half the cost that worked much better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s main drawback was that it tended to go through a couple of sets of blades a year, as I shave daily, and have a fairly coarse beard.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping for something that would work better on really tough beards.</li>
            <li>This razor is quick and can be used wet or dry.</li>
            <li>I used to shave with a straight razor, but after I had a few strokes my hand was not so steady.</li>
            <li>If there is a newer version of this model, you might give it a look, but I can tell you it would be tough to top this model for the price.</li>
            <li>I also like the floating head, which can be locked for those who need to apply more pressure for a tough beard.</li>
            <li>Charging is really quick, and works well dry or wet.</li>
            <li>Hopefully it continues to preform at this high level for a long time.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve purchased a Braun instead based on reviews of long life and high reliability.</li>
            <li>I have to stretch my skin around more than I expected I would, and a couple hairs don&#x27;t get cut at all if they are laying down completely flat.</li>
            <li>Nothing but a cheap cloth bag to store it in, needs hard case to protect it.</li>
            <li>so I had to adjust to the light touch of the razor and not push it too hard as I shave.  </li>
            <li>Shaving up on the face got me really smooth, but it was hard on my skin, and shaving up on my neck was not an option.  </li>
            <li>The size is right, the blades stay sharp and it stays solid while in use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am not sure If this is the right product for me!</li>
            <li>The motor is very fast, quiet and produces minimal vibration.</li>
            <li>The blades seem like they are just becoming less sharp now.</li>
            <li>I can shave dry, wet, or with shaving cream and any way I choose this is better on my skin than any other razor I have ever owned.    </li>
            <li>I am very happy with the purchase at present.lowed to run while plugged in (as the recharger is in the outlet plug to the wall socket and other, less expensive brands/models do so).  </li>
            <li>Both provided an equally smooth shave with the same level of tugging and skin irritation which was very little.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s certainly much better than rotaries I&#x27;ve owned, and my only small complaint is that it seems to need recharging a little more frequently than some others.  </li>
            <li>The only real benefits of this razor are it makes less of a mess than regular shaving and can give a decent shave quickly in the morning.</li>
            <li>Yet, to my fingertips at least, it&#x27;s a close and smooth shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A friend bought another product much more cheaply and complained that it worked poorly.</li>
            <li>Electric razors in general just do not shave as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li>The cost is generally $35-$50/face session.</li>
            <li>The primary negative is the time it takes.</li>
            <li>That is important, since you need to know when to recharge this shaver, and it uses up at least 10% of the charge with each shave.  </li>
            <li>I generally split the difference and replace everything at 18 months.</li>
            <li>I like blade-close shaves, and electrics never worked for me, generally making my face feel as though it had suffered a bird stampede.</li>
            <li>It holds its charge well and clearly shows what percentage is left.</li>
            <li>Like my legs, it usually requires multiple passes and directions to get the skin to feel smooth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was a Braun person for years before trying this Panasonic unit, and generally I&#x27;ve always had good luck with Panasonic products, so have been unhappy with my experience on this shaver.  </li>
            <li>Long battery life (about 10 days), but you have to run the razor from different directions to get a reasonably close shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 70 years old and had Norelco&#x27;s and could not get the soft grey whiskers to cut.  </li>
            <li>it, but it&#x27;s clear they just gave you a refurb as my units were definitely not mine (they had distinguishing marks).</li>
            <li>Years ago I had a Norelco which barely produced an acceptable shave.</li>
            <li>I would not really recommend this product, maybe to someone who wants a starter or a travel razor.</li>
            <li>My old Panasonic razors simply had bars that indicated the charge remaining.</li>
            <li>loud, I had to go over the same areas again and again</li>
            <li>It takes several passes to completely shave this area.</li>
            <li>Last was Norelco with the 3 rotating heads (about a 5-year old product).  </li>
            <li>But if you shave wet with shaving cream or soap you get a much closer shave.  </li>
            <li>Charger cord - I prefer the old style cords that are curled, can stretch, and simply plug in to the wall without a converter.  </li>
            <li>I have NO REGRETS in purchasing this model.  </li>
            <li>(so far they&#x27;ve always come back eventually).</li>
            <li>No regrets.</li>
            <li>Apparently I just can&#x27;t use an electric razor.</li>
            <li>Even on my wedding day, a professional barber left rash, and that man was a master.  </li>
            <li>I can barely feel it gliding over my skin.  </li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t think I would ever pay near list price for it, at the recent Amazon deal, it was a bargain.  </li>
            <li>I had finally settled on a Remington electric razor that I have been using for nearly 10 years.</li>
            <li>needed to replace my old Braun shaver which was totally worn</li>
            <li>I realize now that the only review you can really trust on shavers is from a dude who has the same beard as you, and the same skin sensitivity.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I have coarse whiskers, but it doesn&#x27;t even come close to shaving as well as the old lower-end Braun that this unit was intended to replace.  </li>
            <li>I have used Braun for years and was a devote user until my last Braun shaver (3 years old)</li>
            <li>With the Braun prices going up and the quality of the Braun razors apparently going south, I decided to switch brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>100% recommendation for this product, especially given the rather modest price.</li>
            <li>It has a digital display near the on/off button for the battery strength.</li>
            <li>and I like the battery level display which allows you to judge whether or not there&#x27;s a complete shave left in the battery.</li>
            <li>Been buying the same model for over 15 years, have had 3 so far.</li>
            <li>With the extended life, I have to change my economics from above - the razors have averaged a 2 years plus lifespan; and, the economics are far in the favor of the Panasonic vs.</li>
            <li>With the extended life, I have to change my economics from above - the razors have averaged a 2 years plus lifespan; and, the economics are far in the favor of the Panasonic vs.</li>
            <li>model is smaller,  softer and lighter than old model.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Only have to charge it once a week so far.</li>
            <li>I recently chucked my old Braun shaver because it was hurting my skin.  </li>
            <li>I am 66 years old and have had several electric shavers.</li>
            <li>No regrets.</li>
            <li>The shaver does shave much closer than I expected.</li>
            <li>I tried the &amp;#34;for women&amp;#34; shavers, they wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge and barely cut butter.</li>
            <li>Going back to my 10 year old Braun.</li>
            <li>This shaver isn&#x27;t quiet, but it&#x27;s not too loud either.</li>
            <li>I used to have a Remington electric razor that barely lasted me 5 years...</li>
            <li>However my face is sensitive to manual razors and so electric shaving is currently my only way to shave.</li>
            <li>only negative comment is that it cannot be left charging for more than an hour.  </li>
            <li>I really like the wet/dry feature as I don&#x27;t always have time to do a wet shave.</li>
            <li>B0009DT342 Panasonic ES8043SC Pro-Curve Pivot Action Linear Wet/Dry Shaver, Silver]] gave up the ghost recently.</li>
            <li>Body is plastic and not metal (again, the 20 year old Braun was all metal), so not expecting it to last 20 years.</li>
            <li>The micro screen holes must be pretty small, as it take a lot of work with back and forth movement to get a reasonably close shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Husband loves this early Christmas present!  </li>
            <li>This is now my daily shaver and an old Braun is the backup.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a step up from my old shaver.</li>
            <li>Obviously not as close as a razor/blade would, but not too far off the mark.</li>
            <li>I now do a wet shave every 4th time, to get a really close shave.</li>
            <li>This is where the wide trimmer really excels.</li>
            <li>This razor really does shave wet without losing its edge</li>
            <li>I recently pulled this out and shaved with it again (face and head) and I felt like I had betrayed an old friend.</li>
            <li>I have facial hair of medium thickness and have been using electric razors all my adult life(20 yrs)</li>
            <li>I will probably buy my old shaver again or try a different brand.</li>
            <li>to closeness of shave-- the old Norelco left a lot of stray hairs, esp.</li>
            <li>Gillette Fusion gave me the fewest scratches--but even then, I could barely shave every day.    </li>
            <li>+ Barely any stinging when I apply aftershave.  </li>
            <li>This is real value for the money spent.</li>
            <li>Went back to my old Remington.</li>
            <li>My last razor was nearly identical and was given to me as a gift.</li>
            <li>The fact is works wet is very helpful and</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 71 year old dad who has short term memory loss from a stroke.</li>
            <li>In comparison to my old Braun though, I think it falls a bit short.  </li>
            <li>but I prefer the one on my old Panasonic because it came out further</li>
            <li>QUIET, compared to my old Remington.</li>
            <li>I bought this when my $39, 5-year old Remington finally wouldn&#x27;t take a charge.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For 91 year old female face:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can barely read anything.  </li>
            <li>cleans simply without costly cartridges like my old braun self cleaner.</li>
            <li>I could not seem to find any razor that would shave me as close as my old Remington would, especially under the neck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>much have to go over the same area multiple times in different directions to get all hairs</li>
            <li>Been using the ES8103S for several months now and have had no problems so far.  </li>
            <li>I have only used this razor 3 times, but so far I like it.  </li>
            <li>My wife surprised me with the Panasonic ES8103S Arc3 after searching the internet and watching multiple videos.</li>
            <li>This shaver is a big improvement over my old electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>It shaves much closer and is not much louder.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s apparent that no electric will provide a shave as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li>Especially compared to my old Braun.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a head shaver, and frequently use this for a daily shaver.  </li>
            <li>Seems fairly sensitive to direction of motion on different parts of the face.  </li>
            <li>I got this for my bf&#x27;s birthday present because his old one was eating his face.</li>
            <li>The problem is, the razor can barely do this.</li>
            <li>I got this for my eighty eight year old father who has only ever used a safety razor except for maybe once.</li>
            <li>The battery shows no obvious signs of weakness so far</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve left it nearly a week unplugged</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace an 8-year old Panasonic after the last one died.</li>
            <li>cleans simply without costly cartridges like my old braun self cleaner.</li>
            <li>I use the shave gel for extra comfort on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back to the old strait edge razors.</li>
            <li>It is not even remotely close to a straight edge.</li>
            <li>I like the ES103S and would not go back to my old Braun.</li>
            <li>I bought this razor as a present for my 90 year old grandfather&#x27;s 91st birthday.</li>
            <li>would definitely buy another Panasonic shaver when it&#x27;s time to replace my old one.</li>
            <li>No regrets.</li>
            <li>He had gone back to a standard razor because his old electric one was just worn out and too old to get replacement parts.</li>
            <li>As far as a razor, I use my S4 Eclipse headblade, and a Double Edge for my face.  </li>
            <li>I have not tired using it wet.</li>
            <li>Not much of a problem except the first time I used it to trim the hairs on the back of my neck, the cuttings got into the collar of my shirt</li>
            <li>Would recommend to others, especially those interested in a wet shave.</li>
            <li>People have complained that the shaver is loud and compared to others, this may be true.  </li>
            <li>I decieded to work with it, and when I finally used it as a wet shaver, I was amazed at the shave&#x27;s closeness (it&#x27;s my first wet/dry shaver).  </li>
            <li>First time trimming the big stuff wet.</li>
            <li>This is particularly true because a fully charged battery lasts me about 2+ weeks with everyday use that likely exceeds my time for any/most travels abroad.  </li>
            <li>and I cannot tell when the shaver is fully charged making this shaver kind of useless.</li>
            <li>the screen failed after 8 months of use giving me a nice cut on the chin.</li>
            <li>Leaves some whiskers behind no matter how many passes.</li>
            <li>When I went online today to return, I saw I was past the return deadline for a full refund.  </li>
            <li>Not as close a shave as a razor but good for someone with disability or inability to use a cutting blade.</li>
            <li>it goes from full function to dead in an instant.</li>
            <li>That said, I found the cleaning station to be kind of useless anyway.</li>
            <li>Works better with thin beard hairs in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It does get warm, but not at all uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll take a good ribbing all day if you are seen cutting yourself with an electric.</li>
            <li>It get&#x27;s most of my beard but still leaves a lot behind that I have to do a back-up sweep with a blade to finish off.</li>
            <li>This was worse than most.</li>
            <li>I have a fairly heavy beard but even so it can handle up to about 5 days worth of growth.</li>
            <li>It is not cheap, but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve put up with poor imitations for too many years.  </li>
            <li>You are only applying it to your face and when it dries after a few seconds, it has no bad effects on the shaver.</li>
            <li>:  Not very good on fine neck hair (need to use trimmer), somewhat noisy, short charge life&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have a pretty tough beard and this goes right through it without any irritation or redness.</li>
            <li>For me - for the price of the unit and yearly foil/blade replacement, it sure saved me a ton of money on traditional blades and has been a very convenient / quick part of my daily grooming, so I&#x27;m not too disappointed in the 5 year span I got from</li>
            <li>Most likely it is related to allergies, but I needed a shaving solution in the mean time.  </li>
            <li>I really love using a conventional blade razor, so I was not easily</li>
            <li>I like the shaver very much, but I would rather have a charging stand like the previous Panasonic shaver I had for 15 years.</li>
            <li>I bought this one to replace a model ES 8016 which is 9 years old and still works although it doesn&#x27;t hold its charge as long, down to 7 days from 14 when it was new, and the blades really need replacing.  </li>
            <li>last tip for the first-time electrical shaver users - for the smooth shaving, make your skin very dry or very wet.</li>
            <li>so it takes less time for me to shave than usual and with far better results.</li>
            <li>I give it 4 stars because trim side it not enough strong, you can only make small changes on your beard.</li>
            <li>Their steel had gotten so bad that I couldn&#x27;t get a good shave in a year from buying new heads or razor.</li>
            <li>My husband is crazy about his new razor and goes around rubbing his face saying how amazing the quality of his shave is now.</li>
            <li>I simply chalked that up to the new shaver being lighter and just using a smaller battery.  </li>
            <li>So I sent my shaver back for a replacement and the new one is no different.    </li>
            <li>Any new razor will take a few days for you to get the hang of, for your skin to get used to, and for you to really see the pros and cons.</li>
            <li>Instead I will gladly live with it as the total shave time was only 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>After my last electric shaver bit the dust, I tried going back to blade shaving with a new 3-blade Gillette razor.  </li>
            <li>dry feature is very useful if you&#x27;re trying to save a little time by shaving in the shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nosier than other shavers I have used -- it&#x27;s a loud high pitch type</li>
            <li>Two years ago I bought a Braun for around $80 but it does not shave very close and the charge does not last very long.  </li>
            <li>It was also very noisy and reached a point where it could not hold a charge very long, even though I religiously followed the recharging directions.</li>
            <li>My facial hair isn&#x27;t very think nor very long.</li>
            <li>The plug is quite large, so not exactly travel</li>
            <li>My only negative is that while cleaning is easy, I&#x27;ve had to replace the foil as the stock one started rusting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it as a dry shaver and it shaved very close without any irritation.  </li>
            <li>The Norelco had to make numerous passes over the same long stubble to clean it all up, but eventually it got there, and it&#x27;s so quiet that nobody sleeping would care how long you kept at it.</li>
            <li>Second, while quieter, it seems to be because the motor is a lot less powerful.  </li>
            <li>I have only used this shaver a few times but it gets a super close shave.</li>
            <li>Super Loud  Slow Shave</li>
            <li>Battery runs out after only a few shaves, but it charges quickly.</li>
            <li>It is odd, however, that the shaver head moves from left to right instead of front to back (like my old Braun) which requires some getting used to.</li>
            <li>I mean I wasn&#x27;t looking for discounts or free things, despite the fact they&#x27;ve sent me a faulty product</li>
            <li>It is more expensive than some other shavers, but is worth it</li>
            <li>its up, down, left, right, diagonal, repeat.</li>
            <li>Some 12-15 years ago I used a single head foil induction charging Panasonic which I loved but the charging mechanism failed</li>
            <li>I had the three day extra long stubble and this shaver cut right thru it all (dry shave).</li>
            <li>Each time after he was done his face turned red and raw within 30 minutes after shaving with or without special products that prevent aftershave irritation.</li>
            <li>I had been using a previous Panasonic foil shaver with two blades and the first thing I noticed about this shaver</li>
            <li>I typically shave the first thing out of the shower, with no gel.    </li>
            <li>Lasts for 8-10 shaves per charge which is better than other shavers I have had in the past (Panasonics and Brauns).  </li>
            <li>To do this I first shaved with one of the shavers then immediately followed this with a second shave with the other one.  </li>
            <li>It took me three tries to find a decent replacement for my old Braun 2000 series shaver after it finally died.  </li>
            <li>I have owned other Panasonic raizors in the past and have always been pleased with the results I have gotten.</li>
            <li>The little raised knobs where the thumb holds to shaver could be raised a little more</li>
            <li>Every other rechargeable device I have had a vertical orientation or one that rotates to allow for small spaces that many bathrooms have.  </li>
            <li>I was never able to find one that can adequately shave my neck.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s just hard for me to justify the significant difference in price.</li>
            <li>AS OTHER ELECTRICS BUT VERY HIGH ON COMFORT AND SMOOTHNESS.</li>
            <li>This is in stark contrast to my old Remington, which slowed down as the battery discharged, making shaving more and more uncomfortable each day.  </li>
            <li>From this I conclude that both shavers shave better in certain situations and this was due to the shape of the cutting head as applied to a certain shape on my face.  </li>
            <li>but you have to press the foil pretty hard against your neck and do a few repeat passes to get it smooth.</li>
            <li>I tried to replace it with several other common brands to no avail either they did not shave smooth enough or really were too abrasive for my sensitive skin,until I bought this one.    </li>
            <li>so it usually takes me an extra 1 minute to put soap it, put it in sonic clean mode, and rinse it out.</li>
            <li>I can heartily recommend this shaver to anyone who&#x27;s looking to get a clean shave daily on a small budget.</li>
            <li>If you have a long beard it will not cut properly but shaving part result almost as classic blade.</li>
            <li>Second, it is not easy to judge whether the head outer blade part is completely put on the body, and therefore the outer blade is easily damaged due to the incomplete installation.</li>
            <li>and they stay sharp for a reasonable time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bottom line is, my last Panasonic worked really well, and this one works just as well - no better, no worse.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I was pleased with its performance although it does take at least twice as long to shave with an electric versus a blade</li>
            <li>I hardly ever clean it, just shave.  </li>
            <li>but the trimmer is very lightweight compared to his other shavers.</li>
            <li>The charger is very compact unless all the other bulky ones I was used to.</li>
            <li>Other than that, this product works very well</li>
            <li>if your ingrowns or blemished skin (due to hair growth and shaving) are really problems for you</li>
            <li>He has had other razors and they did not hold a charge, so we were really concerned with that...  </li>
            <li>This works very well and does not irritate his skin as much as other razors.  </li>
            <li>but the other not so much.  </li>
            <li>With the Panasonic ES8103S, I&#x27;m back to the Flintstone&#x27;s days of the old 5:00 shadow, only it&#x27;s apparent by 3pm.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know much about other electric razors</li>
            <li>$ stars due to the battery draining really fast.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any experience with other electric shavers but can say that I really like this one.  </li>
            <li>it is very convenient in the morning compare with other razors.&lt;br /&gt;anyway</li>
            <li>I think the smoothness of the shave is the result of Panasonic&#x27;s use of narrower foils than other models so there is not as much metal contact with the skin.  </li>
            <li>It has a very high-pitch noise that my other models never had.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works very well and shaves as close if not closer than any other electric shaver I have owned.</li>
            <li>I believe this shaver is far better than any other on the market due to its 30 degree blade and all other manufacturers use a 45 - 90 degree blade which requires multiple passes.   </li>
            <li>I believe this shaver is far better than any other on the market due to its 30 degree blade and all other manufacturers use a 45 - 90 degree blade which requires multiple passes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard, so I was expecting a little more after reading some of the reviews.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like vacuuming your face.. back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.. when with a normal razor, one swipe and your done.  </li>
            <li>I bought this on a lightning deal and thought I&#x27;m getting something good since it&#x27;s quite expensive!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed at how long this runs for such a high speed motor.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s no more noisy than my last Braun shaver and gives far better results  at half the price</li>
            <li>Te battery holded a little less time after first year on my first shaver.</li>
            <li>When my older ES8103S was due for a foil and blades, I thought I would just buy a whole new razor, thereby at least getting a new battery and motor in addition to the foil and blades.</li>
            <li>If you read the other reviews you will see that the only detractors are the ones who are expecting a nice razor-like barber-house shave, and that is just ridiculous.</li>
            <li>buying the new blades &amp; foil make this a bargain, almost like getting a new shaver for less than 1/2 price.</li>
            <li>He came back to me a few days later saying now that he is used to it he gets a better shave than any other razor he has tried.</li>
            <li>A little irritation at first then my face got used to the shave much faster than with my other razors.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be a great alternative to walking several hundred meters to use cold water or just shaving dry with a razor.  </li>
            <li>After using this razor, my face hasn&#x27;t felt so smooth in years (seriously).  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately no such luck, it is late July and the indispensable LCD display has already given up.  </li>
            <li>The only negative would be the sound:</li>
            <li>One complaint is that it does not shave as close as my cheap AA battery powered shaver I bought for ten dollars.</li>
            <li>I had owned a previous wet and dry shaver from Panasonic for many years until it finally gave out.  </li>
            <li>A standard Gillette Mach 3/4/5/6/726 whatever works better, is cheaper, blades cost less, and can be used dry or wet without a recharge.</li>
            <li>Shaving is much quicker because there are few do overs and it does not irritate sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this model to replace my old Panasonic Linear which had finally come to the end of it&#x27;s life, to which I thought I would be getting one equal to what I was used to.</li>
            <li>My only complaints about the old razor were the noise, and that I did have to make multiple passes around the neck / Adams&#x27; apple to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li>(so far, only 5 days, daily shave).&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>My second Panasonic as the battery was starting to go on the old one.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this shaver for my 92 year old father as a Christmas present last year.  </li>
            <li>But, if I go longer than a few days, it takes longer to shave with the ES8103S than with a razor and cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still using this item after about 3 months or so, the battery has held up well so far, and the foil does not seem very warn.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 31 year old Asian male.</li>
            <li>I expected the foil and blades to last much longer than this.  </li>
            <li>One negative is that the battery discharges too quick after a complete head &amp; facial cut.</li>
            <li>and I get very close to the same smoothness I received before MINUS</li>
            <li>Then I started to notice in the second week that I could go over the same spot and miss hair repeatedly and not getting nearly as close of a shave anymore</li>
            <li>Looking back, I realize I don&#x27;t really need the wet shave feature.  </li>
            <li>I finally bought some replacement parts for my old Norelco, and am back to using that now.</li>
            <li>It costs about the same as changing the parts in my old shaver and works about the same.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised that you cannot shave with this plugged in, can only use when unplugged, that&#x27;s not a big deal for me though.</li>
            <li>Precision is also average, not comparable with a true wet shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The two minor cons: You can&#x27;t use the shaver while it&#x27;s charging, and it is shipped with an empty battery, so you have to wait a bit for first use.</li>
            <li>Perhaps this particular model is rough on the face.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a replacement for a rotary electric that was OK, but not great (the battery on that one finally died).</li>
            <li>It is a good as my old Braun and the replacement parts (blades/foils) are less expensive</li>
            <li>He usually uses razors and because of that, it didn&#x27;t give him a super close shave the first few times.</li>
            <li>Shaving surface gets just warm enough at times to be slightly uncomfortable    </li>
            <li>The biggest problem is this shaver does not get most of your stubble and leaves a lot behind even after numerous passes.  </li>
            <li>The battery lasts through a weeks worth of shaves and charges on only a few hours.</li>
            <li>More like couple times/week, the other times I shave with a blade, but I really only shave a couple times week in general since I work from home and am lazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t really tested it using wet, just seems odd to me, since my Braun couldn&#x27;t get wet.  </li>
            <li>I found the Norelco shaving head somewhat difficult to remove whereas the Panasonic foil was very easy to remove/</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast, extremely comfortable, and plowed through my very tough beard painlessly (both figuratively and literally).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He has used Norelco brands in the past, but says this Panasonic is hands down better.  </li>
            <li>I wish that Panasonic had repair centers in major cities so that you could possible get it repaired quicker and avoid the expense of sending it out of state.</li>
            <li>No other calls, email, or follow-up was necessary on my part.</li>
            <li>I used my first one for a little under two years, shaving in the shower almost every day.</li>
            <li>the first time or two my skin had to get a little used to it</li>
            <li>I start by running a little hot water over the foil while the shaver is running.  </li>
            <li>It is not sharp enough.</li>
            <li>I just put a little soap on the foil, switch it to turbo mode while it&#x27;s under hot water, let it run</li>
            <li>I was told I might have a little razor burn at first, but it never happened.  </li>
            <li>A little liquid shower soap on the foil, run it under a hot faucet after removing the foil/cover, done.</li>
            <li>Ironically, my first Panasonic, a little battery powered travel unit purchased in 1990 blew my socks off..........</li>
            <li>When I was using a safety razor, it would take upwards of 30-40 minutes to shave because of the 3-4 passes + touchups I needed to get close, and the extra slowness I took to minimize irritation.&lt;br /&gt;-Three, the pop-out trimmer is relatively weak compared to my old cheap Panasonic, so I still use that to trim my sideburns every once in awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have major problems the next day.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it leaves less rash then a high end</li>
            <li>/&gt;Electric shavers are larger than disposable shavers, so you will need to prepare for that (the first time you try one is like the difference between trying to manicure your bikini line with hand held disposable shaver or something the size of a small blow-dryer (awkward)...) :P</li>
            <li>but it takes just as long to get a good shave as it did with my previous Panasonic which ran at less than half the price  </li>
            <li>(@$68), Consumer Reports rated them high too,  plus allegedly you can take one to an authorized Panasonic repair shop and have them replace the battery.</li>
            <li>As much as I have come to appreciate this particular razor, it appears that the small digital LCD-info display has given up the ghost; that is to say that the display has become unreadable and therefore unusable after just nine months of service.</li>
            <li>It would be fine for someone with a thin soft growth... like an adolescent just starting out.  </li>
            <li>The one issue I have is if not used at least once or twice a week, it can cause irritation and in-grown hairs, as it did when your first getting adjusted to the new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>Loved the braun 6520 (which is now obsolete) but was somewhat disappointed in their new 7 series model when I bought it a year ago.</li>
            <li>First it charges in less than an hour, second</li>
            <li>I originally wanted this due to hearing that electric razors irritate less than cartridge razors.</li>
            <li>It looks close enough at first, but my shadow grows in (visibly and to the touch) about half a day sooner than the es8243a.</li>
            <li>I noticed that there was absolutely no drag or irritation, but it did make my skin very flaky and slightly bumpy</li>
            <li>Was not sure how well my skin would react to having an electric shaver, but for my relatively sparse facial hair, it actually does better than a standard razor which I had been using for a very long time.  </li>
            <li>Electric razors in general require daily use over a blade which might let you skip a day depending on your beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had several other electric razors none of which I found very satisfactory.  </li>
            <li>It is not totally silent but much quiter than other brands.   </li>
            <li>All other shavers in my life made my face red and then after shave really burned.</li>
            <li>The battery goes longer between charges than the other razors, and I like the indicator telling you how much battery is still left.  </li>
            <li>However, if I don&#x27;t shave with it at least every other day it is more hassle than a razor with shaving cream.</li>
            <li>One more thing - other reviewers have complained that the razor won&#x27;t work while charging.  </li>
            <li>It provides a much smoother glide over my face and does not draw at the skin as much as other multi-head foil shavers I have tried recently.  </li>
            <li>I want in an electric razor and the price was much lower than other models that basically did the same thing.</li>
            <li>It took no where near as long as a safety razor shave.</li>
            <li>The shave is not nearly as close as the 45 year old Norelco.  </li>
            <li>my next barely looks like I touched it with the shaver.  </li>
            <li>That being said, there must be something odd with my facial hair as I still have to follow up with a quick dry shave with my razor for touch</li>
            <li>and it goes so long that it doesn&#x27;t need frequent charging.&lt;br</li>
            <li>People say the battery lasts a long time but I completely disagree.  </li>
            <li>It also seems to take a really long time to get a complete shave.</li>
            <li>After a few years I traded up for a Braun, which was my first foil shaver.</li>
            <li>My first shave with it after a year with a safety razor is just as close after going over my skin a few times.</li>
            <li>For women who are first transitioning to an electric shaver, remember that it will take a few weeks for your skin to adjust before you start getting close shaves.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now, it gets pretty close to the skin</li>
            <li>Purchased this for myself to replace my normal razor and shaving cream in order to save money, however, the product did not work as I had expected it to.  </li>
            <li>However, after a few months does not give the razor blade-close shave that it did at first.</li>
            <li>For those occasions when I have a few days growth, I like to &#x27;pre-shave&#x27; by running the trimmer across my neck and face first to remove the longer hairs before using the shaver head.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried foil shavers in the past and was sorely disappointed - this razor is by far the best razor I&#x27;ve used...ever.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely loved that shaver, it worked like a charm for over 6 years with only 1 blade change, sadly though the battery would no longer hold a charge long enough for an entire face.</li>
            <li>Yes, the first time I tried with shaving cream, it was quite messy.  </li>
            <li>I tired many different razors, blades, shave soaps, and post-shave products, but the results were the same.</li>
            <li>That didn&#x27;t seem like a problem at first except if I missed a few hairs one day</li>
            <li>The sideburn trimmer is somewhat useless but other than that the razor itself works good.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product, and will never go back to the other major brands.</li>
            <li>I was a little surprised with how high the hum of the motor is</li>
            <li>the shaver does ok, small size I like gets into tight spots,</li>
            <li>This simple and rather old tech gives you a shave that for an average growth person such as myself, will still look decent going out after a day at the office.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic cuts easily through tough stubble.</li>
            <li>I expected a transition period going from a rotary shaver to this one, but still have trouble getting a clean shave.</li>
            <li>Something else worth mentioning: I find I it takes much less time to complete my shave these days - again, this is likely due to the high-speed motor.</li>
            <li>If you have very thick strong beard hair</li>
            <li>comparison, the Norelco was whisper quiet, the battery live was 10 times longer despite the fact that with the longer stubble it took the Norelco twice as long to deliver the same shave as the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>Likewise we have extenuating issues with the skin on many of our faces due to our hair being tough yet our skin being soft causing ingrown hairs &amp; razor</li>
            <li>The battery last only about half of the Norelco,but I think it is because of the higher motor speed.</li>
            <li>As such, I would often be a bit sweaty, after taking a hot shower and drying off in a bathroom with little ventilation.  </li>
            <li>all of my shaves, my stubble still appears to be a little dark, even though it is smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li>The Norelco razors always gave a decent shave, but this Panasonic comes extremely close to the results obtainable with a blade.</li>
            <li>Other cons include the lack of maneuverability, particularly in the case of the trimmer, and the faulty LCD display.)</li>
            <li>It was finally time to replace my 10-year old Norelco razor with rotating heads, and I decided to try a foil razor for the first time since I&#x27;ve had my \\&quot;grown-man\\&quot; beard (my first electric was a foil, but I merely had peach fuzz).  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve noticed that, in my case at least, wet shaving yields slightly better results, particularly in the way of less missed hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you hate wasting your money and want to have a good shaver that will last a reasonable amount of time, then buy a different brand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It wasn&#x27;t a particulary close shave (and resulted in terrible burn afterwards), but I&#x27;ve never had much luck with razors (I irritate very easily), so it was pretty much my only affordable (less than $90) option, &#x27;till I found this lovely little piece of technology</li>
            <li>The shaver is not very good, I have to go over the same areas multiple times and still have to use a regular razor to clean up and get a close shave</li>
            <li>I first tried it dry like any other electric razor I have used.  </li>
            <li>If I had to change, I wanted a shaver that was easy to use every day, worked well for tough, thick whiskers, charged quickly and had a pop-up trimmer.    </li>
            <li>Never having owned an electric razor before, I heeded the advice of many others plus the manufacturer to give my skin at least three weeks to adjust due to the different type of shaving.  </li>
            <li>know this review will get many negative voices, but this is my personal opinion, not biased by discounts, trade-ins and other goodies people get for &amp;#34;proper&amp;#34; review.</li>
            <li>also highly suspect that wet shaving will keep the blades from dulling as fast as they would when dry shaving, being that wet hair is easier for the blades to cut through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It went back, I&#x27;m trying the braun wet and dry next, but the head on that looks pretty soft, delicate, ultra tiny soft and gentle holes in the foil as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The new ES8103S has been used almost exclusively as a wet razor with Edge foam.</li>
            <li>New to wet shaving</li>
            <li>I think it tells you when to clean or and other prompts on the little display as well.</li>
            <li>After the shave they will dry further and shrink into their pores.&lt;br /&gt;Never, never use pre-shave powder, it may make the shave feel more comfortable, but it will soon grind the sharp cutting edges round.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li>It shaves the face and neck clean, don&#x27;t worry but other body parts you will have to use the little shaver on the side that pops out.</li>
            <li>- it is a small in comparison to the shaving head, it is tricky to find the right angle</li>
            <li>Had high hopes for this shaver after reading other reviews.  </li>
            <li>I decided to stop using Gillette razors, due to the high price of the replaceable blades and use an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I had an old Braun foil shaver that finally wore out, and the replacement parts were half the cost of a new 3-head rotary shaver from another brand.  </li>
            <li>I use canned air to dry the thing completely-</li>
            <li>I do not like the flip up trimmer as much as the previous unit, but it works.    </li>
            <li>It shaves really close, doesn&#x27;t hurt the skin, and does the job in half the time a razor blade requires.</li>
            <li>However, I use it dry most of the time, because its less messy.</li>
            <li>and once I cleaned off my face, half of my beard was still there, and I don&#x27;t have much of a beard</li>
            <li>Plus, it took up less space on the counter and looked much nicer.</li>
            <li>Not to mention it cost about half as much and</li>
            <li>Cuts close without irritation (dry) and, if you have really sensitive skin, you can use shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I am old school and use the razor dry.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and the dry shave was a bit irratating</li>
            <li>I received the shaver really fast and took less than an hour to charge it as it was already at 50% charge.</li>
            <li>handle is too narrow, and that does not make for a comfortable grip even for average sized hands.</li>
            <li>Razor shaves usually left me with a bare, red look on my neck.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Time will tell if this model will last as long as my old model.  </li>
            <li>As mentioned before, it is a tad loud and the battery doesnt last too long.</li>
            <li>The battery in the ES8103S lasts just as long as my old ES8077, and the shaving results are similar compared to</li>
            <li>It has a digital read-out that let&#x27;s you know if the power is low, and thus, needs to be charged, which doesn&#x27;t take too long either which is also convenient, so in theory, it is a unit that should last a long time with reasonable care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hoping it will last a long time and so far I think it will.</li>
            <li>Marked at 4 because it leaves occasional long hairs.</li>
            <li>I use it on my legs and it works just as well as a normal razor, as long as you don&#x27;t go too long between shaves.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a wide range of electric shavers, from low to high dollar, but nothing in the last 5 years.</li>
            <li>Next 3 times, I cut down my beard as much as I could with scissors and tried shaving.</li>
            <li>It folds down when attempting to use it and really takes a lot of work to get it to actually cut anything.</li>
            <li>Experiment with different strokes beyond straight up and down to include circular and side-to-side motions.</li>
            <li>have found that I can get a feasibly close shave with a little effort and some patience, but this electric razor just makes the most annoying high pitched whining sound when it is on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but in 1/3 the time a very acceptable shave with very little multiple pass action.  </li>
            <li>It seems hard now days to find a good electric shaver that gives a reasonably close shave and doesn&#x27;t cost a small fortune or have a shaver head and blades that go dull after a month or two of use.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, in order to get a close shave, wet or dry, one has to shave for quite a long time, to the point where the shaving blades are very warm.</li>
            <li>Now that I have reached the 7th decade of life, really turned off with the mess of shaving cream and bladed razors</li>
            <li>So I naturally turned my back on electric shavers long ago as I figured if I couldn&#x27;t get a close enough shave with a razor</li>
            <li>but it just does not cut as close as my old Braun - charge does not seem to last as long, either - will give it another 60 days and, if there is not any perceptible improvement, then perhaps I will go back to Braun -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the trouble considering that it&#x27;s a really noisy shaver</li>
            <li>The pop out trimmer has given me consistent problems, but in the last few weeks its gotten totally unusable.  </li>
            <li>I promise you, only a razor or waxing will get you a closer shave--A funny tip, if you want to use a cream hair remover a few days before you try it such as Nair/Neet/Veet, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;m just plain getting a better shave than I have in the past.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;m just plain getting a better shave than I have in the past.</li>
            <li>As a shaverthis unit is great, but for me personally the trimmer on it is placed in too awkward of a spot to trim with because the tiny trimmer sticks out of the side which makes it very hard to see exactly what I&#x27;m trimming with</li>
            <li>Wet shaving has also made my skin much softer, which seems to prevent the shaving bumps and ingrown hairs that I would get when using an electric shaver on dry</li>
            <li>Wet shave is much nicer than the dry shaving I have been using for years.</li>
            <li>I really like the wet or dry feature.</li>
            <li>Have used only as a dry shaver so far, but that&#x27;s my routine.  </li>
            <li>I also like that it remains just as fast when the battery is low unlike the previous one i had.</li>
            <li>Works very well wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>Works very well as a dry or wet shaver.</li>
            <li>It holds a charge for days and delivers a really close shave wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>The shave is really close wet or dry.</li>
            <li>He is looking forward to trying it with shaving cream and thinks it is a real advantage that it can be used wet or dry.</li>
            <li>- Yes, it&#x27;s loud, but less loud than my Braun.  </li>
            <li>While the placement is odd, it works better than any other trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had on an electric razor (including my $200+ previous razor).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Panasonic certainly has the \\&quot;cutting edge\\&quot; with this fine shaver.</li>
            <li>Shaves right down the center of the head and leaves the sides untouched.</li>
            <li>Also, the rounded head shape itself can make it difficult if you need to shave very precisely.  </li>
            <li>What you need to be careful of is not to push too hard and make sure your skin is stretched out enough so the middle blade does not take a nip out of you.</li>
            <li>if I can&#x27;t shave fast enough to ensure that I&#x27;m doing it with a cold foil, then I shave until I feel the thing getting warm, then put it down and brush my teeth or get my clothes out,</li>
            <li>It was definitely not a good clean shave that he can achieve with a manual razor.  </li>
            <li>less so the shave is outstanding if hair is no more than 3 days long to begin.</li>
            <li>I am a black male with very stubborn facial hair.</li>
            <li>the shaver can be used wet or dry and the screen shows how much battery is left...</li>
            <li>I can report no changes necessary to my earlier review, except to say that it takes less time to fully charge than originally reported (30 minutes or less as opposed to 1 hour).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a decent portable shaver with average battery life.</li>
            <li>I used this shaver it doesn&#x27;t shave properly especially it tough to shave  underneath your chin and near neck region,though the trimmer to the side is good.</li>
            <li>the Arc 3 will help you - The bigger head really reduced shave time to my last Panasonic and it goes a week with out a charge plus being wet dry</li>
            <li>I like the pop-up trimmer but don&#x27;t use it much since I have a little Wahl beard and mustache trimmer.</li>
            <li>A little too much style over function.</li>
            <li>It has taken a little time to get used to it, but now shaving is much easier and quicker.  </li>
            <li>This razor is very good at cutting the hard to get at hairs on the neck - 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>other reviewers were writing about, I ordered it anyway since I like Panasonic shavers and needed an new one.  </li>
            <li>it was due for new blades anyhow.</li>
            <li>This time when it was due to buy new blades</li>
            <li>So far I have only used for dry shaving (saves me water &amp; soap!)</li>
            <li>I have thin, fine facial hair.</li>
            <li>older braun model that was breaking down</li>
            <li>Once I move to my face the razor is very fast, one pass usually gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>He has commented how easy it is to use, it does not tug the hair (he has thick facial hair), and it gives him a very close shave like a regular razor blade without irritating his sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It still has some trouble around the neck, but my next razor will be a Panasonic for certain.</li>
            <li>I have not tried the $200+ Brauns, but I find it hard to believe they could be worth the price premium over this shaver.</li>
            <li>I soon realized my neck was red because that entire region had been rubbed raw and my skin felt like a first degree burn the entire day.  </li>
            <li>My current blade razor is a Gillette Mach 3 and new blades for it have continued to increase in price to the point where I am not willing to purchase them.  </li>
            <li>As close as the Panasonic ES8103s shaves, neither it nor any other electric shaver will shave as close as a blade - especially some of the new, multi-blade razors.  </li>
            <li>He has very thick facial hair and this shaver gives a smooth close shave.</li>
            <li>Other than occasionally buying a new foil and blades, they seem to last forever.</li>
            <li>Usually, it takes 30 days of use to acclimate the face to a new electric shaver, but after 3 days, the skin is responding extremely well (even the neck area), as it did upon first use.</li>
            <li>My one other comment is that this unit is very loud.</li>
            <li>You put some liquid soap on the blades and hold the start button until it goes into some sort of high speed function and then the unit shuts down when it is done.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Philips tri-cyclone design actually forms a 3D pocket when laying the shaving surface on my face, unlike the Panasonic&#x27;s lateral (parallel) blade(s) movements that only make minimum contact(s) to the face, and I have to go back to the same area a few more times, or I have to pressure it hard against my face with a Panasonic unit</li>
            <li>This shaver was not all that bad - but not all that good, either.  </li>
            <li>Which is both good and bad.</li>
            <li>Too bad because it&#x27;s a really good shaver...</li>
            <li>Too bad because it&#x27;s a really good shaver...</li>
            <li>I read the good and the bad review on this product.</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s so easy to clean without the stupid self-cleaning station.</li>
            <li>This is a very lightweight and smooth cutting shaver compared to my Braun shaver.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic does not try to force you into a lot of expensive cleaning cartridges, filled with rubbing alcohol as far as my nose can tell, like the Braun people do.  </li>

            <li> Perfect.</li>
            <li> Best shaver I have ever used.</li>

            <li> Let me just start off by saying I&#x27;ve used Panasonic shavers for 20 years and have always been very happy with them, until this model.  </li>
            <li> and I was very happy with the remainder of its performance.</li>
            <li> So I researched on CR and saw that this was the best razor under a 100 dollars.</li>
            <li> Of course, Amazon had the best price.</li>

            <li> Had this razor/trimmer/whatever for over a year now, still works great!</li>
            <li> Excellent!</li>

            <li> but I am impressed.  </li>
            <li> I read excellent reviews on this</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for head shaving (my scalp hair is thicker than anyone&#x27;s beard I promise), as well as face shaving.  </li>

            <li> The ES8103 does well at this but isn&#x27;t perfect, hence the loss of one star.</li>
            <li> I invested in the Panasonic and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> but the best I found for myself is the Nivea Shaving Gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> very good product.</li>
            <li> Norelcos don&#x27;t get very good reviews, plus I wanted something with a lithium battery instead of nicad.</li>

            <li> Panasonic ES81103S Man&#x27;s 3-Blade shaver is a very good product.</li>
            <li> Any time I would use a razor, even very good razors, I would always develop razor burn.</li>
            <li> Very Good and on time.</li>

            <li> Gave this to my husband (I borrow it) and it is a very good shave.</li>
            <li> Very good.</li>
            <li> But after getting through that unpleasantness I have had a very good shaving experience with this razor.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic has been very good in every respect.</li>
            <li> It took me 30 minutes to get some stubble off my face and even then it didn&#x27;t do a very good job.</li>

            <li> very nice shaver.</li>
            <li> Hi this is the best shaver I have ever purchase excellent on everything charge quickly  and not to noise and when I shave is like shaving whit the razor blade</li>
            <li> A remarkable and greatly needed advance in electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even the trimmer works great, which was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an ok buy, i&#x27;m happy with battery life, i&#x27;ve never been impressed with electrics anyway</li>
            <li> Best of all, the shave is very smooth.</li>
            <li> The best part is that it won&#x27;t beat up your neck and give a very smooth and close shave.  </li>
            <li> simply amazing!</li>
            <li> This razor was amazing!</li>
            <li> This razor does an amazing job of cleaning up my face!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product!</li>
            <li> If you want a nice shaver and don&#x27;t want to spend a fortune this for you!</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with it too!</li>
            <li> A remarkable razor.</li>
            <li> but this gift was one of my best, even better than the tie with fishes on it</li>
            <li> This is a good electric shaver, with a great battery life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did ,the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> He is extremely pleased with it and says it is the closest and best electric shave he has ever had.  </li>
            <li> But I am impressed with Panasonic for exchanging a defective product by a better model.</li>
            <li> My wife bought me this shaver as a gift, I really am happy with my purchase of this shaver, it works great no problems what so ever and the shave is awesome, close and my skin is so smooth after using it.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> Nice!</li>
            <li> So mostly I shave the best I can with it</li>
            <li> Great Product with good battery life.</li>
            <li> Tried many and this is the best.</li>
            <li> You should be able to find the one that best fits your needs and lifestyle.</li>
            <li> Still working excellent; just ordered more blades for it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Panasonic wet/dry shavers for many years and this one seem to be the best one yet without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> Of maybe a dozen shavers over many years, this is the best yet.</li>
            <li> great shaver, good value for money.  </li>
            <li> A really nice close shave!</li>
            <li> I have tried many electric shavers, but this one is the best.</li>
            <li> The razor does a good job although I find that it doesn&#x27;t do a great job on your neck.</li>
            <li> Good electric shaver with a great price.</li>
            <li> The biggest names with the most blah blah are not always the best.</li>
            <li> It says please wait for 30 days so that your skin can adjust to shaver and it has been more than 3 months since I have been using it, and it has never ever given me a perfect</li>
            <li> NICE!</li>
            <li> This is the best of many shavers I have tried.  </li>
            <li> In many ways, this is the best shave I&#x27;ve gotten in years.</li>
            <li> Quality item works good and price was great</li>
            <li> When the latest of those broke, I followed the reviews and the lower prices and decided on this as the best</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Braun and Norelco and love this one the best over the 5 blade systems.</li>
            <li> Combine this with a nice cream - not foam - shaving product (like Cremo) and you are in business!</li>
            <li> am most impressed with the quality of shaving and my skin is so smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Every guy should own one of these!</li>
            <li> A good razor at a great price.</li>
            <li> What a great buy for anyone looking for a good shave.</li>
            <li> The BEST Electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned and after 40 years of shaving I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve found it.  </li>
            <li> This is a great razor with good features.</li>
            <li> Best, smoothest, most convenient shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s best, but I now use it more often than a blade.</li>
            <li> Love this shaver, best I have ever had.</li>
            <li> The ES8103 is a joy to shave with and is easily the best electric shaver I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Shaves great, cleans easily, and it&#x27;s awesome shaving in a steamy shower or with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> The self-cleaning feature is very nice, and it gives a good shave, but now 13 months after purchase the display that shows the percentage of charge is going out.  </li>
            <li> The Consumer Reports reviews pointed to this model as being a \\&quot;Best Buy\\&quot; and it certainly was a best buy for me.  </li>
            <li> I notice I shave more often because this is one very nice shaver!</li>
            <li> which is  very easy and get a very good shave&lt;</li>
            <li> As before, this product is a great design, well made, and comfortable to use, while delivering a superb close shave.  </li>
            <li> great, smooth, irritation-free shaves again and best of all the Remington was one-quarter the price of the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> This was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> Just a pleasant hum.</li>
            <li> My son is very satisfied and happy with it.</li>
            <li> It works very easily and is extremely effective in giving me and excellent close shave.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is excellent as well, and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easily Cleaned  Awesome Battery Life  </li>
            <li> It works perfectly and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great electric razer and price 100% satisfied!</li>
            <li> Works great, I love it!</li>
            <li> Best of all, my skin feels fine during and after shaving.</li>
            <li> We are also not geting the premium products that are very good but are quite more costly.</li>
            <li> This is a very good shaver with many good features.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great razor and a great buy. :-)</li>
            <li> While I am happy with the fact that my husband is happy for the most part...</li>
            <li> After a fair amount of research it appears to be one of the best values available.</li>
            <li> This shaver offers the best value of Panasonic&#x27;s excellent line of shavers.</li>
            <li> - I shave my head bald and and from my experience - it&#x27;s great for face, but NOT so great for top of head / skull.</li>
            <li> Nice convenient, but i sure hope this is NOT the best.</li>
            <li> This razor is good.</li>
            <li> and you are good</li>
            <li> I can get a good, close shave without a lot of effort.</li>
            <li> Good Machine.  </li>
            <li> .this shaver gives me a good shave,so</li>
            <li> good news</li>
            <li> Good buy for the $$$</li>
            <li> The ergonomics are good.</li>
            <li> in ultrasonic self-cleaning feature, seems like a good idea, have to wait and see with time</li>
            <li> The shaver is good</li>
            <li> Price is fair and Braun is now a bit over priced.    </li>
            <li> I settled on Panasonic, and got a good deal on newegg for the ES8103S.  </li>
            <li> , so I feel good about this.    </li>
            <li> I ended up returning it after giving it 3 good weeks of use</li>
            <li> Surprisingly close shave for an electric razor.</li>
            <li> Always good knowing if your shaver is about to die.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Their numbers are based off a 2-3 minute shave, but I don&#x27;t know any guy who can get a good shave with an electric in 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> If not for the recharging thing, I would give it 4 stars because the shave is still good.</li>
            <li> I can give two good reasons</li>
            <li> Works good even if I skip a day or two.</li>
            <li> The battery life on it is really good</li>
            <li> The Norelco had issues with the neck and didn&#x27;t do a good job in that area.  </li>
            <li> It even did a good job around the neck (2-3 passes).</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is quite good .</li>
            <li> However, everything else about this shaver is not so good.</li>
            <li> But, I don&#x27;t know it is really good or not yet,,  by their description,, I should use it about a month to know it.  </li>
            <li> Oh God;;    Anyway,, It&#x27;s working good.</li>
            <li> Superior product with replacement blades and head when needed.</li>
            <li> Slap on some moisturizer and you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
            <li> The rotary razors did not do good in the areas under the nose.</li>
            <li> Never tried this type of head before but after some good reviews and the discounted price I thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> But if your beard is light, as is mine, this model seems perfect.</li>
            <li> By the way, for a 4 minute shave, you&#x27;ll get around 10-11 good shaves.</li>
            <li> It is not as good as it advertised.</li>
            <li> It had gotten good reviews and was on sale</li>
            <li> The battery capacity LED stopped working, then showed up, then disappeared again for good (I think).    </li>
            <li> All in all, it is a good compromise betwween a blade and an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> recommended one hundred percent, really good</li>
            <li> Timewise to get a good shave it takes longer than with Philips equipment</li>
            <li> Gives me a fairly close shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li> So this is a good deal for the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used good Braun, Remington, and Norelco shavers.</li>
            <li> If you need a shaver, the this Panasonic ES8103S is a good one.</li>
            <li> They all shave good in the beginning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s almost as good as asafty razor.</li>
            <li> It is as good as any bargain basement Norelco shaver.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic is so superior in quality, features, and performance to the Braun series 3, that the braun should not even be considdered for purchase.</li>
            <li> The price was good.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good.</li>
            <li> Good razor.  </li>
            <li> Its fairly quite.</li>
            <li> The results are about as good and close as with a razor.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s as good if not a bit closer.  </li>
            <li> I had a Panasonic shaver 10+ years ago and loved it.</li>
            <li> But ever since having switched to this Panasonic shaver, I was astounded by how good it was.  </li>
            <li> Good shaver for the $$</li>
            <li> I need a good shaver that just plugs into the wall, and this is it.  </li>
            <li> ...how good feels.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s good to go.  </li>
            <li> replacement for aging Panasonic shaver--such a good shaver got another one.</li>
            <li> Great shave, nice feel.</li>
            <li> Battery life is good, a couple weeks.  </li>
            <li> Good shaver.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works fairly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get about four to five good shaves, all in the shower.</li>
            <li> i bought this based on the ratings and caught it during a good price.  </li>
            <li> husband loved the shaver.</li>
            <li> It is noisier than the 7103, but the blade system is superior.</li>
            <li> A lot of what determines how good shave is, is...</li>
            <li> I have now owned this shaver for one month and am delighted with it.</li>
            <li> but the reviews and price of this panasonic were just too good, so I took the plunge.  </li>
            <li> : Good Quality of Shave.</li>
            <li> I didnt think it did a good job</li>
            <li> The price was good and delivery was ahead of schedule.  </li>
            <li> I have been shaveing with a norelco shaver for 35 years and loved them</li>
            <li> The shaver itself does not cause any irritation to my skin while giving a good shave</li>
            <li> Also the battery is good for about 8-10 shaves for me.</li>
            <li> I have never had good luck from an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> Good choice for me.</li>
            <li> Vastly superior to all of the women&#x27;s models that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I am delighted with this shaver.</li>
            <li> and I still get a good shave on my legs.</li>
            <li> The shaver works good</li>
            <li> Good choice.</li>
            <li> Razor feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li> Battery is Good.</li>
            <li> Best feature of this shaver is the close, pain-free, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> the shaver works good</li>
            <li> Battery life is good between charges.  </li>
            <li> I had the Braun for over 10 years and loved it.  </li>
            <li> I came across the Panasonic and while I&#x27;d always heard good things I&#x27;d never used one.  </li>
            <li> It is superior to the Braun in almost every respect.  </li>
            <li> So I got this shaver on a recomendation of a good friend.</li>
            <li> But it works good for me...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a really good on the face.</li>
            <li> It is really good.</li>
            <li> The   GOOD POINTS:</li>
            <li> It gives a good shave.</li>
            <li> rest of the features are good.</li>
            <li> I hope it continues to give this good a level of service to me.    </li>
            <li> They were good, but the shave wasn&#x27;t as close.</li>
            <li> It gives as good a shave as the Remington/Braun/Norelco razors I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t so good</li>
            <li> and it had all the essentials without a bunch of gimmicks you don&#x27;t need to get a good shave.  </li>
            <li> Good Shaver.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was good but the battery was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Read good reviews (consumer reports) on this one and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Since I was going to be without a good shaver for awhile, I bought the Philips Norelco 8240XL.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had good luck with Panasonic equipment, and the price/performance of this item has been no exception.  </li>
            <li> My face is smooth as can be and I am very happy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite as good on the neck (front), but you have to rub to feel the difference because you can&#x27;t see it.    </li>
            <li> Hey gals for those of you looking to find a good shaver for your legs and underarms, this is it.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;It works good</li>
            <li> BUT IS GOOD</li>
            <li> After about two weeks of searching the internet, I settled on the Panasonic ES8103S as a good comprimise between price and performance.  </li>
            <li> This shaver provides a good shave.  </li>
            <li> I found this one on sale and the reviews were good.</li>
            <li> does a good job lubricating.</li>
            <li> good display&lt;</li>
            <li> Price, performance, and everyone is satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Asians on my face shows a good performance.&lt;br /&gt;Want</li>
            <li> Surprisingly good razor for the price.</li>
            <li> For me it gives a good shave and battery life</li>
            <li> With this electric shaver, it took me 3 times longer to get a shave that was one-third as good as a disposable razor.</li>
            <li> He is delighted with it.</li>
            <li> A co-worker had a Panasonic and loved it, so I tried this one</li>
            <li> This is a good electric razor.</li>
            <li> Once you get used to this it is all good.</li>
            <li> not as good as razor but works.  </li>
            <li> It feels good in my hand...</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re mistaken, as it will drip water for hours even after a good drying.  </li>
            <li> The best part is that by 2pm my face still feels smooth, which couldn&#x27;t be said of the ES8103.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> I bought another one just like it because it&#x27;s just that good</li>
            <li> The product works fairly well.</li>
            <li> On the downside, the battery life isn&#x27;t as good as the rotary models I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> I get a good shave.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;i bought this  at a good price..</li>
            <li> I suppose that&#x27;s a good amount of usage though.</li>
            <li> Panasonic used to be good</li>
            <li> All good but the battery life.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how good an electric razor could be until I tried this.  </li>
            <li> This is a good razor that has served me well now for 2 years.</li>
            <li> I get a good shave with the Panasonic, the skin in not irritated, and it all works.</li>
            <li> the good</li>
            <li> Light,easy to hold and good shave.</li>
            <li> good price during promotion.</li>
            <li> read complaints about the trimmer not being a good trimmer</li>
            <li> So keep up the good work Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Good battery life.</li>
            <li> The price was good on it.</li>
            <li> Good razor.</li>
            <li> the time and check the battery good for me</li>
            <li> but for a beard it is not as good for edging.  </li>
            <li> Really good for shaving in the morning.</li>
            <li> So good, I bought 2.</li>
            <li> I had a braun for year and and loved it but have had problems getting the correct head this shaver dose just as good as the braun and at 1/3 the price</li>
            <li> It fits perfectly in my hand &amp; glides smoothly to my face contour &amp; lightweight.</li>
            <li> A fair price for the product</li>
            <li> good controlled shaving.</li>
            <li> Good for the face.  </li>
            <li> Not so good for the neck.  </li>
            <li> this is a good shaver，recommend</li>
            <li> The size is good and the charger works well.</li>
            <li> I give it a good cleaning and replace the blades</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s good as new.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good deal for the money.</li>
            <li> It is a really good.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; shave doesn&#x27;t work as good as I would have hoped but that may just be the shaving cream that I am using.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a couple months, and it works just as good as a blade.  </li>
            <li> and i thought it was a good one.</li>
            <li> Good item, Thank you.</li>
            <li> the battery lasts a good length of time..</li>
            <li> I gave this a fair shot.</li>
            <li> I ended up returning it just because it does not give a good shave.</li>
            <li> Things started out good, but then it was all downhill.    </li>
            <li> All in all a good electric razor that I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I used to use a Norelco and switched to this based on the good reviews and price.  </li>
            <li> Good for my skin</li>
            <li> Is not as good when shaving corners and Adam&#x27;s apple.</li>
            <li> Not as good if your bear is longer that 3 days.    </li>
            <li> Conclusion: Still a good product</li>
            <li> You may want to shave often if you want to have a good shaving experience.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to minimize time for shaving   Panasonic is a good brand too   </li>
            <li> This is \\&quot;good enough.\\</li>
            <li> Good use.</li>
            <li> Good price. . .</li>
            <li> It was a fair shaver</li>
            <li> this one is really nice and the price is great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is as shown in the description, I loved it and fulfilled my expectations.</li>
            <li> Good razor</li>
            <li> &amp; I still get 6 to 8 good shaves from it, so</li>
            <li> The electric is still superior to the cartridges in that I haven&#x27;t had the cuts and ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> This is a good product.</li>
            <li> It is affordable and is a good deal for the $80.</li>
            <li> I wanted a Panasonic Shaver because I have had good luck with Panasonic products.</li>
            <li> Feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t feel as good in my hand</li>
            <li> The Panasonic works good</li>
            <li> He loved this Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> It does a good job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery life seems good, will try to update in another year.</li>
            <li> It works so good</li>
            <li> This razor provides an excellent and  surprisingly comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had good service from Panasonic products before</li>
            <li> I purchased it seeing all the reviews on the amazon and saying it was a cheaper option for a good shaver, but it ruined all my expectations.</li>
            <li> but after reading good review I go for it</li>
            <li> Good shaver for the money.</li>
            <li> Battery life is good, design is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Good purchase</li>
            <li> Its not as good as a shaving blade, but thats a given.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be sold for good.</li>
            <li> I suppose it would be good for someone with a heavier beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this was WAY too good not to give credit.</li>
            <li> This shaver is of good value at sale price.  </li>
            <li> He loved it.</li>
            <li> The shave isn&#x27;t as good as a razor, but it&#x27;s darn close.  </li>
            <li> FELT GOOD</li>
            <li> then I decided to lather up with some good ol barbasol.</li>
            <li> The choice was a good one and exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> The batterie life is good for now, 5 days with one charge.</li>
            <li> And of course I like the fact that it&#x27;s a wet/dry shaver, which makes it good</li>
            <li> I had to find a shaver good for a senior gentleman  </li>
            <li> This is a good product.</li>
            <li> and this does a good job of mowing my face.</li>
            <li> Not now, I get as good as a shave with the Panasonic ES-LA93-K shaver as I do when using a razor and no nicks.</li>
            <li> Worked good.</li>
            <li> So I decided to look for a good electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have to honestly say it worked great.</li>
            <li> As others have reviewed - and the reason I bought it - it gives a good close shave.</li>
            <li> I have tried using a shaving cream and it works well, but shaving cream is not needed to get a good close</li>
            <li> in all, it does a fairly good job.  </li>
            <li> It still works good, but the cord wouldn&#x27;t keep a connection to the shaver</li>
            <li> i would even pay 100 its that good a shaver.</li>
            <li> popup trimmer is good</li>
            <li> Batterie life is good around 10 between charges.</li>
            <li> Feels good on the face.</li>
            <li> good:</li>
            <li> Have to go over a number of times to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> Panasonic does a good job</li>
            <li> good:</li>
            <li> good:</li>
            <li> good:</li>
            <li> good</li>
            <li> Really good price through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I loved this shaver, and for about a year it worked fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how good it is six months from now.</li>
            <li> It is a good razor for the money,I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Waterproof is a good advantage.</li>
            <li> I figured it was a good middle-range price option.</li>
            <li> The shave is good, however, after six months the battery life has degraded from 1 week of shaves to 4 days.  </li>
            <li> A good shaver is an oxymoron.</li>
            <li> Good backup as well in case</li>
            <li> This is a superior product.  </li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> The shave is close - as good as I ever got from the Gillette Fatboy, but there&#x27;s no chance of nicking myself.  </li>
            <li> THE RAZOR DOES A FAIRLY GOOD JOB  </li>
            <li> BUT IT DOESNT DO A GOOD JOB ALONG MY JAW BONE EDGES, CHIN AND NECK.  </li>
            <li> TO GET A GOOD SHAVE</li>
            <li> I can get maybe seven or eight really good shaves before the battery dies.</li>
            <li> The shaver does a good job.</li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> This razor does as good a job as any in my experience.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this shaver does a good job.</li>
            <li> Good product for the money</li>
            <li> Some reviewers here say it works good on their skull</li>
            <li> If you want a good cordless shaver for both head and face, check out the Bald Eagle by Skull Shaver here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> in all the ES8103S has turned out to be a good replacement for the ES8077.  </li>
            <li> good price~&lt;br /&gt;good</li>
            <li> For the price it is a good value.</li>
            <li> and I get results as good as a razor and blade.  </li>
            <li> That said, if I start with a couple of days of growth (say after a weekend), the razor takes some time to give good results.</li>
            <li> However there is a downside and therefore a good reason for not giving this unit a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> An all around good razor.</li>
            <li> It looks good.</li>
            <li> corded use w&#x27;d have been good.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Over all good one</li>
            <li> This one got good reviews</li>
            <li> have loved everyone of mine.</li>
            <li> My husband has always had another type of electric shaver but the power reviews on this one were so good</li>
            <li> then that its good has a wall charger cord plus on the razor</li>
            <li> Even with a good shave, when I would run my hand against the grain, I could feel the stubble.</li>
            <li> Excellent and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Good battery life.</li>
            <li> It looks nice, works great, and I&#x27;ve had it for a while and still haven&#x27;t had to recharge the battery.</li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> Battery life is good and it charges in an hour.  </li>
            <li> he gets a good shave.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews in Consumer Reports and they mentioned this is a good buy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> With the razor/gel combo my shaves are as good as a blade.  </li>
            <li> but if you catch it on a good sale I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy it</li>
            <li> He said he absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> If you want a good shave this is not the razor for</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see what I&#x27;m cutting....not good.  </li>
            <li> I bought this shaver because I read a review from someone who said it was a good head shaver.  </li>
            <li> They do a good job of shaving close to the skin.</li>
            <li> the money, it&#x27;s a good razor.  </li>
            <li> I read a review saying this shaver was best for those with light or medium stubble.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been amazed at what a good shave it gives.</li>
            <li> I used another shaver years ago and it did not do as a good job as this one.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> I was of a mind to downgrade to 4-star because the power monitor drops about 10% for each shave, implying that it is good for 10 shaves, so you must pack a charger for a two-week trip.</li>
            <li> I noticed that fairly soon after purchasing it.</li>
            <li> good luck using the trimmer on them.</li>
            <li> It has been a good switch, he hasn&#x27;t had any skin problem.</li>
            <li> My son bought one of these and loved it.  </li>
            <li> The Arc3 is a good size and has good features, including a sideburn trimmer, so I can get rid of another battery-operated device on my bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- hold a good charge</li>
            <li> The battery charges in an hour and holds a good charge for a while.</li>
            <li> and you tend to need a variety of tools to get a good result.</li>
            <li> IMO, shave from rotary is superior.</li>
            <li> it is good for me&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> it is good.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t understand this had a good reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the 3,4,and 5 blade disposables for yr&#x27;s and the Panasonic is just as good..</li>
            <li> I am done with plastic razors for good.</li>
            <li> good quality&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a lot of electric razors (Norelco, Braun), and this is as good as any of them.  </li>
            <li> Really good shaver.</li>
            <li> Battery life is good and the cleaning is no problem.  </li>
            <li> but at 1/4 the cost this Panasonic is a fantastic alternative and excellent</li>
            <li> Good work Panasonic</li>
            <li> Not as good as the Norelco.</li>
            <li> it did good on face .&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> good gift for my friends.</li>
            <li> Delighted with shave...</li>
            <li> Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> It looks and works good.</li>
            <li> Let me say, it was a good feeling after using it.</li>
            <li> And it is just as good in the shower as it is driving to work or standing at the mirror in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I had a Norelco before and it didn&#x27;t do as good of a job.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think electric shavers gave as good a shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good reghargeable electric shaver for some time.</li>
            <li> and I did not even go the amount of time they suggest to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> Loved this , shaved like a razor.  </li>
            <li> thing feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li> do not need to shave a good product</li>
            <li> and he&#x27;s all good now.</li>
            <li> Gave me a good shave each time.</li>
            <li> It is a good product for its price .</li>
            <li> both good results.  </li>
            <li> I cannot understand all the good reviews, unless some of these are good and some are not.</li>
            <li> Good grip.</li>
            <li> But what good is that if it doesn&#x27;t shave the beard.</li>
            <li> but the results are not so good.  </li>
            <li> I believe it is a good deal.</li>
            <li> and he loved it.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome shaver, feels so smooth on my face.  </li>
            <li> Good battery</li>
            <li> good Shaver</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product over the 30 days requested, and I&#x27;m not blown away, but it does a good job.</li>
            <li> Maybe it isn&#x27;t fair to compare.</li>
            <li> All in all still a good product.</li>
            <li> and then not so good.  </li>
            <li> Good unit, not recommended as a gift for someone you share a bathroom with.</li>
            <li> I bought a Merkur handle, feather blades, proraso shave soap, and I even put oil on my face before the soap, basically I had all the equipment I needed to provide me a supposedly superior</li>
            <li> and it was good to go.</li>
            <li> All in all, a good product.</li>
            <li> Good shave every time.</li>
            <li> Good,</li>
            <li> Good price.  </li>

            <li> This is good razor that delivers day-after-day of DFS to good quality shaves.</li>
            <li> Use it a fair amount.  </li>
            <li> My husband said that the shaver works good and gives him that close shave that he likes.</li>
            <li> i used to philips , but it is not so good</li>
            <li> purchased this shaver cause all the good reviews I read.after using for 8 or 9 weeks</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the end of the world, but it is surprising.  </li>
            <li> like I do, be prepared to check in the mirror for stragglers after a good shave...</li>
            <li> I am so impressed by the quality and styling of this product and by the smooth shave it gives me.</li>
            <li> and it says on the manual that it is good for 45 shaves.</li>
            <li> This has been a good shaver for me, a woman, for my legs and arms.</li>
            <li> A good buy..</li>
            <li> GIVES A GOOD SHAVE .</li>
            <li> This Panasonic had good reviews - but I find that is takes longer to shave than the cheaper shaver it replaced.</li>
            <li> A FAIR CHANCE</li>
            <li> Of course, this means no irritated skin, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> Good quality razor.  </li>
            <li> Loved the price</li>
            <li> to allow corded shaving, this is a must for any good shaver in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> to allow corded shaving, this is a must for any good shaver in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> think its a good product.</li>
            <li> Works Good.  </li>
            <li> wanted to shave with it for a week before I wrote my review in case something popped up issue wise that I wanted to write about.  </li>
            <li> I have used electric razors for years, but never had a razor as good as this one.  </li>
            <li> This thing holds a good charge, 8-10 shaves before needing to recharge.</li>
            <li> Good luck</li>
            <li> I hope your experience is as good as mine.</li>
            <li> Good shave -- good speed -- good product.  </li>
            <li> great item, it has nice design &amp; feel good hold it in hand.  </li>
            <li> The price is very good, very clean shave.</li>
            <li> It shaves the around the neck area perfectly and clean</li>
            <li> I clean so perfectly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works excellent in the shower - lather up, shave and clean - all in one flow.</li>
            <li> Have a special needs son, and this razor works great!!</li>
            <li> Easy wash too!!</li>
            <li> Should be easy to do through Amazon!!</li>
            <li> It did however still hold and deliver a full charge - very impressive compared to some Braun shavers I owned in the past.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with my shaver; provides an excellent shave, very comfortable to hold while shaving.  </li>
            <li> It is very good and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very good ergonomics - fits the hand well and easy to hold</li>
            <li> I purchased from Amazon, which had the best price I found, and it came quickly.</li>
            <li> Having read several reviews and finding it at Amazon for the best price, I must say this is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Exceptional.  </li>
            <li> Bought this through Amazon &#x27;best buy,\\&quot; arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> It seems to do the best job of quickly shaving my scalp as well as navigating face curves.</li>
            <li> Quick charge is great too!</li>
            <li> Not the best but quite adequate.</li>
            <li> The wet-dry aspect and optional use of shaving gel are both the best, making it super convenient.</li>
            <li> Quite possibly the best electric shaver and the best shave from one that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> and like I said - it worked perfectly for 5 years, held charge well, charged fast, shaved great for cordless electric.</li>
            <li> It shaves some better than the best Braun and trims much better.</li>
            <li> The /storage/carrying bag is a great perk and the battery holds a good charge for many shaves.  </li>
            <li> I have this as a gift for my boyfriend and he is super happy!</li>
            <li> I will say the battery is ok and the thing looks good, but it is not that great of a razor.</li>
            <li> This is the best one yet very lightweight, and gives a great shave.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this one would be as good; but it is even better!</li>
            <li> He loves it, and I am happy to see his skin is now very smooth without redness or bumps.</li>
            <li> A very nice smooth shave and works great.</li>
            <li> This is a great product--a very good shave at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I find that the best shaves are obtained with shaving cream after a hot shower: what a pleasure!</li>
            <li> This unit is light, fits well in my hand and does a very good job shaving.</li>
            <li> shave is very good and smooth.</li>
            <li> This has been a very good razor which shaves closely and comfortably.</li>
            <li> Not as close as a razor or &amp;#34;as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom&amp;#34;, but very good</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other people seem to love this razor, and I don&#x27;t doubt it&#x27;s great for them, but I just can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Out of the box I was very pleased.  </li>

            <li> I was thrilled to start using this shaver, which gives a really good shave.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> close, good recharging, nice wet/dry use.</li>
            <li> A good price for a nice shave.</li>
            <li> Good charge retention and a readout of the remaining charge which is handy.</li>
            <li> Have always gotten good honest value from Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The sculptural shape of the razor was beautiful (about the closest thing to an Apple product) and I loved the way it naturally fit in my hand.  </li>
            <li> : As I got this shaver out of the well packaged box, it felt quite good in my hand - I liked the ergonomics.  </li>
            <li> The pop up trimmer is not quite as good as the one I have now, meaning that it is not as effective at trimming my side burns and mustache.  </li>

            <li> I was initially impressed with this Panasonic ES8103S for its low price and very good reviews.</li>
            <li> This razor is by far the best, with a great shave and value at this time.</li>
            <li> After using a Norelco shaver for a number of years and thinking that it was the most comfortable shaver, I&#x27;m rather impressed at how well this Panasonic shaves.</li>
            <li> After reading all the great reviews, I wanted to love this shaver, honest</li>
            <li> This might work good on most people but it did not do good on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Excellent product and shipped very fast.  </li>
            <li> It would be better if it had a stand to put it in!</li>
            <li> I switched from Braun system to this and must say Panasonic is better than Braun these days!</li>
            <li> One of the better foil shavers out there!</li>
            <li> I love this razor!  </li>
            <li> I rated this product 4 stars rather than 5 since I am still seeking a perfect shave with no difficult to cut area issues and no skin irritation; nether shaver provides this.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best of the four electric razors that I have owned over the years, and the first with this type of head.</li>
            <li> love this shaver!</li>
            <li> and I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this razor!</li>
            <li> If you shave once in a while.. better check something else!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery life is pretty impressive.</li>
            <li> Your wife / girlfriend won&#x27;t be able to stop rubbing your face!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using the Panasonic for the first time this morning I am very impressed.  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Lots of nice features, and I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>

            <li> better out there for your money!</li>
            <li> You will love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most comfy shave I&#x27;ve ever had!  </li>
            <li> first Panasonic was a 3-blade ES8065 that still works flawlessly.</li>
            <li> It is remarkably close for most areas.</li>
            <li> Love it !</li>
            <li> And also the price is better!</li>
            <li> Fantastic !!</li>

            <li> I love this electric shaver!  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too impressed at first</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This shaver is better than some $200 shavers I&#x27;ve owned!    </li>
            <li> Better!</li>
            <li> Equally competent!</li>
            <li> but with this machine my skin is safe!</li>

            <li> Let me say, this shaver is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> Again, when disassembling for the first time I was impressed with the simplicity of the design and the ease of cleaning and reassembly.  </li>
            <li> but the experiences were somehow ok yet!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Pleased with this purchase and would suggest it to anyone else!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>

            <li> But, this one is a quantum leap better!  </li>
            <li> My favorite shaver!</li>
            <li> at first i couldn&#x60;t get the cleaning cycle to work,but it is working perfect now.</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> I was so impressed with the first one I bought six momths ago; I decided to buy another.</li>

            <li> It looks good, feels good in the hand, has good ergonomics and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experienced zero razor burn, and get a good, clean, shave.</li>
            <li> He love the 3-blades and says it&#x27;s very easy to use and the results are great...</li>

            <li> Cleanup in water however is great and easy to do.</li>
            <li> Cleans easily and shaves great.  </li>
            <li> This one is especially easy to clean (can use hand soap even).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit after reading all the positive reviews here I was almost expecting the thing to be perfect when I got it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and easily packed and just wonderful.  </li>
            <li> They are a good investment because it provides a close shave, it easy to use, keep its charge and good sleek.</li>
            <li> it took almost 2 weeks for my face to get use to, but now gives the best shave, smooth and easy.</li>

            <li> Batery life is good and razor is very comfortable to hold and shave.  </li>
            <li> This is a great price for this shaver, I received on time, and it is working just fine</li>
            <li> Also, the flip up trimmer works great for fine detail work.  </li>
            <li> this product is truly awesome, i did not expect it to be that good because of the relatively low price so it was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> This is certainly the best of the lot.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful gift, easy to use, great price and easy to put together and keep clean.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and very effective.</li>
            <li> I think that is insanely amazing for an electric razor</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this great product every day.</li>
            <li> this thing is amazing.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s now just stick with Costco with their amazing return policy.</li>
            <li> So my bottom line on this product is: great technology, horribly cheap materials.  </li>
            <li> This razor is amazing.</li>
            <li> - this shaver has never given me a real smooth shave.</li>
            <li> design is both attractive and ergonomically comfortable.</li>
            <li> I owned three Brauns&lt;br /&gt;before and liked them, however, this is an amazing value considering performance and&lt;br /&gt;build</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> It is amazing; it does everything the description said it would do.</li>
            <li> Never replaced blades, just use the integrated cleaning feature - absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li> The side burn cutter is also amazing.</li>
            <li> Shaver works great - cuts close and smooth, without any &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Amazing.  </li>
            <li> but it gives him a great smooth shave.</li>
            <li> IT IS AMAZING.</li>
            <li> He says it works great and leaves a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Amazing performance after almost 5 years.</li>
            <li> I also never had foil shaver so decided to try this Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got great deal with free shipping and</li>
            <li> Not so with this amazing shaver, hairs all over my bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> Truly amazing shaver.</li>
            <li> but after couple of times of using it I started understanding the amazing capability of this shaver.  </li>
            <li> So I was not prepared for the amazing shave I get from this Arc3 wet/dry shaver.  </li>
            <li> It is just as amazing as my headblade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 9-18-2012:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still</li>
            <li> But does not seem spectacular for face hair.</li>
            <li> This shaver provides me with the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric shaver, it glides nicely along my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> Charge % display is nice.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-I do notice that the foil gets warm towards the end of the shave, it doesn&#x27;t burn me, but I notice an increase in temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think the what you get for your money makes this a good value, and as noted, I&#x27;m buying 2 more.  </li>
            <li> I almost forgot...be sure to give this shaver a fair shake...</li>
            <li> I noticed the foil gets warm after one side of the face is done.  </li>
            <li> am thrilled to not have to buy razor refills and shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Shaves nice and close and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin.  </li>
            <li> However, he really liked the quality of the shave and wanted to stick with the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I honestly can recommend this shaver and Panasonic has won me over as they kept their word with what was advertised.</li>
            <li> The charge indicator is nice.  </li>
            <li> also this gives a nice close shave with no burn.  </li>
            <li> and I liked the self cleaning station.  </li>
            <li> Battery life is quite good although it does self-discharge at about 10%/week although this might improve as the battery is used more.</li>
            <li> This one gets in close and fits nice in the hand.</li>
            <li> I would say that I am pleased with this product and if the longevity is good I will buy another when the time comes.</li>
            <li> This is a nice shaver.  </li>
            <li> I now own two, one for the home and one for the car.</li>
            <li> It would have been nice if it came with a cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> The reviews pointed to the Panasonic ES8103S as a good bet, so I gave it a try -- and  I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> This is an okay razor, but not as good as I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
            <li> The charge indicator and alerts for cleaning and recharging are nice features.  </li>
            <li> When using it, I can tell that the blades are giving off some heat, as it is warm on my face.</li>
            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Speaking of travel shavers, I also own a Panasonic ES3833 wet/dry, battery-operated travel shaver.</li>
            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> Speaking of travel shavers, I also own a Panasonic ES3833 wet/dry, battery-operated travel shaver.</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;ll need to be handy with a soldering iron.  </li>
            <li> -- Again, maybe an issue with all foil shavers, but I have found that instead of catching the shaved off whiskers they are ending up all over the counter and my shirt.  </li>
            <li> -- Again, maybe an issue with all foil shavers, but I have found that instead of catching the shaved off whiskers they are ending up all over the counter and my shirt.  </li>
            <li> Having used electrical shavers my whole life I have to say this is the best one I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> It was quieter than the others and much faster and best of all</li>
            <li> A fairly close shave with a trimmer that is okay.  </li>
            <li> After my Panasonic was lost (to put it nicely) from my travel bag, I decided to get a Braun shaver.  </li>
            <li> Product was just as described..very nice.</li>
            <li> nice shave..</li>
            <li> I have also recommended this system to a friend who also is loving the results.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s about as nice as a compliment as I can give it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best shave ever gotten from an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> I told my buddy he could use my razor, but that if he liked it, he&#x27;d have to date his own.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll have him shave me with my own razor.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is well placed to handle sideburns and works nicely for shaping beards if that&#x27;s what you want.</li>
            <li> It has a nice battery, When it is charged to %100</li>
            <li> nice item for man</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with its good quality.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have to be honest.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to have to keep cortisone cream handy for shaving</li>
            <li> Also, the Braun will not move over your skin if it is oily or micro-moist from a warm bathroom, even with shaving powder.</li>
            <li> Good price and so far very happy with results.</li>
            <li> The battery &#x27;countdown&#x27; on the display is nice, not just a warning that you&#x27;ve run out.  </li>
            <li> I have learned that each razor has its own characteristics.</li>
            <li> Really a nice razor, quite too.</li>
            <li> Really, really, really like this shaver: great on my legs!</li>
            <li> nice to use in the shower</li>
            <li> That comes in really handy.</li>
            <li> Make sure you hold onto your receipt, there&#x27;s a good chance you may need it.</li>
            <li> The product was really convenient to use and gives awesome experience.</li>
            <li> Nice, close shave.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> it as good or better as my braun 5-series shaver it replaced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve own Braun shavers for years.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor after much searching and I must say I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
            <li> It charges fully in about 1 hour, providing 7-8 shaves, and the charge display (at 10% increments) is a nice feature to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , moving head is nice although I don&#x27;t use that function.</li>
            <li> Now that&#x27;s good value :)</li>
            <li> -Looks nice...</li>
            <li> I used to own Panasonic ES8066 and still own it.</li>
            <li> He is just thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li> Nice balance, close shave.</li>
            <li> The shaver itself handles very well and does give a great shave!</li>
            <li> Nice close shave.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really need all the bells and whistles so this one is perfect.</li>
            <li> The battery level indicator is a really nice feature and takes the guesswork out of knowing when it&#x27;s time for a recharge.</li>
            <li> even better, but for me I am completely satisfied and see no need to improve upon what I consider to be a great razor.</li>
            <li> The trimmer accessory is awesome and the shaver is smooth and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Prompts on display for charging and cleaning are nice.</li>
            <li> Nice shape, fits hand well.</li>
            <li> Gets quite warm while in use.   </li>
            <li> This shaver is really nice.  </li>
            <li> Nice and close shaves.</li>
            <li> I get results that are as good as or better than any streight razor I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> It might come in handy for when shaving with a blade isn&#x27;t an option.  </li>
            <li> My dad ordered this one and really liked it.</li>
            <li> Its kind of compact, really great to hold and comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> but it does a really nice job</li>
            <li> This updated model has a floating head which is nice</li>
            <li> I owned a Braun many years ago and loved it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> So my experience is keep a razor handy if you do not plan on shaving every day.</li>
            <li> but the shaver part is awesome and works very well.</li>
            <li> It does a nice close shave and it does catch the longer hairs also.</li>
            <li> I own a separate trimmer.</li>
            <li> bought this one per the good reviews and the razor is probably ok, but I was expecting more,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Now that he&#x27;s getting used to the shaver, he&#x27;s getting a really nice close shave.</li>
            <li> This may be the quickest charging model I own.  </li>
            <li> I get a really nice, close shave with it.</li>
            <li> Still not as good as a blade, but does the job and is much more convenient.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It would be nice if you could lock the shaver in the &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; position.</li>
            <li> some kind of power off lock would be nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice close shave.  </li>
            <li> Husband liked the shave</li>
            <li> I guess you have to spend more than this to get a good electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Couple of times I did, I got &#x27;missed a spot&#x27; kind of comments.</li>
            <li> Nice design.(shape)&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s good for about 3 years, after that the batteries won&#x27;t hold a charge for more than one or two shaves.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t ever get another kind.</li>
            <li> the downside, the grip isn&#x27;t quite as nice.</li>
            <li> but does an excellent job of providing a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Thrilled with the quality of the shave using this model</li>
            <li> Have used top of the line Braun and this shaver shaves just as good.</li>
            <li> The high-speed cleaning feature is a nice addition.</li>
            <li> Do your own research.</li>
            <li> Just like many have found out, this is a really good shaver.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;linear\\&quot; feature on their higher-end models is excellent, moving the blade so fast that the the beard seems to evaporate.</li>
            <li> Ive always had Rotary Norelcos and wanted to try a diff kind.</li>
            <li> Effective:</li>
            <li> : readout of charge remaining is nice; blinking \\&quot;charge me\\&quot; icon is convenient  </li>
            <li> Nice to have it be waterproof, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am glad I made a good choice.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works nicely.</li>
            <li> Just get the WES 9013PC replacement kit on its own.  </li>
            <li> Well, it would be nice if it were muted a bit.  </li>
            <li> and it does the job nicely in both conditions.</li>
            <li> And the clipper also works nicely.</li>
            <li> Excellent item thanks..</li>
            <li> Excellent, close shave &amp; very well built.</li>
            <li> I use this for shaving my head, and it provides a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> The Shaver Saver is nice to use in between shaves as maintenance.</li>
            <li> The nice thing is I notice no drop off in power from 100% charged to the 40%.  </li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> I really liked this razor.</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower, which is really nice to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> It gets nice and close on edges.&lt;br /&gt;*Overall</li>
            <li> It gets nice and close on edges.&lt;br /&gt;*Overall</li>
            <li> This is the best wet/dry shaver that I have found and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I do rinse it in the sink when I&#x27;m done and have noticed that it has a nice &#x27;stench&#x27; afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Pivots and flexes nicely.</li>
            <li> It has a nice weight to it.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t be cost effective to return it to Amazon even though I could.</li>
            <li> Nice shaver for the money,</li>
            <li> Does a nice  conferrtable shave.</li>
            <li> I still use skin balm after shaving, but now I do it to smell nice.  </li>
            <li> I have always used Braun and bottom line is they really are the best.</li>
            <li> liked it a lot</li>
            <li> The reviews tell a good story, the overwhelming majority of people give this one 4 or 5 stars because that makes sense.</li>
            <li> I liked the reviews on this product and have never owned an electric razor before.</li>
            <li> Having used Braun shavers for many years, I was looking for a good shaver with a lithium-ion battery</li>
            <li> Nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li> Nice job.</li>
            <li> Wet/dry is handy feature, as is the cleaning method.</li>
            <li> He liked this one</li>
            <li> Nice close shave.  </li>
            <li> ONE.VERY NICE.</li>
            <li> This provides a nice, close shave.</li>
            <li> It is a wet/dry razor, which is nice if you like to change it up once in a while.</li>
            <li> well, kind of forgot about it for awhile.</li>
            <li> He liked that it also had a beard trimmer since he has a goatee.</li>
            <li> Time&#x27;s up, you own it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> So nice to not have to go through the morning ritual with blades and shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I honestly regret not replacing that piece of trash a year go and at 70.00 this razor is a steal.</li>
            <li> BTW its nice to just wash it after every shave there</li>
            <li> the grip is nicely made and the head can be locked so it doesn&#x27;t move or unlocked...</li>
            <li> works ok, not so good on neck.  </li>
            <li> Percent charge remaining is nice as is the sonic setting used for cleaning.  </li>
            <li> It provides a nice close shave with no skin rash, etc.  </li>
            <li> the most i&#x27;ve ever paid for one and the battery life is good for about 10 shaves (1 per day)</li>
            <li> gives a nice close shave and a trimer</li>
            <li> Nice product.  </li>
            <li> This one is the absolute best!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I reget the purchase because it works well, charges fast and has stuck with me for a while, but it&#x27;s not the best electric shaver out there.</li>
            <li> Razor is a good value.&lt;br /&gt;Works better as a trimmer according to my son.&lt;br</li>
            <li> All of the above,This Shaver is a nice thing.</li>
            <li> The really nice thing is that I can use it with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> but it is kind of dust</li>
            <li> I could buy 3 of these for what it cost me to own one Braun.  </li>
            <li> The battery display is handy.</li>
            <li> The wet/dry ability is nice, too.</li>
            <li> The side cutter on the ES8103S is good and better than the Braun or the Norelco.  </li>
            <li> It is not as good as the side cutter on the Panasonic ES4000 because it is mounted on the side of the razor body whereas the ES4000 cutter extends beyond the head of the razor and can better access areas around the ears and dangling nose hairs.</li>
            <li> the percentage of charge remaining window is nice</li>
            <li> /&gt;Good:&lt;br /&gt;- looks nice</li>
            <li> Honestly, I gave it a try knowing that I have never had luck with the electric razors.</li>
            <li> Kind of a pain to use.</li>
            <li> Nice price</li>
            <li> Awesome product and it works really well.  </li>
            <li> I think it would be nice if it was a bit wider.  </li>
            <li> It looks nice and works well to me.</li>
            <li> absolutely the best electric I have ever owned!  </li>
            <li> The flex head is nice as it contours around your face.</li>
            <li> I found it got kind of gummy.</li>
            <li> is nice &amp; appears to do a nice job.&lt;br /&gt;Tomorrow</li>
            <li> When you now get started, you will have to be accustomed to it before you learn how to use effectively.</li>
            <li> , it just would of been nice to feel they appreciate my business.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still giving it three stars, because I feel that it&#x27;s well built, a good value, and that others with easier beards might have better luck than me.</li>
            <li> He gets a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> In fact, when my brother tried it he absolutely liked it.</li>
            <li> I tried it because of the good reviews and the reviews were once more on the money.</li>
            <li> and it is an excellent combo, highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> That said it seems to be working ok after 2 months the shave quality is good with this 3 foil razor with 2 blades.</li>
            <li> Fits my hands nicely</li>
            <li> A NICE PIECE OF EQUIPMENT.  </li>
            <li> I do have to say that the return was a piece of cake but would much rather had a great razor with no return!!!!</li>
            <li> Good or better than my Braun.</li>
            <li> Does a nice close cut.</li>
            <li> Just as good or better shave than $300 Braun Shaver I have.</li>
            <li> Awesome, really does shave 99% as close as a blade with zero irritation.</li>
            <li> is truly astounding.</li>
            <li> Has nice recharging ability.</li>
            <li> Gets nice close shave in under a minute.</li>
            <li> A simpler charge indicator that was always on would be nice.  </li>
            <li> Best shave speed and smoothness, fast recharge, cord/cordless operation.</li>
            <li> Knowing this, and knowing my price points, I started my own research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product, though, works reasonably well and is the best blade substitute I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> but this own has outlasted them all.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice shave.</li>
            <li> Nice shaver.</li>
            <li> Even with trendy retro double-edged safety razors.</li>
            <li> which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> The price was right and the ratings were very good.  </li>
            <li> This is a very nice reliable razor for primarily shower use.  </li>
            <li> It was a very nice, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Quick easy, no fuss, excellent results all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shave wasn&#x27;t perfect, but there was no irritation, it did a nice job on my face and a decent job on my neck.  </li>
            <li> clean an nice, great resistance to water, and cleaning</li>
            <li> I got it for 50 bucks here on Amazon and it is totally worth my money!!!</li>
            <li> but this is great shaver with closeness for a clean shave.</li>
            <li> display is great for reminding you to clean and recharge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has not made me better looking or more successful.</li>
            <li> Everything else about it was great, it just couldn&#x27;t clean my neck.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it on weekends when I do not need the clean shave of a razor and am happy with it.</li>
            <li> First, I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it worked but after time, it great!</li>
            <li> Great shaver -- I&#x27;ve had mine for 4 years, and it still does a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li> but the main function is perfect!</li>
            <li> Gives a decent shave I&#x27;ve yet to find an electric razor that gives a perfect one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a joy to clean.</li>
            <li> In summary, I am very happy with my purchase and highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic shaves the best of all I have ever owned and highly recommend it.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks now, about 4 or 5 shaves, and I have some very good first impressions.</li>
            <li> works best if you go with the grain for the 1st cut, to get the high stuff out of the way.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this excellent product!</li>
            <li> But this is an awesome product and is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I got this at a great price because of a special at Amazon.</li>

            <li> Very nice shaver, very good price on Amazon, very close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> This new shaver is excellent.  </li>
            <li> this new Panasonic is incredible!</li>
            <li> I am so impressed I just bought replacement blades which I never do because of the cost vs a new razor.</li>
            <li> but the new ES8103s is the best ever.</li>
            <li> I bought a new razor and as it turns out one I&#x27;m very happy with.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t get that detailed and the shaver does a good job on its own.  </li>
            <li> men seem to have medium - light beards, that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s so many great ratings.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;-Fits good in my hand and is easily maintained</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed, my husband has nothing  negative to say about this - it was a great gift!!</li>

            <li> Arrived quickly and looks great.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and works great.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipment and great product.</li>
            <li> Best to get two of anything you like, next year&#x27;s models are not always (if ever) quite as good.</li>
            <li> The closeness of the shave is also excellent, which, again, is the key to a good</li>
            <li> Whatever, I have finally found the perfect shaver at a really good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for a couple of weeks and it works great for a quick morning shave.  </li>
            <li> Great for a wet/dry quick shave.</li>
            <li> Does a great job, but the battery runs out quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor which allows you to shave quickly.</li>
            <li> Great razor, shaved my beard off really quickly, but do not leave it in the bag they include, after you rinse it with water, or it will become stinky.</li>

            <li> I got this for my boyfriend and he claims that this shaver is the best one he has tried out by far!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Small nits though--I&#x27;m really very happy with this shaver so far (knock on wood)!</li>
            <li> Gets a close shave, very high power - stays charged for days, and it was a very good price before Christmas.</li>
            <li> It does a very good job in getting a clean and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> The battery is still fine and the shave is as good as ever.</li>

            <li> This is by far the best electric razor I ever owned.  </li>
            <li> The features are nice, but the shaver itself could be a bit better.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8103S is a great balance of useful features vs price.  </li>
            <li> I have had about 4 shavers and this is the best one so far.</li>
            <li> By far, the best shaver I have ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t get that detailed and the shaver does a good job on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> Far and away the best shaver I ever owned and</li>
            <li> This is the best by far.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best shaver I&#x27;ve obtain to reduce the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow</li>
            <li> I am 74 years old and this is the best shave I have ever had.</li>
            <li> WOW, I am so impressed.  </li>
            <li> I read online that the best thing for people with sensitive skin and acne is to shave with an electric razor</li>
            <li> This is by far the best electric razor that I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> The shaver is surprising lightweight but doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.  </li>
            <li> But the most amazing thing of all is cleaning.</li>
            <li> I got this one about three weeks ago and so far, I would say this is the best one ever.</li>
            <li> This one by far is the best one I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Amazing - seems to work even better for me than the reviews here.</li>
            <li> This model is proving to be dependable and an improvement over my old one, and cost-wise, is also an excellent value.</li>
            <li> this is by far the best shave.</li>
            <li> For my sensitive skin, that&#x27;s what&#x27;s worked best.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After two weeks of using the Panasonic ES8103s shaver I must say its a good comfortable shaver for the price, but for me I&#x27;m going to pass.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing electric shaver I have ever had -- or used.  </li>
            <li> Thus far this is the best rechargeable razor I&#x27;ve ever owned (have used it for a week).  </li>
            <li> The weight is good and the handle is comfortable in any position or grip.  </li>
            <li> Best Shaver I&#x27;ve got so far.</li>
            <li> I use both hand and electric razor and this one by FAR yields the best results!</li>
            <li> good fit for orient people&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Rechargeable Linear Pivot Action Shaving System, Silver is excellent and performs as advertised.</li>
            <li> so far excellent shave .</li>
            <li> So far this electric shaver is the best.</li>
            <li> This has worked perfectly for me so far.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a lot of electric razors in my lifetime and this one is by far the best yet.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin i think this would be the perfect machine for you.</li>
            <li> So far I would rate it excellent.</li>
            <li> It lasts many cycles and does a really nice job.</li>
            <li> and I have owned most of the popular brands out there.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I can&#x27;t imagine a better shaving experience for what I paid ($54.99).  </li>
            <li> This is my 4th electric/rechargeable razor and this is the best one so far.  </li>
            <li> By far the best electric razor I have ever had in my 64 years.  </li>
            <li> So far I am very happy with this shaver and recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> I love it and its so nice.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve had so far.  </li>
            <li> so I gave it a try, and so far, it is the best shaver I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I think in this price range we know what we are getting - not the bottom of the barrel cheap electric shavers that don&#x27;t stand up to the test of time, nor provide a good shave.</li>
            <li> Will update this review after some time (Panasonic mentions 30 days) to see if extended beard growth can be handled more effectively.</li>
            <li> and so far it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> GREAT VALUE - WORTH THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had electric shavers before, but this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> This shaver is by far the best I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used electric razors and this is by far the best one that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The results are just too patchy no matter how many passes you make or what kind of technique</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nice to just be able to wash the heads.</li>
            <li> This razor does a wonderful job on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Its comfortable to hold while you are shaving and gives a good shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had electric shavers for over 40 years and this one is the best by far.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is by far the best shaver I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely perfect for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to buy a product where the company can guarantee its&#x27; quality (for more than 90 days let&#x27;s say, Panasonic puts a 2 year warranty on this).</li>
            <li> Practical, cheap, good built quality</li>
            <li> The purchase price and free shipping made this shaver a good value.</li>
            <li> So far i am very happy that it gets as close as a bic razor.</li>
            <li> To my surprise he actually liked it :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to be able to rinse it off when done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting used to it, but so far I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> I think it may come in handy now and again, but for the most part it just sits there.  </li>
            <li> you are looking for an exceptional shaver I would strongly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Much better than normal razors and the best electric shaver</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has been almost 9 months, and I cannot count how many times he has thanked us and commented on how wonderful his new shaver is.  </li>
            <li> It is a great shave!&lt;br /&gt;- Do not expect it to work smoothly right away if you&#x27;re switching from the blade.</li>
            <li> He used this one right away (it arrived fully charged) and thought it was great.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine, so I</li>
            <li> it is easy!  </li>
            <li> I bought the Panasonic ES8103S in December of 2010 and it is still going strong!</li>
            <li> I strongly recomend this!</li>
            <li> 5 years and still running strong!</li>
            <li> The shave is quality is excellent - almost as good as a razor, and the experience is fast, smooth and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> The best thing is, I can run it under hot water to clean it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work that good for the price you pay for it!</li>
            <li> Aside from doing what the ads say, it is very quiet, easy to handle and provides a very good shave - a welcome way to start the day.    </li>
            <li> Good, clean shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many razors over the years, but this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> It gives a great shave and it is extremley easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The wet/dry feature is really great, and it&#x27;s easy to charge and clean.</li>
            <li> When it stops grinding, I know I&#x27;m clean and good</li>
            <li> When it stops grinding, I know I&#x27;m clean and good to go.  </li>
            <li> It works great and is so easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> I am still in the assessing programme but so far am most impressed.</li>
            <li> This shaver provides a good clean shave.  </li>
            <li> I have been a Panasonic user for nearly 10 years now and have been very impressed by the quality of the product, but more so by the quality of the shave.  </li>
            <li> Clean shave, feels good.</li>
            <li> The water foucet icon display is a good reminder to clean the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Panasonic ES8103S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric... does a faster job for shaving, trimmer works great for my mustache and side burns and the unit is easy to clean either with a brush or by washing it.</li>
            <li> overall I am happy and the thing still works great.</li>
            <li> It holds charge and gives a good clean shave.  </li>
            <li> but honestly, the shaves just keep getting better and better.  </li>
            <li> He states it is easy to use, clean and does a great job.  </li>
            <li> Pro - Battery level display, clean alert; rapid charging process; looks good  </li>
            <li> There may be better ways to do it, but this works the best for me so far.    </li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and gives a great close shave.</li>
            <li> I loved the clean shave, he wasn&#x27;t impressed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shaver is easy to clean and maintain.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a great buy, just skip the using it in the shower.</li>
            <li> I bought it because it was reasonably priced, got reasonably good reviews for closeness of shave, and the brand got good reliability</li>
            <li> flexible and quiet-a good fast shaver with a good trimmer.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and was a great price.</li>
            <li> With the Panasonic I get a good, clean, close shave every time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier (for me and him) to clean and does a good cut.</li>
            <li> My husband has had many shavers over the years, from Norelco to Braun; but this one is by far his best.  </li>
            <li> best shaver I have ever used, fast and comfortable with a close shave.</li>
            <li> But be aware, it is super noisy!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a joy to use and charges very fast...</li>
            <li> So in my opinion, there&#x27;s nothing special about the ES8103, but it&#x27;s basically a good razor</li>
            <li> When Amazon ran a holiday special for about $65, this seemed too good to pass up.</li>
            <li> When I received it and used it the first time I was fairly happy with it</li>
            <li> The first use was a great surprise.</li>
            <li> first shave was great</li>
            <li> , I first thought it was great, guess because it didn&#x27;t eat my face off.  </li>
            <li> Got what I paid for, pretty happy but it could be cheaper.</li>
            <li> This is apparently the best shaver my husband has ever had.</li>
            <li> But even at that higher price, it&#x27;s a great shaver for the money.</li>
            <li> Since then, it consistently gives a great shave.</li>
            <li> important, it looks very elegant</li>
            <li> Great product, my husband loves it, he said shaving is a lot faster now, thanks!</li>
            <li> The saver is great, battery life is outstanding and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I decided to give the ES8103S a try and after about six weeks I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to charge, quite and good shave.</li>
            <li> To clean it, I just pop the top off and give it a good blow on either side.</li>

            <li> and if i just want to get a quick go-over without getting close, it&#x27;s good for that.</li>
            <li> Nice n easy.</li>
            <li> Shaving after splashing some warm water on the face yields pretty good results too.    </li>
            <li> This shaver does a good shave but not as good as an older Panasonic I have had for many years.</li>
            <li> Excellent battery life; you could probably shave for 30 mins straight on a full charge and</li>
            <li> It gives him a close shave, is handy, and easy to transport when traveling.</li>
            <li> A good quick shave.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li> Well, I first liked this shaver because it worked good.  </li>
            <li> It charges quickly and the battery life is quite good.</li>
            <li> Conclusion: there are higher priced shavers out there that look fancier, and I&#x27;m sure they have some useful bells and whistles this one doesn&#x27;t have, but this is a great, attractive shaver that feels good in your hand and is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> The shaver is great, light and charges quickly.</li>
            <li> It is a good hand fit and easy to move around his face.  </li>
            <li> It is light and easy to use and has good instructions.</li>
            <li> He is able to shave with this shaver very comfortably.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with it as It shaves as close as a regular razor and leaves my face very smooth.</li>
            <li> I have very fair, sensitive skin as I am blond.</li>
            <li> , it has a very good trimmer for sideburns and the pivoting action of the razor head</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s been a very good purchase for me.  </li>
            <li> In addition to being quite loud, this shaver does not do a very good job of shaving - even after many passes.  </li>
            <li> The vibrating foil does a better job than Norelco&#x27;s spinning blade heads - probably faster blade speed.</li>
            <li> it is the most powerfull shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li> He is handicaped in many ways &amp; is on blood thinning medicine &amp; they wouldn&#x27;t shave him unless he had a electric r portable razor.</li>
            <li> This shaver never holds a charge for more than 2-3 shaves anymore.</li>
            <li> I wanted a great shave in between using my razor on the weekends and this really fits the bill.</li>
            <li> more foam\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> However, the shaver seems to work better on my face with some water.</li>
            <li> it hurts a LOT MORE with this shaver when you put your after shave on.  </li>
            <li> nope, even more irritation.</li>
            <li> The instructions say to use it with shaving cream for a month and then you can do it without the shave cream, however, I have never been able to get to that point.  </li>
            <li> need to go over areas of face more than once but still</li>
            <li> ok.  </li>
            <li> , BTW, don&#x27;t believe that hogwash about having to use an electric 30 days or more....</li>
            <li> Price is ok for product.</li>
            <li> I say, invest in your face and get a more pricey one.</li>
            <li> so I ordered this and it has been a night and day difference better.  </li>
            <li> You probably won&#x27;t find that magical electric shaver that you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several brands and rate this the best for both shaving and ease of cleaning.</li>
            <li> Amazon even had a $15 off coupon for the Arc 3 and that makes this an even better value!&lt;br</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> On the face, it is ok.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic, it turns out, is a quantum leap better.</li>
            <li> but with this I am able to shave every day (even in the morning and at night before going out).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-wet shave in the shower is even better</li>
            <li> And before buying I read the reviews and have found for the most part, that I am in line with others views.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> And before buying I read the reviews and have found for the most part, that I am in line with others views.    </li>
            <li> Love this razor and would recommended it to others looking.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean  Good battery life    </li>
            <li> Better than a $200 Braun.</li>
            <li> After a month, I am extremely pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li> yes but a 5 or 7 series and way more $$$$ than the pana..</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research to see what was getting top reviews in the $75-$150 range.  </li>
            <li> I find I can&#x27;t seem to get quite as close of a shave with it, but I believe that is because the shaver screen is a bit more robust than the Remington.  </li>
            <li> I bought it on the recommendation of a friend, and I love it.</li>
            <li> that might be a consideration for many people.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li> I love this shaver period.</li>
            <li> I had a Panasonic shaver for many years</li>
            <li> and I hope to find a better product to replace it.</li>
            <li> after two months of use, I&#x27;m quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> altogether way more pluses than minuses.</li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> A former co-worker recommended it, and I was very happy to discover it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many electric razors.  </li>
            <li> Better to have each percent shown or</li>
            <li> Probably because they use more plastic parts to save on cost, but still it is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is okay but could be better.</li>
            <li> (it does seem to shave better that way</li>
            <li> It tugs a bit more at the skin.</li>
            <li> I would have no doubt facial shaving would be equally superb!</li>
            <li> Try it and you too will love the results.</li>
            <li> I have been on a quest for a better shaver for many years.  </li>
            <li> but after many &#x27;trials,&#x27; it becomes second-nature.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer in the Braun did work much better.  </li>
            <li> and I could not have bought a better razor for him.</li>
            <li> Shaving in the shower, he&#x27;s able to shave almost as close as a razor, but his skin has NO irritation.  </li>
            <li> The charge lasts more than a week; I didn&#x27;t bother to bring the charger on my 1 week business trip to Europe.  </li>
            <li> It is still my favorite razor.  </li>
            <li> I love this shaver and will never use another brand again.  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I have shaved with gillette blades for over 15 years now, and suffered most of it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad to give it up for a better shave    Notes:   </li>
            <li> - Takes more time to shave vs. razor (</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the top of the line, and it&#x27;s not an el cheapo.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver, everything as the ad said.</li>
            <li> I would endure all these annoyances for a better, smoother shave.</li>
            <li> I am totally pleased with my razor.  </li>
            <li> I was a long-term Braun user, but am glad I switched to the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> because I just didn&#x27;t know any better.   </li>
            <li> I found that today, I am glad I didn&#x27;t throw out my $30 one, because in the end, it was the one that didn&#x27;t act like a dysfunctional lawnmower.     </li>
            <li> The rotary felt more like a power tool in your hand.  </li>
            <li> I have been using electric shavers for over 30 years now and have tried many of them.</li>
            <li> The razor is a bit noisy and cumbersome to hold compared to the shape of most rotary razor bodies.</li>
            <li> So my review is &amp;#34;go for the Braun and pay the price for a better shave.</li>
            <li> My Norelco was so-so, my Braun was better, my Remington was a joke.</li>
            <li> I can say that even more surely now.</li>
            <li> It is a critical reason why this is the best.</li>
            <li> Love the battery power sensor, and wash/charge reminders.</li>
            <li> I would have liked to see a nicer travel case instead of the cheap cloth bag, but as for the shaver itsef, I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a reason to spend more money, and I would recommend this Panasonic shaver to a friend.</li>
            <li> Love my Panasonic.</li>
            <li> The trimmer seems better than most that I have used on shavers as well as it cuts even and doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;chew\\&quot; through like a lot of shaver trimmers.</li>
            <li> This allows the razor to make more cuts per unit time for better coverage.  </li>
            <li> The sonic cleaning mode seems to do a good job of keeping the blades clean, is easy to use, and does not take up space like some of those self cleaning models.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is the best electric shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I like this Panasonic much better.  </li>
            <li> It is great, giving me a really close shave and no cuts.  </li>
            <li> While it has a pivot system for myself I have found that it works better if I lock it in place.  </li>
            <li> None of them lasted much more than a year.</li>
            <li> So, if you are traveling, make sure you pack the shaver away</li>
            <li> So, if you are traveling, make sure you pack the shaver away safely.    </li>
            <li> Simply put, this razor is the best I have owned.</li>
            <li> I will say that even consumer reports lists this razor as one of the best and for the price, it simply can&#x27;t be beat.  </li>
            <li> I thought all electrics just required many passes to get a so-so shave.  </li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m glad I did</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really glad I chose this one.</li>
            <li> It is an okay razor for the money.  </li>
            <li> Great price and really the closest shave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked on Panasonic now and when I have to replace this, I&#x27;ll be sure to stick with them.</li>
            <li> I have not had an electric shaver in more than 20 years.</li>
            <li> I think it is quieter than many I have used.  </li>
            <li> Just be sure to read the instructions for cleaning.    </li>
            <li> I have used (prefer) electrics for many years, both rotary and foil.</li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> 3/14/2012 - Still love my shaver.  </li>
            <li> holds a charge for many days.  </li>
            <li> I also love that it can be used wet/dry and cleaned with water.</li>
            <li> more time for shaving , -shave</li>
            <li> Pleased with all my purchases</li>
            <li> I was in need of changing heads and my brother recommended this razor and I am glad that he did and that I took his advice.  </li>
            <li> While using this item with shaving cream I received much better results.</li>
            <li> and they keep getting better.  </li>
            <li> it gave a much better shave.</li>
            <li> This shaver is much better than the Norelco it replaced.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;m getting a closer shave than I was able to get with a razor.  </li>
            <li> With this shaver, I just take the top off and shake out the hairs, and now</li>
            <li> The Braun is ok</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m looking for something better.</li>
            <li> The trimmer isn&#x27;t any better.</li>
            <li> I hope amazon will let me return it used, because there&#x27;s no way it&#x27;s touching my face again, and otherwise I&#x27;ll just be out the $65.</li>
            <li> I love Panasonic Wet/Dry Shavers and have been using them for many many years.</li>
            <li> but I love the Panasonic shave quality and the versatility of their Wet/Dry shavers.</li>
            <li> but this one is so much better.</li>
            <li> I have owned several panasonic shavers over the years and find this one to be the best.</li>
            <li> I decided that I needed a better razor that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I saw no reason to purchase a shaver for more than a hundred dollars.  </li>
            <li> although I am beginning to think it does a better job (closer shave).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: Now using this shaver for 6 months, I feel qualified to tell you guys that I still love this shaver.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d get a better shave from a blade.</li>
            <li> I had considered the 4-head design costing a bit more, but I thought that was overkill and too bulky for my taste.</li>
            <li> While I wouldn&#x27;t know how those perform, I can&#x27;t imagine them being any better than this one.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m more of a board shorts and tee shirt type guy</li>
            <li> I did a notable amount of research on both price and reviews before I selected it and from where I bought it.</li>

            <li> All in all, I am pleased with this razor and would recommend it to anyone looking for a next-step or two-up from an entry level electric razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this after doing hours of research on what the best mid level electric razor was.</li>
            <li> that just costs more money every time to refill.</li>
            <li> , I doubt that electric razors will ever get better than this in terms of closeness of shave.  </li>
            <li> ease of cleaning is fantastic!</li>
            <li> $blades must be way better.</li>
            <li> Buy one, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I love how it forms to the contour of your face while cutting.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I since had two Brauns and they were OK.</li>
            <li> It eclipsed my Braun and Remington in every way, in terms of shaving and usage; I like the looks of the Braun a bit more.  </li>
            <li> I have owned many.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for about 20 years, mostly the wet/dry type when they came out &amp; mostly Panasonics.    </li>
            <li> I keep it in a plastic glass along with my toothbrush, which is actually more convenient than a stand.  </li>
            <li> I had several electric razors and this is the best one ever, I do wish it had a charging stand, though.</li>
            <li> After reading (too) many reviews I ordered the Panasonic ES8103S.   </li>
            <li> What a fabulous razor, a dream!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a great product that works very well.</li>
            <li> Now this is based on shaving with it 5 times with it, but I have really enjoyed it and do recommend</li>
            <li> Considering the cost of the Gillette 5 Blade cartridges, the Panasonic looks like an even better value.</li>
            <li> and he has said that it is better than that one.</li>
            <li> Compare with Norelco and Braun - I like the shave of Panasonic better.</li>
            <li> maybe over time my experience will be better</li>
            <li> and he love it .</li>
            <li> and thank me bought it for him. :)</li>
            <li> I would have rated it five stars but the stubble on my face takes considerably more effort.</li>
            <li> If you shave your head, you will love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a lot of things that I love about the shaver.</li>
            <li> That means that you have to plan ahead and charge it before you need to shave (which makes the battery percent display all the more convenient).</li>
            <li> My face was baby-bottom smooth!   </li>
            <li> unsuccessful finding electric razor that cuts close any better than this.</li>
            <li> I have owned many different electric shavers over the years and this is the best one!</li>
            <li> The Braun never gave me a satisfying shave</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t ask for better service.</li>
            <li> Using a combination of an electric shaver and a blade gets my shave much closer and definitely more comfortable than just using a blade alone regardless if the blade is a top of the line Gillette, which probably the best blade design available.</li>
            <li> I am now quite pleased with it.</li>
            <li> (but cord is better for</li>
            <li> I have owned many electric shavers over the years.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I am able to get over 10 shaves per charge on it.  </li>
            <li> Bought this model because it was ranked as the third best Pansonic shaver you could buy.  </li>
            <li> I love the ability to wash it under the faucet and not worry about water damage.  </li>
            <li> but you have to go over your face too many times to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the performance will suffer, but it&#x27;s the best/closest shave</li>
            <li> shaving quality: It was better compared to</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall: The shaver is OK for the price</li>
            <li> Overall a very good shaver!!</li>
            <li> This razor is ok.</li>
            <li> Better then</li>
            <li> I love the battery meter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased</li>
            <li> so of course I have to go over a couple spots more than once</li>
            <li> It works better on shorter hair, not so well on 3+ day hair.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research and decided that I didn&#x27;t want to pay more than $100.  </li>
            <li> You cannot get a better shaver for the money.  </li>
            <li> This is actually a better shaver than the one I returned.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this razor.</li>
            <li> Plus price here on Amazon is top notch.  </li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> The shave is ok but not close</li>
            <li> I was amazed at the quality of the shave I was able to get, and</li>
            <li> even n more amazed that I got virtually no razor burn.  </li>
            <li> This electric shaver is way better than any razor blade I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> but this shaver works for better.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I do find that this shaver does do a much better job on my chin area.</li>
            <li> makes it work so much better.  </li>
            <li> just something in my situation might want to consider, a norelco might be more forgiving.</li>
            <li> A shorter beefier handle would have made it much more practical as well as</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there might be some microscopic difference between the closeness of the shave, but I couldn&#x27;t tell.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> The battery life is excellent and the charge time is very short.</li>
            <li> and it worked a bit better.  </li>
            <li> Outstanding shaver --</li>
            <li> GLAD</li>
            <li> It has become a favorite task to shave.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> This is a phenomenal shaver.  </li>
            <li> It has done everything that I need and more.  </li>
            <li> In effect, this electric shaver has mostly replaced shaving cream, making the shaving task quicker.  </li>
            <li> but overall I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Now he is always as smooth as a baby with no razor burn or in grown hairs to bother him!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it&#x27;s waterproof</li>
            <li> Much better shave than the Philips Norelco.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you could find a better shaver for the money.</li>
            <li> wonder how many shavers they sell just because of that...</li>
            <li> I love the closeness of the shaves as well as the ease of cleaning the razor.</li>
            <li> I just wish it did a better job shaving.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you put the cover on the blade.</li>
            <li> but now that I&#x27;ve had this one for over a month I can tell you that its much better.</li>
            <li> I recommend you buy this shaver if you don&#x27;t want to spend more than $100.</li>
            <li> So much better quality and engineering than the Braun.</li>
            <li> After fully charging it, I gave it a try and was relatively satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> No, but its the best I have personally used.  </li>
            <li> I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shaver.</li>
            <li> I get even better results on shaving the mustache than I do with my razor.</li>
            <li> Notably, the shaver had evidence of vapor on the inside of the screen.</li>
            <li> Since it had a one year warrantee, the Panasonic rep explained that if I could get a copy of the receipt I would be able to send it in for repair or replacement.</li>
            <li> I was able to send a copy of the Amazon email receipt (from the person that gave me the gift) and Panasonic sent me a pre-paid label to attach to any box to send the shaver in.</li>
            <li> My Dad borrowed it when he visited, and he really thought it was great.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This is an ok shaver.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting more for the money, but maybe I&#x27;ve been spoiled by Remington.  </li>
            <li> the shaves keep on getting better with no irratation.</li>
            <li> It is better than my Norelco.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this is probably for safety, since it&#x27;s rated to use in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li> It does provide a nice smooth shave and the battery life seems to hold a charge for a couple weeks when shaving once a day.</li>
            <li> This is the second Panasonic razor I have owned and find the quality of the shave to be excellent.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to friends for sure.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase, especially for the price!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I decided to give this thing a try.  </li>
            <li> It shaves a lot closer, cleans much easier, charges faster and is, at about $80, a great value.  </li>
            <li> It captures most of the hairs it cuts inside the shaving block.  </li>
            <li> And while it is a wet/dry shaver from what I&#x27;ve found on the Internet it is not fully water proof; more like water resistant.  </li>
            <li> Almost as good and economical as DE shaving, but faster to use when you include setup and cleaning.</li>
            <li> In my many years I&#x27;ve used &#x27;em all.  </li>
            <li> like it :)</li>
            <li> i tryied different shavers and this one is one of the best.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d gladly purchase it again any day.</li>
            <li> Shaves better than a blade.</li>
            <li> I got this shaver a couple of months ago hoping that I wouldn&#x27;t have to use razor blades any more, because latetly I been cutinng myself while shaving.</li>
            <li> panasonic is a good brand and this one just proves it.</li>
            <li> This foil shaver is much better than the budget rotary units I have been using from Remington and others.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I used Brauns for many years.</li>
            <li> The one caveat is the battery doesn&#x27;t hold that many charges.</li>
            <li> I \\&quot;assumed\\&quot; that Panasonic&#x27;s razor technology had moved forward after many years</li>
            <li> ES8243A had a nice velvet-lined vinyl bag, while the ES8103S comes with a CHEAP cloth bag.</li>
            <li> I suspect most of the parts for the Japanese-assembled ES8243A, aside from the foil, blade and motor, were imported from China.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to find a better product</li>
            <li> I have used Braun&#x27;s electrical shaver more than 5 yrs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received this shaver and was pleased with it.</li>
            <li> My latest job requires me to shave often.  </li>
            <li> A great buy and a real bargain.</li>
            <li> I shave more often since the shaver do its job</li>
            <li> I had to go over some spots so many times that it caused skin irritation.</li>
            <li> Well, on the top of the head anyway.</li>
            <li> OK, it is going over a lot of territory.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> There are better options out there.</li>
            <li> I doubt it will get better in time.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many electric and manual razors and every one always caused a rash.  </li>
            <li> I discovered a tube of Alba coconut lime shave cream lying in my drawer, and that made my experience even better.</li>
            <li> Oh, and one more thing-</li>
            <li> BY BEING ABLE TO USE IT IN THE SHOWER WITH THE ASSISTANTS OF THE STEAM/WATER</li>
            <li> I switched to the Panasonic from a Norelco rotory blade shaver and it took a couple of weeks until I felt like I was getting a better shave</li>
            <li> Both shavers require more repeat strokes than I would prefer.</li>
            <li> It gets a close shave to most of my face.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> He recommended this one to me and I am sooo glad I listened.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but it doesn&#x27;t cut all the hair.</li>
            <li> It works much better than any I have owned.  </li>
            <li> Many of the reviews seem to indicate poorer reliability.</li>
            <li> When I found the ES8103, I found a shaver with all the strengths of the ES8047 plus better battery</li>
            <li> Make sure you change the blades when you see the performance drop off.</li>
            <li> My Norelco needed replacement after many years, and that model was discontinued.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you can do any better.</li>
            <li> so maybe I just work better with foil.</li>
            <li> But simply, this is the best electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li> After a week of use, the shaver gets better and better and grows on you.</li>
            <li> pros:&lt;br /&gt;- close shave on most parts of my face</li>
            <li> good build quality&lt;br /&gt;- easy to clean</li>
            <li> /&gt;- struggled in thicker parts of my beard - took longer and more passes, and you could hear the thing struggling (fyi this did not happen with the 14,000 linear motor in the ES-LA63-S).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> though gave a close shave for most areas of my face, couldn&#x27;t cut it with thicker parts of my beard, so no go.</li>
            <li> It did ok on under arms and face.</li>
            <li> You think for the price, it would be much better  </li>
            <li> better product.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> There may be better ones out there</li>
            <li> Works better when I use shaving cream.</li>
            <li> This product is just OK.  </li>
            <li> I use it mostly when I am on the go</li>
            <li> Best electric shaver I have had in the last 40 years.</li>
            <li> I love saving money and not having to buy replacement cartridges for my Gillete razor.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> It ok .</li>
            <li> Make in japan , it way better then this</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe the low price, and it is a GREAT shave!  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried a Panasonic shaver before and was pleased with this one.  </li>
            <li> Better than the Remington did.</li>
            <li> For the most part Panasonic has meant quality products made in Japan, not anymore.</li>
            <li> but there are many better units at the non-sale price of this shaver.</li>
            <li> I love it and so does he, 5 stars for me.</li>
            <li> It looks better than it works.  </li>
            <li> Better recharging setup on that one.  </li>
            <li> Of course now I realize it was because I was spending so much more time trying to get a close shave with</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing alot of research and it seems that men with rougher / thicker beards need to spend more money on a stronger electric</li>
            <li> - that convenience has made the purchase worthwhile.  </li>
            <li> These two setting allow me to have more control over the shave</li>
            <li> Am I glad I purchased it - YES.  </li>
            <li> I am really impressed with how close of a shave I get, especially when using the shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> after a month everything is ok.</li>
            <li> i am satisfied...</li>
            <li> You would be better buying at Walmart or Target where you can return without hassel.  </li>
            <li> I prefer this one.&lt;br /&gt;Needs to be charged about every 17-20 days using it once a day.&lt;br /&gt;Overall pleased.</li>
            <li> how many times I go over it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am convinced that, like most things in life, you need to try it for yourself.</li>
            <li> It felt like I needed to apply more pressure</li>
            <li> so I ended up leaving it in Locked position most of the time.</li>
            <li> in fact its even better.</li>
            <li> Replaced the latest in a series of Braun shavers with this after reading the ratings on Consumer&#x27;s Reports and find this to provide a better shave at a much more affordable price than the Brauns.  </li>
            <li> This is an ok shaver, doesn&#x27;t give a close shave.</li>
            <li> MAGIC works well but is too inconsistent (e.g. chemical</li>
            <li> I believe it provides one of the closest, smoothest shaves of any electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned (better than Norelco and Braun</li>
            <li> love that it is wet/dry, since I often prefer to shave in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I suggest more people purchase this shaver.</li>
            <li> With my ES8043SC I could tap the top of the unit after I removed the top to knock out the cut shaving hairs.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try it with this unit because you&#x27;ll probably break the top.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m betting that it&#x27;ll do just as well or maybe even better.</li>
            <li> OK, but I prefer a closer shave</li>
            <li> However, I am so satisfied with this razor that I was motivated to get off my butt and write these words.</li>
            <li> I found it&#x27;s better than phillips.</li>
            <li> Does not cut pieces of meat out of my neck like most shavers and this one works well with water.</li>
            <li> I think it is the most bang you can get for your buck.</li>
            <li> He has mentioned over and over that it was the best Christmas present he has ever received, and considering how many Christmas&#x27; he has seen and how many children and grandchildren he has received presents from, that says a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it was ok for a foil, but this baby rocks.</li>
            <li> Simply the best electric razer I have owned.  </li>
            <li> and I am able to get close and shave around the goatee with no</li>
            <li> Had it for about 5 years now and love it.</li>
            <li> More words.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also more noisy</li>
            <li> I would not be satisfied.</li>
            <li> The Panasonice model that I purchased is better than most that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver..</li>
            <li> So, if you shave every day, this thing does a nice job giving you a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> When this is done properly the trimmer is excellent.</li>
            <li> most impressive thing is that after a fully charge, it can work for about 2 weeks with daily usage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> - they are retained much better in the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works well for more than 2 years</li>
            <li> So glad that we made this choice when there was so many to choose from.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was so glad to see.</li>
            <li> gives a better shave then this.</li>
            <li> but that has nothing to do with the shaver and more to do with his learning curve.</li>
            <li> I love both.  </li>
            <li> made more of a difference than I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Love the wet/dry razor.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still highly pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best shave and most comfortable I have ever had in my life.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li> Way better than mine.&amp;#34; So now my son owns it.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this shaver.</li>
            <li> I looked at many reviews here and felt I should add mine too.</li>
            <li> No wonder there have been so many reviews on this one...</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s pleased with it..  </li>
            <li> This one is lighter and more compact.  </li>
            <li> most of the time finish shaving the mustache area with a blade shaver.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> and he is glad to receive it.</li>
            <li> Okay</li>
            <li> I have always used either a top of the line Braun or Eltron.</li>
            <li> I must say I am extremely pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li> Hopefully this will get better once I get adjusted with the saver</li>
            <li> I am totally pleased with every feature of the Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather a not so close shave but more uniform.  </li>
            <li> Nice razor, have had for approx 8 months and has worked great so far.</li>
            <li> This one is substantially better than both.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco rotary razors for many years.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver.  </li>
            <li> Yep, the packaging//marketing is on target :) I&#x27;m a newbie at shaving my head and have never used a manual (blade) razor.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ll probably never learn, nor (have to) gain the courage, to shave my head with a manual/blade razor :)</li>
            <li> The shave is as close as a manual razor, but it is much more convenient.  </li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> have tried many types of razors all promising to do a great job, none did, except this one.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I am sure this works for many people, but it didn&#x27;t meet my expectations after using it.</li>
            <li> I thought this would do better.</li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s doing a better job.</li>
            <li> Be sure and give it the month to see if it works for you.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver I have used in the last 20 years.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I read the review &amp; gave this shaver a try.  </li>
            <li> It may do even better with soap and water but not tried as I am satisfied as is.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s more than satisfactory for my needs.  </li>
            <li> I have had many electric razors over the years....</li>
            <li> The Panasonic works much better without the irritation.</li>
            <li> Just bout this and am enjoying it a lot.</li>
            <li> If there was a choice to pay the difference and upgrade it for a better model, I&#x27;d do it in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> I love Panasonic razors.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably buy the $31 replacement screen/blades and hopefully get many more years out of this.</li>
            <li> I was sold on the outstanding reviews, and jumped on these for the $59 sale.</li>
            <li> It also shaves closer and better than any as well.</li>
            <li> At this point I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> This is the favorite electric razor my husband has ever had.  </li>
            <li> I love to shave with it</li>
            <li> I read many reviews before picking this model.</li>
            <li> They love them.</li>
            <li> Have been fairly pleased as I was a razor user for years....</li>
            <li> It also seems to now cause more skin irritation than it did at the beginning.  </li>
            <li> I get a nice smooth shave time after time.  </li>
            <li> I bought it :)</li>
            <li> More plastic.  </li>
            <li> I swear shaves better.  </li>
            <li> I picked this panasonic razor based on a rating where a guy said he&#x27;d been using electric for many years and this was the closest shave he had had.</li>
            <li> excellent condition, shaves as close as a triple regular blade.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the purchase at present.</li>
            <li> Love would order another</li>
            <li> Love this razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure a lot of people prefer foil shavers to rotaries, and that they work well for them.</li>
            <li> I have had many cordless shaver.  </li>
            <li> I love the razor and it out shaves the Braun.</li>
            <li> and I think I&#x27;m like the Panasonic&#x27;s suit me better.</li>
            <li> one good thing I&#x27;ll say about this unit is how easy it is to clean.</li>
            <li> I could not be more pleased at the performance and value.</li>
            <li> I reckon I will be able to use it for quite a while before I have to replace the blades and foil.</li>
            <li> The foil and blades are so much more cheaper for this unit than the quad blade max</li>
            <li> Better than anything</li>
            <li> so I shave mostly in the shower with glycerin bar soap which I also use for bathing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have owned this for more than 4 years now.  </li>
            <li> After exploring my choices, and reading the reviews for many electric shavers, I decided to go with this Panasonic.</li>
            <li> It still holds a charge for a week or more</li>
            <li> The best part is I haven&#x27;t cut my upper lip since I&#x27;ve started using this razor.  </li>
            <li> This one is even better.  </li>
            <li> but this is still better than razors costing 2-4 times as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a bit more than a month now.</li>
            <li> It does an excellent job and actually gives you about 12 shaves before it needs recharging.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t rush to review it then.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had an electric razor for more than 30 years.  </li>
            <li> That said, I still am using it more than 90% of the time.  </li>
            <li> I like being able to use it in the shower and contrary to some of the reviews</li>
            <li> I love this shaver.  </li>
            <li> Yet, I did not give more stars because this blade is advertised as a man&#x27;s blade.  </li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s shape is better than the circular shape of most electric shavers.</li>
            <li> However, I can say the recipient of this gift was very pleaed with it and had great raves about it.  </li>
            <li> Most of them are 5.</li>
            <li> just use more water.  </li>
            <li> The best thing about it from my standpoint is how quiet it is!  </li>
            <li> It works better than most electric shavers I have tried.</li>
            <li> My favorite shaver I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Used it for years and thought that a Braun would be better.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best!</li>
            <li> Better type for him.  </li>
            <li> but many have said it gives a close shave then as well.  </li>
            <li> I still prefer the braun 6520 foil/trimmer design and its overall shave though even though that one isn&#x27;t perfect either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric razors about 15 to 20 years ago and they did not get any better.  </li>
            <li> Fast charging and great shaves</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s magic.  </li>
            <li> and I still love it.  </li>
            <li> I love how it&#x27;s washable too.</li>
            <li> Glad I finally found something that perfectly meets my needs.</li>
            <li> I upgraded from a rotary shaver, and this works much better.</li>
            <li> its okay.</li>
            <li> The ES8103s simply delivers the best shave I have ever head.  </li>
            <li> An all-around great razor for me, I love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There have been many comments on battery life.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps your experience might be better than mine.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried many types of razors.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and have felt like you have tried so many and and are still looking for a satisfying shave, by all means try this one.</li>
            <li> Alex is completely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned 6 or 7 electric razors, mostly inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> Works well to shave my legs, I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift to myself in 2010, and almost a year later and its working flawlessly.  </li>
            <li> For the price and efficacy, I can&#x27;t think of a better razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li> The shave is still among the better I&#x27;ve had from an electric razor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still satisfied with it though, I just need to remind myself to bring the charger if I&#x27;m going on extended business</li>
            <li> The shave is still among the better I&#x27;ve had from an electric razor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still satisfied with it though, I just need to remind myself to bring the charger if I&#x27;m going on extended business trips.</li>
            <li> Has a \\&quot;Soft\\&quot; mode, making shaving more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Good battery and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this model shaver for many, many years.</li>
            <li> All I can say is this razor is much better than any Norelco I have owned.  </li>
            <li> ok..</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t love it..</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s ok..</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I had one of these for years and love the Panasonic quality.</li>
            <li> and I believe in starting him off with the best.</li>
            <li> I have owned many electric shavers and none has given me the satisfaction that this Panasonic has.  </li>
            <li> Overall an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Will write more after I get</li>
            <li> Have to buy more.</li>
            <li> They claimed you might not get a better shave from any razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Ok just received this.&lt;br /&gt;Charging....</li>
            <li> I think I can do better.</li>
            <li> This is better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that any razor can do a better job of a shave than this one?&lt;br</li>
            <li> Two blade was better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll shave with this in many directions.</li>
            <li> It looks ok?</li>
            <li> find it entertaining the lathering up of the soap on my face with this razor.</li>
            <li> Lathers more after I run water over the blades.</li>
            <li> After more experience with this.</li>
            <li> Two blade was better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll shave with this in many directions.</li>
            <li> It looks ok?</li>
            <li> find it entertaining the lathering up of the soap on my face with this razor.</li>
            <li> Lathers more after I run water over the blades.</li>
            <li> After more experience with this.</li>
            <li> Works better than my Philips HQ9070, which misses a number of hair.</li>
            <li> He was very happy with it and requested same one as replacement.</li>
            <li> so if you wait for better results, you won&#x27;t be able to return it...</li>
            <li> it seems that I am re-charging it more than the Norelco.</li>
            <li> I have had many electric shavers over the years, but this one is exceptional.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Glad she bought it for me.</li>
            <li> This one performs so much better.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice smooth shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li> but I mostly don&#x27;t do those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t shave any better to me.</li>
            <li> my favorite is the panasonic es8103s 4.8 stars, panasonic ES-LA63-S 4.5 stars, too bulky;</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t used a hand razor since, well satisfied</li>
            <li> &gt; Annual replacement cost of foil should not be 50% or more than the shaver</li>
            <li> It may resonate sometime but is ok.</li>
            <li> The shaver head will bend to the contour of your face, most notably your jawline&lt;</li>
            <li> Excellent product; this is my second one.</li>
            <li> My only knock is it doesn&#x27;t do great on the neck with longer hairs, but I&#x27;ve never had an electric shaver that does a good job there.</li>
            <li> I love the responsiveness of the flexible shaver head, and the electronic display for battery life was also a convenient feature.  </li>
            <li> about a month.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts, but after 3 weeks my beard, face or razor is getting  better, or all 3.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m glad for that.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> It is getting better though.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re shaving hair more than about 3mm or 1/8 in.</li>
            <li> After checking various web sites, I selected the Panasonic ES8103S because of the features and the excellent price I found on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The Norelcos and the Braun that I owned were all top of the line models as well, I&#x27;m not a cheapskate.  </li>
            <li> so much more superior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought this February 2013 and paid more than I ever had for a shaver.  </li>
            <li> Looks like it is just more planned obsolescence.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be much better than I  found it.</li>
            <li> Simply put, this is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> They are simply the best and keep getting better.  </li>
            <li> Look no further, this is the best shaver for the money you can buy.</li>
            <li> All in all, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s one of my best purchases of the last year.</li>
            <li> The Remington design is better and easier to use.)  </li>
            <li> --I get many shaves from one charge.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s almost no place on my face where you get most of the blades to contact your skin.  </li>
            <li> I was going to get the 4 blade model but would have paid $40 dollars more.  </li>
            <li> Been using it for a month, still love it.  </li>
            <li> My favorite razor.</li>
            <li> In doing research for this purchase, I decided my top price would be $100.  </li>
            <li> I cannot imagine spending more than that for an electric razor.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> First rate quality, first rate design, and superb shave.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I also have 4-blade shaver from panasonic and it definately works better compared to this one.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s contoured to fit the hand nicely.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver mostly for the sideburn trimmer to trim my mustache and around the edges of my beard.  </li>
            <li> I love the charge.  </li>
            <li> Better shave than with my Braun.</li>
            <li> and you can get many years out of it.</li>
            <li> Do not let this shaver sit on the charger for more than 40 minutes ever.</li>
            <li> have shaved with it 3 times now and love it :)</li>
            <li> Really glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> How many shavers hit the landfills around the world every year with the toxic batteries still inside them?&lt;br</li>
            <li> but yet we allow this to pass as OK.</li>
            <li> On top of that, what are the effects of all these toxic batteries going into our environment?&lt;br /&gt;Why</li>
            <li> I mostly use it with lather, but sometimes without.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s recharging capabilities are excellent and last every bit of the fourteen days.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to replace the foil/blade every 12 months which you can get here on Amazon - kit Panasonic WES9013PC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using Panasonic wet/dry razors for more than fifteen years.</li>
            <li> I like the Series 7 somewhat better</li>
            <li> The Panasonic is light-years better than the travel razor it is replacing, which was a Braun priced between this one and the Series 7.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a ok shaver, but save your money and get a Braun</li>
            <li> instead it&#x27;s just a better product.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s pleased</li>
            <li> Had the raiser now for more than 6 months, maybe a year?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend any more to get a fancier razor.</li>
            <li> I also use in and out of shower, but prefer to do it before the shower, seems to work better that way.</li>
            <li> This is much better for me than blades and water, but I&#x27;ll probably replace my Norelco&#x27;s shaving head and use that machine instead.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic ES shaver provides a good close shave, however, most importantly, it is easy to clean and maintain.  </li>
            <li> My dad is pleased with this razor.</li>
            <li> but this one is ok to get started out on electrical shavers. &#x27;</li>
            <li> , u just have to work more at it.</li>
            <li> Love this one.</li>
            <li> My hubby requested an electric razor and after going through many reviews I decided on this one.</li>
            <li> This shaver gives a close smooth shave all your wives/girlfriends will appreciate!</li>
            <li> ,MORE SUIT</li>
            <li> Neither of us have found a better shave than we get with the ES8103</li>
            <li> /&gt;works better with a litter water or lather .</li>
            <li> Still much more convenient then a safety razor.</li>
            <li> It tended to pull more than cut...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will update after I have used it more.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver..</li>
            <li> What more could we want, guys?</li>
            <li> I have used electric razors for more than 25 years.</li>
            <li> In the begining, it worked perfectly but 6 months later it stopped working.</li>
            <li> Have been using electric shavers many years and  for the price  </li>
            <li> Still want to explore more.</li>
            <li> I had a Norelco before and felt like I could cover the areas better, but I may just not be use to the Panasonic yet.  </li>
            <li> I think I will like it better</li>
            <li> the more I use it.  </li>
            <li> The best part is that it does not pull his facial hair at all.</li>
            <li> EL PRODUCTO LLEGO OK, TAL Y COMO LO OFRECIERON ESTOY TOTALMENTE SATISFECHO CON EL MISMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hat tip to reviewers who said the three blade was better than the four - I&#x27;ve had it for a week</li>
            <li> I love this shaver.</li>
            <li> I also love the &amp;#34;Time to clean&amp;#34; alert.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m quite pleased.</li>
            <li> Many Norelco&#x27;s are not advertised as wet/dry.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Panasonic model since January 1st, 2013 and have been pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I would knick or cut myself many mornings and that just wouldn&#x27;t do after being permanently placed on the blood thinner Coumadin.    </li>
            <li> SHAVES THE NECK BETTER THAN ANY OF THE THREE PANASONICS</li>
            <li> I have used an electric shaver for many years.  </li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I never leave reviews but for this one I hope this saves someone money and decides to stick with shaving until something better comes out.</li>
            <li> Sturdy Construction, packaged well, works better than any Razor I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> I was able to kinda go all around after I thought I had gotten it all</li>
            <li> Love this razor...</li>
            <li> I seem to get a better shave.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic electric shaver!</li>
            <li> I am glad I went with this razor.</li>
            <li> Used a couple of Norelco shavers for years and was happy, but this shaver gives a much closer shave.  </li>
            <li> I totally love this razor</li>
            <li> I love how it&#x27;s waterproof</li>
            <li> After thoroughly evaluating many reviews here and elsewhere, I picked this Shaver out for a Christmas gift my wife could put under the tree for me.  </li>
            <li> It did seem to work better in the water with shaving cream</li>
            <li> and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> I cleaned it (more thoroughly than just empting the captured hair)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a &#x27;rotary&#x27; style shaver for many years...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m extremely pleased and would recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
            <li> After 2-3 years, I decided to look for something better.</li>
            <li> and they shaved much better.</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t sure what sort of quality Panasonic would have in this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric razors for most of my life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I will have to replace the blades soon, but for now they are still getting the job done.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in many years</li>
            <li> LOVE being able to use this in the shower - just soap up and shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to say that about an electric shaver before.</li>
            <li> I love this razor, it is my every day (</li>
            <li> Gave this to husband for gift and he is really enjoying it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure.</li>
            <li> They feel more like tweezers or a band-aid than clippers.  </li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for probably 40 years, and I&#x27;ve tried most brands.  </li>
            <li> I researched this thoroughly and am well pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> and he is satisfied with his.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s hope their customer service is better than The Nerds.</li>
            <li> It shouldn&#x27;t sell for any more than $50.</li>
            <li> I still am keeping my Hydro 3 and the blades I&#x27;ve been able to find, but just for a backup.  </li>
            <li> The razor you see in the picture, on top.</li>
            <li> more words required.  </li>
            <li> 2 more</li>
            <li> I probably have heavier growth than most men.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Based on my experiments the gel works better than the foamy.</li>
            <li> Better than my razor ever was.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I made</li>
            <li> so I am saving more time when I leave from home.</li>
            <li> It looks great, too, not that that really matters to most guys.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice smooth shave, but can cut you if you have pimple.</li>
            <li> OK for travelling</li>
            <li> After using Norelco for many years, decided to try something else.  </li>
            <li> Keep trying shaver makers, maybe some day a product better than Norelco will emerge.  </li>
            <li> and I knew not to expect to be able to use it exclusively.</li>
            <li> I had a Braun many years ago</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see too many men walking around with</li>
            <li> But I still find it doesn&#x27;t do a flawless job even on short stubble.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Manufactures make better batteries.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my purchase, one for me and one for my Dad.  </li>
            <li> Even when my wife gifted me one -</li>
            <li> Felt much better now.  </li>
            <li> one might even call it sexy.</li>
            <li> , my girlfriend bought the slightly better Panasonic ES8249S model --</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s no longer sold, but it has 4 blades and 13,000 RPM and it works MUCH better</li>
            <li> that I know works better</li>
            <li> Might just take more time for my face to get used to this one?</li>
            <li> Of course, it takes much longer to shave than with a blade (40 minutes or so for me), but I&#x27;m more than happy with the results I&#x27;ve achieved.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i love it~~</li>
            <li> A closer, comfortable shave, and quieter to boot!</li>
            <li> quality on a two-day beard was EXCELLENT and required no multiple passes except on neck&lt;</li>
            <li> Am ordering two more today.</li>
            <li> are better in quality and performance, this shaver is no slouch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> have only used this shaver twice, but I couldn&#x27;t be more impressed.  </li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m really glad</li>
            <li> My hearing is better than most peoples&#x27;, and it didn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Not the top of the line</li>
            <li> Used that one for too many years without replacing the foil and blades.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned my lesson and will change them more often.  </li>
            <li> Though someones commented that it is noisy but for me the noise is OK</li>
            <li> I noticed during my shave, most of it lands in the sink and not caught in the storage head</li>
            <li> This with shaving cream is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> It takes more time then I would like to spend shaving to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8103S is ok.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps the cleaning part if the most \\&quot;annoying\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> So I mostly used a blade.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than a blade,  </li>
            <li> After a couple of months, I can safely conclude that it does provide a close shave.</li>
            <li> If it did, I&#x27;d give it more stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would gladly purchase this again.</li>
            <li> foils any more</li>
            <li> With the Panasonic electric shaver, I am able to shave every day with not irritation to my neck at all.  </li>
            <li> but it is better than the Braun I had.</li>
            <li> I apply a bit more pressure</li>
            <li> and I find it does a better job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the price, I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> After a weeks use I have found this Wet/Dry shaver to work nothing short of excellent.  </li>
            <li> This shaver gives me almost as close a shave as I get with a blade and when traveling it is much more convenient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for more than a year now</li>
            <li> I will admit that I have never gone more than 2 days</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> I have had for over a year and love it.</li>
            <li> I have bought and eventually returned/discarded so many electric razors over the years that I had given up on them.  </li>
            <li> so I thought I would try one more time.  </li>
            <li> You should give it 30 days to train your beardand not go back to shaving with a razor for the best results...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s never received any more attention than that.</li>
            <li> thinking: better purchase a replacement foil/blades.</li>
            <li> when i use it,it makes big noises!i wonder if it has been broken?not my best choice !</li>
            <li> I am reasonably satisfied.</li>
            <li> a box would have been better though.&lt;br</li>
            <li> would be something better than this</li>
            <li> the shaving head is too narrow.&lt;br /&gt;Takes more time to shave&lt;br /&gt;short battery life&lt;</li>
            <li> This one is better in terms of a closer shave.</li>
            <li> Still better than the remington I was using.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS RAZOR.  </li>
            <li> AND SURE BEATS</li>
            <li> It shaves well on most parts of my face except in the lower part of the neck.</li>
            <li> This shaver is better then others I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> &gt;  Shaved hairs fall into the remove able head</li>
            <li> I am hoping the reviews I read are correct and that he will love this product.</li>
            <li> this shaves better than the rotary ones (with circle-shape blades).</li>
            <li> What I meant by better is &amp;</li>
            <li> More to follow.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more, it still irritated my skin a bit.</li>
            <li> I have used Remington and Braun prior and this is the best!.  </li>
            <li> Now I decided to shave every day once more</li>
            <li> i the spot between the outer foil and the power button lest you accidentally turn on cleaning more and injure yourself.</li>
            <li> All in all, I love it.</li>
            <li> but it does better coming close to my chin beard.</li>
            <li> This is obviously the best shaver</li>
            <li> /&gt;Compared to the Braun 7, my ES8103S has never showed an issue and is much more reliable.</li>
            <li> When my latest started having problems I began the search for a replacement.</li>
            <li> I love the LCD display of battery percent remaining.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not buy if price is over $150, there are better reviewed shavers at that price out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7.5/10</li>
            <li> Bought this as I&#x27;m no longer in Japan to be able to pick up foil and blades.</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> 3-Arc is a life saver,  and I love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only reason why I won&#x27;t give it a perfect mark is because of the price (I keep thinking of the hand bags I didn&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> or  About 4.25 stars!I love it</li>
            <li> The only reason why I won&#x27;t give it a perfect mark is because of the price (I keep thinking of the hand bags I didn&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> It works great, shaves very closely, and I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s still the same awesome shaver.</li>
            <li> Works ok.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased that this isn&#x27;t a problem with the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> It is OK for when we do not go out.</li>
            <li> I called customer service and was told that the pre shave liquid is safe.</li>
            <li> I use it every day, I am completely satisfied, both with the price and quality of this shaver.</li>
            <li> I like this razor better than the Remington I used to use.  </li>
            <li> Norelco and Braun products used to be better before they started manufacturing them in China.  </li>
            <li> It gives a good close shave and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> I love the read-out that tells what charge the batter is at.</li>
            <li> I had been using Braun for years and boy am I glad that I switched.  </li>
            <li> but I was expecting a bit more from Panasonic.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver and is highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I think it takes too many passes to achieve a close shave without irritation.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s much better than my philips architec for 320$.</li>
            <li> I kept trying DE, but in the end I think I had more irritation and nicks than with Schick.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t started week 4 yet, but I expect my results to continue getting better.</li>
            <li> Use soap every once in awhile to keep it most fresh.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After comparing many shavers I decided to go with this one.</li>
            <li> OK, I did my research and looked through the Amazon reviews for shavers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure he would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> His exceptionally smooth face is a plus for me, too!</li>
            <li> am totally satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I have missed a opportunity to buy a better one with discount, so I suggest if you do not need it in a hurry, you can wait to buy a better one.</li>
            <li> Never has an electric razor given me a truly satisfying shave and this one is no match for my Fusion blades.  </li>
            <li> I got this because sometimes the electrics work better around the edges of the jaw line, and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint, plus it&#x27;s saved me during some car rides to meetings.</li>
            <li> in theory it does a better job.</li>
            <li> and I spend about 5/10 minutes most mornings shaving and probably charge 1 time every 7 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this shaver so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i shave my face neck and head with this, been using it for almost two weeks, it does an ok job.</li>
            <li> maybe the four blade would do a better job?</li>
            <li> am saving it for my husband&#x27;s birthday on June 17, but I am sure he is going to love it.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great shaver and way better than the 3 head rotary shavers that cost so much.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints and am glad I chose this model.</li>
            <li> otherwise OK.  </li>
            <li> Some have been better than others, but it is always better to shave in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I have been using electric shavers for over 50 years and my Remington that I have been using (I have been using Remmington shavers for most of those years)</li>
            <li> I love the power meter.  </li>
            <li> I bought this shaver several months ago and have been using it 3 to 4 times a week and am very impressed with the performance!  </li>
            <li> After reading the reviews for many razors I decided to buy this for my boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m quite pleased.  </li>
            <li> I have used this shaver for over a week and it cuts ok.  </li>
            <li> However, after using it on my face and my head, both my face and head started to have many bumps.</li>
            <li> I do not need shave every day like most guys.</li>
            <li> After about 3 months I am completely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I had before it and is holding up much better; the Braun had problems with the trimmer after 8 months.  </li>
            <li> Cost OK.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have it for more than two weeks when the number display went out.  </li>
            <li> Was a Remington foil razor user for many years before trying this razor.  </li>
            <li> Use something better if you have time, but this thing does what I need for my moderate/medium hair growth/coarseness.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work well for me, Braun is 100% better.</li>
            <li> The shaver worked ok, but doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a razor.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I absolutely  love it and battery life</li>
            <li> Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> Love using it with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I love the shaver.</li>
            <li> Electric shaves are never going to be able to replace a razor shave</li>
            <li> and so could have used more than a flimsy cloth travel pouch</li>
            <li> The pop up trimmer gave me better results than I could ever achieve with the Fusion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m exceptionally satisfied.</li>
            <li> A FANTASTIC Shaver!</li>
            <li> Most I have tried snag at the hair and pinch or give you razor burn.</li>
            <li> 10% battery had been used more than 3 times, 1 to 2 times each.</li>
            <li> He can&#x27;t get a close enough shave with an electric unless he&#x27;s in the shower, and this product is the best wet/dry electric we&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> and I am so glad.  </li>
            <li> I love this shaver.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised and better.</li>
            <li> In fact, the emollients in some canned lathers deliver more moisture than whipped lather.</li>
            <li> No electric shaves as close as some of the modern and vintage DE razors; but this electric does a great job and it will not damage your skin.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd Panasonic Men&#x27;s Shaver, and it is by-far my best electric shaver yet!  </li>
            <li> Nine nine nine nine nine nine nine more words.</li>
            <li> Love this shaver.  </li>
            <li> a good, clean shave and the clean-up is easy.  </li>
            <li> At this point I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> It was recommended in Top 10 Foil style electric shavers.  </li>
            <li> so I shave more almost every day.</li>
            <li> Better than the 2 Brauns I have.</li>
            <li> mostly the Panasonic or Norleco 3 circular blade style.  </li>
            <li> I tried one many, many years ago</li>
            <li> Nice, smooth, close shave.</li>
            <li> This is a gift to my father, my father very like it, great.</li>
            <li> 3 more words required.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t mastered the razor yet, but expect it to get better.</li>
            <li> no matter how many times I go over the area.</li>
            <li> This Is better than eitherone.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> What more can I say???  </li>
            <li> But I read that foil shavers shave smoother than rotary ones and I read through many reviews.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> That, I believe I will get better with practice.</li>
            <li> and I get a much better shave</li>
            <li> and it just works better with or without charging cord.</li>
            <li> This is much better than using a razor.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> AS MOST ELECTRIC SHAVERS</li>
            <li> It does best if you use daily.</li>
            <li> I like my Norelco better, but then again, that cost $80.</li>
            <li> Sure, there are all sorts of self cleaning shavers out there with plenty of fancy schmancy options</li>
            <li> After trying several razors, My hubby like this one the best :)</li>
            <li> 20$ shavers perform better.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this shaver and would not hesitate to buy another if necessary.</li>
            <li> I like this much better.</li>
            <li> but it needs a more flexible head.</li>
            <li> My cheaper shavers work better then this one</li>
            <li> Shaves much better than the Norelco I had.  </li>
            <li> Good close shave and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Much better then</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Close shave and better than my Braun series 3.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great product, even the trimmer works surprisingly well</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s better than the Brauns I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> However, this shaver is way better when used wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought Thayers Lavender Witch Hazel to use as an after shave, and it is possibly the best after shave you can buy.  </li>
            <li> I have used many different types and brands of electric razor, and this is the best one I have had.  </li>
            <li> This creates more time/cleanup time shaving which is what we are all trying to mitigate.&lt;br /&gt;-Because</li>
            <li> This creates more time/cleanup time shaving which is what we are all trying to mitigate.&lt;br /&gt;-Because</li>
            <li> Have purchased many Panasonic shavers for my guys over the years.</li>
            <li> I like it better than the Norelco I owned before.</li>
            <li> I really love the quality and closeness of shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> recommend the seller &amp; most of all the Panasonic product any day of the week.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Replaced a Norelco with this razor and it is some what better</li>
            <li> So glad I switched.</li>
            <li> this thing is amazing...being able to rinse and wash it with water.  </li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This thing is so much better on all counts.  </li>
            <li> I love the time saved cleaning it without needing a brush and disassembly.  </li>
            <li> works better than any electric  </li>
            <li> and I sure can&#x27;t shave in 4-5 minutes as some claim,</li>
            <li> I had a Braun shaver forever and thought nothing could ever top it.</li>
            <li> and it is more cost efficient for the electric shaver.</li>
            <li> There are definitely better shavers out there, but you will be shelling out a BUNDLE to purchase them.</li>
            <li> easy to carry and very easy to recharge.  </li>
            <li> this is a very good shave, shaving is pretty easy and smooth...</li>
            <li> pretty good - best results have been right after a hot shower or with shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> I hoped the shape and appearance would be a positive for an old-school kind of guy, but was impressed by the high tech features.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is a nice feature - very useful for the sideburns, as I do grow sideburns.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still going strong, takes a full charge, and gives a good shave.</li>
            <li> I am even more pleased with this latest version, as the shave is the best I have yet experienced, the noise of the shaver is virtually non-existent (compared to all earlier versions), and the feel and quality of the product remain high.  </li>
            <li> This 8103S seems just as good for size and, right now, for sharpness.  </li>
            <li> This electric razor is by far more superior than my Norelco rotary razor!  </li>
            <li> In summary, it gives a great comfortable shave, handles nicely, and appears to be of high quality.</li>
            <li> I hope it will fix itself as I get older and more experienced</li>
            <li> nice floating head, waterproof and easy to wash, battery charge state indicator easy to understand, plastic protective cover fits well and stays on.</li>
            <li> then not shaving really close battery power good cleaning unit is very easy</li>
            <li> We both read about this one &amp; both got very excited.  </li>
            <li> Easy to maintain, easy to use!</li>
            <li> When I received this razor for Christmas I was very excited to alleviate these problems.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very smooth and has a great battery live.  </li>
            <li> Highest recommendations to Panasonic for great new shaver!</li>
            <li> Overall great product, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> The fact that you can clean it under running water is nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice feature to have and let&#x27;s you clean the shaver under running water without fear of damaging the shaver.</li>
            <li> Works great for shaving my head which was the main reason I bought it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and beautiful and cuts very close.</li>
            <li> Nice and clean.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I can no longer get a refund, which is understandable, but I also in good conscience can&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to handle, easy to keep clean and has a good battery life.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son for his 16th birthday as his first razor after reading many good reviews.  </li>
            <li> My dad can operate this on his own and then clean it.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with the old model and this seems almost as good.  </li>
            <li> Gets a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li> You must take your time when using this shaver and when you do, you&#x27;ll find that you get a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li> This shaves better than Norelcos but they&#x27;re pretty good too..</li>
            <li> Gives me a nice, clean shave with no irritation (eventually).&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> It does have a nice way to clean out the stubbles from the blades.</li>
            <li> this provides a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li> Nice clean and close shave.</li>
            <li> it is easy to use and it is easy to clean, gives a good shave.  </li>
            <li> I always thought it must be a gimmick, but for me, it works great - highly recommended.    </li>
            <li> The high speed of the blade is a great plus, as is the wet/dry shave feature.  </li>
            <li> The batery life is great and it charges very quickly and does not make much noise either.</li>
            <li> Both good shavers, depends what your requirements are.&lt;br /&gt;You need to have a way to charge the Panasonic every couple shaves, whereas the Norelco could get you through a week&#x27;s worth of shaving on one charge easily.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic is good for a quick light shave or a touch up</li>
            <li> Also the 14000 RPM makes the whole shaving experience faster and much more pleasant as it eliminates the pulling of stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li> The charge indicator on the front is very accurate and easy to see.</li>
            <li> When cleaning don&#x27;t forget to use liquid soap as it helps keep the head of the shaver very clean.  </li>
            <li> Very clean shaving.</li>
            <li> It gets them both very clean with no cleaner or fuss....instantly.</li>
            <li> Shave very clean and perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does its job and a very clean job at it.</li>
            <li> it is very light weight and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and easy to use, portable and reliable.</li>
            <li> The first impressions with this new one are excellent, very smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li> Light, easy to clean, and holds a good week charge.</li>
            <li> But, honestly, if this lasts for 2 years - I would have got more than my money&#x27;s worth and would gladly buy another one.  </li>
            <li> The first shave wasn&#x27;t good</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8103S Wet/Dry RechargeableElectric Shaver is a pretty good electric shaver.</li>
            <li> It does not shave as closely as a bladed razor but it is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a good razor with plenty of power and this one performs pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> It did a pretty good job, probably a bit of a learning curve on my part.  </li>
            <li> I have always owned a NORELCO shaver and it was pretty good, however the PANASONIC blowes it out of the \\&quot;water\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice feature is to have the battery scale on the front in full view.  </li>
            <li> I must say, the battery life is pretty good on this thing.</li>
            <li> This shaver is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used by a long shot.  </li>
            <li> I have had a couple of Braun and a Norelco  shaver and they were pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Now, after a month, I get pretty good results.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor, so maybe they all suck, but I don&#x27;t get a good shave.  </li>
            <li> This is my first &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; electric shaver (not just a travel shaver), and I feel like it was a good investment.</li>
            <li> Just as the title states, pretty good shave.</li>
            <li> The reviews seemed pretty good, so I gave this one a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good shape, fast shave!</li>
            <li> I get a shave 95% as good as a razor on the first shave.</li>
            <li> Going on 3 months of use and its still just as good as the first day.</li>
            <li> Best shaver I have had in a long time</li>
            <li> It really does give a nice close shave!  </li>
            <li> I consider both of these as minor complaints for a razor that superbly performs</li>
            <li> in all, its a pretty good shaver.</li>
            <li> Still, six years is a pretty good run, and no complaints.</li>
            <li> Breaking my hand was the perfect excuse to be adventurous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Remington was a higher end foil model and it did well (but to be fair, I used that one when my beard wasn&#x27;t as rough/thick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it 6 or 7 times and it does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> Firstly the cost - there was also a $15 off special - and the great reviews.  </li>
            <li> Despite the manual&#x27;s hedging about needing up to a month to get used to the new shaver, I got a great shave from day one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this new shaver now for about 8 shaves and it&#x27;s doing great.  </li>
            <li> , I have to say it does do a great job, his face is as smooth as it is when he uses a real razor.</li>
            <li> Works great for the most sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> I bought this shaver because of all the great reviews it received hoping it would be better than my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best electric razor I have ever used and is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The speed, comfort, closeness used dry are the best of all the shavers I&#x27;ve used.      </li>
            <li> This one is much better, gives a closer shave, is quieter, &amp; cleans up easily.</li>
            <li> The unit charged very quickly and appears it will work for four shaves before requiring a charge.&lt;br /&gt;I would not use this for underarms, but I&#x27;m satisfied using a safety razor for this area.</li>
            <li> so I continue to use it as a dry shaver with excellent results every time.</li>
            <li> I have an older Panasonic 800 series shaver, but this one is the best in shaving that I have experienced, much faster than the older models.</li>
            <li> I got useto using it, its so handy and quick to use, there is no messingaroundwithsoapand water.</li>
            <li> it kind of irritates my skin when i try to do a quick shave.</li>
            <li> I love the wet/dry feature and easy clean-up.</li>
            <li> Nice quality and re-charges quickly.</li>
            <li> The shaver comes in handy for a quick shave</li>
            <li> This shaver is easy on your skin if you don&#x27;t make too many passes</li>
            <li> You can shower with it and he leaves it on shower top landing for easy  access.</li>
            <li> I get the best shaves by shaving dry.  </li>
            <li> (the headblade stuff is excellent) as I didn&#x27;t like using it dry or with water alone, but</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own quite quickly.  </li>
            <li> researched using many of the reviews of razors and decided from one particular review by a fellow that compared two shavers in a very lengthy review that this was the best deal for us.&lt;br</li>
            <li> lol it really gives u a smooth shave</li>
            <li> This Panasonic has a excellent COMFORTABLE face following shave.  </li>
            <li> Once I figured out that a wet shave working in a circular motion and using my favorite gel lather gave me the best results for my skin and beard type</li>
            <li> The best thing I love it about it is that I can do wet shave with it.  </li>
            <li> I was thinking that maybe I should have spent more, but this one turned out to be the best shaver I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> Best shaver ever - very quiet and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a specific set of specs and this seemed to fit the bill perfectly.</li>
            <li> Works great battery life not as good as expected.</li>
            <li> I had many cheap shavers do a way better job.</li>
            <li> He really likes this and feels like he gets a good shave, much better than he was expecting.  </li>
            <li> Also, easy to clean unlike the Norelco I own (taking apart and reconstructing blade arrangement is Mickey Mouse).</li>
            <li> a positive note, the shaver is easy to clean, retains a charge fairly well, feels nice, and the blades don&#x27;t appear to be getting any duller.  </li>
            <li> ,maintainability is very easy with clean up a matter of running the unit under water.  </li>
            <li> it is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> This razor works well and is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> like that the shaver is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> The power monitor is helpful, and it is very easy to clean under running water.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Great shaver...bought this for my elderly father with very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean, and also like the pop-up trimmer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to clean - no need to get the razors with the cleaning stations where they get you for the cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Clean up under running water was very easy and thorough.</li>
            <li> and it is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Shaves close and very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean -</li>
            <li> Considering he is using it every single day, it&#x27;s holding up just great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll make this short and sweet to help you decide more efficiently if this is best for you...</li>
            <li> Electric shavers are great for Ladies with sensitive skin issues as well as Men!</li>
            <li> The Panasonic goes about its job with surgical precision and efficiency; the high-pitch whine it produces is not super-loud, and not unpleasant in a high-tech kind of way.</li>
            <li> The shaver worked great at first however the blades dulled quickly.</li>
            <li> The unit is very light and feels cheap I have been using a Braun Series Seven for Five plus years and still use it.</li>
            <li> , I had no problem getting shaves that are very smooth and comfortable.</li>
            <li> It is very light and comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different pre-shave lotions and found good old Williams Lectric Shave does best.  </li>
            <li> most of the reviews were positive and i am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Who would have thought that a shaver you have manually clean is easier to maintain than one of those self cleaners?!?  </li>
            <li> my husband loves that he can clean it by running it under the faucet!</li>
            <li> but it works just fine and the battery lasts for a week without going for a charge, You should think twice about buying the top of the line, save $$$ and get this model.</li>
            <li> Or you can even use soap to clean it thoroughly!</li>
            <li> It is great for touchups or the odd missed hair, but really great if you want to get cueball smooth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: As of December 13, 2015, this shaver is still working perfectly for me with the original blades and screen (see above).</li>
            <li> As of December 13, 2015, this shaver is still working perfectly for me with the original blades and screen (see above).</li>
            <li> The best way to shave with it is to use it every other day at most.</li>
            <li> It has a quick charge function and is easy to clean and would recommend this product to those looking for a good electric razor.</li>
            <li> As with most other things Amazon had the best price and service.</li>
            <li> it took me a good 15 minutes and a full 60% of battery life each time I tried to shave (the unit got very hot while I was doing this).</li>
            <li> : Sometimes misses hairs under certain spots - looking into the Arc 4 for a good price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My 16 year old son and my husband are both very satisfied with this shaver!</li>
            <li> And the more I try to get my neck clean, the more irritated it becomes.  </li>
            <li> A nice clean and comfortable</li>
            <li> Each morning it would give my face a nice clean and smooth look.  </li>
            <li> you Seller, good packaging, quick service in getting here quickly, and</li>
            <li> It has a very good cleaning mechanism without the need to buy extra cleansers though.  </li>
            <li> This shaver gives a very good shave in a very short time.  </li>
            <li> Very good close shave overall.</li>
            <li> If you are going back and forth through reviews, consider this very good shaver and by all means trust that Panasonic doesn&#x27;t just make cameras.</li>
            <li> and actually it makes a very good work.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> very simple very good</li>
            <li> I consider that very good longevity because of the double duty</li>
            <li> If the power monitor were more accurate this shaver would deserve a 6-star rating.</li>
            <li> I love the display, and the comfortable design of the unit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed at how close it shaves and with minimal irritation.</li>
            <li> More importantly, it doesn&#x27;t shave when plugged in, which means you always have to time the charge correctly.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts a long time, the razor has a nice contour that fits in my hand well, and the display feature with the batter power is great.  </li>
            <li> Yep, the Panasonic Nano shaver is the best I&#x27;ve ever used, and by a fairly wide margin.    </li>
            <li> Almost forgot the most important part, function...</li>
            <li> My husband indicated that there is no pulling of the skin which helps for a more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver and I&#x27;m very pleased.  </li>
            <li> The % charge display is convenient for understanding when charging is needed (better than just a warning light).  </li>
            <li> There is much more cheap plastic</li>
            <li> and then so it glides more freely.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic does a great job all the way around and shaves almost as close as an old school razor (without the razor burn).  </li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s a great product, my skin is just too sensitive.</li>
            <li> the situation changes with time, I will update this review, but so far, works really great.</li>
            <li> but the wet shave is AWESOME.</li>
            <li> Most importantly is the quality of the shave.</li>
            <li> Then the battery life between recharging started becoming noticeable shorter.  </li>
            <li> Everything so far is pretty much perfect  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic shaver at a fraction of the price of a Braun with more features.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;ES8103s is lighter and more smooth.</li>
            <li> Probably will be better off buying a cheap razor from WalMart.</li>
            <li> but since I have an incredibly nosey spouse, it was discovered and used the same day it was delivered to my house.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the performance of this shaver, but at about 15 months of use, it started working intermittently and then completely stopped working (wouldn&#x27;t turn on).</li>
            <li> and I was getting a closer more comfortable shave with</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> And I love his smooth face.</li>
            <li> This shaves a lot cleaner, more comfortable, deeper, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about cuts.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still the closest, most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>

            <li> WOW, great shaver.  </li>
            <li> It seems that most shavers today are made in China and are cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> Just OK - I have given it the 30+ days that Panasonic said it takes to get comfortable with it</li>
            <li> Great razor took me some time to get used to it, but now i am completely satasified</li>

            <li> i have had this model for over a year now and would say that this razor does a good job and the battery holds up reasonably well.</li>
            <li> In the end, I just wanted a close, good electric shaver that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and that&#x27;s what I got at a reasonable price.  </li>

            <li> The shipping from Amazon was fast and packaging was good.</li>
            <li> That being said, Panasonic is a good all-around shaver.  </li>
            <li> The replacement blades for this are reasonable, also, price wise and seem sturdy compared to the triple-head razors.</li>

            <li> I have not had any problems at all with the lcd readout and like the way it lets you know when it needs to be cleaned which is very easy and quick to do.</li>
            <li> works great,  easy clean-up,  clear directions,  light in the hand with good ergonomics,  held the first charge for 8-9 shaves.  </li>
            <li> I was prepared to spend $150+ on the more fancy electrics, but this one had the best overall reviews, and for once, they were right.</li>

            <li> I have always used Remington brand electric shavers and loved them - close good, but dry shaves.</li>
            <li> The new shaver gives an amazingly close shave!  </li>
            <li> He loves this one so much, figured he&#x27;d love it again! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are better ones out there, but the battery is strong and it gives me a pretty nice, clean, close shave with a couple of passes.</li>
            <li> The blades are still good as new and it is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a great feel to it since it is rubberized on the back and sides and feels very comfortable.</li>
            <li> SHAVER.IT IS VERY LIGHT TO HOLD AND EASY TO CLEAN WITH WATER</li>
            <li> 40 seconds to clean a shaver is pretty darn good.     </li>
            <li> It says it gets 14 shaves to a full charge-don&#x27;t believe it!  </li>
            <li> This is one example where paying more gets you your money&#x27;s worth!</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good about !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this and other Panasonics for years, and they&#x27;re the best electrics I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> It took about eleven passes to get a good shave and an additional nine under my chin to make that area as smooth as I prefer, which is pretty smooth, let me warn you.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor I have ever owned, but lets face it guys, while a little more hassle, nothing competes with a razor shave.  </li>
            <li> Purchased ES8103S due to excellent reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was such a good choice!</li>
            <li> The other best thing is that it is waterproof.  </li>
            <li> Used other products before, but this is best.</li>
            <li> Seems to perform better &amp;#34;wet,&amp;#34; although using it in this manner is not environmentally friendly, as consuming oceans of water if used while showering.</li>
            <li> It takes significantly longer if you wait more than a couple days between shaves.</li>
            <li> Bought this based on other Amazon reviews and after a month of use I am very impressed with this razor.  </li>
            <li> Other than that shaver works great!</li>

            <li> I use Lotrimin HCL -your pharmacist can order it for you or it is easily found on line.  </li>
            <li> It makes shaving so easy.</li>
            <li> very quick (about 1 hour) or</li>
            <li> LED display displays % of charge remaining making it easy power</li>
            <li> Very quick recharge is a bonus.</li>
            <li> This razor has a Strong trimmer.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> However, on robustness, comfort, good ergonomics overall, I&#x27;d be apt to give it a 5.  </li>
            <li> The charge lasts 5 or 6 uses and the battery is still going strong after all this time.  </li>
            <li> I strong recommend this razor to any one thinking about purchasing an electric razor.</li>
            <li> My beard is strong, and it would scratch my skin when shaving with razor, so I had to take 3-4 days breaks between shaves.</li>
            <li> I shave him frequently myself and although it does an ok job, it certainly isn&#x27;t as good as it sounds.  </li>
            <li> Update #5 05/06/2017 - Guess what folks, this shaver is still going strong after 6 years.</li>
            <li> shaver is still going strong after 2 1/2 years of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool looking and shaves pretty good.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> Battery life is decent &amp; charges very quickly: 1 charge is probably good for 45 mins shave time, about 1/2 dozen shaves.</li>
            <li> I had an older model that was a really good razor.</li>
            <li> It was a good upgrade from my older Panasonic shaver, and I will not hesitate to recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Figured I&#x27;d spend some decent coin to get a good shaver.</li>
            <li> A fresh cutter and block delivers a comfortable and effective shave.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> After 3 years of continuous usage - 3 times a week - it is going strong, except I had to replace the Outer Foil around 18 months, as it wore out and started scratching my face.  </li>
            <li> The good news is that when you do you end up with a decent shave.</li>
            <li> Great foils for a close shave and a nice trimmer to buzz the rough off.</li>
            <li> This new model (8103) does a very good job at the first cut</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone wanting a good electric razor.</li>
            <li> I found this Panasonic highly rated and at a good price.</li>
            <li> Highly efficent, good recharge holding.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice close shave (for me anyways) and charges very fast.</li>
            <li> Holds a good charge highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased my Panasonic ES8103S right here on Amazon in January 2010 and it has worked excellent up until just yesterday February 19, 2015 when it suddenly stopped taking a charge.</li>
            <li> About 8 years ago, my first electrical shaver was a Panasonic, which I think it was easy to use when I found out how handy a electrical shaver could be and amount of time</li>
            <li> Very comfortable shave with no razor burn and it&#x27;s shaves quickly.</li>
            <li> it went through it quickly, leaving my face very smooth.</li>
            <li> Great shaver for general trimming.</li>
            <li> what was most important for me is how good it seemed to be with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a pretty amazing razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a pretty amazing razor.</li>
            <li> Great: price, quality, brand and product in general.</li>
            <li> I was originally going for a Norelco Rotary, but most reviews warned that the foil could fall off from the blades and you could get cut or that the razor itself was made of cheap material.    </li>
            <li> That may be true for some beards, but mine requires more than one pass.  </li>
            <li> If I redesigned the razor, I would consider having three, full width blades and screens for greater coverage and fewer required passes.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is also pretty handy.  </li>
            <li> he&#x27;d use whatever--not interested in buying his own.  </li>
            <li> I have been a tried and true supporter of rotary shavers for better than 30 years...</li>
            <li> Kept a good charge really easy to clean and gave him a really close shave.</li>
            <li> Been using electric razors most of my adult life and this one has by far been the best.</li>
            <li> Not real loud, gets the job done very easily!!</li>
            <li> Hands down the best shaver I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Owned, wore &#x27;em out, and thought some were better than others, but this one has topped them all for comfortable and ease of use that leaves me with a close shave that feels like I&#x27;ve had a clean close shaved.  </li>
            <li> Hands down, this shaver is the best electric shave I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Hands down best electric razor I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> hands down the best!</li>
            <li> The result has been an astonishingly close shave that leaves my face smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li> This Panasonic is hands down the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
            <li> I love the features this has, like the light up LCD screen that shows the battery level and when it&#x27;s time to rinse the blades clean.</li>
            <li> Having used electric shavers for 40 years, this is the smoothest, most comfortable and clean shaving shaver.</li>
            <li> Hands down, the best razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li> good for a fast clean shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Braun and Norelco shavers, and this one is hands down the best I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> Hands down, the best razor I have ever owned!</li>
            <li> I tried the razor (dry) and it did not give a very good shave.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, strong and gave me my first truely perfect shave from an electric.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s by far the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used though, and I highly suggest it.</li>
            <li> In the meantime, since I have no idea when I&#x27;ll have a working razor again (as they offered no turn-around time), I purchased a highly rated &#x27;Panasonic ES 8103 S&#x27; which so far has been excellent.</li>
            <li> My husband loved his new shaver.  </li>
            <li> people that got a defective unit complain instead of getting a new one and trying it out with a fair review.</li>
            <li> the new  ones are just as good.</li>
            <li> The shave is not quite as good as when it was new.  </li>
            <li> Pros:  - easy to clean  - battery lasts 2 weeks  - nice battery status indicator  - the shave is as good as other razors I&#x27;ve used  - pretty good price    </li>
            <li> This shaver works just fine.</li>
            <li> Shaver Works Fine</li>
            <li> My face it works fine on...</li>
            <li> The razor itself continues to work fine</li>
            <li> Comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to charge, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> In comparison to my previous electrics, this one is the best I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> This one cleans fine without that stuff.    </li>
            <li> Have had this one 4 months and the foils seem fine</li>
            <li> You get 10, 20, 30, etc, which is fine.</li>
            <li> The razor still works fine, but it is a pain to have to guess when to charge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He says it is easy to hold and use--shaves are close and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Clean and mostly one pass shaving, easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> It gives a comfortable shave and charges easily.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s a fine shaver.</li>
            <li> When it dries out the display is fine</li>
            <li> It works fine.  </li>
            <li> The side to side pivot was fine, but I didn&#x27;t care for the in and out motion (like a car shock) on my face.</li>
            <li> It felt fine, but it took forever</li>
            <li> It has worked fine for over 20 years.  </li>
            <li> This shaver gives a smooth and easy shave.</li>
            <li> but it works fine</li>
            <li> than the fact that it didn&#x27;t shave worth a crud, this seemed like a pretty good razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shaves were fine, but today</li>
            <li> At first I was very happy with the Panasonic shaver, but enthusiasm has waned over the period of several weeks.  </li>
            <li> This suits me fine.  </li>
            <li> I have this razor for over year and a half and still works perfectly.</li>
            <li> It misses the fine hair on my neck</li>
            <li> Also does a fine job under the chin.</li>
            <li> Build quality looks and feels fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better razors -need to go over many , many times before I get a half-way decent shave.</li>
            <li> razor itself is holding up fine.</li>
            <li> Battery performance is still fine, I can get about 10 shaves per charge.</li>
            <li> Everything went fine, cheers</li>
            <li> It is light, easy to use, and it cleans itself.  </li>
            <li> Like it fine and would recommend to anyone who shaves with an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> I used a three-headed, six-year-old Norelco electric razor that did fine.</li>
            <li> This shaver works fine in, before or after the shower.  </li>
            <li> Works fine.....</li>
            <li> it is easy to use easy to clean and easy to use</li>
            <li> Update: Still working fine as I add this update on August 23, 2014.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fine.</li>
            <li> The pop-up trimmer is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t cut your skin if you use a light touch.</li>
            <li> and till now is working and doing its job just fine.</li>
            <li> It requires all kinds of lotions and creams and after shave balms just to feel fine and hopefully get rid of the redness.</li>
            <li> Easy and comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to recharge.  </li>
            <li> The timmer works just fine.</li>
            <li> Just started using electric shavers, maybe it will be fine once the technique is mastered.</li>
            <li> Around the mouth and chin, it does a fine job but along the jaw and the neck areas, arent as effective.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Another one I just purchased as a spare since I love this shaver so much! :-)</li>
            <li> It is light weight and easy on the face.</li>
            <li> My previous shaver was a Norelco, which was the best I&#x27;d had until now.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly fine for me.</li>
            <li> Cheap and easy care</li>
            <li> /&gt;the light weight device, it is easy to use and does the job.</li>
            <li> The delivery was just fine, as everything I receive from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> working fine.  </li>
            <li> I tried it on my arm hair and it took it out just fine.</li>
            <li> While the shave quality was fine for me, the hair trimmer never worked well and the LCD display gave out within 6 months.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco  Electric Shavers for many years for a quick or weekend shave none of them have even&lt;</li>
            <li> I used for many years, battery life seems to drain quick</li>
            <li> It still charges quickly and lasts for many shaves.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, I haven&#x27;t had to worry about that!</li>
            <li> He can&#x27;t believe how quickly it works, but better yet, how closely it shaves.  </li>
            <li> but it sure is quick and convenient.</li>
            <li> It gives a close shave on most areas of the face and quickly.</li>
            <li> This one is super!</li>
            <li> , it shaves more quickly and feels sturdier -- but</li>
            <li> Quick close shave!</li>
            <li> The rapid charge is a pleasant change from my old shaver that took all night.  </li>
            <li> This provides a good shave, has a decent battery life and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> This Panasonic electric razor is comfortable to use, recharges quickly, and is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> but this razor seems to be quit good at taking it down almost as good a a razor and shave cream.</li>
            <li> This electric razor is incredible and I can use it every single day without any irritation.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much awesome, but it&#x27;s better used wet</li>
            <li> The battery meter looks nice and it&#x27;s nice to know exactly how much juice you have.</li>
            <li> I have tried the new braun and norelco and the Panasonic is by far the best.</li>
            <li> The new Panasonic I bought is clearly the best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clear and the charge on it is really good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean, easy to charge</li>
            <li> Quiet, close shave after a couple of passes, great battery/charges very quickly  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean and easy to carry.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean, easy to charge.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and easy to charge.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy to clean, and the blades are easy to replace.  </li>
            <li> I had asked my wife to find me a razor that is easy to clean and this one seems like it will hit the mark for easy cleaning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Battery life is good so far, about 3 months and still going strong.</li>
            <li> This is my 4th Panasonic razor and I think they&#x27;re great, mainly because the motor is just stronger than what I&#x27;ve experienced in other electrics.  </li>
            <li> This is just one dang fine shaver, holds a charge for weeks, super easy to clean, even in the shower!</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with my shaver and look forward to many more close, comfortable shaves from it.</li>
            <li> The thing I&#x27;m most impressed with is the short amount of time needed for an amazingly closer shave with zero irritation to my pretty sensitive face.  </li>
            <li> clean close shave on my tender face, love that I can run it under the faucet for a better cleaning, recharges very fast</li>
            <li> This razor works quickly, is nicely shaped, fits my hand very well, gives a good readout on the battery level, and recharges fast, even for a quick shave.  </li>
            <li> The screen has held up perfectly (the Braun screen would lose bits here and there, causing the shaver block to grab and chop little bits of skin).</li>
            <li> Hopefully I grow out of this noise, as this is a wonderful little shaver, except for the noise.  </li>
            <li> Except a little noisy when I use it, everything else is very wonderful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the Panasonic ES8103S razor and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Found this shaver is very good and gives a close shave all over my face and neck like the way it cleans and using it as a wet shaver</li>
            <li> It remains to be seen what kind of battery life it has, but if it&#x27;s like my old razor it should go a couple weeks on a charge, which is fine for most business trips.</li>
            <li> It remains to be seen what kind of battery life it has, but if it&#x27;s like my old razor it should go a couple weeks on a charge, which is fine for most business trips.</li>
            <li> partly because of the price from Amazon and free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased .......and would highly recommend it....</li>
            <li> Best razor that I have owned...hands down!</li>
            <li> They clean up easily and give a smooth, close shave</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m going to return it, and spend $150-$200 on a more powerful / advanced one.</li>
            <li> But I cannot stand the huge noise which sounds like car engine.</li>
            <li> But this Panasonic gives an amazing fast and close, comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean, battery lasts, and leaves my face smooth.</li>
            <li> I am not going to return because Amazon can&#x27;t write accurate descriptions in this case.</li>
            <li> I got a 100 dollar Braun to replace it, huge mistake.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers said that 4 and 5 blades are so huge that they have problems shaving under the nose.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> Smooth shave, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> It charges quickly, it&#x27;s easy to use and to clean, but the noise is a huge drawback.</li>
            <li> This shaver was great initially - close and comfortable shaves.</li>
            <li> smooth and close shave that was a cheap and light weight work</li>
            <li> The whole process is so much faster than using a blade, its great.  </li>
            <li> Also, being wet/dry is another huge plus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sold on those 4 and 5 blade shavers, they just look too huge.</li>
            <li> The shaver also doesn&#x27;t break my skin if I go over any raised acne bumps, which was a huge problem with the manual razors.</li>
            <li> Really came in handy on our driving trip.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> In the short time that he has been using it,the results are great.</li>
            <li> A couple of passes and its smooth...</li>
            <li> like I used a Mach 3 razor, skin is smooth</li>
            <li> skin feel smooth  </li>
            <li> This shaver is so smooth and quite.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this shaver.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic shaver.</li>
            <li> comfortable  4.</li>
            <li> easy to clean</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and does provide a close shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been burned before by cheap shavers, and know you get what you pay for, but then there comes a point when you have to remind yourself</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I have a light beard and use a pre-electric shave; just soap when in the shower -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for several years and am generally happy with it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a great price for a Panasonic, which is the only brand of shaver I&#x27;ll buy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean with liquid hand soap, so the optional cleaning machine is not a necessity.</li>
            <li> The product was advertised as provided a close, comfortable shave</li>
            <li> It still takes me 4-5 minutes to shave each morning, but when I&#x27;m done it leaves my face smooth and stubble free.  </li>
            <li> Louder than the norelco but not annoying.  </li>
            <li> Holds a charge well and is easy to clean-</li>
            <li> The shaver does great on my face and jaw line but the neck is a completely different story.  </li>
            <li> The shaver seemed very well built with a nice weight to it.  </li>
            <li> sound, charger cord, and travel case.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my head baby  smooth.</li>
            <li> Great shaver, this is the second one I have owned of this model.  </li>
            <li> Its quite smooth.</li>
            <li> This shaver is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Primarily Norelco but also Remington, Braun and Toshiba.  </li>
            <li> - Easy and inexpensive to clean (had to do it once in</li>
            <li> so I replaced it with a cheap razor</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price :)</li>
            <li> It provides a smooth, close shave and does not irritate his skin.  </li>
            <li> I feel like the shave is closer, and I appreciate the smooth, non-irritating shaving experience.  </li>
            <li> feel is comfortable to handle</li>
            <li> and it did an decently smooth shave.</li>
            <li> The wet/dry feature is fabulous and I wouldn&#x27;t buy a shaver that couldn&#x27;t be used in the shower, it&#x27;s just too convenient.</li>
            <li> All the reviews promised a painless, smooth shave that is about as close as it gets for an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I had a Braun prior to this and was happy with it as well,</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to use and is advertised to use with water and shaving cream.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8103S is a fantastic electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean</li>
            <li> and I found the Norelco didn&#x27;t move as smoothly across the skin as the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> The shave is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It slices through my stubble with ease and gives a smooth, comfortable shave every time.</li>
            <li> Can clean it easily with liquid hand soap.</li>
            <li> Panasonic recommends that the razor be recharged at a comfortable room temperature</li>
            <li> Wet-compatible  Comfortable to use  CONS:  </li>
            <li> This shaver is easy to use and to clean.  </li>
            <li> It takes about four times longer to get a shave that I would not feel comfortable leaving the house.</li>
            <li> So my guess this one will give me great shaves over and over again - but last about 5 years as well...</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to hold, and the head pivots to contour your face.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s really easy to take apart to clean.  </li>
            <li> I was not expecting such a great shave from an electric razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite comfortable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite comfortable.</li>
            <li> I needed an electric razor that would leave my face smooth and not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Overall this shaver works great and appears to be well made.</li>
            <li> but now it cuts smooth.  </li>
            <li> but i understand then i wouldn&#x27;t be as cheap of a price.     </li>
            <li> Cuts close and smooth.</li>
            <li> This shaver is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Easy clean up too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely great for shaving the head and equal to a blade even without shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> found a bit of Argon oil as an aftershave leaves your face smooth as silk.</li>
            <li> but, after my beard was conditioned , the shave was as smooth as a babies bottom.</li>
            <li> And the Panasonic has a fantastic trimmer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Waterproofing means it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It has a comfortable \\&quot;floating head\\&quot; that will adjust to the pressure you use to apply it against your skin and it will also tilt to the contour of your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Which is a rare moment in time :)</li>
            <li> easy to clean.</li>
            <li> comfortable, close shave.</li>
            <li> light, durable,</li>
            <li> Speaking of battery life, the display showing battery percentage (with light) is fantastic.</li>
            <li> After a month or so, I can say it&#x27;s faster and closer than the rotary (which I now keep at work, just in case), and almost as comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Overall seems like a great unit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good design and removes most of my facial hair comfortably.  </li>
            <li> * Light weight and quiet.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> So, enjoy this feature while it is still available.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The built-in ultrasonic cleaning is truly fantastic.</li>
            <li> Easy to use &amp; clean.  </li>
            <li> Overall, i am happy with it.</li>
            <li> Your face will be smooth after using this razor.  </li>
            <li> This is the closest shave, next to a safety razor, I&#x27;ve experienced.</li>
            <li> still don&#x27;t get a smooth shave</li>
            <li> Feels cheap made in China material -1&lt;</li>
            <li> This razor has a fantastic cut.</li>
            <li> feature of this shaver is the close, pain-free, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I passed the shaver lightly hoping that would make a difference, but the hairs were continued to pull.</li>
            <li> So for now, I&#x27;ll stick to the 2 blade model which I find comfortable, and gives a resonable shave.</li>
            <li> Impressions 5 days in, daily: works great, beyond expectations.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I need a trimmer, check, and a comfortable shave, check.  </li>
            <li> It fits comfortably in your hand and is reasonably light in weight.</li>
            <li> Easy to Clean.</li>
            <li> Ease of use was the primary reason</li>
            <li> Much more powerful than my $30 Panasonic 2-blade.</li>
            <li> smooth Larry       ps.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean  </li>
            <li> Completely smooth.  </li>
            <li> All these years, I believed in the marketing hype and used the rotary shavers from Norelco(including arcitec 1050) and lived with the conclusion that if I wanted a smooth silky shave, I will have to use a razor blade.    </li>
            <li> and it leaves my face smooth as a babys bottom.</li>
            <li> Smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and close shave</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how smooth the skin is after a shave.</li>
            <li> get a smooth comfortable shave</li>
            <li> After shaving, the Panasonic comes apart easily for clean up in soapy water.   </li>
            <li> This is a great shaver, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> I would say 99% as smooth as razor, the difference is nominal</li>
            <li> Despite the three weeks without a shaver, I thought this was fantastic customer service.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic.  </li>
            <li> then another 2 or 3 passes to really get a nice shave.  </li>
            <li> If you want a really smooth shave, start with lather and a safety razor follwed by an electric like the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Stays charged for a week and re- charges in an hour.&lt;br /&gt;Feels smooth on my face and gives a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> Charges fast and having the display battery life is nice.</li>
            <li> It is pleasantly smooth, retains it&#x27;s charge.  </li>
            <li> I read the fantastic reviews of the Panasonic es8103s and gave it a try.</li>
            <li> I did some research and thought I&#x27;d try this model for my primary shaver.  </li>
            <li> My face is almost &#x27;baby&#x27; smooth.</li>
            <li> Perhaps moisture is getting inside, or Panasonic&#x27;s LCD screens are simply CHEAP.</li>
            <li> Convenient and comfortable when use it.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast-only issue I would have is their was no bubble wrap in the box to help secure the shaver from bouncing around as box was rightsized but needed some cushioning for the ride to my house.</li>
            <li> It cuts smooth and close...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as smooth as a Mach 3</li>
            <li> The head doesn&#x27;t curve to fit the scalp, but none of them do.    </li>
            <li> It is easy to clean every now and then.</li>
            <li> and the shave was fantastic....</li>
            <li> It is comfortable and smooth and shaves almost as close as a blade.</li>
            <li> It is a smooth operator.</li>
            <li> Light weight</li>
            <li> The shaves I get are close and smooth.</li>
            <li> It also tells you when it&#x27;s time to clean it, and it&#x27;s waterproof so you can easily wash it or shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> and I have skimpy, light beard growth.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> comfortable in</li>
            <li> I found it easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> One important thing to me is that I did NOT get any razor rash.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean and can be washed with water without any problems.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean as it is water proof.</li>
            <li> With my fairly light beard it lasts two weeks between charges.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it 6 stars if they were available.  </li>
            <li> Cheap Plastic seems to be the priority in the manufacturing of the unit.</li>
            <li> issue i have is it does not shave my neck hairs well, but on my face it is absolutely fantastic</li>
            <li> Smooth, so it packs well.</li>
            <li> But, the important part is the shave</li>
            <li> is it is so easy to clean which saves time and hassle</li>
            <li> Along with an unbreakable shower mirror, I shave with soap lather and it takes me about 1-2 minutes for a close, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> Smooth skin and no nicks.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This was such a great testament, I just finished placing another order to replace my husband&#x27;s electric shaver (another brand).</li>
            <li> Sound level is probably equivalent to a Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic and Amazon do a great job of giving side-by-side comparisons of the current shavers.  </li>
            <li> Great shaver especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> When available as &amp;#34;Deal of the day&amp;#34; it&#x27;s a steal.</li>
            <li> I have light morning growth</li>
            <li> so it seems to cut easily and cleanly.  </li>
            <li> It took a bit to get used to, but I really enjoy this style.</li>
            <li> So easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely fabulous deal, given the price these sell for now.</li>
            <li> Yes, I&#x27;m talking about the cheap plastic ones you buy 5 per pack.</li>
            <li> Eventually it will work, but you have to apply it lightly to those stray whiskers.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Sound like mower.&lt;br /&gt;Is</li>
            <li> Overall I am happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Stopped because I could not get a close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to clean and charges fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is a zero skin irritation factor and it&#x27;s easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> I use it with shaving cream and it provides a smooth and close shave, with no skin irritation at all.</li>
            <li> It shaves so smooth.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable Grip    </li>
            <li> it was fairly smooth over my face.</li>
            <li> It cuts smoothly and efficiently.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t feel smooth and</li>
            <li> Even when the firmer setting is chosen, the head still pivots to some degree just not as freely.  </li>
            <li> but this one is very close and feels nice and balanced in my hand.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Product packaging does not show the HydraClean Dock is available as an accessory.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean shaves close.</li>
            <li> Fantastic shaver.</li>
            <li> Works great, especially with Gel.  </li>
            <li> This shaver may not quit be razor smooth but its damn close.</li>
            <li> When i bought it and started using it it went well gave a smooth shave</li>
            <li> Maybe it works great for others, but definitely not for me.</li>

            <li> It is easy to clean and charge.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.    </li>
            <li> Comfortable</li>
            <li> Some great features are the battery level display which shows the percentage of battery life left; the ability to keep plugged in and not over charge (my father is 80 and forgets it all the time); and the water proof feature.</li>
            <li> His face was so smooth.</li>
            <li> Light weight,easy to use</li>

            <li> Easy to clean and charge.  </li>
            <li> Quiet and works great</li>

            <li> and he actually said it was great.</li>
            <li> Great simple electric razor.  </li>

            <li> It is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This shaver works great and shaves closer than my last two Brauns.</li>
            <li> Got free shipping and a $10.00 rebate.  </li>
            <li> Since I was used to a rotary, it felt comfortable and smooth from day one.</li>
            <li> The factors that were important to me about this Panasonic were that it is cordless and can be used in the shower.</li>
            <li> , light shave oil with Dr. Bonner&#x27;s pepperment oil soap, and just the soap.</li>
            <li> Again great razor for the price but don&#x27;t expect the same shave as a 300$ plus razor.</li>

            <li> This gets just as close and leaves my skin baby smooth.</li>
            <li> The swiveling head is also a nice feature, and it can be locked into straight position if a person doesn&#x27;t want it to swivel.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not all that light.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel or look cheap in anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Usage....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth as can be.</li>
            <li> Am learning to get it to where it&#x27;s smooth as can be in any direction.</li>

            <li> easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> five stars if it didn&#x27;t take multiple passes, but it might be more apt to irritate the skin if they redesigned it to cut more aggressively.</li>
            <li> Still, since the shaver itself does a great job, I haven&#x27;t had a big need to use it.</li>
            <li> After a couple months of use, I&#x27;ve found that to be confirmed.  </li>
            <li> Not so comfortable on face.    </li>
            <li> In just a couple weeks of getting used to this Panasonic, my face gets near-up razor smooth, and my neck is closer than I could ever get it with a razor.  </li>
            <li> After using it, my beard is smooth, but not as smooth as when I use the razor.</li>
            <li> Blade and screen still shaves close and irritation free after 2 years.</li>
            <li> the cap works smoothly</li>
            <li> Pros:  - pivot head, shaves well, easy clean up, wet/dry use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons -</li>
            <li> Fortunately, it died about 15 years ago and I switched to the Fatboy.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> : The Panasonic is compact, light and sits well in the hand.</li>

            <li> Easy to wash clean</li>
            <li> After charging and shaving with it just one time my skin has never been so smooth</li>
            <li> hail the mighty profit and dividend!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives a smooth shave as close as you can for an electric.</li>

            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Whenever he uses it, I find that his face feels smooth and always has a close shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Lightweight and comfortable grip</li>
            <li> It appears to be well made and light</li>
            <li> would recommend it because of its price, easy clean up, battery life and quickness.</li>
            <li> and I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> My face felt as smooth as a baby bottom A$$.</li>
            <li> I used a cheap foam, purchased from the Dollar Tree Store.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a close shave and clean up is beyond easy.</li>
            <li> This is important, because you can&#x27;t leave the shaver plugged into an electric outlet all the time.</li>
            <li> It does a great job but again have to make multiple passes.</li>
            <li> It gives a shave as smooth as a blade.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s what he uses and feel comfortable for him.&lt;br /&gt;would</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and charge.</li>
            <li> The shave is smooth &amp; close and the flex-head bends with the curves.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to clean, just run the blades under faucet and rinse the foils.  </li>
            <li> My last Braun greatly outperformed this razor and the blades lasted almost a year.</li>
            <li> sounds more powerful.</li>
            <li> I like the design and the way the parts fit together.  </li>
            <li> Clean up is easy</li>
            <li> Easy to clean as well as you just take the outer foil and run it under water.</li>
            <li> EASY to clean.</li>
            <li> And the led readout of the charge left in the battery, is a great feature also.</li>
            <li> I got this shaver a few weeks ago and can tell you it is one of the best shavers I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Smooth on the face and neck.  </li>
            <li> But when the job is completed it has achieved a close and  smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> The shave is smooth and comfortable.</li>
            <li> In fact, once my brother tried it and liked it so much</li>
            <li> The battery indicator is such a great feature</li>
            <li> (although I really am a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; guy), and a nice price to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Panasonic units feel more powerful than Philips units</li>
            <li> And like I said, my face still feels smooth which is what&#x27;s</li>
            <li> It is light &amp; does the face well</li>
            <li> I am so happy with it that I am considering buying a second to stash in my office.</li>
            <li> Works great on my coarse beard.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean too.  </li>
            <li> As someone who&#x27;s used many different models, I can honestly say that it isn&#x27;t much better than some of the lower-end models I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It provides a close shave, is comfortable to hold and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> sound is great，Real good-looking than the picture，Packaging</li>
            <li> It gives him a clean shave and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It takes forever to get a shave, and even then , it is not a close smooth one...</li>
            <li> Easy to clean .</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> smooth face.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and shaves well and close.</li>
            <li> It works great when I have waited several days to shave.</li>
            <li> Fantastic electric shaved.</li>
            <li> I have been using a cheap rotary Norelco for years.  </li>
            <li> Shaves close and comfortably.  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Flexible head clings to face and neck contours and shape fits hand comfortably.</li>
            <li> I shave my face and head and with this one you cannot beat for a smooth shave...</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Instructions is unclear on how to get the water faucet icon to light up.</li>
            <li> Shaves are close and smooth.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic razor does a pretty good job, the shave is almost as good as a manual razor (on legs anyway), but its pretty loud.</li>
            <li> THIS IS FANTASTIC.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to clean as well.&lt;br /&gt;Wet</li>
            <li> It is easy to remove shaving head, which I rinse clean under running water once a week.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean in shower.</li>
            <li> I used my Dad&#x27;s Panasonic ES8103S and liked it so much I bought one.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and give a close, clean shave.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know its reliability yet, but it works fantastic.</li>
            <li> can be bought for under $80 w/ free shipping on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It is also easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Holds a charge well and is really easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I have a light beard</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s plugged in (recharge mode) it doesn&#x27;t work so keep an eye on the battery life light.</li>
            <li> Close and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I have a fairly light beard but the hairs on my neck/</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, and the charge lasts for a week.</li>
            <li> Feels comfortable in hand.</li>
            <li> but when I switched to using a shaving gel (Edge) I got a close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> This shaver is perfect for the man who razor shaves occasionally, and wants to stay smooth in-between.</li>
            <li> good so far -</li>
            <li> Since I would be without a razor while the battery was being replaced, I bought a current Norelco product (# 8240XL) and it seems to be as good as the Panasonic or even better flowing over my face and getting a close cut.  </li>
            <li> razor cleans up easy with liquid hand soap and water and has a nice sonic cleaning mode to really power clean the heads.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> this one so far is good.  </li>
            <li> It shaves much closer, although it still takes multiple passes to make a perfect shave.  </li>
            <li> so far so good.  </li>
            <li> Nothing but good stuff so far</li>
            <li> I had a Braun I loved for years and this shaves closer, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Good so far +1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> far, the shaver works fairly well.</li>
            <li> and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I used this razor because it does as good a job  </li>
            <li> So far, so good, after one week.  </li>
            <li> But I am deducting a star because it is noisy with a loud hum and the trimmer is not as good as the Norelcos.</li>
            <li> I finally tried this one, and it is clearly superior in many respects.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda loud, which was surprising.</li>
            <li> He has sensitive skin and gets shadow by noon;not a good combination.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using both for 90 days separately the Panasonic was clearly the closer and more effective shave.  </li>
            <li> I am impressed with the fact that it has a&lt;br /&gt;lithium battery and lets me know how much charge is left at the end of my shave.  </li>
            <li> Much superior to my OLD Norelco..closer and smooth shave without pinching..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing this shaver is far more effective on softer/thinner beards....</li>
            <li> The razor gives a good shave although not as close as my old Braun did before they began manufacturing their shavers in China.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> It gives me a good shave so far.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Satisfied overall for the money, but I don&#x27;t think the Panasonic shavers areas good as they used to be.  </li>
            <li> and so far so good.</li>
            <li> The motor on this shaver is far superior to the Remington</li>
            <li> It is about as good as the old Remington</li>
            <li> Great Razor ,better than expected close shave.</li>
            <li> After much research on Amazon, I finally decided that this model was the best bang for the buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t compare), and my old Panasonic was a cheap $20 one that shaved surprisingly well.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> Not as good as my old Norelco rotary.</li>
            <li> I replaced a 10 year old Panasonic that I loved, but whose battery pooped out.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> It works well but not as good as my old Braun 5 series.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one works just as good as the old one and hopefully, I&#x27;ll get another 10 years out of it.</li>
            <li> Shaves good, fast, easy to use, my husband likes it very much.  </li>
            <li> The super high speed must be a good answer to the shaving problem.  </li>
            <li> My first still works great, but needed a new blade and foil, and when I saw this one at such a great deal</li>
            <li> quick clean up!</li>
            <li> This was my first screen style and, cheaper than either the fancier Brauns or another Norelco, this $85 wonder shaves beautifully, cleans easily and apparently would even work in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Consistent, accurate and holds a charge, also easy to transport safely.</li>
            <li> My wife, the true judge of a good shave, had no idea I had purchased a new shaver.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8103S is light but very powerful.  </li>
            <li> The shave is light but very powerful.</li>
            <li> The reviews were excellent, so I bought it on Amazon for $64.00 and received it, as usual, very quickly with no shipping charges.</li>
            <li> It does a beautiful job quickly and quietly.</li>
            <li> i used it dry first time out and results were great!</li>
            <li> i used it dry first time out and results were great!</li>
            <li> The other issue is that sometime it pulls the hair (like when I cut the goatee).&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, very good choice of electric razor if you use it often.</li>
            <li> The display of battery power remaining is a nice touch, and the trimmer action is good (as it was in the older model).  </li>
            <li> This razor works wonderfully and does as good a job as some that cost as much as $190 (which I think is a ridiculous price for a razor).  </li>
            <li> and the razor runs strong at full speed until it dies; there is no \\&quot;petering-out\\&quot; period wherein the motor slows to a pinching crawl before stopping.</li>
            <li> First off, it arrived 22 hours after I ordered it 5 days before Christmas!!  </li>
            <li> Display is very useful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a couple of weeks now and it is very useful.</li>
            <li> Very rarely does it pull a hair..</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does give a very nice shave, it may take a couple extra passes in areas where the hair doesn&#x27;t grow in a uniform direction</li>
            <li> I have never gotten such a close shave than I have with the ES8103S, it is also very gentle on my face, it is so easy to clean with the turbo clean mode feature, and the pop up trimmer is also very good.</li>
            <li> Shave clean, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> the way, I use it for my entire head (scalp and all) and can get 5-7 shaves on one charge and one cleaning, which is great, in my book, just charge up and clean on weekends.</li>
            <li> I have been using Panasonic for many years, but this is so better improved than older</li>
            <li> shaver even tells me when it&#x27;s time to clean and it&#x27;s easy to remove the foil, clean and re-assemble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8103S shaver is light, compact and delivers a comfortable clean shave.  </li>
            <li> He recently got a great job that required him to be clean shaven every day.  </li>
            <li> This one gives a smooth, close shave quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li> This shaver delivers a nice clean shave, very efficiently, without any pulling or skin burn.</li>
            <li> I am a young engineer who dresses well, smells good and likes to be clean and trimmed.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts for about 1/3 of what it used to, and the shave does not feel as close or as smooth as it did originally.</li>
            <li> I first notice how nice it feels to hold the shaver, so hats of to Panasonic for designing such a good grip feel.</li>
            <li> they were right, after shaving for about a month I don&#x27;t want to try any other devices, it is the best.</li>
            <li> Gives a very, very close and comfortable shave, closer than a blade FOR SURE.</li>
            <li> True to many of the other reviews here, the quality of the shave is excellent, and really does rival the closeness of a blade.</li>
            <li> From the first shave it gave me a very comfortable close shave.  </li>
            <li> This does everything right and tells me easily the charge condition, that I think is easy to read anywhere.  </li>
            <li> The battery on my old Panasonic expired after many years of great service, so I decided to buy another rather than a new battery.  </li>
            <li> The battery charge indicator is accurate and it even has an icon to tell when to clean the shaver.</li>
            <li> The shave is smooth, quick and close (even with fine chin hair).  </li>
            <li> As for the Panasonic, I remember that I picked this shaver up in college when my roommate said that it had the most powerful motor available and that meant it could cut the hairs quickly without snagging or causing any irritation.</li>
            <li> AS COMFORTABLE AND CLEAN SHAVING</li>
            <li> In fact, I swear it does the reverse: it leaves my face so clean and smooth</li>
            <li> I clean it whenever the cleaning light comes on, and I change the blades and foil once a year.</li>
            <li> with Jet Clean System, Frustration Free Packaging]], about $240,</li>
            <li> Clean smooth shave&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It charges quickly, holds the charge well, and cleans easily.</li>
            <li> This model shaves even better than the last, and I am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I own an older Panasonic which I have been using for 5 years and when it was time to replace it I looked around and saw this.  </li>
            <li> Like I said, quick and easy.</li>
            <li> , this deserves a small section of its own, this shaver is really great for guys that get a lot of ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> easy to clean....charges quickly.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how it fairs on a full grown beard, but for everyday shaving it is excellent.</li>
            <li> Plus, the battery life on it lasts weeks after full charge and it is water proof, making it easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> I had an older version of this which i liked a lot</li>
            <li> and it cleans with water quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li> At first I was delighted with it, but gradually noticed that it takes repeated passes to give a really close shave.</li>
            <li> Super easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> Quick, easy, and efficient.    </li>
            <li> Really these are minor issues in an otherwise excellent product in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really these are minor issues in an otherwise excellent product in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s not scientific but good enough for a quick apples-to-apples comparison.  </li>
            <li> It was quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> Shaving with this Panasonic is quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> I would first comment that the ES8103S does a good job of shaving both fast and close.  </li>
            <li> mainly i got it since the charger works from 110v to 240v, but it was also nice that this is a sealed shaver that can work in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Quick to shave and gets all the hair on my face fairly easily.</li>
            <li> It did a nice job on my face and a decent job on my neck.</li>
            <li> a result, do not need to go into much detail you want to get shaver&#x27;ll have a pretty good choice</li>
            <li> Caught this one a good price and after a few weeks, I have to say I am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> The batter life is adequate (holds about for 9-10 shaves) and charges very quickly.</li>
            <li> It charges quick and is easy to hold while using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very versatile and does a pretty good job,</li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver that I think gives a good shave in a reasonable length of time.</li>
            <li> The ability to lock or float the head is an added nice feature for different parts of the chin and face and is very easy to clean.    </li>
            <li> &#x27;s : Very easy to clean, works when wet, charges quickly , good shave quality</li>
            <li> The skin on my face is very tender and can get irritated very easily.  </li>
            <li> This provides a very close shave and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great shaver, the only complaint I have is it have to go over my neck beard multiple times for a clean shave, works great on the face!</li>
            <li> It gives me a smooth shave, is easy to handle (pretty light), confortable, and the battery percent left display is a great feature.</li>
            <li> recommend it highly, gives a nice close shave...</li>
            <li> \\&quot;If\\&quot; money was no object I would have purchased the new high-end Braun that is rated as the best overall unit in Consumer Reports</li>
            <li> Its okay didnt shave any better after I bought new blade and screen.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean, charges quickly and lets you know when to recharge it by the lighted percentage numbers on the handle.  </li>
            <li> It charges quickly, lasts about 6 or 7 shaves, and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> It shaves very close and like so many guys my neck area gets irritated easily.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy to clean under the faucet.</li>
            <li> While it easily shaves most areas very well, to me</li>
            <li> The included charger dumps 5.2volts at 1.2 amps into the handle (fast charging), so you can easily get many shaves out of the unit from 20 minutes of charging.</li>
            <li> Shaves close without irritation, easy to clean, quick recharge...</li>
            <li> It is super easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li> Quick charge and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> I am sure that it died because of its exposure to water, but since it is advertised as being good to use in the shower, it did not live up to expectations.  </li>
            <li> It does a GREAT job on the flat surfaces of my face- super smooth.</li>
            <li> It charges fast and is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Quick and super easy to clean and gives a quick, close shave on course whiskers with no cuts!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to hold, cleans up easily under running water, charges quickly, has good charge retention, and has a good strong cutter with a thin foil.</li>
            <li> In general it is good for the money</li>
            <li> From the first time I used it I got a better shave than I have had in years.</li>
            <li> and the wife likes it because I&#x27;m willing to shave more often.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slim and powerful!</li>
            <li> As rechargable electric razors go, this is the best one I have used in the past 5 years.  </li>
            <li> So far I am very pleased with the Panasonic ES 8103.  </li>
            <li> The oscillation frequency of the linear drive is significantly faster than that of the Remington MS3 3700</li>
            <li> It has not disappointed me at all.  </li>
            <li> If you look at the cost over 3 years, the Panasonic would cost $65 whereas the Norelco would cost $117 which exceeds the original cost of the shaver ($100).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found some issues with the shaver that I wanted to append to my original review:&lt;br</li>
            <li> -- I commented on the noise in my original review.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found some issues with the shaver that I wanted to append to my original review:&lt;br</li>
            <li> -- I commented on the noise in my original review.  </li>
            <li> If the first shaver gave a better shave</li>
            <li> well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I was surprised and very pleased with the performance of this one.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver in more than 15 years.  </li>
            <li> For some reason, it seems to hold a charge better then when I first bought it.</li>
            <li> I originally bought the ES-LT41-K Arc3 and the display started to malfunction so within the year&#x27;s warranty</li>
            <li> The sound is not bad though and is frankly not an issue at all.</li>
            <li> I have had one for around 6 years and it still works like a charm, with the original blades.  </li>
            <li> After reading many reviews (thanks everyone!)</li>
            <li> You may have to \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; if you&#x27;re heading out in the evening after originally shaving in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Takes a long time to get a close shave, otherwise great  shaver to take on vacation.</li>
            <li> WELL worth the money!</li>
            <li> At first my husband wanted me to get him a more inexpensive electric razor like the one he had</li>
            <li> and so far I am very satisfied with the quality and the shave performance.</li>
            <li> When I originally read how to do it in the instructions, I dreaded to ever have to do any of that.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think I would be willing to pay more than $65-ish.</li>
            <li> When he first tried it he thought it was just ok.</li>
            <li> My first foil type shaver in many years.  </li>
            <li> I still have my original 8066 as a backup.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise very pleased with the shaver performance so far.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not disappointed after 2 weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> But, even considering those minor detractions, I bought another one on sale to keep as a spare, because THIS IS A GREAT SHAVER.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t buy again even on a significant sale, as was the case this time.</li>
            <li> I am a 77 year old man who is very pleased with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> Do you want all the bells and whistles like shooting soothing shave gel on your pretty face while taking a shower or more doo-dads than a swiss army knife...</li>
            <li> so far I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recall when I purchased the first one as it has been many years.</li>
            <li> The first thought I had shaving with this: &amp;#34;This is the most pleasant-feeling shave ever!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure that goes for anything that isn&#x27;t a razor.</li>
            <li> So far I have been very satisfied.</li>
            <li> and this is the closest and most consistent shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> far I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Cleaner shave and plenty powerful!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gives a closer shave than my rotaries did, but it seems like I have to shave significantly longer to get that close shave.  </li>
            <li> and I was so excited to have this Panasonic</li>
            <li> Original June 2013</li>
            <li> Got it on sale and am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do well with long hair, but it&#x27;s great if you shave every day.</li>
            <li> I am also pretty sure Panasonic gives refunds if you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> And THAT is a significant difference.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my favorite model is out of production, so I tried Panasonic for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s worth investing in!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a shame that they could not have incorporated the original design.</li>
            <li> me smile to give 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I handed it to my bro a fewe days later since he liked it, so I wanted to get one for myself!</li>
            <li> While I originally bought it for $66, newegg had it for $70.</li>
            <li> Works great, holds the charge for a long while &amp; for the pric you cannot beat it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recently I came across the original receipt and operators manual.</li>
            <li> I am still using the original blade and foil, and do not note any appreciable performance decrease.  </li>
            <li> Amazon staff was friendly, however we were not offered anything as compensation for our troubles.  </li>
            <li> Not quite as close a shave as a razor blade and hair grows back quicker, still more enjoyable and conveinent than a razor as no need for shaving gel or water, thus can shave anywhere, even while watching tv!.</li>
            <li> So the money saving in the long run is great as well.</li>
            <li> have the original blade, it does take a bit longer, but still cuts well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought it based on its reviews -- not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> Original review from Nov. 20, 2012</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually review products unless really impressed.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure you will be too.</li>
            <li> Below is the original review where I gave the product five stars.</li>
            <li> I usually finish shaving in &lt;3 min, every 2 days.</li>
            <li> I assume you all know this, but be sure to plug in and charge first.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using the razor long and it seems to working great.</li>
            <li> I love that you can simply pop off the top and run some water over it to clean it, or if you want to get a better clean, just drop some soap in it too.  </li>
            <li> Although I believe a superior Panasonic model was listed at a similar price on Overstock ( it wasn&#x27;t when I checked before this purchase ) , this model seems fine.</li>
            <li> The first shave was decent, not quit as good as the razor I have used for years.</li>
            <li> Overall a good purchase, but don&#x27;t toss your blades yet for a super close shave on the days you need it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a very good shave, but it&#x27;s just a slightly longer cut.</li>
            <li> 6 weeks, my previous razor was a Braun, I used it about 15 years and got very good close shaves.</li>
            <li> All other features are very good however, the head design does not lend itself for a quick clean shave.</li>
            <li> The trimmer on this is small but effective, and I appreciate that it flips out a good inch, which makes it easy to see where sideburns or mustaches need to be trimmed.</li>
            <li> First off this shaver is very friendly to the face.  </li>
            <li> Still has to use a regular razor for the real close smooth shaves, but if he forgets to shave this looks just as good!</li>
            <li> What irritation it has caused is my own fault, because I&#x27;m in need of a new blade/foil.  </li>
            <li> really liked the ES8077, and I still have one that I use as a backup (it&#x27;s almost still new).  </li>
            <li> This new one shaves close a bit quicker, and is easier to clean using a bit of liquid soap and warm water.  </li>
            <li> Great shaver, holds charge still for a very long time.</li>
            <li> In fact it still works great, but its rechargeable battery just doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for very long now, so I thought it was time to replace it.</li>
            <li> it icon even if the unit is clean</li>
            <li> having to clean the blade all the time -</li>
            <li> but it also does a great job dry.  </li>
            <li> 30 seconds to clean...</li>
            <li> clean the blades</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how I can read so many different opinions on it from the reviews.  </li>
            <li> The shaver provides a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m happy with the results using it dry)  </li>
            <li> It comes out clean and you can just let everything air-dry.  </li>
            <li> Quick, comfortable, and for me, close as a blade.  </li>
            <li> - surprisingly loud    - takes several passes for best result    </li>
            <li> Panasonic ES8103S is not the top of of the line shaver, but it performs better than anything I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> No nicks, no razor burn, just super smooth.</li>
            <li> After each shave, I like to clean the razor, and it&#x27;s a dream to do if you use soft-foam soap and follow the directions for cleaning that come with the unit.  </li>
            <li> the shaver gives a clean shave (5-8mins)</li>
            <li> I clean it when it says it&#x27;s time to clean</li>
            <li> clean shave and charge holds for couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> To clean it, just place it under running water for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> so I can clean under running water, the swivel head and the compact charger.</li>
            <li> It works great, and I really like that it clearly displays the amount of charge remaining.  </li>
            <li> I have owned a number of shavers over the last 20 years and this is by far the best one to date.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and accurate and you can use it with or without water, even in the shower if you want.  </li>
            <li> Gives a clean save and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This shaver gives a close clean shave with no irritation at all.  </li>
            <li> I get a clean shave all over my face.</li>
            <li> I like not being dependent on additional products to keep the razor clean.</li>
            <li> I go through shields, so my strategy is to buy the lower end panasonics more frequently, as opposed to buying the top end and then spending money on replacement shields.  </li>
            <li> Also it tells you when you should clean it.  </li>
            <li> Keep your shaver blades and foil clean.</li>
            <li> Provides a quick, close and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is relatively cheap and is a good choice for someone wanting to make a jump from regular razor to electric.</li>
            <li> Basically, the ES8103S can deliver a close, clean shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of different razors and this is the best by far.</li>
            <li> I clean it with a spray bottle of alcohol after each shave.         </li>
            <li> Plus, it will let you know when it&#x27;s time to clean it.  </li>
            <li> Plus I&#x27;d have to clean anything it would miss with a disposable</li>
            <li> This is the easiest electric shaver to clean.</li>
            <li> to clean.</li>
            <li> When it is time to clean the heads, it will tell me that too with a prompt on the led display.</li>
            <li> FOR USE AND FOR CLEAN</li>
            <li> /&gt;No brush to clean it</li>
            <li> The shaver will tell you when to recharge &amp; clean the head of the shaver.  </li>
            <li> Unless you clean this out EVERY time you use it, there are whiskers all over your shirt and sink after you&#x27;re done shaving.  </li>
            <li> It leaves a clean skin without pre shave lotion.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s a lot easier to clean than the rotary models I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> Just take off the screen and rinse, to clean.</li>
            <li> : it makes a clean shave.</li>
            <li> and I have a clean</li>
            <li> clean will be</li>
            <li> good price~~&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s  big sound</li>
            <li> It works like a charm by giving me a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> But it took lot of time to clean the neck and lower chin area , I had to use my Saving blade to clean this.</li>
            <li> and it is shiny and clean.</li>
            <li> but it does provide a clean shave</li>
            <li> It gives a good smooth shave, and I have tried it on my legs as a personal test.</li>
            <li> After using different brands over time this was the best said my 83 year old mate.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s time to clean the shaver.  </li>
            <li> This is the best razor I have ever bought as far as the actual razor goes...</li>
            <li> This is my third Panasonic Wet/Dry shaver and is by far the best one.</li>
            <li> Quick and comfortable and holds its charge well.</li>
            <li> So I am shaving clean my neck, chin and mustache area as I want neither a mustache or beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always clean my razor after every use.</li>
            <li> The motor is much quieter and considerably faster than everything I have experienced.</li>
            <li> I clean it with liquid soap every time I use it and charge it about once a week</li>
            <li> But, this one started better than the others I&#x27;ve had, and after nearly a year, it&#x27;s still holding up better.  </li>
            <li> It is light weight and elegant yet does a very manly job of shaving close without damaging my skin.</li>
            <li> I still have to use my clippers if I want to look clean.</li>
            <li> If you need a clean shave, stick with razors.</li>
            <li> Never has it gave me a clean shave.</li>
            <li> I choose to clean immediately.</li>
            <li> Works well &amp; cuts clean.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to clean it.</li>
            <li> So far a great product and the price was definitly reasonable would recomend.</li>
            <li> it shaved well but felt underowerered and pop up trimmer didn&#x27;t trim as clean as the panasonics.</li>
            <li> Cleaning is a breeze, just hold under tap faucet, optionally using sonic vibration to clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Gives a clean shave&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my husband, he like the speed and the clean cut.</li>
            <li> what I dislike,will not shave clean under the nose area.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the display tell me I need to clean it yet, but I have.  </li>
            <li> I appreciate the fact that it is waterproof (it is easier to clean it by just passing it under the water)</li>
            <li> to clean (because it can be run under the water)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For convenience and ease of memory I simply clean it every time it needs to be recharged</li>
            <li> Get something like this that you can just clean off in the shower/sink.</li>
            <li> You do have to replace the outer foils and inner blades about once a year to keep getting a good smooth shave with no tugging and as of the time of this post you can buy the replacement foil/blade set - Panasonic WES9013PC - for about $34.</li>
            <li> Gives a clean, close shave.</li>
            <li> This is the best for a young teen with acne.  </li>
            <li> As a &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; razor I clean it with liquid soap and rinse it under running water in the sink.</li>
            <li> After joining the police force, I&#x27;m required to have a clean shave.</li>
            <li> However, dry, it worked great.  </li>
            <li> and I can shave in the shower and clean it under water.</li>
            <li> I take the head apart and brush clean all the blades and foils.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is far better than my many Brauns, Norelcos, erc.</li>
            <li> He is pleased with it and shaves more frequently than before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only owned it 6 weeks or so, but so far it&#x27;s the best, closest shaving electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned--</li>
            <li> overall well worth the cost and a great product.</li>
            <li> I use a disposable razor to clean up what the Panasonic misses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many Panasonic shavers, they all worked great, but this one stopped working after a few shaves.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend for one who are expecting clean shave.</li>
            <li> and you can rinse it clean under running water.</li>
            <li> It gives a close, clean shave and is a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> really quiet - works good - recharges quickly - comfortable - blades</li>
            <li> The shaves are great, even on wet/very dry skin.</li>
            <li> so you can clean it with one hand</li>
            <li> Clean shaven every day.  </li>
            <li> Clean up is a snap.</li>
            <li> Braun&#x27;s has a cleaning cradle and some nice touches, but actually this one became my favorite after one day&#x27;s use.  </li>
            <li> wash/ clean up&lt;br /&gt;light and durable&lt;</li>
            <li> Now I get that you don&#x27;t have to clean it every day</li>
            <li> I like the automatic \\&quot;clean\\&quot; icon and the sonic cleaning mode, which make it the easiest shaver to clean that I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> It dry shaves great.</li>
            <li> Not the shavers fault, but, now I get to clean my sink whenever my son shaves.</li>
            <li> like the speed and turbo cleaning with soap,keep&#x27;s the shaver really clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Super-easy to clean,</li>
            <li> Husband has Alzheimers and because he can&#x27;t remember to clean shavers, he thinks they always need replacement.  </li>
            <li> Seems the older I get, the more easy I get nicks from razors, so decided to go to a shaver.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes longer to get a clean shave and the bulkiness doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> He did say he has to &#x27;get used to it&#x27; and had to stretch and pull this skin to get a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> I have Parkinson&#x27;s and still stuck in the life-long habit of being clean shaven.</li>
            <li> but I like that I can clean it and rinse it with soap under water.</li>
            <li> It also is a snap to clean it when needed.</li>
            <li> I have to look in the mirror, use the trimmer to shorten them, and then clean it up.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like scrubs or a beard and like to have the clean shaved look since it matches with my personality.</li>
            <li> Like the display that tells you what the charge level is and when it&#x27;s time to clean the shaver.  </li>
            <li> so I wanted an electric razor for the &amp;#34;final clean up.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> It feels good when shaving, no dry skin or burn.</li>
            <li> It charges SUPER fast, and is very very very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Shaving has always aggravated it, but so does not shaving, as my skin is also very sensitive to my own beard.  </li>
            <li> It is working out very nice for me when the beard gets too long for my razor.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and most were positive so that helped me decided to buy this model.  </li>
            <li> I use the lemon pre-shave oil from \\&quot;The Art of Shaving\\&quot; and cannot be more positive.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this shaver after I had read all the positive reviews here on Amazon, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Just 3 blades but high RPM and very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> After the very first shave my wife immediately noticed how smooth I felt.  </li>
            <li> The Amazon price was the best I found and at the time I purchased the Panasonic there was a $10 rebate being offered so the final price was pretty reasonable.</li>
            <li> since Remington and Norelco pretty much exclusively concentrate their product development efforts on personal care technology like shavers, you&#x27;d think they make the best ones,</li>
            <li> Clean up is easy and has a battery meter right on it.</li>
            <li> Right out of the package, I thought it felt cheap and sounded cheap while shaving, but it is durable and cuts well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, fits comfortably in my hand and provides a pretty close shave.</li>
            <li> It more than meets my needs and recharges pretty quickly as well.</li>
            <li> It holds a good long charge, too, and is easy to wield.</li>
            <li> Really it does a fine job!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shaver, it charges very fast and leaves a very clean shave no matter how much hair you have.</li>
            <li> No electric razor is as good as a blade, but at 2.5 bucks a blade (geeez!), this baby has paid for itself at least three times over (and more like four).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quiet, does a great job (maybe because my old razor was so old and dull by comparison--but this is WONDERFUL), charges quickly, easy to clean, and wet/dry</li>
            <li> Charges much more quickly (30 minutes) than my older Norelco and cleans easily too.  </li>
            <li> Good in the sense that as the blades aren&#x27;t super sharp its very kind on my skin (which is a bonus considering I have sensitive skin).    </li>
            <li> It has a nice feel in your hand, lightweight and makes a high pitch wine when turned on, it&#x27;s pretty neat!    </li>
            <li> Nothing special or super-duper.</li>
            <li> Ya, I still have to scribble certain areas of my face to get  the closeness I desire, but, the comfort of the shave itself is much better and leaves my face feeling quite refreshed afterward.</li>
            <li> : I almost never shave up when using my blade unless special occasion-</li>
            <li> - it doesn&#x27;t seem to make sense to buy a shaver with the special cleaning apparatus that you need to put cartridges into.</li>
            <li> It also needed more than one shot at certain areas, but that was what I was hoping to avoid.</li>
            <li> No matter how many times I pass over certain areas of my neck, this shaver just does not pick up the hairs.  </li>
            <li> but not any thing special</li>
            <li> It uses liquid soap and water and cleans itself with a special turbo mode.</li>
            <li> recommend this to anyone, unless you&#x27;re looking for that &#x27;special&#x27; gift to your father in law.</li>
            <li> All of the reviews were right!</li>
            <li> A switch on the Braun shaver broke off right out of the box: plastic!  </li>
            <li> I am happy with this shaver, it cut closed and clean.</li>
            <li> - this one give a good clean shave, and is comparatively quiet; for about $80, seems a no brainer.</li>
            <li> The end result is a fast clean smooth shave every time!</li>
            <li> You can also take it in the shower and clean with soft soap, which is nice.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic is a decent shaver, a much more high-tech and precise instrument compared to the Remington.</li>
            <li> Near-perfect smoothness with no irritation, redness, or bumps.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that I get the best shave by using very, very light pressure on the initial passes while keeping the machine perpendicular to the area being shaved, and then gradually pressing just a bit harder while varying the angle of the shaving head.</li>
            <li> So I was able to move on to the main contender, the \\&quot;Panasonic\\&quot; with Panasonic technology!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s especially nice to prep my scalp for shaving by going over those pesky areas that are hard to get at with the blade.</li>
            <li> It charges very fast and is easy to clean.      </li>
            <li> He has tried many of the more expensive razors and he is always complaining that they don&#x27;t do a very good job.  </li>
            <li> (so I went ahead and bought 2) :P, still a bit over the top for a &#x60;shaver&#x27;, but, even on the low end they have been priced at over $150 and on the high end, over $500.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reliable, portable, comfortable, high quality, and super easy to clean / super easy to replace the foil and blade.</li>
            <li> The ergonomic design is very comfortable to hold and the foil head follows the contours of my face every bit as good as the triple floating head design I previously used.</li>
            <li> sure the Panasonic Arc 4 is an amazing product but is the extra blade worth $50?</li>
            <li> Edge trim is pretty basic as well and doesn&#x27;t do that great a job.</li>
            <li> Shaves cleanly and closely with no irriration,  Easily cleaned by running hot tap water on cutter head.</li>
            <li> The ES8109S is great, if you are willing to spend the extra $50 - $70 for the drying dock, but not a necessity.  </li>
            <li> It shaves super close to my skin, has an LCD to indicate how full the charge is, and lets me know when I need to clean it.</li>
            <li> in my first shave, it felt so smooth &amp; light that I thought it was not working</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT SHAVER YOU CAN SHAVE IN THE SHOWER OR WHERE EVER DONT WORRY ABOUT GETTING IT WET</li>
            <li> in all I&#x27;d say this was definitely worth the price, and I&#x27;m overall very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this was definitely worth the price, and I&#x27;m overall very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> I liked the first razor so much I bought another one for my house upstate.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery life seems pretty good so far.</li>
            <li> The ES8109S is great, if you are willing to spend the extra $50 - $70 for the drying dock, but not a necessity.</li>
            <li> This machine is very satisfying, I use it generally when I drive to office in a car.</li>
            <li> Really a great product and still working great a few months later.</li>
            <li> I thought the wet shave would be great.  </li>
            <li> It greatly reduces drag and allows the shaver to do its job easier.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I took much more than 3x the time to shave as with my wife&#x27;s and 1.5x as long as my own norelco.  </li>
            <li> It is a joy to shave in the shower, when your beard is wet, it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> This model is a great price point, and it works fine, though I wouldn&#x27;t go for one that has a speed of less than 13,000 (which is what this model has).  </li>
            <li> More like 1 week&#x27;s worth of shaves (3x/week) which is pretty sub-standard.&lt;br /&gt;-Need</li>
            <li> More like 1 week&#x27;s worth of shaves (3x/week) which is pretty sub-standard.&lt;br /&gt;-Need</li>
            <li> Bought it for the ability to get it wet(use sensitive skin shaving cream) which is a nice option</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d like to think that it&#x27;s true with this one.</li>
            <li> Definitely does not shave as good as a razor blade.</li>
            <li> liked my old Braun better.&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic</li>
            <li> Panasonic is faster, cuts whiskers closer, and is not painful (as the rotary shaver was to my skin).</li>
            <li> As with most electrics has a real problem getting under your jaw line.  </li>
            <li> The swivel ability of the shaving head also is a nice improvement from my old razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave, more when shaving against the grain.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d probably replace it at full price if I had to.</li>
            <li> Also the reviews for the current Brauns are not that good.</li>
            <li> Works well with shaving around a full beard and mustache.  </li>
            <li> I was in the market for a rotary shaver, but read some very marginal reviews of them, including Norelco&#x27;s latest product.  </li>
            <li> I found that both shavers did a relatively good job overall.  </li>
            <li> With a safety razor, I could go a full day plus.</li>
            <li> I still spend a good 5 minutes shaving, about the same as the circular triple-head units I have used before, but this one shaves a bit closer.  </li>
            <li> I recommend you spend the extra money to get a good shaver, but no need to get a ton of fancy features.  </li>
            <li> At 77 years old, I do not have a difficlut beard but no matter how I lathered, or how many passes I made, I could not get anyway near the close shave of my good-&#x27;ole Remingtons plus the ES8103 irritated my face.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred a full size trimmer.</li>
            <li> but it was good enough for when I needed to look semi-presentable in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ever let your razor get filled with days/weeks worth of whiskers, foam, lotions, etc.</li>
            <li> and it cut bear deep inside, which is a good point.</li>
            <li> but really is true.</li>
            <li> It shaves nicely and I have no complaints thus far.</li>
            <li> The blades and outer foil are supposed to last a year, but are fairly inexpensive to replace even if they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is one sweet razor.  </li>
            <li> for a full charge.  </li>
            <li> I still find myself quickly going over my neck area with my Fusion razor when I want to get a close clean shave on my neck.</li>
            <li> The Fusion or Proglide shave is much superior but at the exhorbonant price per blade using a good quality razor such as this Panasonic (especially at the discounted price paid) is both an acceptable tradeoff and</li>
            <li> It gives a nice close shave without any irritation (he has sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> The trimmer on the back works surprisingly well for an edge up or rouge hairs.</li>
            <li> The ES8103 charges to full capacity in 1 hour.</li>
            <li> Battery is good enough for about 4 shaves.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, just to be fair, the product seemed well built and solid.</li>
            <li> It is the only one I&#x27;ve owned that does a good job on neck hairs.  </li>
            <li> Very affordable and has many features.  </li>
            <li> Actually, having switched to razor for three weeks, I realized how much I loved the ES8103S and had started taking it for granted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve still never found a shaver that does as well as a blade, but this shaver is pretty much the best I&#x27;ve used in a long time.  </li>
            <li> Good ratings in CU especially at this price.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be a good shaver with all the features at a very middle of the road price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good shaver, provide close shave, only thing I don&#x27;t like about</li>
            <li> The clean, quick performance makes shaving a breeze.</li>
            <li> You cannot shave in three minutes; it takes about the same time to shave with a Panasonic as it does with any good electric shaver ... about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Good production the same as description.</li>
            <li> He is very well pleased with his gift &amp; the Price at the time, one just could not beat it.  </li>
            <li> I usually own modest priced shavers.</li>
            <li> I have tried various electric shavers over the years and NEVER found a one to be really as good as shaving creme and a Gillette Razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also good for mid day touch ups.</li>
            <li> It does a good enough job to get me through the day.</li>
            <li> This reasonably priced shaver has all the performance of the more costly versions with \\&quot;drying</li>
            <li> But that is true of any electric that I have tried, so that is just par for the course.</li>
            <li> In a short, it&#x27;s a good shaver.</li>
            <li> Time wise, this shaver will take about the same time as shaving with a blade-</li>
            <li> The charge hold well and it does a good job with multiple growth levels.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that any electric shaver is efficient like a regular razor, but for this price I shouldn&#x27;t have to go over my leg five times in order to get a good cut.</li>
            <li> I guess Electric razors are only good for getting missed hair after shaving in the shower.</li>
            <li> Shaves quickly and cleanly.  </li>
            <li> Charges fast and the charge lasts through many shaves.</li>
            <li> The only good thing is that the 8103S is quieter.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> Plus the trimmer is full sized and works, unlike the Remington which has a &#x27;toy trimmer&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Panasonic ES8103S (Arc 3) is an overall good shaver for the price.</li>
            <li> Fully charges in about 2 hours and a full charge will give you about 60-90 minutes of shaving.  </li>
            <li> i really don&#x27;t know when i need a replacement will i be able to find it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had and the least I&#x27;ve ever paid for one.  </li>
            <li> If he comes home shaved next time, I&#x27;ll know it was a good deal.</li>
            <li> But it is good enough.  </li>
            <li> A full charge takes about 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Love the speed and the battery really doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;fade&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> With this straight line, apparently it&#x27;s SO much better.</li>
            <li> Recharge time is short, dual voltage good for intl travel.</li>
            <li> Charge last a long time, easy to clean, also very attractive design.  </li>
            <li> Provides a very close shave though i notice the curved hear may require more passes to hit all of the areas.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  quick and clean.</li>
            <li> and I get about 10 shaves on a full charge</li>
            <li> This is not a bad shaver at all; just know that you won&#x27;t get 14 shaves on a full charge.</li>
            <li> He did not want to use disposables, and I wanted a good quality product with all-in-one options to take care of his facial grooming needs.</li>
            <li> If you want to take a chance with this product, I recommend you buy it from a store that has a more reasonable return policy...</li>
            <li> I decided to go back to using an electric after years of using a blade after getting a good deal on the Panasonic</li>
            <li> Plug it in for about an hour to get a full charge</li>
            <li> If you have a full beard you will need to work at shaving with the shaver</li>
            <li> Snap the head back on, and you&#x27;re good to</li>
            <li> Good for several shaves.  </li>
            <li> This is true of your electric razor or throwaway razor.</li>
            <li> I get 8-10 three minute shaves out of a full charge.</li>
            <li> I liked that this one could be used wet/dry, but it wasn&#x27;t as close of a shave as I had been used to with my old razor.</li>
            <li> Overall this shaver is good for the $70 price, so with the price factored in I&#x27;ll give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, for those with a protruding jawline, you will need to stretch your skin quite a bit to be able to get into those corners, whereas some shavers, regardless of expense, can do a much nicer job of this.  </li>
            <li> Seeing people say they are not as good as regular razors.</li>
            <li> I have noticed it does need to be brushed out every day in order to keep a good performance</li>
            <li> /&gt;The build could be better, but for $90 I really have no complaints.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This shaver does seem to get good reviews, so it&#x27;s obviously working well for some guys.</li>
            <li> It charges for a good 12 shaves in only 40 minutes.</li>
            <li> Still good value for the money and a solid machine that keeps on going.</li>
            <li> I went from a full beard to a close shave and had reservations as to the ability of this razor.  </li>
            <li> OVERALL A FAIRLY GOOD SHAVER FOR THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> NEED FULL CHARGE FOR AN EFFICIENT SHAVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get about 10 shaves per charge, though I do have a full beard and</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised how effective the shaver is around the mouth/chin area.  </li>
            <li> : Quiet, good close shave,</li>
            <li> But I have to shave for a while and it seems just good enough on that front...</li>
            <li> the battery between %30 and %80 full</li>
            <li> Whether you think 5 years is a good run or not is up to individual opinion.</li>
            <li> blades will last about a year for a good shave.</li>
            <li> The shave is not as close as it gets with a razor, but definitely good enough.</li>
            <li> I used to look at people on TV and in movies and feel I could never be as cool as they are.</li>
            <li> i was told the the shave is never as good as i can get with a regular razor</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;the shave is not as good as a regular razor</li>
            <li> Would have been nice to include some type of stand to use while charging (my old mode charged inductively).  </li>
            <li> I considered several razors, but selected the Panasonic ES8103S -- and I am delighted that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes the Noreloc cost more but shaving is so much easier.</li>
            <li> No fooling around with blades, shave cream, sink full of water, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands and this one I really like.  </li>
            <li> The shaver is good for a morning or evening touch ups but doesn&#x27;t get as close as a razor especially on the neck area.</li>
            <li> This is a cool feature.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s true with every shaver I&#x27;ve tried thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good quality product that will last.</li>
            <li> am also satisfying about the battery I use it in my cars and its battery good enough whole week.</li>
            <li> I purchased this given the recommendation from The Sweet Home.  </li>
            <li> My husband really likes this shaver but he doesn&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li> so maybe if you don&#x27;t let your stubble grow much it will do better.</li>
            <li> , I feel this model is a sweet spot for value and performance and</li>
            <li> Strengths:&lt;br /&gt;*Very fast charge to 100%; better than advertised.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, its a good razor.</li>
            <li> It is definitely a good product, but I am gonna review it somehow different!</li>
            <li> If I forget, a 5 minute charge would give me one full shave  </li>
            <li> Neither shaved or held up well, despite the specific models getting good reviews/ratings here and in \\&quot;a well known consumer magazine\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to dump those brands after reading that Panasonic and Braun were superior.</li>
            <li> Numerous websites gave this Panasonic model a good review for a value shaver.  </li>
            <li> Good solid feel.  </li>
            <li> Quick and clean.</li>
            <li> only good on one.</li>
            <li> I get about 7 shaves from one full charge.  </li>
            <li> It is closer, the motor is faster, and the battery lasts much longer - one charge lasts more than two weeks even after use of almost two years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not irritate my skin as much as the Norelcos that I have used for many years.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this Panasonic wet/dry rechargeable electric razor.</li>
            <li> Not as good as regular razor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much knowledge about electric shave but after comparing many products, I chose this one.</li>
            <li> Battery is good for a week if fully charge and with indicator showing % left.</li>
            <li> I was not terrible on my skin, but was still a bit rashy after the shave much like the newer model phillips/norelco.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I am not getting nearly as much inflamed acne anymore caused by irritation, mostly just hormonal acne now.</li>
            <li> full charge lasts me about 6-8 shaves, but I also take longer to shave than what the instructions recommend, which is just 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> Charges quickly and is fairly easily to clean.</li>
            <li> Even after a full shave the battery is still at 100%</li>
            <li> overall a good buy for $60</li>
            <li> This is absolutely true.  </li>
            <li> love the battery display and shaves very well.</li>
            <li> Still works good after several years of use.</li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave, infact better than a manual razor.  </li>
            <li> OK is about as much as I care to contribute now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still the same well built shaver, good quality.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Really, I would expect a better build quality.</li>
            <li> value overall, I think, and it looks good, too.</li>
            <li> I read that this one gives a much smoother shave than Remington, even though Remington works better in the neck area.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s twice as quiet , another good feature</li>
            <li> Did not do a good job,so sent it back.</li>
            <li> even though I recently bought a replacement foil and blades I have not replaced them as I am still getting as good a shave</li>
            <li> Does reasonably good job especially when used with shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> and I love it as much as the 5 blade model.</li>
            <li> I mostly use clippers, but they sometimes leave too much hair</li>
            <li> A full charge holds for 5-6 FULL shaves.</li>
            <li> The price for the Panasonic was not bad for the quality at all.</li>
            <li> Each shave uses around 7% of the charge, which is not bad at all.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> This item is not bad at all.</li>
            <li> It does not pull or irritate my sensitive skin, its pretty good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it is not a bad electronic shaver thingy.</li>
            <li> But not bad..</li>
            <li> I know some people can not go that route, so this is not a bad alternative.  </li>
            <li> This one is not bad, but requires soaping and dis-assembly into separate parts.</li>
            <li> have no bad points about this iteam</li>
            <li> For the money, it&#x27;s not a bad product.</li>
            <li> in all, not a bad purchase, and I would do it again.  </li>
            <li> But not a bad shaver.</li>
            <li> The battery was wearing out on that so instead of investing in a new foil I decided to get something new, Very happy with it so far!</li>
            <li> the charge easily lasts 2 weeks (maybe more as I haven&#x27;t really paid that much attention which means it&#x27;s not annoying).  </li>
            <li> Boy, was he glad right from the first use.</li>
            <li> Light weight, shaves VERY close, clean-up is easy</li>
            <li> /&gt;This shaver is fast, smooth, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Wanted a shaver that&#x27;s easy on the skin, easy to handle, doesn&#x27;t overheat, doesn&#x27;t burn, and gets the job done decently.  </li>
            <li> This shaver left tons of irritation, cuts and was super time consuming and didn&#x27;t even do a good job.</li>
            <li> Price was good and provides better performance than the brand I was using previously.</li>
            <li> : FAST, perfect shave in less than 3 min (including goatee trimming)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does a good job, certainly better than the brand I was using previously.</li>
            <li> PRETTY COOL!</li>
            <li> I should mention, however, that I have a very light beard, both in color and in density, and therefore don&#x27;t need a particularly close shave.</li>
            <li> and it wades right and gets things smooth.</li>
            <li> have a light beard and this shaver doesn&#x27;t just cut right through.  </li>
            <li> The shave from the Panasonic isn&#x27;t as good as a new disposable blade, but it&#x27;s pretty close and is a lot better then an old used blade!  </li>
            <li> So, in conclusion, wet shaving with a blade might be better with a cream, and wet shaving with an electric Panasonic seems fine, plus it makes a pleasant humming noise to indicate that your hairs are being ground up effectively (use them as fertilizer).</li>
            <li> It shaves me closer than a razor blade and pretty easy on the skin also.</li>
            <li> The only suggestion I would make is be sure to clean the razor thoroughly after each use and it will perform even better than razors selling for three times the cost.</li>
            <li> Change the foil every year and the blade every 2 years according to the manufacturer/ and that said you can have many many years of high quality fast electric</li>
            <li> Other than those two things I liked everything else, it was very easy to clean, built well, nice battery display, and most important little to no irritation.</li>
            <li> What a great shaver, I should have ordered the new blades &amp; foil several months ago, but it still shaves very well, it will just be more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Good clean shave, long charge, no complaints.</li>
            <li> Right away you will notice a very positive feature: the ES8103s charges very quickly, going from 0% to fully charged in about an hour.  </li>
            <li> Overall I am quite happy with it and would certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li> This electric shaver is exactly what I was looking for: 1) economical, 2)efficient, 3) easy to clean &amp; maintain,</li>
            <li> Other than the fact that the shave is not that great</li>
            <li> But other then that it works great.</li>
            <li> Amazon seems to be having problemss with their order processing and delivery lately as I experienced on this and other orders (which has caused me to start shopping elsewhere), but that is another issue unrelated to this shaver.</li>
            <li> great razor just a overpriced 80 bucks for something that should be going for around 40 other</li>
            <li> I love gadgets - so she thought it would be a great birthday gift - within the first few years our marriage.  </li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I was excited that electric razors might finally be worth using.  </li>
            <li> Bought this due to all of the great ratings but when my husband tried to shave it did not even shave is stubble.  </li>
            <li> Works good and the battery actually last a good long time.</li>
            <li> I had better results than all the others, but not quite as good as a standard razor; however, no razor burn which I normally have problems with regardless of the razor.  </li>
            <li> This one does a good job on the neck, you have to work it a little more because lets face it</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a good razor and it performs better than the flatter-faced Norelco I was using before, but it does take a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic works the best: close shaving, fast, and comfortable;   The Braun also works well, though the noise is a little too loud;   The Norelco gives close shaving, but would leave me with some razor burn most of the times after shaving.    </li>
            <li> Although I always dry shave, it&#x27;s nice that you can use it in the shower and clean it easily without worrying about water damage/rust.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic has a nice wide trimmer for longer hair, and the shaver makes for a smooth easy shave.</li>
            <li> Powerful and clean effect.</li>
            <li> He said it shaves very close and is super easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> electric shaver is super convenient to use, and gives a shave almost as close as the mach3.  </li>
            <li> It charges quickly and I can about a week of use before needing to charge again.</li>
            <li> First time elctric shave user, great product, long life battery</li>
            <li> For a decade or more I stuck with one of the classic block-shaped Remington shavers.</li>
            <li> Quick charging time - goes from 0% to 100% in about an hour for me.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> It made quick work of my beard which I tend to let go 3 to 4 days.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was quick, and was everything I hoped for in a shaver for my head.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used most everything over the years, including a number of Remingtons, 2 Brauns, Gillette razors (blades), and, most recently, 3 different Norelcos.    </li>
            <li> i was lucky to get three shaves from old(8 mths) panasonic.  </li>
            <li> ES8103S is the best shaver I&#x27;ve owned, WITHOUT being the most expensive.  </li>
            <li> I would pay more for the same shaver that was built better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick.</li>
            <li> That said,this thing charges up extremely quickly.</li>
            <li> Shaves close and recharges quickly.  </li>
            <li> Most of the reviews will say the same thing, and there&#x27;s nothing more I can say that hasn&#x27;t been said.  </li>
            <li> It is an updated version of an older model which I had for many years.  </li>
            <li> but it does charge quickly.  </li>
            <li> Before I have been a loyal customer to Philips equipment.</li>
            <li> I would not buy Panasonice again, I might rather stay loyal with Philips.</li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave and is easy to clean without a cleaning dock.</li>
            <li> If you stop off at home for a shave and quick change before an appointment or occasion and the battery is drained, you will need a backup razor or have to show up unshaven...</li>
            <li> A more comfortable shave than my 15 year old Braun.  </li>
            <li> I like this for a quick once over when needed or when I don&#x27;t feel like getting all lathered up.</li>
            <li> The charge is quick @ ~1hr</li>
            <li> My latest, the ES8103 (the product currently reviewed), does not fare much better.  </li>
            <li> Interestingly the difference in the quality of the actual shave is more incremental then one would imagine when comparing the two shavers.</li>
            <li> Wow...had an older electric razor that was top rated some years ago.  </li>
            <li> It charges super quick, and the charge lasts longer than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had been using an older Panasonic wet-dry shaver for many years.</li>
            <li> It does shave well and close, but it is not as quick as others here have stated.</li>
            <li> It charges up quickly ( 1 hour).</li>
            <li> This gives a quick close shave.</li>
            <li> Two days growth can be handled fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried shaving wet with the Panasonic yet, but it will be nice to be able to shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> Quick charge</li>
            <li> I use this razor with shaving cream for a wet shave and it is by far the smoothest and best shave</li>
            <li> Recharges quickly.</li>
            <li> Charges quickly.</li>
            <li> Panasonic ES8103S will serve best for a last minute touch-up, rather than the regular morning shave.  </li>
            <li> I ordered it and got it in about 4 days with the Super Saver shipping.  </li>
            <li> Luckily I shave whenever I want, as I work from home</li>
            <li> if I&#x27;m lucky).  </li>
            <li> Holds a charge quite a while, and recharges quickly.</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal Braun user for decades.</li>
            <li> Next time I will pay more for a better shaver.</li>
            <li> Oh, well I guess a perfect product is more expensive.</li>
            <li> Charges up quickly.</li>
            <li> Like the readout of the percentage remaining and how quickly it charges.  </li>
            <li> Using this for quick leg touch-ups</li>
            <li> I was getting older 70, I needed something better and easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> The charging is quick</li>
            <li> Never found an electric razor that would do an adequate job.</li>
            <li> charges quickly</li>
            <li> Returned it quickly.</li>
            <li> Recharges quickly, blade and screen lasts about three years.</li>
            <li> Battery drains quickly too but recharges quick as well.</li>
            <li> I am sure most electric razors with this technology will have the same result.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stay with my razor blades for now (habit, I suppose), but will be using the Panasonic ES8103S more and more, especially when I travel.</li>
            <li> It recharges quickly.</li>
            <li> Charges quick.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully the battery does not wear out too quickly.  </li>
            <li> It charges quickly.</li>
            <li> All the others I&#x27;ve used have also died dismayingly quickly.</li>
            <li> The wider trimmer that slid straight up on the ES8097 was far superior.</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely tremendous instrument.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a month now - needed all that time to familiarize myself adequately -</li>
            <li> Took a chance having good success with prior Panasonic shaving products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And with quick shipment.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts fora week and recharges quickly, as advertised.</li>
            <li> Overall this has been a great purchase and at this point much cheaper than going with Gillette&#x27;s overpriced cartridges.</li>
            <li> thought was quickly followed up by: &amp;#34;Oh</li>
            <li> Charges quickly and the charge lasts for days.  </li>
            <li> Much better than my older one.</li>
            <li> Charges quick and holds</li>
            <li> The foil has been remarkably durable, more so than the remington micro foil shavers I had in the past.</li>
            <li> Hoping it would be really quick once it is set well.</li>
            <li> This one seemed sturdier and to have overall better reviews than most of the designed-for-women shavers</li>
            <li> Great shaver, recharges fast (in about 1 hour at 220V) but the LCD display is dying with segments disappearing only after 6 months of use.</li>
            <li> It shaves cleanly, quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> It works very well and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I cleaned the foil and blades daily, with soap and warm water (and sometimes rubbing alcohol), and lubricated them with light mineral oil (baby oil).</li>
            <li> This shaver is lightweight and charges quickly.</li>
            <li> The noise level was acceptable and the shaver charged quickly.</li>
            <li> For the money, this product performs an adequate job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast, light, and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Charges quickly and lasts for about 6 shaves on one charge.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it in the shower but it is nice being able to wash it off and wet it to shave with.</li>
            <li> Quick Charge.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband he has told me several times how much he loves its and how great it works</li>
            <li> QUICK.  </li>
            <li> Like most electrics, it definitely gives a better shave on me when not in the shower (does work if that&#x27;s what you are in to).  </li>
            <li> Gives a quick and close shave.  </li>
            <li> I got a closer shave with this razor than I have ever had with an electric and it charged quickly.</li>
            <li> area!&lt;br /&gt;- quick charging&lt;br</li>
            <li> If he spends a lot of time shaving then he gets a super close shave, but even spending 5 minutes</li>
            <li> I like this razor as a quick get up and go shaver.</li>
            <li> It took me about 3 weeks to get the hang of getting some of the spots like under my neck but after that it has been a joy to use and much easier on my face than a regular razor.</li>
            <li> It charges from 0 to 100% rather quickly.</li>
            <li> Charges quickly.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean and cleans up very well.</li>
            <li> It charges rather quickly.</li>
            <li> One will need to perfect their technique since all razors are different but pulling the facial hair against the grain will make it easier for the blades to bite.</li>
            <li> Fairly quick.  </li>
            <li> Fairly quick charge.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, charges quickly, display battery power and have a turbo cleaning mode.  </li>
            <li> , I am completely stunned by how good this unit gets your whiskers off, much closer than Norelco</li>
            <li> a quick update....to get the best possible shave I try to keep the charge at 70% or above and remove the shaving head and brush beard remnants from around the cutters once a week.  </li>
            <li> I would call the battery life extraordinary.</li>
            <li> Super shipping</li>
            <li> On the plus side, it does recharge quickly, and keeps shaving for a couple of weeks before it needs another charge.  </li>
            <li> Quick charging and holds a charge longer than any razor I have owned.</li>
            <li> This shaver also recharges super quick.</li>
            <li> So easy to clean, the wet/dry feature is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> My Remington died and I quickly got on Amazon.com and picked this Panasonic brand.</li>
            <li> however whenever I need a quick shave to tun out somewhere</li>
            <li> The batter lasts for 4-5 shaves and recharges quickly.</li>
            <li> was getting a bit slow and not doing that good of a job and since that model which I liked was no longer being made</li>
            <li> It recharges quickly.  </li>
            <li> I get a close shave quickly.</li>
            <li> What I do expect is for the electric shaver to do an adequate job on off days</li>
            <li> It charges quickly and for those stubborn whiskers that don&#x27;t want to get zapped (the ones beside the throat)</li>
            <li> I was expecting a close, quick, and stubble-free shave.</li>
            <li> is quick.</li>
            <li> battery is amazing for me, I have light amounts of facial hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;Efficient - It does the job quickly.  </li>
            <li> Gentle on my husband&#x27;s skin, easy to use, and delivers a clean and close shave.</li>
            <li> a quick 5 min charge is possible.&lt;br /&gt;-Nice</li>
            <li> /&gt;We couldn&#x27;t afford the (Arc5), I believe it was rated as Best &amp; most expensive.</li>
            <li> , this one came on sale so I could afford it, &amp; I snatched it up quick like too!&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> I have managed to drop mine twice while cleaning it (luckily without damage).  </li>
            <li> Works well enough, gives me a razor smooth shave and is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> remaining, nice little popup trimmer, easy to clean, charges fast, good grip--pretty much everything I could expect in a razor.  </li>
            <li> I could not be happier with this product and highly recommend it :).</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this model, I can&#x27;t see spending any more than the cost of this shaver, even though there are newer models out there.</li>
            <li> But this shaver has so many high reviews for a reason.</li>
            <li> A very reasonably priced.move smoothly across the skin.</li>
            <li> At this time, I highly recommended this shaver to those who have many side burns and neck hairs like me.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend giving this razor a try because if it works for you I think you will love it.</li>
            <li> It has high quality and better style.</li>
            <li> Being able to use it in the shower is highly recommended when shopping for a shaver.  </li>
            <li> I have used a Panasonic shaver in the past and it was very good.  </li>
            <li> By contrast, the first shave with this model was amazingly close and the high-speed motor is pleasantly smooth, though the high-pitched sound is reminiscent of a buzzing wasp.</li>
            <li> razor shaves very mild hair adequately, but not thick or filled  areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was very well pleased with this Panasonic shaver right from the start.  </li>
            <li> According to CR and my own expierence, foil shavers shave a little closer, Norelcos are a bit more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Very nice and lives up to all the ratings provided by other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> the instructions say to give it 2 weeks for your face to get used to the unit, and they are pretty accurate.</li>
            <li> I bought my first Panasonic shaver about seven years ago and have become a huge fan.</li>
            <li> The first shaves were comfortable but not too close.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure this one will last the same, great quality.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very pleased</li>
            <li> I recently bought Panasonic ES8103S and very pleased with the closeness and comfort.</li>
            <li> I finally purchased the Panasonic and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> It generates a noticeably higher pitched sound than any electric shaver I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> However, the Panasonic performed slightly better on the flat cheek areas whereas the Norelco did slightly better on the curved areas around the jaw bone and neck.  </li>
            <li> Overall I have been very pleased and recommended it to my son-in-law.</li>
            <li> If it holds up, then I will be very satisfied with this shaver, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> the very first shave this shaver</li>
            <li> Some electric razor really are noisy, but this on hums so fast, it sounds like a bee buzzing or an electric tooth brush instead of like a barbers clippers like most razors sound.</li>
            <li> and so I listened to some friends and bought the Norelco rotary type (2 0f them), from the very first</li>
            <li> It is light in weight, feels good in the hand, holds a charge well, and tells you how much charge you have left.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with its first performance test: zero discomfort, very efficient and a really close shave too.  </li>
            <li> The pitch of the sound it makes is also much higher.  </li>
            <li> , time consuming.will not want to recommend this, better to use the normal blade.</li>
            <li> Fits the hand well, provides a close shave (although multiple passes help insure this),has excellent battery life and clearly shows how much charge remains.</li>
            <li> Just replaced the blades because it wasn&#x27;t as smooth as when I first got it.</li>
            <li> Very fast recharging (one hour maximum)!</li>
            <li> I have a pretty light beard, and I got used to how close the Norelco could shave without causing irritation.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor knowing I like the other kind of head better</li>
            <li> so am finally pretty comfortable with it.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this razor for about 18 months and although in its first weeks its job was not that great, I can say that nowadays its performance has been pretty solid.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty light beard.  </li>
            <li> Great shaver so far - fast motor, fast charging time, upscale look and feel.</li>
            <li> First of all it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li> I received the product quickly as usual with amazon,and at an incredible price.</li>
            <li> THE MOST QUIET, SMOOTH, EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE SHAVE I HAVE EVER USED.</li>
            <li> If the noise (my biggest peeve) is not a problem, definitely a great buy (on sale, NOT worth $100+).</li>
            <li> The very first shave I did with this unit</li>
            <li> If you have a king tag on your face or neck and have to shave smooth every day, that is what you have to use exactly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice but am very pleased with the purchase.  </li>
            <li> Shaves are pretty close and smooth.</li>
            <li> Wash your face first or not, it&#x27;s so smooth.</li>
            <li> First impression of the Panasonic is the sound.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the top of it can shave any where other than the face and neck effectively.</li>
            <li> Not so, first shave was painless, no redness, and surprisingly smooth.</li>
            <li> I received the product quickly as usual with amazon,and at an incredible price.</li>
            <li> If my dad says it is comfortable and valuable (also cheaper than higher level model)</li>
            <li> I bought both and the Panasonic is significantly cheaper, shaves better, and is no where near as noisy as the Braun.</li>
            <li> but so far I liked my old Norelco better</li>
            <li> As I said before, is not ss good for a long bear.  </li>
            <li> I hope it lasts a good long time.</li>
            <li> When I am done, I give it a good long rinse with the razor running.  </li>
            <li> what and own a shaver that might last me 20-30 years if I took really good care of it.&lt;br /&gt;I found one corded only powered shaver made by Norelco for about $30</li>
            <li> The Remingtons do the best job shaving my fairly heavy beard, and their trimmers are nice and wide for a bit of a trim around the ears.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s asking himself why has he waited so long to use a good product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cuts close, visible charge content, able to alternate between fixed &amp; floating head, good trimmer&lt;</li>
            <li> I used this shaver yesterday for the first time and no irritation at all, super close shave, and very powerful motor.</li>
            <li> Nice use left display and tells when to clean it.  </li>
            <li> I mixed my own cleaning solution for some time until I saw this razor that you clean by throwing some liquid soap on it and rinsing it off.</li>
            <li> Really appreciated the ability to use for water cleaning which is quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I never really got a good shave and needed to manually clean up my neck with a handheld razor.</li>
            <li> It fits in your hand nicely and makes a clean, close shave without having to go over and over the same spot.  </li>
            <li> Works great for people without a lot of facial hair, decent buy.</li>
            <li> decent battery life, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Your face adapts gradually until you get a fast, smooth and clean shave in one or two passes.  </li>
            <li> Currently owned an older model (ES7035) and was reasonably happy with it.</li>
            <li> The ultra-sonic cleaning feature (with the reminder to clean the blades when necessary) is handy.</li>
            <li> and the shave is great all the way down to 10% of battery charge.</li>
            <li> After reading (somewhere) foil razors shave closer (and are louder) than rotary, I researched up and down on for a great razor for under $100.</li>
            <li> With its original screen and cutter, I liked the Braun 1775 a little better as a shaver.  </li>
            <li> Although it was OK, the new Panasonic was a far superior shave with more comfort, less time and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> On the first shave it took a few extra minutes to find the best postions to hold it, but it gave a very clean and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> over three years old and going strong!</li>
            <li> It flips open from the back and looks nice, but it doesn&#x27;t really do that great of a job.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do the best job on soft neck hair, but with a little persistence you can get a perfectly clean shave.  </li>
            <li> Given how simple, yet powerful and useful it is (faster and more precise than a three-head rotary shaver for me.), I could not resist the super sale!</li>
            <li> but it is still way better than this new Panasonic piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Much better with new blades</li>
            <li> With a new head and blades, it can still rival the latest Panasonics.</li>
            <li> So, when it came time to purchase a new one, I thought I would try the new Braun with the \\&quot;odd-shaped\\&quot; holes in the screen that were supposed to give you the best possible shave because this screen captured the hairs from all angles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m stunned how much better this feels than when my Braun was new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it more time and hoping that my beard will adjust and get used to the new shaver, so it can shave even closer.    </li>
            <li> I love this new shaver.  </li>
            <li> The shaver requires going over my face many times, may need new blades already?</li>
            <li> I love my new razor.  </li>
            <li> That said, the batter life is VERY good and when it&#x27;s down to 10% it lasts much longer than you would expect.</li>
            <li> here again the next time you buy&lt;br /&gt;Shaving is very comfortable, easy care</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the performance and the price was exceptional due to a limited time offer.</li>
            <li> Since I previously used a foil shaver, there was no \\&quot;adjustment period\\&quot;; it did not irritate my skin and it gives a great shave every time.</li>
            <li> : Easy to clean, very quick to charge (and so far it holds the charge pretty well)&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Anyway, this shaver still rocks, I just need to be less of a killer when using it, lol.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic had great reviews and was on sale half price.    </li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver on Amazon because I had had a previous Panasonic that had performed well, and the price was attractive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;inverter-charger plug adapter for the U.S. will use the current turkey must take&lt;br /&gt;state-machine charge is not trivial rather cheap does not shave habit of the previous machine was doing was being charged more beautiful bustled tried ..</li>
            <li> I have owned several electric shavers and this Panasonic ES8103S is FAIR at best in shaving my skins smooth in a few passes, when used daily..........</li>
            <li> a great product none the less.</li>
            <li> But those are minor issues considering the amazing shave and smooth skin that results.</li>
            <li> Overall I think it&#x27;s pretty good.    </li>
            <li> Although it takes multiple passes this razor cuts pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Fast close and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, either buy a higher level model or just a low end model which works as good as this one.</li>
            <li> Overall a pretty good deal for its price.</li>
            <li> Dry shaving is still good, but not as close.</li>
            <li> Very close shave, charge lasts for 8-10 shavings, easy to wash/clean.</li>
            <li> This shaver was delivered quickly and was worth even a longer wait.  </li>
            <li> Recharge time is quite quick, useful to know if you forget to recharge, as you can not shave with it while it is being recharged.  </li>
            <li> I considered returning it, but it is useful for trimming the nose and ear hair, I guess, or a quick non-shower shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just my neck hairs that are very resilient or if the shaver is not the greatest</li>
            <li> I have been using Panasonic Wet/Dry shavers for the past 25 years or more and have nothing but good things to say about them.  </li>
            <li> This is much gentler, even though it still does cause very mild irritation.</li>
            <li> BUT this Panasonic is actually doing a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> Good balance but need electric shave for a smoother dry shave.</li>
            <li> So first I  went ahead and bought the top of the line Norelco a month ago, with the auto cleaner and all that, and what I found was that it didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> Does not seem to be as good dry as a rotating razor.</li>
            <li> I tried wet shaves, but prefer a dry shave, although it&#x27;s nice to be able to clean the blades operating and under warm water flow with the cover/comb headpiece removed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very ergonomic, and easy to control.</li>
            <li> Great electric razor, fast recharge, keeps its charge for a long time, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling like I just got</li>
            <li> Much smoother shave than with the Rotarys, cleans easily, and I have used it 8 times before it  needs to be charged.  </li>
            <li> To be totally fair in the process, I thought I should test each razor in both advertised modes, \\&quot;wet\\&quot; and dry.</li>
            <li> The ES8103 does give a very close shave and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy to use, well made, shaves very close (which the Braun didn&#x27;t do).  </li>
            <li> If you slowly go over your face and make sure to rinse the blades every so often, the shave is quite remarkable.</li>
            <li> I was worried at first that it was going to be different but diferentes is good</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works good dry as well-</li>
            <li> About the only thing I can think of that would make this aspect of it better would be if there was a very easy way to replace the battery with a reasonably priced replacement.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I originally thought the numeric display was overkill, but it turns out to be a handy way to tell how many more shaves you can get before recharging (approximately, it shows percent charge remaining).</li>
            <li> this is something I have never been able to do since I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It has been very hot here in the Pittsburgh, PA area, as many are probably aware, since ti has been pretty hot all over the US.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;d be nice if the battery is run down to be able to plug in and have a &amp;#34;tethered&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure more is better (a 4th cutting blade), but it isn&#x27;t worth $30 more for the shaver and 17$ more for the rebuild kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> A single charge is good for ~7 or 8 shaves.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , clean close shave safe, fast charge, quiet and smooth!</li>
            <li> I will probably never go back to shaving cream and a blade after this because its so easy, quick and the clean up is SO easy.</li>
            <li> Unless you find very light foam somehow, I found it more useful use it on dry skins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> NEVER have I had such an easy, quick, comfortable shave...and so smooth.</li>
            <li> First electrical shaver that works on me!</li>
            <li> Going by first impressions, this shaver kicks @ss &amp; chews bubble gum!  </li>
            <li> THIRD time I used it, I freaking love it!</li>
            <li> It didn’t shave as close as a blade, but was pretty darn close!</li>
            <li> Only been using this thing about a week now but absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After my first Panasonic, I changed to a Philips and I realize Philips tri-cyclone style does everything the same but much more comfortable!  </li>
            <li> It gives him a really close shave!!</li>
            <li> First Panasonic!</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and looks new afterwards.</li>
            <li> so I wanted a fresh new out of the box razor and thought this might be worthwhile.  </li>
            <li> Switching to a new shaver takes some getting used to, but after a few weeks it is an awesome shaver</li>
            <li> The three blade razor cuts close and provides a good close shave for loose skin types.</li>
            <li> This shaver works with short stubble, but if I wait a day or 2 (over the weekend, for example), the shaver doesn&#x27;t shave very well, and it tends to snag on beard hairs around my neck (which aint pleasant).</li>
            <li> Previously I owned a good Braun and a cheap Remington.  </li>
            <li> He is very happy with the closeness of the shave and has only needed to use it dry.  </li>
            <li> The only downside with this shaver is that it will nick or burn more easily than the others.  </li>
            <li> your skin doesn&#x27;t get hured.it is very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> But this new one cuts very close and comfortably and is better in every way.  </li>
            <li> It shaves my moustache and my chin fairly cleanly and on the first pass.</li>
            <li> Seems to work best dry, and needs charging every few days, but I&#x27;m quite pleased with this device.</li>
            <li> But when it arrived I took it out of the box (didn&#x27;t even clean it first) and gave it a go--</li>
            <li> /&gt;Right away I was happy with the fact that it was perhaps half as loud as the Braun was, and had a much more tolerable tone.  </li>
            <li> I really like how fast, easy and precise it is.</li>
            <li> Found this for less than $75 - excellent value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Nice little shaver which gives me a smooth, fast shave with no nicking.  </li>
            <li> Great shave, very easy to clean without a complicated cleaner and solution - just soap and water</li>
            <li> The shaver is also washable, making it very easy to clean and stay fresh (big plus!).</li>
            <li> The new razor seems to shave better and with less noise for a good clean shave.  </li>
            <li> As far as electric shavers go, I don&#x27;t know that I find this one to be the best, but it is completely acceptable - for much less money than any of the better ones I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , Panasonic has done a great job with this little wonder.  </li>
            <li> This means it would be a task for any razor, but with just a little bit of time it has great results.)  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great little shaver</li>
            <li> great little shaver.</li>
            <li> great little shaver.</li>
            <li> Great little shaver, which exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> This little gem cleans up great, using water as per the instructions.</li>
            <li> : I have now had this razor for a little over 5 months and it is still great.</li>
            <li> Shavers take a little longer to shave with than razors, but it does great job.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a quick shave, and this thing&#x27;s pretty quick, though it cuts so close that I manage to cut myself almost every day.</li>
            <li> Nice blade, quiet enough, easy to use, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The shaver also has a very fast recharging rate with it receiving a full charge in under 30 to 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> Sure the case could have been more substantial, but I improvised, using a heavy duty pouch I had lying around, which works fine in protecting the shaver while traveling.    </li>
            <li> I had a Synchpro which, while large and heavy gave a great, close and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> On days I want an impeccable shave I do have to touch with a conventional razor.</li>
            <li> So I purchased this Panasonic and now I&#x27;m back to a very quick, very clean shave.  </li>
            <li> Works great, long lasting battery, clean, smooth shave every time.</li>
            <li> It does a very good job, but I do find that need to go over my face several times to get all spots, especially on my neck and under my chin.</li>
            <li> After comparing the two (the only difference is an extra head on the 8243), I decided on the 8103 and have to say that it is a very good shaver.</li>
            <li> but really, something being lighter is not necessarily indicative of lower quality and might be a good thing to you, i personally enjoy a certain heft.</li>
            <li> HUGE plus, so I don&#x27;t mind giving up a little bit more closeness for that)&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning: 9/10 (stupidly easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old Panasonic razor, which had given me more than a decade of good shaves but now needed a new battery, foil, blade and trimmer blade (All were original, and had performed above and beyond the call of duty).</li>
            <li> It might be the first razor that I can honestly left my face smoother than a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the quality of the shave, there are a few good things about this razor; it&#x27;s very comfortable and light in the hand, making it easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works great but is a bit on the narrow side, and when deployed it sticks out and away from the shaver&#x27;s body at an angle that takes a bit getting used to.    </li>
            <li> and I get a very close and comfortable shave with no irritation.  </li>
            <li> So I really like it, shaves smooth and close.</li>
            <li> Also, &amp; again,unlike the Norelco, I can get a smooth, very close shave in the neck area with no irritation at all.</li>
            <li> Once I learned how to shave with this model, I started getting some very close comfortable shaves.</li>
            <li> It was much faster and my face is smooth as a baby&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I have a medium heavy beard and it is great.  </li>
            <li> Takes a few shaves for your skin to get used to it, then it cuts great.</li>
            <li> Works great on the face, but has a lot of trouble on neck hairs, so I still need a regualr razor to finish the job.</li>
            <li> It is smooth, fast, and no irritation at all.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really give you a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, it has an indicator showing how much battery life remains before it needs to be recharged.</li>
            <li> No shaver burn, just fast, smooth, no hassle procedure.</li>
            <li> cheap and very suit my taste!!!&lt;br /&gt;automatic</li>
            <li> it is very lightweight&amp; comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> Really gives a close shave leaving you with a smooth face....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and shaves very close.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Remington, Norelco and Braun before and although the Braun worked well, I really like the smooth shave this Panasonic delivers.</li>
            <li> The foil is smooth and the blades are fast, and it contours to my face well.</li>
            <li> The shaver gives a very close, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Been using this for about a month now and no lie, it shaves very close and comfortable with no burn.  </li>
            <li> My husband loves this razor and he says it gives him a very close, aggravation free shave.</li>
            <li> The unit is very lightweight and the rubber grip is comfortable to hold at all angles.</li>
            <li> I love the ability to have a wet shave and easy clean up.</li>
            <li> For over 50 years I have been a confirmed blade shaver, although at various times the nicks and cuts that I experienced led me to try various electric shavers.  </li>
            <li> It shaves fast, close, and comfortable, almost like a blade shave, and has an LCD displays that always gives &amp;#34;percentage remaining&amp;#34; for the battery.  </li>
            <li> Smooth and fast.</li>
            <li> but this comes very close and leaves maybe 2-3 spots lightly haired.</li>
            <li> razor is comfortable and shave very closely.</li>
            <li> It is quite, runs smooth like a Honda car engine, and shaves very clean.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I will now know how much power is still available</li>
            <li> This shaver will give you a very close, smooth shave and it never burns or chaffs your skin at all.  </li>
            <li> It is so fast and smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave a rash or burn.</li>
            <li> I get a really close and comfortable shaves when I use it with gel cream and water.</li>
            <li> Provides a very close and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> The shave is fast and comfortable.</li>
            <li> My 10 year old Norelco shaver still has better battery life than this unit after 1 year of use.</li>
            <li> Speaking of my old Norelco, it still gives me a better shave and shaves while charging.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useful and fun.</li>
            <li> so far ok.  </li>
            <li> So if you buy this razor be sure to keep your old razor because you may be without a razor for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li> shave is just as good as a wet shave</li>
            <li> your face will most likely be baby smooth.</li>
            <li> Nice and quiet.  </li>
            <li> I felt like I got my money&#x27;s worth out of that beast.  </li>
            <li> The razor performs on par with my old razor and since I&#x27;ve been using an electric microscreen razor for many years my face is used to it</li>
            <li> Worth the money</li>
            <li> i just bought the $50 version again, since it has a more reliable old school lcd display instead.  </li>
            <li> update:  for what it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> It charges fast, is easy to clean and very lightweight, making it an exellent choice for home or traveling.  </li>
            <li> I am totally satisfied with the purchase so far.  </li>
            <li> Only drawback I see is its a bit loud but who cares it works great.</li>
            <li> I changed the blades to make sure I did not get an old blade with the razor.    </li>
            <li> I had to upgrade from a 4 year old Norelco since the replacement blades cost more than the razor was worth.</li>
            <li> I liked the cleaning system but a short time after buying the razor the stores stopped selling the cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> Pop-up trimmer works well, also, which is rarely the case for the pop-up trimmers.  </li>
            <li> I think rotary types will never be as good as straight heads, as a technical matter.</li>
            <li> I guess I should start by describing the kind of facial hair that I have.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly quiet and has a nice balance.  </li>
            <li> I did extensive searching on the internet for electric razors, liked the reviews of this product and bought it.  </li>
            <li> It was only $18, and included a nice, hard-shell carrying case.</li>
            <li> It was only $18, and included a nice, hard-shell carrying case.</li>
            <li> More than surprised and a Panasonic concert.</li>
            <li> Is it worth the money?</li>
            <li> was well worth it.</li>
            <li> So far i&#x27;m satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Bought it in December for my husband to replace an old panasonic shaver that he had used for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li> I do think it requires a more frequent charge, as it seems to use about 10% of its power when I use it.  </li>
            <li> Stop making fun of me now.</li>
            <li> Stop making fun of me now.</li>
            <li> As a dryer shaver its great, but where it really stands out from the rest is when you use it for a wet lather shave.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t felt my husband&#x27;s this soft in years, I&#x27;ve missed being able to get close to him without getting beard burn.</li>
            <li> After one shave it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Carrying case would be useful.     </li>
            <li> But - that seems normal these days with most higher end shavers</li>
            <li> The closeness of the shave is nice and the unit feels solid.</li>
            <li> Nice close shave (especially for an electric shaver.)&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Love it so far.  </li>
            <li> The only issue is the on/off button, I keep hitting it when shaving, not a deal breaker but would have been nice if located somewhere else.</li>
            <li> more like a couple of loud bees.</li>
            <li> I have not tried it with a wet shave and cannot determine if any of the pre-shave lotions do any good or if they just smell.  </li>
            <li> The product was worth its price and recommendable.</li>
            <li> WOW it is outstanding.  </li>
            <li> Early June I ordered a replacement hoping to fare better this time.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that the more frequently I use it, the closer the shave and the cleaner</li>
            <li> The trimmer works far better than my Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even tried it yet in wet mode because the results have been so good.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have been using an electric shaver on my legs for many years.</li>
            <li> So far I love this shaver.  </li>
            <li> If you want to save your money, I recommend growing a beard, as I&#x27;m currently doing (keeps you warm in the winter, saves on shaving supplies, and makes you look wiser).</li>
            <li> We selected this item based on prior reviews at this site, and now add our own \\&quot;5-star\\&quot; review based on our dad&#x27;s feedback.</li>
            <li> And, I&#x27;ve been more than pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> The old Braun used to spread most of those all over my sink.  </li>
            <li> Now the good part, I found in a coutry wide drugstore a product tha</li>
            <li> Going from a blade to this shaver did take some getting used to, but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> This shaver is well worth the money, and at sale prices it&#x27;s a steal.</li>
            <li> The digital readout is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> I guess the plug in AC motor on the old Braun is just better.</li>
            <li> The Panosonic ES8103S is by far a much better shaver.  </li>
            <li> Started out okay, but over time it&#x27;s become more rough on my neck.  </li>
            <li> I did some checking on various shavers and liked the wet/dry aspect of the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> Much better than with my old razor.  </li>
            <li> When I started shaving my head daily, I decided to get a nice electric razor.</li>
            <li> so well, I&#x27;m curious if the cleaning system is as good as the razor..</li>
            <li> This fact alone is worth the price of the razor..</li>
            <li> Of course a blade will do one better, but as far as electrics go in this price range</li>
            <li> I also have a Norelco and a Braun, and this is far and away my favorite.  </li>
            <li> This is a rare thing anymore and needs to be the norm again not the exception if quality brands want to survive.</li>
            <li> I also noticed the shave I got was not as close as my old shaver on top of the longer shave time.  </li>
            <li> My husband had never used an electric razor before, but had to go on blood thinners long term, so we purchased the Panasonic and he is very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;To be honest, I had rather low expectations about the shaver.  </li>
            <li> On scale of 1-10, I would rare the Panasonic an \\&quot;8\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I called Panasonic customer service to see if this upgrade would be worth it.  </li>
            <li> it is useful for you.plerse try it</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it\\</li>
            <li> very much worth the money.</li>
            <li> Cuts close like a razor and has a handy trim tool on the back.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with it though and recommend it especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so useful for me.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem quite as close on one day&#x27;s growth, but it was every bit as good as my old Braun (before it got old).  </li>
            <li> Like most electric razors it doesn&#x27;t get my face smooth even after several passes in every direction.</li>
            <li> Pleased so far.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a defective unit, but my 3 year old razor still shaves better than this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The razor motor sounds powerful, but...</li>
            <li> My favorite Braun unexpectedly died so</li>
            <li> and this is by far a better shaver.</li>
            <li> Shaves and performs much better than my old norelco.</li>
            <li> This shaver is even better than my old one.  </li>
            <li> This is the 4th and 2nd 8103S I own.</li>
            <li> , you get about 10 days worth of shaving before you need to charge it again.  </li>
            <li> better than my old norelco.</li>
            <li> &quot; I don&#x27;t think the HydraClean Dock is worth an additional $60 to the cost of this shaving</li>
            <li> Rechargeable batteries need attention to how you care and charge them to give you the longest useful life.</li>
            <li> (another way rechargeable batteries useful life can be shortened).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (another way rechargeable batteries useful life can be shortened).    </li>
            <li> This model is worth the price increase over model ES-SL41-S.</li>
            <li> So far, I really am enjoying this shaver.  </li>
            <li> It was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The shaving head gets a bit warm, though not enough to burn the skin.</li>
            <li> Now after getting used to it, I like it as much or more as my old model.</li>
            <li> Powerful</li>
            <li> It seemed hazardous in potential.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So this one wins the &amp;#34;best so far&amp;#34; award.</li>
            <li> is a much better shaver than my old Braun.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Takeaway - If you&#x27;re looking for an affordable, wet/dry travel shaver, this is worth looking into.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on thIs razor, and decided it was worth the try.</li>
            <li> Overall, a nice shaver.</li>
            <li> I grew tired of not being able to take razors in my carry on luggage when I fly.  </li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t remember the last time I had an irritated face or an ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> Two different types of cutters in the head tackle whiskers effectively.  </li>
            <li> Own a similar model.  </li>
            <li> The size is good because anything wider ( like the 4 or 5 blade razors) would be too wide.)</li>
            <li> Far better than the Braun shavers I used to have.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth Since it doesn&#x27;t seem flimsy.</li>
            <li> The hairs will have absorbed water and will be softer and fatter.</li>
            <li> light pressure when hair is longer, then at the end use more pressure to cut short hair shorter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far and works great.  </li>
            <li> The shave as such is really smooth, love that aspect of it.</li>
            <li> I have to go over most areas at least twice to get rid of all the stubble, and I seem to get the best results shaving in multiple directions instead of always with or against the hair&#x27;s grain.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about a month, and get about a week&#x27;s worth of shaves per charge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Final thoughts, totally worth the price in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I heard that foil shavers are much better for those with sensitive skin than rotary shavers.  </li>
            <li> With the cost of razor blades continually raising, this is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> My face is soft and smooth!  </li>
            <li> However, the trade off in closeness is worth it because the razor never cuts my face.  </li>
            <li> Gives a nice, close shave in a very short time.</li>
            <li> this price point that is economical to do.</li>
            <li> Consumer Reports rated this Panasonic shaver near the top of its ratings</li>
            <li> The ability to lock the head or switch it to pivot mode comes in handy for different areas of neck and face.</li>
            <li> It had also gotten really loud (more about that below).  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> After reading reviews, I thought it would be worth the money.</li>
            <li> I satisfied completely now.</li>
            <li> Worth of buying.</li>
            <li> So far, I love it.</li>
            <li> He always complains that everyti,e he buys a nice electronic shaver, it pulls on his facial hair.</li>
            <li> It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I gave this a good month to come to this, I wanted to like it after i spent 140 on it</li>
            <li> Bought this on a whim and wow am I glad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly easy to clean, the battery lasts about 5 shaves, and so far I haven&#x27;t nicked myself or had any irritation.  </li>
            <li> I own the Panasonic Body Groom and thought I would stay in the same family of razors.  </li>
            <li> This razor is so much better than my old Remington</li>
            <li> and I can use it in the shower too (rarely)</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s still worth it in the $70.00 range.</li>
            <li> I used to dread the pain of trying to shave 3 days worth of scruff....</li>
            <li> It definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> The first time I shaved with this razor, I did so with a full beard.</li>
            <li> nice extra features onit.</li>
            <li> This actually DOES shave close and comfortable and recharges real quick.</li>
            <li> The Arc3 is okay so far.  </li>
            <li> fair and not what I expected for a closer shave, and does not hold the charge for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li> I am sure that it is much better than PHILIPS shaver nice cutting, able to use during taking a shower, price etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not that powerful of a shaver, I guess.  </li>
            <li> Battery lasts just about all week, and I rarely replace the foil and blade more frequently than once per 12-16 months.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and not as loud as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> , the quality of the shave is obviously the most important aspect of the product.  </li>
            <li> The time and work just aren&#x27;t worth it to me.</li>
            <li> My husband was not crazy about this shaver.  </li>
            <li> The shaver works very well, by far the best shaving method I ever used but does leave some rough areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the soft setting to get around the nooks and crannies of my neck.</li>
            <li> but, it was well worth the investment)</li>
            <li> but, it was well worth the investment)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased that these have lasted as long as they have (with periodic blade replacements).  </li>
            <li> I guess its worth buying.</li>
            <li> This is one of those rare products that truly delivers on the hype.  </li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve had all smooth, close and comfortable shaves.  </li>
            <li> I am surprised and quite pleased.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s as good as expected. .</li>
            <li> Certainly worth the price</li>
            <li> I am simply doing this because I would have appreciated someone telling the truth and not just giving good reviews.</li>
            <li> I then bought a second for my own use.</li>
            <li> the battary is powerful.</li>
            <li> Panasonic&#x27;s hi-end models are my favorite by far.</li>
            <li> Worth what I paid, and would buy again.</li>
            <li> This model ES8103S shaves better than my old Panasonic model.</li>
            <li> after like 8 shaves found not cutting close to my moustash and had to use a manual blade.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at the Sensotouch, but as I used the three circular blade arrangement on a Norelco shaver before I moved to Braun, I had found that the razor&#x27;s blade arrangement worked far better for me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I like the shaver, and am pleased with how it has worked for me so far.  </li>
            <li> I think its worth it IMO.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have used Braun and Norelco for years with varying degrees of success.  </li>
            <li> Hope the Li-ion battery lasts 7 to 10 years like the old shavers, but probably NimH batteries are more durable.</li>
            <li> I got my money&#x27;s worth on that shaver.</li>
            <li> And to top that off, you can shave with shaving cream, in the shower or dry and you just rinse off to clean it!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and feels high quality.</li>
            <li> Very very close shave and quickly as well.</li>
            <li> It still operates strongly after eight years however which speaks highly of the brand.</li>
            <li> I was happy with my first Panasonic, happier with the 2nd, and this new one surpasses both, each progressing in enhanced usage and performance.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver because i shave my head and read very positive reviews.</li>
            <li> The vibrations in the hand are pretty strong compared to not feeling much with the norelco.  </li>
            <li> I got a good shave, via the dry method, on the first shave.</li>
            <li> but I usually dry shave on my way into work and still receive a pretty good shave.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to understand why it can be so great on all the other hairs, but not be able to get those last</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m always nervous that wetting metal is bound to dull it quickly) - and it really does shave closely with a small bit of foamy soap rubbed in to the heads, best after a good hot shower so the beard is nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product and cleans easily, is compact for travel, can be used wet or dry, and a cheap alternative to the $100+ electric razors.</li>
            <li> I love that I can pop it open and run it under water to clean it, and I&#x27;ve even used it in the shower a few times and it always gives a great shave,</li>
            <li> First, the head is so large that shaving above a mustache is more challenging.</li>
            <li> I purchased this particular shaver after researching the best shavers for African American men.</li>
            <li> Only time will tell, but seeing as I&#x27;ve had wonderful experiences with other Panasonic/Technics products over the years</li>
            <li> have also used this electric dry and I am very pleased with those results as well.  </li>
            <li> The shaver overall is nice because of the outlay of it and how fast it charges plus the speed that you can clean it using water.</li>
            <li> A fine shaver at a decent price.  </li>
            <li> job.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t stick a blade to my upper leg, due to the sensitivity of my skin, but the ES8103S achieves wonderful results without my needing to resort to a blade.</li>
            <li> I wish there was a way to lock the outside piece in place, but other than that I have been thoroughly impressed.</li>
            <li> and it does it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> The screen also began to malfunction pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend its his first electric razor and he loves it says it gives a quick close shave</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this electric shaver for the first time, I quickly asked &amp;#34;Why</li>
            <li> tl for turkey (varies according to the exchange rate), and you give comes as soon as six days rather expecting it pretty quickly</li>
            <li> The razor does get hot, which does not feel nice in more sensitive spots (upper lip, under ear).&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It does fine dry, but shaving with it using shaving cream makes for a very comfortable and close shave.</li>
            <li> Shaving in the shower doesn&#x27;t necessarily give me a closer shave, but it sure does keep the shaver clean, so I can shave after I&#x27;m dressed</li>
            <li> Soft, smooth, clean shave even on neck and adams apple.</li>
            <li> clean fresh shaving just like manual blade and very mobile and flexible to use.</li>
            <li> I wore a beard for many years but recently decided to go clean shaven.</li>
            <li> It is easier to clean then an old razor and comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Seriously, I dont understand why it has so many good comments.</li>
            <li> Way more than enough to get a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Finally after 2 years the top piece that fits over the blades, which you remove to clean, broke off and can&#x27;t be reattached.</li>
            <li> Overall, a good shaver and a decent price.</li>
            <li> There is a newer \\&quot;ARC 4\\&quot; model which I guess has an extra set of blades, but it had fewer reviews and they weren&#x27;t as good as the reviews for this shaver, so I stuck with this older model.</li>
            <li> Clean up is very easy, a drop of liquid soap and a little water on turbo clean and a quick rinse.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how close it shaves and the cleaning is very easy and it charges fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In general, a great product to invest in your personal grooming needs and even worth the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In general, a great product to invest in your personal grooming needs and even worth the price.</li>
            <li> other design features that I would change is that the charger indicator goesdown fairly evenly until 10%.  </li>
            <li> I decided on this Panasonic shaver due to the good reviews [...]  </li>
            <li> It is easy to clean, not terribly loud, and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Its performance in shaving was comparable with other electric shavers--OK, but not as good as manual razors.</li>
            <li> Due to the shape of the head, the shaver is not as good at getting the area under the nose as a Norelco triple head.</li>
            <li> my goodness, the Panasonic cost 1/3 as much, and the difference in performance is just not that significant.  </li>
            <li> It can be a tab bit messy, but I&#x27;m not late for work anymore and the BEST thing about it was no razor burn and still felt like a very close shave.</li>
            <li> The razor still gives a very close, very fast and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> The razor still gives a very close, very fast and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> So it may have been my overly high expectations or the limitations of the product, but I didn&#x27;t think it provided me with an adequate \\&quot;clean shave.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, especially for people who have never had a good razor.</li>
            <li> My shaves are now as close as they were when I dry shaved, and even more comfortable and smooth thanks to the steam.</li>
            <li> I got a special offer from Panasonic for a different model, but this one was better and cheaper, with faster shipping from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I paid around $60, so the price was right for me also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the price was right.</li>
            <li> I now can shave right in my hootch with no water or anything.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having problems with my right hand.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> It says it right on the box.</li>
            <li> Use it right after or in the shower you will be amazed.  </li>
            <li> thats right, Merry Christmas) gift from my wife.</li>
            <li> , right?  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I will be buying one as soon as I find one at the right price..</li>
            <li> right though all of it.  </li>
            <li> Dad was right.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced this was the right purchase.</li>
            <li> This shaver&#x27;s head seems just the right size.  </li>
            <li> right after I shower - never with water or in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Right out of the box</li>
            <li> The price was right</li>
            <li> the price was definitely right.</li>
            <li> Panasonic has got it right.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I just use a Gillette 5 blade shaver, which cuts right through it and gets the job done even closer than these fancy machines.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s waterprod and has a sideburns trimmer and the price is right.  </li>
            <li> With this, I can go right over my lips.</li>
            <li> Like right at the bottom of my nose.</li>
            <li> With this, I can go right over my lips.</li>
            <li> Like right at the bottom of my nose.</li>
            <li> (I used it right out of the box with just 10% power on it)</li>
            <li> and this goes right through it.</li>
            <li> I was right.  </li>
            <li> yes you read that right.</li>
            <li> The repeated passes means skin irritation, so I put on moisturizer or coconut oil right after the shave.  </li>
            <li> Seemed just right.  </li>
            <li> I bought the shaver after breaking my right hand.</li>
            <li> Use it in the shower, or in your car right before a date or interview&lt;</li>
            <li> Well I did the right thing and purchased this as</li>
            <li> A convenient rechargable razor that is easy and quick to use with no mess.</li>
            <li> In about 10 days I received a new unit back, and guess what, it was the model ES8249, a much more sophisticated unit.</li>
            <li> But most of the new Panasonic shavers are bigger and heavier with more heads.</li>
            <li> I think you will be writing a positive review like I just did!</li>
            <li> On the positive side Amazon returns are a breeze!</li>
            <li> But for being ok he sure seems to like using it very much, put other one away and has been using this one ever since.  </li>
            <li> It will really save me a bunch of time and waiting for a free sink and no chance of hot water.  </li>
            <li> I particularly like the easy cleaning process - a few drops of liquid soap on the screen and blades , running at a higher-than-normal, cleaning vibration mode, cleans the screen and blades within a couple minutes - much easier and more effective than manually cleaning Norelco shavers.     </li>
            <li> It is fast and it has a pretty quite sound.</li>
            <li> and I still enjoy it as much as the first.  </li>
            <li> First, the shave cuts very close and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only able to get about 3 full shaves out of the unit before it needs to be recharged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only able to get about 3 full shaves out of the unit before it needs to be recharged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In contrast, my rotary razor does the neck area much faster, but its not as clean in comparison to this razor -</li>
            <li> If I ever get another Panasonic wet/dry shaver, I&#x27;m pretty sure I won&#x27;t use it near water again.  </li>
            <li> It has everything I was looking for in a shaver, Clean, Close, FAST &amp; no \\&quot; neck burn.</li>
            <li> to clean and charges very quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is such a beautiful system that I can now even shave my private parts without fearing any cuts and my wife loves it now!!    </li>
            <li> Super easy to clean (doesn&#x27;t require cleaning fluid or anything) just rinse with water.</li>
            <li> but it gives a very close and clean shave.</li>
            <li> Had an older Panasonic model before with a wider handle and that seemed to fit my hand better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure how much more effective it makes the shaver.  </li>
            <li> Very well built and cuts really clean.</li>
            <li> It cleans easily and the clipper is powerful and precise enough for my needs.</li>
            <li> I really pushed it against my skin, but the shave was never even close to as clean as it would be with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It cuts fast and clean.</li>
            <li> Virtually no pressure is needed to ensure a very close clean shave.  </li>
            <li> Unit is very quiet, easy to clean and battery charges quickly.</li>
            <li> It recharges quickly and is easy to clean with simple running water and soap.  </li>
            <li> I wanted something that was easy to use, could get wet in case that were to happen, easy to clean and works well.</li>
            <li> It is fast and shaves clean.</li>
            <li> The shave is fairly close - typical of most electric razors - but it is really loud.</li>
            <li> and I really like clean close shave</li>
            <li> It charges quickly and it has a nice display that tells you how much power it has left.</li>
            <li> It took way to much time to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> I find that it works the best when my beard is no more than one day old although it will handle longer stubble.</li>
            <li> It is light years ahead of my older Panasonic shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used Braun, Norelco, and Remington in the past and this is by far the best I have used.  </li>
            <li> a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The docked it one star because it&#x27;s not easy to clean in a hurry</li>
            <li> model offers a wet shave option which works great - super close with no irratation.</li>
            <li> He really likes it and Mr. Scruffy is now Mr. Clean shaved.  </li>
            <li> If you are a clean cut guy who does not like the been up for 5 days straight rock star look, then avoid this since you will have to grow it like that for this shaver to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only discomfort is noise, but you not need use the shave more than 5 minites each time, so it &#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li> The unit is very easy to clean -- simply pop off the foil and rinse under the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;The absolute biggest drawback of this shaver is the pop out trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Received item very fast - easy instructions - husband has used only once so far - but seems to enjoy it:)</li>
            <li> It shaves through a 1-2 day stubble very easily (admittedly, I don&#x27;t have the thickest facial hair)</li>
            <li> Cleaning is very easy and charge last about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I experienced very little (new shaver) skin irritation, and wet/dry ability allows thorough and easy cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blades were not sharp and skipped more than they cut.  </li>
            <li> I have been using electric shavers for over 25 years and have tried most major brands.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that gets razor burn and cuts very easily when using normal fusion razors.</li>
            <li> Besides the high pitched sound of the nano tech motor (it sounds like a mosquito on steroids)</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, it makes a high pitched buzzing sound when turned on</li>
            <li> high pitched sound -</li>
            <li> It has a high pitched sound that my wife can&#x27;t tolerate.  </li>
            <li> the Panasonic was a very acceptable alternative, not quite as close as a wet shave, but very comfortable and way, way better than a Braun i received as a gift before that.</li>
            <li> Noise levels are on par with my old shaver and should be fine for all but the most sensitive ears.  </li>
            <li> I am surprised it does not come with hose attachments to clean my house while shaving!</li>
            <li> They worked great overall as long as you replace the blades every 1-2 years and clean it after each use. .</li>
            <li> There are so few products today that really measure up that it is a pleasure to fine one this good.</li>
            <li> (I alternate right and left), and the charge status and fast recharge are very good.</li>
            <li> Since the cost of replacing them is more than the cost of a new electric razor, I began to look for a modern replacement and hit upon this</li>
            <li> The shave is clean and quick, probably because it is new also.</li>
            <li> I purchased the whole razor since it wasn&#x27;t much more money that a couple of new blade and foil sets.</li>
            <li> It is only an OK shave in my opinion far from great, and far from even a decent disposable razor.</li>
            <li> The initial shave took much less time, but the results were just as impressive.  </li>
            <li> I especially love the fact that I have the option of shaving wet or dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it both wet and dry and have gotten excellent results both ways.  </li>
            <li> The shaver works perfectly either dry or wet.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed that it can be used wet or dry.</li>
            <li> For many, this may be no issue, but my shave locations tend to be adventurous and unpredictable</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it wet but dry it is the best!  </li>
            <li> The best part is it works dry or wet, you can use it with or without shaving cream as well.</li>
            <li> A charge lasts for ten or more shaves and it recharges quickly.  </li>
            <li> I love the close shave, the quick charge, and the overall quality and build of their razors.</li>
            <li> Charges quickly and lasts me several shaves (usually 5 or more).</li>
            <li> The new one works fine.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge for about 20 normal close, smooth shaves.</li>
            <li> but I definitely think the Panasonic is giving me a closer shave much quicker and definitely MUCH more comfortably.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic has more power, charges faster, shaves closer &amp; cleaner, a more comfortable head, cuts flat laying wiskers, and has a % digital battery charge indicator.</li>
            <li> My past experiences with the circular rotating heads wasn&#x27;t great, as it didn&#x27;t provide a close shave and irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li> I got exactly 2 weeks worth of shaves and as of today I still get exactly 2 weeks worth of shaves.</li>
            <li> True to form it shaves very close.  </li>
            <li> That is no more sillythan finding a great deal on a BMW and finding out you can&#x27;t afford to fix it.</li>
            <li> Now I find myself going back to my $45 old shaver (ok a Remington) more often than I would care to admit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what is so incredibly great about this shaver, whether it&#x27;s the nanotechnology that produces a closer shave</li>
            <li> One good thing about the charger though is that it is relatively compact, and curiously is almost shelf-like when plugged in to the wall, which allows the razor to sit on top of it while charging, almost as if it were designed that way.</li>
            <li> One good thing about the charger though is that it is relatively compact, and curiously is almost shelf-like when plugged in to the wall, which allows the razor to sit on top of it while charging, almost as if it were designed that way.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use it in the shower because I don&#x27;t have a mirror in there but works great either way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had several electric razors over the years from Norelco and Remington and the Panasonic ES8103S is by far my most favorite that I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> Except for replacing the blades the Norelco was great until in the past 2 years it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t generally have many problems.</li>
            <li> Both fell short of shaving with a razor but with aging skin that has become much more sensitive to nicks and cuts, there is a greater reliance on electric razors.</li>
            <li> flip out trimmer is nice for sideburns and for those long hairs on my toes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shave is not bad - a very close shave</li>
            <li> He used it the other day for the first time n loved it.</li>
            <li> The good things about this product are that it&#x27;s quiet, light, it charges very quickly (an hour or less), and has a battery percentage monitor on it.</li>
            <li> Light, quiet motor, and a very smooth cut is provided by this particular shaver.</li>
            <li> In total I still find using an electric shaver a trade off which is acceptable for every day use, but for special occassions or just when I want to get a really close shave a blade is far superior.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this particular one for about three years now, after dropping my original in the shower and breaking it.</li>
            <li> At first, I was mildly pleased by the shave, but the blades faded quickly over the following months and it became a grinding chore to do my morning shave.</li>
            <li> While the ES8103 weighs a little more than the women&#x27;s models, it is actually much better balanced and</li>
            <li> recommend this for a person who wants to try out electric shaving or someone who primarily uses a manual type razor, but is looking for an affordable and quick shave in between their normal routine.</li>
            <li> gave it a 1 star because it&#x27;s a cute little mousy shaver :)</li>
            <li> Over three years later this razor is still going strong and shaving close!  </li>
            <li> easy to clean, quick and long charge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li> so I did a little more research to make sure and bought this.  </li>
            <li> Update at the 4.5-year mark (April 2017): This same razor is still going strong!</li>
            <li> great shaves could also be due to the cutters being brand new</li>
            <li> Agile - does a good job with tough spots on your face</li>
            <li> Battery life is not so great and have to charge very few days.  </li>
            <li> This unit also seems to lose charge on batteries much faster (without use) than other brands and models, so be prepared to go out unshaven more often with this razor than with many others.</li>
            <li> Unlike the new Cheap@$$ quality made by Panasonic Eletric Works Wanbao (Made in China).</li>
            <li> This new Panasonic that I just purchased from Amazon.com is FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li> Every thing feels light and plastic with this new unit.  </li>
            <li> I am now back to my 8 year-old norelco that i have never ever even cleaned or replaced a head on (just the occasional rinsing under water) - it no longer provides a great shave either and the battery is dying</li>
            <li> It charged quickly and shows you how much percentage battery is remaining.  </li>
            <li> Sound - the sound is like a cross between an amplified mosquito (80%) and an electric grass shear (20%).  </li>
            <li> Clean up is so simple and easy by just putting a drop of liquid soap on the shaver head, turn on, let it foam, shut off and rinse.</li>
            <li> This one&#x27;s going strong after nearly a year</li>
            <li> So when my last Panasonic wore out (needed head parts, cost more than it was worth)</li>
            <li> time seems quick for a fast recharge&lt;br /&gt;overall</li>
            <li> So far, so good after several weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Not as good as my previous Remington but that razor jumped its price to $300.00.  </li>
            <li> Good shave (subject to limitations below)  </li>
            <li> super fast shipping</li>
            <li> I was going to replace the rotary with another Braun of some type, but they are kind of expensive, and this Panasonic had good reviews.      </li>
            <li> It is really easy to clean an works especially well in the shower.</li>
            <li> I was pleasently surprised by the great level of shaving and the machinery sound so much quiter than my previous one.</li>
            <li> So all in all - if you choose to purchase this product - you can expect to buy a good performing razor that is easy on your skin but has a tendancy to smell musty if you don&#x27;t dry it properly.</li>
            <li> My old Panasonic wet/dry lasted forever, and the battery still easily holds a charge for over a week.  </li>
            <li> not as good as my old norelco, trimer is in too low location.  would not reccommend.</li>
            <li> Like all foil shavers, you have to go over the same area again and again, and finish up with aftershave and a razor to get the few spots you missed, but I am very happy with this and plan to get one for my son for Xmas.</li>
            <li> So far it has worked very well on the top of my head.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clear under running water&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Have used for several weeks and so far a good shaver.  </li>
            <li> shaver is easy to clean and the batteries last for five or six shaves without recharging.  </li>
            <li> Cuts smoothly, quickly, and charges fast.</li>
            <li> Part of the irritation may be from the fact that the blades get quite warm on this with dry shaving after 2 or 3 minutes of use.</li>
            <li> and i really got pissed off, threw the whole thing away, thank you panasonic for being a cheap bastard for quality of your products</li>
            <li> It indicates how much power remains and it charges quickly.</li>
            <li> I want quick fast shave in the morning, to mitigate the process of using razor and cream.</li>
            <li> After a great deal of research and reading reviews on several different razors I decide on the Panasonic ES8103S.  </li>
            <li> Razor is easy to clean just follow simple directions.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean, and is relatively silent.</li>
            <li> However, it does shave quickly, so it hasn&#x27;t really been a problem.</li>
            <li> Ultimately I wanted something that was cheap to maintain (replacement blades/foils), comfortable and durable.</li>
            <li> It charges ridiculously fast and it gave him a super close shave; almost as if he had used a razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much quieter does not vibrate, and charges quickly.</li>
            <li> an unfortunatly its not as good as my previous shaver</li>
            <li> Unexpected benefit is that since I&#x27;m not running a blade agains my skin any more, my skin is much smoother than with the razor.</li>
            <li> It is fairly quiet, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> (these areas are sensitive and get irritated easily when I use a blade</li>
            <li> I get a really close shave and really quick &amp;#60;5 minutes (as opposed to ~10 minutes with manual shave).  </li>
            <li> Short shaving times, long-lasting battery, no irritation, and it&#x27;s still easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I liked the LCD screen showing how much battery is left.</li>
            <li> I would have to say the only downfall I have experienced is that occasionally I have had to do some touch-up with a manual razor.  </li>
            <li> The shaver head is easy to clean, but sometimes the foil falls out when you remove the head - the tabs to release the foil are in the same location as the tabs to remove the head.</li>
            <li> It kept a charge for several days and was easy to clean.</li>
            <li> people with sensitive skin issues and allergies don&#x27;t have much choice, it&#x27;s either this or waxing which adds up to a lot more over time...</li>
            <li> and I think they can make an even smaller, more powerful unit for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I think they can make an even smaller, more powerful unit for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Drop few shampoo and switch on vibration then wash it clean under running water, very convenient and remains a good smell.</li>
            <li> Light to moderate light pressure is all that is needed.  </li>
            <li> after I&#x27;ve spent more time with it, but feel free to make any comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ease of use, more comfortable when wet.</li>
            <li> I get five to six shaves per charge; and the razor performs much like a mild DE razor like Gillette&#x27;s vintage Tech razor; and it shaves closer than Feather&#x27;s AS-D1 razor.</li>
            <li> I like this design as it is quite small compared with the 3-head rotary shavers, and is therefore much more suitable for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> then a quick 1 hour charge and its ready again, no problem.</li>
            <li> This was an Amazon deal-of-the-day special, so I feel particularly satisfied with the then very low price and the remaining very high quality of this shaver.</li>
            <li> I generally use panasonic, and I am happy with it, this year, I was surprised by the $30 discount and rushed to buy it for $66 (padded it with other panasonic eligible products to be able to use $99+ discount).</li>
            <li> His skin is very soft and smooth after using this shaver.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted 15 years (would have replaced the blades and kept using it but was almost the same price to get a new one on sale and got the swivel head as a new feature -which works great BTW)</li>
            <li> First, I wanted to see how it would fair against my old electric shavers from different manufacturers (Braun &amp; Remington).</li>
            <li> I spent a lot more money to buy!  </li>
            <li> cleanup of any shaver out there (Panasonic in general), very cost effective (soap/water) and very quick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was my second Panasonic shaving product which I purchased because I liked the first one so much</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of facial hair, nor does it grow terribly fast, so the top recommendation from The Sweet Home seemed overkill.  </li>
            <li> The head moves in and out as you our more pressure on and it pivots from left to right.  </li>
            <li> Light weight and easy to use and maintains the charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> This razor is way more economical to keep clean than having to buy the cleaner cartridges to keep my previous Braun clean, and the replacement screens don&#x27;t cost as much as a replacement razor.</li>
            <li> Make sure you clean regularly with good mineral oil, such as any baby oil and the foils and cutters will last longer.</li>
            <li> After two Braun shavers that were good but not special, read the Amazon reviews and decided to try this.</li>
            <li> Thus, a clean, close, comfortable shave is particularly important, since nicks and other problems associated with shaving tend to get magnified.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean, shaves clean and close (takes a few passes though), charges quickly and works well on my neck.</li>
            <li> very (VERY)</li>
            <li> You can now find my ES8103 on eBay at a VERY reasonable price.</li>
            <li> With this Panasonic shaver, cleaning is very fast and efficient.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> I am very light on facial hair</li>
            <li> I very much like this shaver.</li>
            <li> With a very comfortable, the next will buy.</li>
            <li> I like this shaver very much.</li>
            <li> i had!&lt;br /&gt;The battery is charged very fast and lasts</li>
            <li> Very reasonable price, too.  </li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced on Amazon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shave itself is very, very nice.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is a gift and my friend likes it very much.</li>
            <li> Like all razors, under the chin and neck take multiple passes, but very smooth with no skin irritation</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a pretty heavy beard and this is the first shaving solution I&#x27;ve really been happy with.</li>
            <li> And very reasonable price...  </li>
            <li> Therefore, I settled on this version for a very reasonable price</li>
            <li> Charges very fast.  </li>
            <li> Charging is very fast.</li>
            <li> This is a very good shaver as it can reach places under your nose and around your neck that a razor with the three spinning blades are unable to cleanly shave.   </li>
            <li> Your shave will be so smooth that you may be able to get by shaving every other day as I have, and 2)</li>
            <li> it is clean and soft, and you can clean it with water, it&#x27;s very convenient.</li>
            <li> So far, after one week, working fine.</li>
            <li> Have not owned an electric since I was 20 years old or so, now 68, since I never could fine one that worked as well as blade shaving.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor wet with cheap shaving creme or dry.</li>
            <li> Before I ordered the Panasonic though, I pulled out an old ( but still in fine shape) Norelco/Phillips triple head that I used to use.</li>
            <li> off more than 1/2 of the time off of my previous shaving time, and does it much cleaner and more consistant than my disposable shaver.</li>
            <li> The shaving experience is not as sensational as described in the ads, I would rate it average.</li>
            <li> Previous shaver did not do a great job (always had patches that were a more rough than others).  </li>
            <li> The blades are so sharp, so fast, and the design so good</li>
            <li> How easy and so quiet, fast, light (Already mentioned</li>
            <li> To be honest though I still have to use a regular disposable razor blade very quickly to get that last bit of smoothness.</li>
            <li> My previous Panasonic wet/dry electric shaver finally gave up the ghost after many years of good service</li>
            <li> An added benefit to this would be that the manufacturer would be able to determine if the razor could be refurbished with a new battery and new parts then sold and used again.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> It shaves as close as a blade, gets long hairs on the neck and is very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good little razor...</li>
            <li> thanks so much!!</li>
            <li> Shaves very close and FAST !!</li>
            <li> This shaver does fairly well with cheeks and the neck, but struggles a little with the spaces in between.  </li>
            <li> The PROS: very reasonably priced; fast, ridiculously close shave with no nicks or pulled hairs; very easy to clean with the high speed cleaning feature; charges quickly; light weight &amp; easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> It runs good and has simple-looking features, and can take a little water for cleaning.</li>
            <li> but it took a week to get familiar with the new brand shaver.</li>
            <li> The sound is much lower than my older Bruan...</li>
            <li> It is super quiet and cleans easily.  </li>
            <li> the blades are easy to press and make your daily routine quick &amp; simple!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cleanup is easy and it holds a charge through multiple shaves and charges fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> husband loves it and delights in such an easy and quick way to shave</li>
            <li> It gives better results when it is moved several times over the same spot if required applying very light pressure, which agrees with the passport recommendations.  </li>
            <li> Charge running a full week--easy to clean--very high revolution motor.</li>
            <li> very good (but not great) shave</li>
            <li> This is very easy to clean and it says when it needs charging, which takes less than an hour.  </li>
            <li> , I highly recommend the property.&lt;br /&gt;panasonic travel bag to use as a rag-bag against external impacts ridiculous the situation is more stylish and good imiş</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would highly reccomend this product to all who want a nice middle price shaver.!</li>
            <li> The high pitched sound is very annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this shaver it has to be the best around and it wont take you to the poor house either, priced at under $80</li>
            <li> Not as good as a regular shave, only use it for a fast shave, but have to keep going over until its clean, and uses up all the charge</li>
            <li> but, this razor, so far, is by far the best little razor I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> 12/13/2015 Six 1/2 year update: After more than six years of daily use, this razor still works and looks almost like new with the original foil and blades.</li>
            <li> it was awesome for buzzing down facial hair - i often don&#x27;t shave clean but just do the stubbly look, and the very wide trimmer made that easy.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic cost less than my original shaver and is far superior to it.  </li>
            <li> Because of the speed of the blades, the moveable head, and the option of wet /dry shaving, it does an amazing job.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing to me that we as a civilization are so aware of what kind resources are wasted by making such disposable products</li>
            <li> I promise you, allowing your skin to rest a day or two between shaves will make a huge difference in the condition of your skin, especially on those more sensitive areas (face, underarms, swim zone)...</li>
            <li> The pretty lcd display stopped functioning after 6 months of use.</li>
            <li> the same close shave as with a razor takes more passes than it would with a razor.</li>
            <li> Could not believe how close it shaved on the first time.  </li>
            <li> Two months later did this again and made sure i got a confirmation on the panasonic website and still no response.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor.  </li>
            <li> More than a month later I still don&#x27;t like how it feels or shaves.  </li>
            <li> is how much closer it cuts!</li>
            <li> My husband said it felt like it was yanking his hairs out for the first two months.</li>
            <li> I use it with shaving soap and for the most part it works well enough for me...</li>
            <li> The difference with my last Braun feels like, for lack of a better metaphor, the difference between a scalpel and a scythe.</li>
            <li> it does shave pretty close when i use it in the shower.  </li>
            <li> i actually spend more shaving now.  </li>
            <li> With this model, you simply add some liquid soap to the top of the foil, add some water, turn the shaver on and let it run for under a minute.</li>
            <li> The Remington had alot more vibration vs the solid Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Especially the area over my top lip for some reason.</li>
            <li> Obviously the wet options are best, but It does a fine job dry, too.  </li>
            <li> This is my first razor</li>
            <li> It seems to do about 8-10 shaves on a full charge, so I normally don&#x27;t have to take the charger on trips.</li>
            <li> It also required many passes on the same area to remove all of the hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using the shaver for about a month, about 4-5 times per week and still on the first charge.</li>
            <li> so you have to make sure to charge it regularly.  </li>
            <li> each minute shown that is left because it gives the user greater control over when to re-charge in my judgment.  </li>
            <li> And no it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade, but it&#x27;s pretty close.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Minus 1 more star because of overall product reliability.</li>
            <li> He guesses it will last about two more years.</li>
            <li> This razor is much more quiet than the Braun and gives a close shave without irritation.</li>
            <li> First Panasonic was bought in 1980.</li>
            <li> The first one I bought six years ago.  </li>
            <li> My first electric shaver was a Philips 3 head rotary model, switched to Braun 3525, Braun 3-2-1, Braun 7525, and Braun 8575.</li>
            <li> After charging the Panasonic up I had my first shave and let me say to any one thinking about purchasing an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> couple minutes more, no big deal)  </li>
            <li> Shipping as always was lightning fast from Amazon!</li>
            <li> So when I saw the Panasonic ES8103S Pro for close to $50 I got interested.</li>
            <li> But the next in line of the Panasonic  (ES8243A and ES-LA63-S) use 4 blades which I would prefer to stay away from, plus I don&#x27;t know why to expect that they are built any better.</li>
            <li> This is my first wet/dry shaver.  </li>
            <li> (TV&#x27;s, stereos, etc), I&#x27;m pretty confident the company put the same quality work into their shavers.      </li>
            <li> This is the first foil shaver I&#x27;ve tried, having used nothing but rotary types before.  </li>
            <li> This was the first electric razor I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li> The results were always the same, and no matter how many days I allowed for my skin to become accustomed.</li>
            <li> I received this razor today and just had my first shave.</li>
            <li> I have had many different brands of shavers over the years and none can compare with this shaver.</li>
            <li> and power light stopped working completely.</li>
            <li> The Braun is definitely the better razor but the $195.00 price was the reason I decided to try</li>
            <li> I love this shaver, and will NOT go back to Phillips/Norelco.....ever!</li>
            <li> The reviews were saying that it gives a pretty close shave</li>
            <li> Instead of nicks though, they&#x27;re more like tiny scrapes.  </li>
            <li> I have one area that no shaver has been able to cut close and this is no different.  </li>
            <li> I have tried 3-4 different brands earlier but this specific model is awesome.</li>
            <li> After cleaning the blades and replacing the foil, the foil many times does not \\&quot;catch\\&quot; and will fall off the next time I shave.  </li>
            <li> I had grown a beard for many years and had only used a blade the times that I had shaved.  </li>
            <li> And third, I love the cleaning feature.  </li>
            <li> It is now safe to say that I have purchased my LAST Braun shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One big bonus: spare parts are available!</li>
            <li> It is now safe to say that I have purchased my LAST Braun shaver.    </li>
            <li> One big bonus: spare parts are available!</li>
            <li> /&gt;In summary, the Panasonic rated higher than the Norelco in all areas with the exception of the warranty.  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried it I was amazed at how close the shave is, almost as close as when using a razor.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much better than the last one</li>
            <li> This is the first review I have made on a purchase</li>
            <li> My foils and blades last well into 2 years and more.</li>
            <li> There are a couple of things to be aware of however.  </li>
            <li> First, don&#x27;t believe the number of uses the shaver literature</li>
            <li> It was the first time for me to purchase a Wet/Dry shaving system.</li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t think one higher digit would make that much difference, but it this case it makes all the difference in the world!</li>
            <li> I broke the first one by dropping a couple stories when I was moving.    </li>
            <li> This is the first Panasonic shaver I have owned, I was always a Remington user.  </li>
            <li> I actually grow SO many fewer beards now, because I don&#x27;t dread</li>
            <li> Daily head washers are just more stuff to fiddle with and supplies to buy.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried many over the last 25 years.    </li>
            <li> I knew I had to go back to the Panasonic razor that had lasted me for so many years of service.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this razor from Amazon and am finally again pleased with the shaves I am getting.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Panasonic!</li>
            <li> The first time I used the PANASONIC ES8103S</li>
            <li> My nine year old son says my face is as smooth as his.</li>
            <li> I get a close shave every time and the battery maintains a consistent charge.  </li>
            <li> From the first day it gave a close shave.</li>
            <li> 8 months I am married to this shaver.</li>
            <li> That would be hot.........</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this to be much more affordable than my last 3-head rotary Remington.</li>
            <li> I found this to be much more affordable than my last 3-head rotary Remington.</li>
            <li> It not only does a great job shaving but the rechrageable battery holds a charge for a rather long time.</li>
            <li> The battery has performed exactly as advertised-</li>
            <li> The first week of shaves have been close.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this every day since I got it a month ago, so whatever it&#x27;s going to do, I&#x27;m fully aware of.</li>
            <li> and this is the first non-Braun razor I buy.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> he first time use it.  </li>
            <li> Stubble on your scalp is smaller and more even.</li>
            <li> Also be aware that this model will NOT allow shaving while it Charges.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is pretty awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does do a better job than my last</li>
            <li> Digital battery life remaining display (many shavers don&#x27;t even have this feature anymore).</li>
            <li> This is my first wet/dry shaver.</li>
            <li> but I would try different model to get a lot better experience.</li>
            <li> For the first time ever, I didn&#x27;t have to do that.</li>
            <li> First time, out of the box, closest shave I ever had.</li>
            <li> but I wanted to share my first thoughts.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only about 1.5 years since I&#x27;ve been using it, and while it worked, it worked ok.  </li>
            <li> My beard is regular and I&#x27;m pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li> I have used manual razors for many years and I finally decided to try an electric model.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to give the BIG razor companies any more of my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After choosing one from each in a specific price range I read as many reviews that I could find.</li>
            <li> First electric shaver for me.</li>
            <li> I have been extremely pleased for several months now with the Braun wet/dry 5040s.  </li>
            <li> It is the REAL DEAL folks!  </li>
            <li> Love this razor, would recommended it to anyone, especially guys who get razor burn.</li>
            <li> but you will have to make more than one swipe to get the job done  and it will take you about the same time as it takes to shave with a razor blade.</li>
            <li> I like the ease of this shaver ,cuts pretty close</li>
            <li> I shave with Panasonic and Braun most the time, and occasionally with Norelco.</li>
            <li> My first Braun lasted about 6 years.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic gives off a high-pitched hum - kinda like an electric mosquito - but is still more quiet than my Brauns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did a lot of searching for what would work for me (first time electric razor user) and with my thinner, lighter colored hair I needed the foil razor.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well.</li>
            <li> This one works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> If you use it with the Nivea Gel, the skin is so soft and smooth, that my wife keeps gliding her hands over my cheeks over and over again.    </li>
            <li> It is enjoyable and it appears to give facial skin a rejuvinated look.</li>
            <li> This is my second Panasonic, and I love it.</li>
            <li> smooth, but not harsh for skin.</li>
            <li> Look, it will hurt at first.</li>
            <li> However, at first, your sleeping partner may think that the alarm clock has gone off.</li>
            <li> To make sure that I wouldn&#x27;t run out of power mid-shave, I was constantly charging the women&#x27;s models.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t irritate on the first day and it still hasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> -Constantly misses hairs no matter how many times you try to shave them</li>
            <li> The first time I used this shaver</li>
            <li> I still prefer it over the Norelco, but may need to spend more in the future on a Braun</li>
            <li> It shaves better than the last 2 shavers I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mid 60s-year-old man who has used a blade razor for more than 40 years.  </li>
            <li> It shaves close but is never uncomfortable on my face.</li>
            <li> All in all I am pleased with the experience and do not plan to move back to razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the screen that tells you the percentage of battery left.</li>
            <li> I think my usage may go back twenty years...possibly more.</li>
            <li> These many passes leave the skin all chafed and red.</li>
            <li> This is my first go at an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Got the razor, charged it up and used it the first morning I could.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic is a step up in technology and made a noticeable difference the first time.    </li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it four stars is not because of the shaver, but because the manufacturer promises more than the shaver can deliver.  </li>
            <li> first electric shaver</li>
            <li> I think it works even better on the upper lip.</li>
            <li> I suppose this caution is a bit unrepresentative of most users, as I shave my entire head, not just my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Panasonic wet/dry shaver user for many years now; this is my 3rd model</li>
            <li> It gets pretty close on my face but doesn&#x27;t at all on my neck.  </li>
            <li> First electric shaver I have used EVER.</li>
            <li> The head is smaller, easier to use and just does a better job.  </li>
            <li> Would be better yet if it were American Made.  </li>
            <li> This morning I finall got the shaver here in the Bahamas, Charged up and had my first use.</li>
            <li> For example, at first, I couldn&#x27;t shave my neck.</li>
            <li> If you are in the market looking for a smooth shave that will not irritate your face for those of us with sensitive skin keep on looking.</li>
            <li> This is the first razor that has left me razor bump free!</li>
            <li> No matter how many times I went back and forth over my neck area I would have stray hairs all over that I needed to get with a blade.  </li>
            <li> I also appreciate the ability to set closeness (&amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;) and the speed of the motor (&amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li> this is my first item purchased at amazon</li>
            <li> If you do not already know, shaving is different for most every man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although the shave is pretty close on the face, for me it struggled on the jaw and neck area.</li>
            <li> I guess I was hoping it would do a tad better since I shave daily</li>
            <li> So for under $90 its a solid performer, and many people here have given it glowing reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s because the blade frequency is much higher than my Braun.  </li>
            <li> I never write reviews on Amazon (this is my first I believe).</li>
            <li> It gives a pretty close shave-</li>
            <li> Thanks, Panasonic !</li>
            <li> and it did an okay job, but for the most part, for the past 40 years I shaved with a blade.</li>
            <li> I first used the razor</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was interested in this model and the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> My beard is such that it needs a gel and blade most of the time.  </li>
            <li> Bought one for my son, and then bought one for me to replace my almost 20 year old Braun (which I love, but after a rebuild and a final death, I was ready for a more modern shave).</li>
            <li> Pros: the first shaver that worked on me.</li>
            <li> When the Panasonic ES8103S (Arc 3) was on sale, I decided for the first time to try a foil shaver.</li>
            <li> He has just now used it for the first time.</li>
            <li> I have tried the circular shavers for many years, but finally switched to this version.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what I want.  </li>
            <li> The blades are shot - the motor is making a funny noise.</li>
            <li> For the convenience, I was glad to go back to the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> but it burn out on me since i used it out of the country with a higher voltage.</li>
            <li> Glad this works internationally.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> My first one was still working well</li>
            <li> Very well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> If you let it die (it gives you way more than enough notice with the display)</li>
            <li> I recommend at the discounted price, but at regular price there are better razor options out there.</li>
            <li> Exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> First one I dropped in the shower and broke a piece of the head.</li>
            <li> Pretty soon the line between a close shave and and hair extraction will be blurred.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone interested in purchasing an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I first got it</li>
            <li> at present it is better.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, I even skip using aftershave lotion most days because it&#x27;s not necessary.  </li>
            <li> I love the digital battery life display.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to use it without the need for a touch up with regular shaving razors.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s an improvement on the first.  </li>
            <li> When I first received this shaver it worked well.  </li>
            <li> So I was pretty disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received my Panasonic ES8103S the first week of June.  </li>
            <li> Initially I was quite pleased.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time to use an electric razor in 40 yrs of shaving with lather.</li>
            <li> but this one was close from the first shave.  </li>
            <li> When i first received the product i thought it will not work well on my skin</li>
            <li> This was my first electric shaver.</li>
            <li> smooth shave 10 days use after full charge would recommend to anyone looking for shaving satisfaction and very quiet performance</li>
            <li> Exactly as ordered.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver.</li>
            <li> This is my first wet/dry shaver</li>
            <li> It is still holding up pretty well.  </li>
            <li> They do not recommend cleaning under hot water.  </li>
            <li> The key is shopping online for blades and parts because if you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll end up spending the price of the shaver or more for each replacement set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty compulsive about shaving -</li>
            <li> but my first Panasonic made me a convert, and the upgrade to linear deepened my enthusiasm.</li>
            <li> As electric shavers go, it&#x27;s pretty quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Reliable razor - my first electric.</li>
            <li> The Braun had a bigger name and more blah blah to it.</li>
            <li> it is what a shaver would be if Apple made one ;-)</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver in over 20 years.  </li>
            <li> This was and is my first electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> I think my review would be higher.  </li>
            <li> shaver isn&#x27;t the most silent one</li>
            <li> I used it first time in my life, I been hesitating to buy it</li>
            <li> I call this a &#x27;finishing&#x27; razor because if you have only one day of stubble, this will shave your face to razor-closeness, or even better.</li>
            <li> Being able to replace the battery is another big plus.</li>
            <li> say it gets uncomfortably hot.  </li>
            <li> think a lot of one&#x27;s reaction to the first use of this (or any) electric shaver is affected by what one has been used to.  </li>
            <li> First, I used safety razors.  </li>
            <li> I just now used it the first time.</li>
            <li> Had to make too many passes over the same spot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shaved for 50 years, mostly with a razor, and I&#x27;ve finally found an electric shaver I like.</li>
            <li> whereas the Braun has a pleasing hum, the Panasonic sounds more like a giant hornet.</li>
            <li> I rinse it out after shaving and wipe it off, blow through the foil and the cutters to get rid of most of the water, and leave it open on the counter to finish drying.    </li>
            <li> This is by far the best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric, and I&#x27;m using it with cheap Barbasol, not some expensive cream, by the way.  </li>
            <li> If you have a thick beard(like my husband)you probably won&#x27;t be happy with it.</li>
            <li> i am a first time electric user.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty.</li>
            <li> But after a couple of weeks of using it, it started to work pretty well, even around the neck and adam&#x27;s apple area.   </li>
            <li> I have balding clippers that i use first</li>
            <li> First thing out of the box was to plug in the shaver to charge it.  </li>
            <li> So much nicer than the Panasonic it replaced!</li>
            <li> pretty frequently.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;This will be my first electric razor.</li>
            <li> I am thinking many are being too critical of electric shavers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably add more later.</li>
            <li> I am thinking many are being too critical of electric shavers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably add more later.</li>
            <li> If this exact one comes out with longer battery life and it works with the cord plugged in when the battery runs out of juice</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, long charge, close shave.  </li>
            <li> pretty much exactly what he was looking for.</li>
            <li> All shavers for some funny reason dont allow me to shave when plugged in.</li>
            <li> I love the digital readout and the wet/dry ability of this shaver.</li>
            <li> Compared to an old school razor, this is light years more convenient for almost the same exact results.</li>
            <li> Works OK but display syarted acting up within 3 months</li>
            <li> First thing</li>
            <li> Charges pretty fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was shipped promptly, but the first one I received would not charge so</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews, I bought the Panasonic ES8103S and tried it for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li> Much better than my last Panasonic model.  </li>
            <li> Battery charge last for more than a week.</li>
            <li> The first one, I ordered to replace an electric shaver I used on my legs.  </li>
            <li> you NEED to use the trimmer first.  </li>
            <li> It would probably work better in the shower, but there are non-shaver related reasons which make that impractical.  </li>
            <li> Have had an opportunity to use this shaver over the past several weekends, and I am impressed.  </li>
            <li> It makes a humming sound that is not too loud.</li>
            <li> Unlike the Braun electro-foil shavers, this Panasonic seems to oscillate at a much higher frequency, I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> rarely write reviews as my review history will show, but this is such a good shaver that I actually felt compelled to write a review about it.  </li>
            <li> rarely write reviews as my review history will show, but this is such a good shaver that I actually felt compelled to write a review about it.  </li>
            <li> First of all, they already have the fastest motor (13K RPM when you buy the Linear models) out of any shaver out there.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver ever, and I just received it today</li>
            <li> Probably not terrible for the time it is in use each day shaving that big head of mine.  </li>
            <li> COSTING MORE DOUBLE THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> Having formerly used a Remington two-blade Titanium electric razor for many years, I feel qualified to review this Panasonic</li>
            <li> /&gt;Razors in general with a straight head design are just comical to me.  </li>
            <li> Plus they actually pivot with your face and make so much more sense.</li>
            <li> and I am pleased with the actual shaver.</li>
            <li> I have not had it for long but so far so good.</li>
            <li> the only thing I dont like about this product is that you cannot use it while charging it, my concern is that with time, when the battery starts to wear off I may not be able to use it.</li>
            <li> but I was pretty sure that it was a piece of junk that wouldn&#x27;t last but a couple years</li>
            <li> Although many of the shavers I looked at, bought and took back stated they would work corded as well as cordless, they will not work without a functioning battery.</li>
            <li> It is pretty close to a razor shave without all the prep.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hot creamy shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> My son needed his first razor.  </li>
            <li> Nice close shave with minimal touch up with a hand razor.</li>
            <li> and I also am getting a pretty close shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This also recharges pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I charge it about once each week and rinse it under the hot water</li>
            <li> At first it felt funny</li>
            <li> The shaver have a digital led screen can show you how many power remaining so it is convinent.</li>
            <li> Very close shave without the nicks and burns!  </li>
            <li> When I first turned it on the display showed 10% charged</li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;m going back to the rotary type, It did a much better job for me.</li>
            <li> I see the first review of this item is from 2011.</li>
            <li> On top of that the charge only lasts for about three days of usage and  you can&#x27;t run it off of the cord; it has to be charged.  </li>
            <li> The only difference between the two is that the newer model has a travel lock switch like most Pannys.</li>
            <li> spend the extra money on a better shaver.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, keeps its charge a long time and doesn&#x27;t pull or knick my skin.</li>
            <li> Our first one lasted 4+ years and then the electronics went out, so we had to replace it.</li>
            <li> Took my skin a couple of weeks to completely get used to it, but after that it was smooth sailing.</li>
            <li> It also runs a top speed, even with just 10% left in charge.</li>
            <li> For a much higher cost mind you.</li>
            <li> it does exactly what it says it can do.</li>
            <li> so they tend to last longer, which means in most cases</li>
            <li> I first got the product, I would have rated it a 4.8 out of 5.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- indicator of how much battery left in the shaver and If u need to wash it or not!&lt;br /&gt;- easy to clean</li>
            <li> After using Norelco rotary razors for more than 30 years, I decided to try something different when replacement time arrived this time.</li>
            <li> After a moment or two of getting accustomed to the different grip and different shaving motion required, I found that it was both comfortable and highly effective.</li>
            <li> I think that it is a good deal because it has some great features and it isn&#x27;t as expensive as the bigger name competitors.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is that the plastic cover on top is pretty fragile, and if you drop it 4 or 5 feet, you better be praying that murphy&#x27;s law doesn&#x27;t land it on that spot that makes it crack and break.</li>
            <li> I have found the Panasonic Razor to be fast charging, quiet, reliable, and easy to clean after shaving.</li>
            <li> pretty sooth shave.</li>
            <li> I have owed many different electric shavers in my 83 years!</li>
            <li> Its better to use the regular stick instead of shaving with this.</li>
            <li> Shaving doesn&#x27;t hurt and I don&#x27;t have to take a hot shower to soften up my beard</li>
            <li> really smooth, and my 71 year old face can use it!&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> why the price here is much higher than it on the Amazon.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> The Arc3 is my first electric shaver; I&#x27;ve been sticking it out with a Gillette Sensor Excel but wanted a change in my shaving routine.  </li>
            <li> When finished with Norleco, just pop the top and blow out the shaving \\&quot;dust\\&quot;, then put it back in the charging cradle until tomorrow.  </li>
            <li> The only reason he doesn&#x27;t love it is because it doesn&#x27;t have a stand to place it while it dries.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d make a guess that anyone who shaves their head regularly would be glad to have this.</li>
            <li> A gift for my son, his first shaver.</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, the shaver gives a very close shave and the pivot motion is useful.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> But in the last 3-4 years, I haven&#x27;t been satisfied with my shaves.  </li>
            <li> First Experience</li>
            <li> Cuts pretty close.  </li>
            <li> and I was only able to use it dry.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first charged this baby up and shaved with it</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used the machine on my legs and it does a pretty dandy</li>
            <li> Always against the grain of hair growth at first.</li>
            <li> pros of this machine most definitely outweigh the cons.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> My first Panasonic brand</li>
            <li> I have had it for 2 years now, and the battery still holds a charge for well over a week of consistent use before needing to be recharged.</li>
            <li> This shaver really does the job!</li>
            <li> Though higher priced made in Japan shavers (ES8103S is made in China)</li>
            <li> But, I threw that one away after using this one for the first time, and I will tell you why.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first got this shaver, I plugged it in to charge, which it did within a couple hours from 20% to 100%.  </li>
            <li> should point out there is one thing to be aware of.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty underwhelmed with this razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used multiple brands of Electric Shavers and this one is by far the most comfortable and battery efficient.</li>
            <li> However, for a shaver at this price, I&#x27;d expect that it would be more quiet.</li>
            <li> First off: I&#x27;m 17</li>
            <li> however, this razer gets very close, much closer than my old $20 Norelco (of course it was 3x more)</li>
            <li> Wish I could have kept my first one, would have, but the parts were discontinued</li>
            <li> I have no buyer&#x27;s remorse with this shaver, which is a first for me.</li>
            <li> It does struggle with some of the longer hairs, but it&#x27;s a pretty infrequent problem.  </li>
            <li> I would say that the shave I am getting is pretty close to what I would expect from a razor blade.  </li>
            <li> Just received this shaver yesterday and used it for the first time today.</li>
            <li> Overall, I love it.</li>
            <li> At first I thought the Panasonic was a toy.</li>
            <li> It literally is like using a hot knife to cut butter.</li>
            <li> switched from a rotary to get a closer shave &amp; this does that so overall I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> First off, before this I was using a $20 trimmer.</li>
            <li> This was my first electric shaver I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> but it is pretty darn close.</li>
            <li> This is my fifth panasonic shaver, the first one made in China, and I have stubble four hours after I shave.</li>
            <li> Price was pretty good&lt;</li>
            <li> I love it immensely.</li>
            <li> This is the second Panasonic I have had and love it.  </li>
            <li> Finally, we found an electric razor that gives a close, smooth shave and doesn&#x27;t irritate!  </li>
            <li> :  The battery doesn&#x27;t last for more than about 5 or 6 shaves.  </li>
            <li> Cuts pretty close albeit not like a blade.  </li>
            <li> My first shaver lasted four months before it would no longer hold a charge.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric shavers for over 30 years, and tried many different brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Norelco and this and have to say that they&#x27;re pretty even.  </li>
            <li> It shaves pretty close</li>
            <li> This was the first one I put in my wish list</li>
            <li> : They cost too much!</li>
            <li> and then maintain the areas with the shaver, it might make it easier the first time you try it on your bikini or speedo zone</li>
            <li> Was difficult picking a razor for my husband, but this one works perfect.  </li>
            <li> a bit longer to wash, and requires both hands to take apart before cleaning (most of Philips only requires one click opening up for rinse!!!!!!!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love Japanese products</li>
            <li> If you use it with the Nivea Gel, the skin is so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s to sad ( with this feature it would be a best electric chawer)</li>
            <li> I have a pretty protruding adam&#x27;s apple, and not even that gets irritated when I glide over</li>
            <li> Is his first electric razor.</li>
            <li> Just open the top, add some soap, run under water, rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned many of them and the same thing happens</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH AN ELECTRIC RAZOR, AND FOR ALL INTENSIVE PURPOSES I FIND IT</li>
            <li> I have tried many more expensive razors and they don&#x27;t do any better.</li>
            <li> I have had it for 6 months now, and feel I have gotten my moneys worth for how much I shave my legs.</li>
            <li> I have tried the Norelco Shavers a couple of times and they were okay, but I kept going back to the razor for a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> The first lasted over 5 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many men&#x27;s razors and this is the only reasonably-priced one that works on the contours of a woman&#x27;s leg.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean too, and a charge lasts pretty long.</li>
            <li> This is my first.</li>
            <li> First product I have found that does no leave razor burn.</li>
            <li> But I find it gives me a close enough shave not to look scruffy from a distance, but if I am meeting with people I need to look fully respectable in front of, I need to get out the lather and razor blades.  </li>
            <li> but when my $$$ Braun gave up the ghost after just 2 years I decided to break ranks and go with Panasonic after reading  pretty favorable reviews.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I started using a electric shaver</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this razor since it first came out, and just loves it.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I didn&#x27;t buy a Braun</li>
            <li> Overall, I am satisfied with the ES8103S.</li>
            <li> Got exactly what i expected and does nicely.</li>
            <li> My sons first electric razor &amp; he loves it.</li>
            <li> Top 10 because different site have different reviews, but the ones I saw, this one was in there, within the top.  </li>
            <li> for a low- to medium-priced electric razor it shaves OK.</li>
            <li> the battery does not last for more than a week for me.  </li>
            <li> The sound level is a bit higher in pitch than my old model.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used so</li>
            <li> I bought this almost exactly 2 years ago.</li>
            <li> After several passes over one area, it wouldn&#x27;t give a smooth shave, it might eventually but gave up as my old foil shaver worked much better.</li>
            <li> buy into all the gimmicks - Buy this razor first -it</li>
            <li> An now, many months later, it works as well as the day I first used it.</li>
            <li> I still use my Norelco for the first time around, and the Panasonic to finish the job.  </li>
            <li> It takes more than multiple passes to shave.</li>
            <li> I would say that the quality of the shave is appropriate to the price level (which is in the middle).</li>
            <li> sooth cut &amp; soft sound</li>
            <li> as when I first bought it.</li>
            <li> most likely will be using an electric razor on my head for the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, I do not believe that it is better than a pre-shave oil and a shaving cream such as Proraso.</li>
            <li> under chin are pretty dense.  </li>
            <li> I am willing to learn\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am willing to learn\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I thought I&#x27;d try an electric, the first in my 68 years.</li>
            <li> This is my first Panasonic and</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is suppose to, shaves as close or closer than&lt;br /&gt;any</li>
            <li> I wound up first using my Norelco to cut the longer hairs and then finishing with the Panasonic for a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this shaver really takes the prize!</li>
            <li> The first one lasted 5 years at which time the battery would not keep a charge.</li>
            <li> Even if it would last two or three years I will be pleased.</li>
            <li> Granted the sores are few &amp; superficial, but maybe using \\&quot;aftershave\\&quot; is a good idea to help serialize the area after shaving.  </li>
            <li> It is a good shaver, but for my hand the shaver shape is not comfortable.</li>
            <li> if not closer (since you can go opposite way much easier) than my Gillette fusion, which was surprising and unexpected.</li>
            <li> but the neck and chin are some trouble spots for the shaver but all and all good shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this a few months now, its good.  </li>
            <li> is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a cradle; the one thing I liked about my old Panasonic razor was that it had an inductive charging cradle which was very convenient, and because the charging was inductive it meant the shaver was completely sealed.</li>
            <li> I had trouble finding a good shaver at this price point.</li>
            <li> These Panasonic models will give you a good shave if you plan to use them for just a few months and them throw them away.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is a good value if it lasts a few years</li>
            <li> I was expecting this model ES8103s to be better than my old ES8066 model which was rugged, good quality, and long lasting (10 years).</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the wet function becomes very useful - after each use, you can actually clean it under running water!</li>
            <li> The Panasonic is very easy on my face and never irritates my skin but shaving dry doesn&#x27;t give the closest shave I ever had.  </li>
            <li> This is a great shaver and beat my old Braun 7 series hands down.</li>
            <li> I have a very tough beard and this is hands-down the best shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I am not interested in using it in the shower, but still pleased that I can rinse it under the faucet to clean it.  </li>
            <li> it seems that I do spend a bit longer with this model, doing several passes to get my face just right, but that might just be my own idiosyncrasies and getting used to the floating head (the old Braun would just pivot).</li>
            <li> single charge lasts for over a week and the razor is very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to buy this razor as an open box item for $45 (yay me) and I am very, very pleased with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a new series 3 Braun as a gift which I probably would have bought myself, since I was satisfied with my old Braun.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I decided to use these due to the reviews promising a more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts a very long time, it is relatively quiet, and gives a great shave.</li>
            <li> Very powerful compared to my old Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> Works pretty good but slower than my almost 25 year old Braun single blade plug in razor.</li>
            <li> To clean this razor the manual shows several steps you should take to clean including the use of a hand soap and running the razor with the sonic speed.</li>
            <li> The technology is much more advanced than the previous model.</li>
            <li> This shaver effortlessly gives me an incredibly close shave whether I use it wet OR dry.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and dry.  </li>
            <li> It is quiet, the swivel head is comfortable, and the shave is quick and close.  </li>
            <li> Oh yes, incredibly easy to clean, rinse and let dry</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with a similar Panasonic for about 5 years and my pleasant experience was key in selecting this one for him.</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it, it&#x27;s durable, easy to use and has stood the test of time so far.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and works better than I expected.</li>
            <li> You can clean it with soap and water instead of any expensive solution, the upfront purchase cost is reasonable, and the quality of the shave is very good.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer blade opens out at a 90-degree angle, which is more practical for shaving necks and sideburns than other shavers he has owned, where the blade simply rose above the foils.</li>
            <li> It also charges very fast and the indicators are very useful in telling you how much power is left and when it needs a clean.</li>
            <li> Even having been using an electric shaver for 20+ years, it still took about 3 full weeks for my face to get fully used to the new shaver.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to matter how much you spend, you just have to keep looking for the right combination and for the moment anyway, I think I have found it.</li>
            <li> However, right out of the gate, it did give me a much closer shave.</li>
            <li> shave my head bald and have a very angular face if it does me right</li>
            <li> The battery life leaves something to be desired, but right now, it works very well.</li>
            <li> I liked the results so much I started using it on the little blonde hair on my face, too, and am loving the results.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my new Panasonic ES8103 arc3 Electric Shaver wet or dry.</li>
            <li> After a year and half of having this shaver, I am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> If the blades don&#x27;t last more than a year, then, I am not sure it is worth paying more than the cheap Norelco.</li>
            <li> No less than 10 passes to get a smooth mustache area.</li>
            <li> I find that different parts of my face are best served by using different modes, and it&#x27;s a quick flick of the switch to move from one to the other.</li>
            <li> I took it a little easy with the first shave (dry) and applied more pressure today and had very smooth results.</li>
            <li> Nice razor gives a better cut than my braun but my braun blades are very dull.</li>
            <li> Anyone else who is tired of cheap plastic &amp;#34;make believe&amp;#34; products from China (no disrespect for this great country or its people), I highly recommend the Braun series 5.</li>
            <li> My beard is mixed between very light and very heavy and the Panasonic does fairly well in all areas.  </li>
            <li> It shaves closer and in less time than my prior older model Panasonic that did good service for many years.</li>
            <li> I can use it half up getting one good shave whereas my older heavier one will last a week and do a better job.</li>
            <li> I have owned 12 or more shavers in the last 20 years, and this is one of the better ones, very close shave, I think closer than Braun&#x27;s big one I also have.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with both products, but thought that the components would be a little more interchangeable--this new shaver will not recharge in the cleaning/charging station with my first shaver, and even the power tips are different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unless you use it all the time you&#x27;ll find that is gets kind of a moldy smell and quite frankly you can clean this razor just as well if not better with soap and water than the cleaning station can.</li>
            <li> It provides a really nice clean shave and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like others have in the past.</li>
            <li> While this Panasonic ES8103S gives a better face / neck shave under the chin, the Skull Shaver Bald Eagle does a better job for skull / entire head (especially for getting around ears and easily reaching around to do back of head and neck).</li>
            <li> Used the product both wet and dry - only did a fair job in removing leg hair - for light surfaces it worked better.</li>
            <li> but I had higher expectation for this product after all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> This little jewel has given me the most comfortable and closest shave that I have had in decades.  </li>
            <li> As long as I don&#x27;t grow too much of a beard, I can get a clean face very quickly</li>
            <li> The shave is close yet gentle, it holds a long charge, and it is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Shaver works very well with the nonotech blades system and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and turn it all red like my old norelco rotary shaver , very satisfied with purchase if the shaver holds up for a couple of years</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ve read that the blades get the mesh warm due to friction</li>
            <li> I get a nice close shave on my face but the other areas are an issue.  </li>
            <li> The only issue is its battery, although still pretty good, not the same as it was advertised.</li>
            <li> Blades nice and sharp after about 6 months of use.</li>
            <li> It cuts better on the flat surfaces of the face than it does on the curves.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Agree with other reviewer it would be nice to have a stand</li>
            <li> someone with sensitive skin, I was excited to see how this would work.</li>
            <li> Due to the high cost of replacement razors for Gillette Fusion and the inevitable nicks and cuts that come from using even very good cartridge razors, I started looking around for an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> I find the unlocked position gives me the best shaves, and the wide head gives you a lot of beard real estate to mow down with one pass.  </li>
            <li> I am also finding that as I get more familiar with an electric razor it takes less time.</li>
            <li> though this model is hypoallergenic, the friction against the skin of day-to-day shaving can still cause some degree of irritation, so again, as previously stated, it is best to adopt a 4-day-to every other day shave regimen (M W Fri Sa), instead of every day.</li>
            <li> The other thing I love is the quick charge of this thing in about an hour</li>
            <li> It does not irritate the skin and is able to reach most of the hard to reach spots.</li>
            <li> Owned this for a couple of years and still has great battery life and provides quick electric shaving dry or wet!</li>
            <li> I did a quick math and realized that for the money I spend on the replacement cartridges, I can buy a new electric shave every year.  </li>
            <li> As soon as I get the new shaver, I was happy to see that it finally came, but at the same time nervous as hell to use it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this one because of the longevity of my last one and expecting this new razor to be as good as my old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tested it wet with shaving later, and it worked great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and empty.  </li>
            <li> I had a 15 year old Braun which worked, but wasn&#x27;t particularly fast or comfortable.  </li>
            <li> However the on/off switch is way to easy to press while in use - Panasonic need to either relocate the switch or make it less easy to press by accident.</li>
            <li> The only thing that does not hold up to Panasonic&#x27;s claims is the battery life on a charge - it is 3 to 4 shaves for me compared to the 12 or more promised, but I do not really care about this - it is quick and easy to recharge.  </li>
            <li> Not only was it quick, the shave was much closer than I have ever experienced with ANY of my previous razors.</li>
            <li> Really nice to be able to use it wet or dry.</li>
            <li> SO MUCH more comfortable than my old Philips Norelco dry shaver.</li>
            <li> It definitely worked better in the shower than dry, and even better with shaving</li>
            <li> The only criticism I have is that this shaver does not do a good job on the upper lip.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t travel abroad that much, and when I do, I bring a converter, so being able to plug into a wall outlet directly in essentially any country isn&#x27;t that valuable of a feature to me.  </li>
            <li> Almost a work of art - fine instrument  Holds a long charge  Charges quickly  </li>
            <li> I love that you can see how much charge is left.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would recommend buying this product if you don&#x27;t have problems with ingrown hairs and don&#x27;t mind spending some time shaving (which is ironic because I thought the point of an electric shaver was to shave more quickly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My suggestion is to give it a good 3 weeks of regular use and if you don&#x27;t like it send it back.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;I really love this neat razor, so much that I won&#x27;t go back to hand razors.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it, a good option even just to pick up if you&#x27;re looking for an occasional alternative to using your blade w/o breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> If you let your facial hair grow out more than a day, this shaver will not do very well.</li>
            <li> Found this model almost as close as 3-4 blade devices, much easier to use, and better at handling spots where hairs grow in different directions.</li>
            <li> Super simple to clean.</li>
            <li> the only reason it got 4 stars instead of 5 was because the &amp;#34;clippers&amp;#34; on the back aren&#x27;t good at all...</li>
            <li> so I decided since the overall shave wasn&#x27;t good enough</li>
            <li> The floating head feature can be disabled, but I found it to make the shave more comfortable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The four row shaver is only good if your face is totally beard free.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Only thing good about it from my perspective is that it is quiet.  </li>
            <li> I used to have a Braun and this is far, far better, smoother, faster, closer.  </li>
            <li> I do not know why my shaving is better than I found initially, and I really don&#x27;t care.  </li>
            <li> not as close a shave as with a regular bladed razor with shaving gel, but good enough when in a hurry,</li>
            <li> This razor gives a shave near as smooth as a straight edge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works far better then my old Norelco shaver.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks now, and I really love the smooth shave.</li>
            <li> While I miss the sensuous design of the old razor, I have to admit that the quality of the shave with the floating head is significantly better than old model.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not gonna be quite as close as a razor, but truthfully, the difference is so minimal that the trade-off is worth</li>
            <li> 7/10 (The shave itself is great as far as machines go, but the fact that it misses a few hairs and doesn&#x27;t do my neck as well as I&#x27;d like lowers the rating a bit.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different shavers lately, and this is one of the best.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t use the shaver while it is plugged into the charger.&lt;br /&gt;Neither of these are a deal breaker and if I can ever get over my old habit of shaving for 5 minutes like I did with my old shavers just to get all the whiskers, I should be able to increase my battery life.</li>
            <li> Husband has looked at more expensive ones, but I saw the good housekeeping seal.</li>
            <li> The price was fair and the replacement blades are not as expensive as many others out there.</li>
            <li> There are similarly priced 3-blade models that I think give a closer shave, so I think the retail price on this is very inflated, and I would be hard-pressed to pay more than $50 for this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It produces a good shave, is quiet, and simple to maintain.</li>
            <li> Shave is about the same when used daily, maybe not as good.</li>
            <li> At least I got a good laugh.</li>
            <li> Also, I found a fantastic review someone wrote about the different electrics under Sensotouch &amp; the Arc 4 review section...which is worth a view if you want to go deeper.  </li>
            <li> Almost the same, good battery status and solid performance.</li>
            <li> hard to get my neck right, but all and all a good razor.  </li>
            <li> Far superior than all other razors available.&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic really cares to make the design and quality they are known for.&lt;br /&gt;BEST BUY!</li>
            <li> The high speed motor really cuts the stubble quickly.</li>
            <li> With very gentle pressure against my skin, it quickly and completely shaves off all my whiskers.</li>
            <li> very close shave charges very fast</li>
            <li> Shaves fast, very fast.</li>
            <li> Highly reccomend this unit and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sparse facial hair that doesn&#x27;t grow too rapidly and isn&#x27;t very coarse, but I still have to go over and over most spots to get a *relatively* smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> The performance-to-price is high, so it is really worth to buy this model.</li>
            <li> I still get a fine shave, just not as close as a wet shave with this razor, but far better than acceptable.</li>
            <li> While it works great in general large spots on the face, the head on this shaver is so big that I can&#x27;t really get to the harder spots on my neck as easily as my Norelco did.</li>
            <li> Certainly there are other models out there for more money (including the higher end Panasonic) but for the money this is WELL worth it.</li>
            <li> I shaved dry with this at first and was pleased.</li>
            <li> The first one has served me well for over 4 years with one change of blades and foil and is still going strong, but I plan to stop changing em and use it only for travel.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a considerable decrease in razor burn which I am super grateful for, however the first 2 shaves</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks: After first use, I started doing dry shave, and just love the result.  </li>
            <li> First one is used almost daily and is still going strong after almost 3 years.</li>
            <li> The first one was still going strong after 10 years, but I replaced it only because I had the urge.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, and I like the new feature telling me how much charge I have left in the battery.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband based on all the positive reviews. . .</li>
            <li> so I decided to try this one after all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> After reading the mostly positive reviews, I decided to purchase this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband after reading all the positive reviews about it.</li>
            <li> Coming from a cheaper brand, which is no longer as efficient after 2 years of use and a blade replacement, I thought I was getting an upgrade after reading all the positive reviews on this brand &amp; model.</li>
            <li> I read the positive amazon reviews and decided to take a chance.</li>
            <li> Amazon is always a positive experience.  </li>
            <li> But as my neckline was getting irritated and based on a sale and generally positive reviews I bought this and have been trying it for 3 weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When it was time to purchase a new one (rechargeable batteries weren&#x27;t holding a charge any more), I was surprised the same model was still available.</li>
            <li> I use it dry and it gives me a very smooth shave, with no skin irritation.</li>
            <li> Until my purchase of this electric razor I have used a combination of blades and a trusty Braun 7000 Series that was adequate for a second shave if needed in the evening (fast growth) but was too much work to use as a primary shaver.</li>
            <li> It was about as cheap to order this new unit at the special price rather than ordering a new battery, head and cutter for the old one.</li>
            <li> This razor is easy to clean, comfortable in the hand, and I can get six to ten days of shaving on a single charge.  </li>
            <li> Extremely close shave, easy to use and clean.    </li>
            <li> The cheap Remis were hurting my face, but the Panasonic is real smooth and makes a soothing &#x27;angry mosquito&#x27; sound.  </li>
            <li> The quality of the shaving is very close to a blade and maybe even higher considering no nicks, cuts, irritation, etc.</li>
            <li> On the first shave I really thought I wasn&#x27;t going to like this unit, but the manual says stick with it to allow your face to adjust to it.</li>
            <li> I have used Braun electric shavers in my 20&#x27;s, also with some irritation and in-grown hairs on the neck pretty much all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is pretty much a &#x27;one pass&#x27; shaver.  </li>
            <li> It will remove some hair but it takes many, many passes over the same area to do even a partial removal.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic gets all the hairs on the first pass and it shaves really close.</li>
            <li> First you will have to shave with a real razor and then just try to keep things trimmed up with this one, which defeats the purpose.  </li>
            <li> It does okay as long as you don&#x27;t let your beard get beyond a stubble.</li>
            <li> It used to be that a quality product cost more but paid for itself in the long run.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure Panasonic is not wishing that it lasts that long either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The higher RPMs of the motor made shaving much easier.</li>
            <li> #34;had it for 15 years&amp;#34; Would recommend this to anyone who wants a close shave, fast!</li>
            <li> This is a much lighter weight shaver compared to my Braun shaver and it has a much higher speed motor inside.  </li>
            <li> I am glad that I spend a little more to get a little more.</li>
            <li> I also found that it feels much warmer, almost hot, as it passes over my skin.  </li>
            <li> This is the first that didn&#x27;t and was a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;s been working, but I continue to love these electrics.</li>
            <li> So I wet my face, dabbed some shaving cream on, and was pleasantly surprised to get a smoother, more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> At first use I didn&#x27;t like it much.</li>
            <li> Recommend it for first time electric shaver users or anyone who wants a replacement.</li>
            <li> This is my first modern day panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li> give it four stars for, \\&quot;I like it\\&quot; because it pretty much does everything I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> If I let my beard grow too long, I have to use the trimmer (which is top notch, by the way) before shaving.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really judge it from the first time.</li>
            <li> This panasonic shaver I really love when I let my beard grow too long.</li>
            <li> even better is that it actually cuts through my clark kent-like facial hair and gives me a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> No missed hairs here and there, as with his old razor, easy to clean and moderately priced too!</li>
            <li> Takes to long to shave with it to be able to shave in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shaves pretty fast</li>
            <li> than these few cons, I am really enjoying this shaver, and my sensitive face is even more thankful that I made the switch!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> With all electrics, if you let your stubble get too long it takes longer to shave and you will get more irritation.</li>
            <li> Evidently does not need charging very often.</li>
            <li> love it and battery life is truly long.</li>
            <li> This goes a long way at making me feel better about my shave.</li>
            <li> it really works very well,I like it!</li>
            <li> and I have to wait an extra day to shave again, but other than that the razor has been great.</li>
            <li> The battery seems to go pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I loved Braun, but they are excessively over priced.</li>
            <li> I have had one in the past and was a good product.   </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually share, but my buddy is a good friend.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works good, but I think the slide switch is a bit too small.</li>
            <li> I have no trouble with the number of shaves that you get with a full charge.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how this has any good reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as good if not slightly better.</li>
            <li> when I find something good, they usually quit making it or &amp;#34;improve&amp;#34; it (not).  </li>
            <li> I chose it because Consumer Reports ranked it near the top and yet the price is fairly modest compared to the very best-ranked models.  </li>
            <li> Also cleans up quick and easy without special equipment, the Braun had a bulky cleaning tub that required regular refills of a cleaning fluid.  </li>
            <li> It requires many, many, many passes over and over the same area in different directions (even upside down) pulling my skin this way and</li>
            <li> I was so happy to have a decent razor, and read in the manual  that you should use it wet for the first several times.  </li>
            <li> After going through the reviews ,i have bought this and after first use \\&quot;WOW ! ! !</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re OK with needing 10 minutes to shave (and having to clean up afterwards with a safety razor), don&#x27;t waste your money on this model.  </li>
            <li> stubbornly continuing to dry shave for many years with my Panasonics, I have for the last 5 years enjoyed better results by wet shaving (with Aveeno shave gel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it miiiight help with trimming down some before shaving, but honestly-</li>
            <li> Quick quiet and adequate.</li>
            <li> Does not shave as quickly and close as previous Panasonics I have owned but works better than a Norelco and Remington.</li>
            <li> Does a decent job, can quickly look decent in couple of minutes.  </li>
            <li> Since this razor had a seal of approval from Consumer Digest and we own other Panasonic brands, it was a slam dunk!  </li>
            <li> I can shave her even if she hasn&#x27;t recently had a shower, but I get better results when the skin/hair is still soft and damp right after bathing.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to hold in the hand, and has a selectable flex head, or keep it fixed, I like both settings for different parts of my beard.</li>
            <li> This has been a pretty good shaver, though I should note that the battery life is less than my old Braun.  </li>
            <li> , I decided recently to try the Panasonic ES 8103s based on the strong positive reviews on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> When my most recent Braun died I looked around and this Panasonic kept coming up with high reviews.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor for top, back, sides, and front of any head.</li>
            <li> I had used Norelco Phillips for a long time, but this one delivered a very close, smooth shave from the very first time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve rotated the blades once to be sure that they weren&#x27;t dulling, but I really think I could have gotten another few months out of their original position.  </li>
            <li> Shaves my tough old Italian beard like it was peach fuzz, close, smooth, fast  and in perfect comfort.</li>
            <li> and it looks and smells fresh as new.</li>
            <li> reviews here are pretty accurate overall in terms of the quality of the shave you get.  </li>
            <li> Luckily I have my trusty old Norelco or I would be growing a beard with no razor.</li>
            <li> I think it works better when it is dry.</li>
            <li> Especially like the curved head design, easy to get under the chin.</li>
            <li> I like how I can use it dry if I&#x27;m in a hurry, or can take more time and use water and shaving creme to get a closer shave when I have time.</li>
            <li> Easy to use pop out trimmer same as Norelco.  </li>
            <li> The digital screen in addition to indicating remaining battery life (6-7 confortable shaves per charge) also tells you when to wash the unit with handsoap and water which is quite easy.  </li>
            <li> I mostly shave dry, works well for me.</li>
            <li> but I hit those with a dry razor real quick</li>
            <li> Granted, this is also the first electric ive ever spent more than $60 on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also used to a coiled cord, which takes up less space in a bag and doesn&#x27;t require a twist tie to keep it tidy.</li>
            <li> we have too many minerals in our water for me to trust that it will dry without leaving deposits on my blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upshot: any shaver purchase will be hit or miss.</li>
            <li> He has really sensitive skin and is super finicky about everything.</li>
            <li> so I have some thicker stubble after this thing mows through it and leaves my face super soft.</li>
            <li> No more skin irritation, works great so far been using 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I prefer using it dry, but it did ok the one time I used it in the shower.    </li>
            <li> Cleaning is easy, you just open the unit up and run under water.</li>
            <li> I find it works better dry than in the shower.</li>
            <li> The sideburn trimmer is nice, plus less irritation of your skin over blade shaving.  </li>
            <li> I love that you can use it in the shower, with shaving cream or dry.</li>
            <li> Surprised how quickly it charges.</li>
            <li> It charged quickly, and runs quieter than any electric I&#x27;ve used by far.</li>
            <li> My previous Panasonic had a nice recharge stand</li>
            <li> So if you are super noise sensitive you may want to get a quieter one.</li>
            <li> With norelco the blade keeps falling off, but here it stays put and even cleans easily with simple tap water.</li>
            <li> Using shaving gel made it less effective for me and didn&#x27;t help reduce irritation.  </li>
            <li> Very decent price for the quality of the shave.  </li>
            <li> My previous razor was a nice Braun.</li>
            <li> The head of the unit can be put in to \\&quot;soft\\&quot; mode with a tremendous amount of pivot in two planes of motion, or put in to \\&quot;lock\\&quot; keeping the head perfectly fixed.</li>
            <li> Charges very quickly and the charge last over a week.</li>
            <li> Easy enough to clip off with the built in clipper.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Close shave in a quiet razor, lightweight and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Only \\&quot;complaint\\&quot;, is that Amazon makes is too easy to buy.</li>
            <li> I easily get 10 shaves per one charge if I want, but in the future I plan to charge all my electronics on Sundays.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not easily impressed and think that&#x27;s pretty incredible.</li>
            <li> Cleanup is very simple and charging is very quick.</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s Hypoallergenic, shaves close (only a razor will give you a closer shave, so no complaints here), can be rinsed clean, and unlike disposable shavers, does NOT leave a trail of razor burn/bumps, and it can be used to safely shave your entire body (as well as a man&#x27;s face)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t use it for a quick shave and does not do a complete job.</li>
            <li> Easy to care for; no extra cleaning products needed, just hand soap.  </li>
            <li> I get a much closer shave thanks to the higher blade speed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to shave and this really works very well, holds charge and can be used in the shower when the hair has been softened by the hot water.  </li>
            <li> Most days I use it dry</li>
            <li> Although I like the way this razor handles and recharges quickly, bottom line is it does not give as close a shave as my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> At first, you feel kind of worried water will destroy it</li>
            <li> I would not compare it to a straight blade (the king of all shaves , but takes a good amount of skill, time, and upkeep), but I would say with 100% confidence that it beat my fusion blade by a small margin.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely rate this a strong 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic shavers for a long time now with good results - only thing I don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> Overall, a good value as long as you&#x27;re not in a hurry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another year goes by and the (2nd) razor is still going strong.</li>
            <li> Charge last a good long time.</li>
            <li> If the quality of the shave was not so strong this one thing would be enough to cause a return.</li>
            <li> Happened to find one a little less at Best Buy.</li>
            <li> The motor is very fast and the foils get very close to the skin, leaving me with a smooth shave in a relatively short amount of time.</li>
            <li> Overall, it felt very good in the hand, and seemed to be of a durable construction that would last a long time.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic is hands down the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned!arge, but the indicator predictably drops by 10% intervals every morning that you use the shaver.  </li>
            <li> It goes more than a week on a single charge.  </li>
            <li> So, a year ago I tried a Panasonic model ES7103 (which had received largely favorable reviews).</li>
            <li> but the head is large and cuts a close shave.</li>
            <li> and I certainly don&#x27;t find it noisy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m keeping mine and certainly recommend the product.  </li>
            <li> But, if you had to make a choice, this would be a smart move.</li>
            <li> I have always had certain areas of the face and neck that I can not get a close shave.</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone and would certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li> I just assumed a certain quality for electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Why are a certain number of words required.</li>
            <li> In my opinion you dont need a five blade unit or even four unless you have a large head/face because the amount of razor head surface would be too large around rounded corners.</li>
            <li> but when it died I decided to try this one, based in large part on some of the reviews here.</li>
            <li> do recommend product to someone not wanting to spend large monies to get the task done.</li>
            <li> to shave off certain hairs on my chin.</li>
            <li> I wish I could remember the brand and model, as it would certainly help with the comparison I am about to do.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m saying an ELECTRIC RAZOR of all things is overrated, but I&#x27;m really boggled by the positive reviews of this thing.</li>
            <li> On a positive note, I still have this shaver and it shaves very well.</li>
            <li> It is light, does a fine job with its pivot action system, and holds a charge for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> it is amazing product, the first electric shave that gives the same result as regular shaving blades, except no irritation or bleeding</li>
            <li> I have been shaving most of my life (and no one cares how long that is) and have primarily used the Braun suite of electric shavers at multiple price levels.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve pretty much tried all the different brands and models over the years and none of them have given me as close or as comfortable of a shave as this.</li>
            <li> because most retailers only give you a month to return these things back to them for a full refund.  </li>
            <li> Having said that, I am on my second razor of the exact same kind and would not trade it for anything.</li>
            <li> I hope this shaver lasts a good long time, at least until something better comes along, which I doubt.</li>
            <li> It has a loud but not unpleasant buzz noise when</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned four Panasonic shavers because it has made more sense a number of times to buy a new shaver instead of buying replacement parts - one of my only complaints about Panasonic -</li>
            <li> This new one didn&#x27;t even last more than 2 months.</li>
            <li> The most recent Braun never seemed to shave well, even with a new replacement shaver head.  </li>
            <li> So every time when I am shopping for a new electrical shaver, I still will try both Panasonic and Philips units before making my decision; and just in my last two purchase, I do believe the tri-cyclone style shaver works better with me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A good shave can take a very long time and even then with my neck I&#x27;d need to use a regular razor to truly remove the hair.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a little better wet shaving (with foam) as opposed to dry, and it does take a week or two for your beard to adjust, but after that the shave is very good.</li>
            <li> Works great wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> The shave is great wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> It shaves closer than the Braun, I use less time in shaving, and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Works great wet or dry.</li>
            <li> It does a great job wet or dry</li>
            <li> Have used it both wet &amp; dry, either way, great shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to use it for dry shaving or for use on a wet beard and washing the shaving block off under the sink.</li>
            <li> This is great dry, wet or with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Works great dry or wet.</li>
            <li> Have not tried it wet yet, but did a GREAT job dry.  </li>
            <li> Has a great wet to dry option.</li>
            <li> I told him the reviews said a wet shave will be a closer shave, but he said he is perfectly happy with the dry shave.  </li>
            <li> It works great as a wet or dry shaver.</li>
            <li> Works great wet and dry.</li>
            <li> I clean this with liquid dishwashing soap, takes about a minute, let it dry and hit it with a quick shot of Remington Shaver Saver.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave even half as good as my old Remington Microscreen.</li>
            <li> A previous model of the Panasonic ES8103 had given me excellent service since August 2008, but it stopped working a few days ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the way the head moves and glides freely across the face, the easy cleaning method, the directions and the closeness of the shave (I have a heavy beard).</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be fair, I have a pretty coarse beard, I have to buy the &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; disposable razor blades because the regular stuff is also completely ineffective.</li>
            <li> Very smooth shave, minimal skin irritation.</li>
            <li> Even though the electric is significantly more expensive, the time saved, for the great look and feel, gives me the impression that it&#x27;s worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li> I can do a final shave with a good razor without having to throw it out after a single use.  </li>
            <li> Most importantly, the blades are very sharp, and as a result I haven&#x27;t yet had an incidence of ingrown hair, something that my old razor was doing a lot.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;ve had four of these is that I&#x27;ll replace the blades once after about 18 months or so, but then 18 months later I&#x27;ll just buy a new one if it&#x27;s a good price.  </li>
            <li> I research electric razors, and found that most guys had success with the Panasonic Linear series, mainly due to the high speed of the blades.  </li>
            <li> Working fine after 3 years, however, the digital display has stop working</li>
            <li> It still cut fine, but the batter could only hold a charge for 1 shaving, so</li>
            <li> However, I have always had a problem with fine facial hair and getting a close shave with the Braun.  </li>
            <li> I only used the trimmer side once for this review and it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> I only used the trimmer side once for this review and it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> I feel that the foil is really fine and stubble on your face is larger than that on your head.</li>
            <li> My last shaver was a Braun and it still works fine</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower with only water and it works fine.</li>
            <li> long as you keep a sharp blade in the shaver, I think this machine is a great value.  </li>
            <li> Love this shaver; it does a better job dry than wet, but that&#x27;s to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since this is my first electric shaver, I don&#x27;t have any other brands to compare this shaver with, but I am pleased with my purchase and the results it gives me.</li>
            <li> I love being able to shave wet or dry.</li>
            <li> The shaver seems to struggle a bit and requires multiple passes, but in the end it does a fine job on the moustache area.</li>
            <li> When I first got this razor, I thought it was decent quality.  </li>
            <li> The entire system is worthy of praise!  </li>
            <li> decided to give this particular razor a try after reading some  stellar reviews about them.</li>
            <li> I found that the customer satisfaction with the Panasonic shaver was very high</li>
            <li> This was very highly rated in Consumer Reports Mag.  </li>
            <li> , it is a very high quality razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cleaning is not hard - a quick rinse and air dry does just fine.</li>
            <li> My old Braun has a similar style trimmer, and when new, it was far superior to this razor&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> , if you plan on shaving at least every other day, want low cost replacement foil/blades, and are satisfied with a 80% clean shave, this is probably great bargain.</li>
            <li> I have only used it dry, however I suspect that a wet shave will be just as good, maybe better.</li>
            <li> But this little thing does an amazing job.</li>
            <li> have a nice little Wahl trimmer that I&#x27;ve used on my sideburns.</li>
            <li> The price is pretty good, and the quality is equal to any other electric shaver I have used.</li>
            <li> You need grow it out a little before it becomes effective.</li>
            <li> The convenience of shaving wet or dry is nice and it seems easy enough to clean.    </li>
            <li> I can now shave my neck area where i have never been able to before with an electric because it caused irritation and was never able to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> Great product; shaves tough beard without skin rash from blade shavers.</li>
            <li> It replaced an older Braun that I was finding more difficulty getting replacement blades/foil for (tells you how long I had it around).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty high pitched humming noise</li>
            <li> i would highly reccomend this product to anyone that is interested in an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> The pop-up trimmer is nice for the when the leg hairs are a bit longer than other times, as it whacks them down better in that mode.</li>
            <li> The fact that you can use it wet or dry is a very nice feature.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to clean with just a little liquid soap and and water.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to clean up, with a little Comet spray bathroom cleaner  and a rinse under the tap.  </li>
            <li> and I loved it for the mustache area because I have a hard time shaving this area without pulling and pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a very thick, stubbly face and really didn&#x27;t expect the shaver to perform a great job on my neck.</li>
            <li> , I figured it was better to get a whole new one with a new battery for pretty much the same price.</li>
            <li> It is very loud!!</li>
            <li> The second one though was better and probably a little faster and certainly more convenient.</li>
            <li> It takes a little more time but is quite a bit better than I recollect from my last encounter with an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I have no idea when I need to charge or clean (although I tend to clean it every other use anyways).</li>
            <li> There is no base for the shaver to set in, and so the charger is a separate charging device (much like a cell phone charger) which plugs into the bottom of the shaver, so the net is, another charger to keep track of.</li>
            <li> I wanted a shaver that was wet/dry capable and would provide a comfortable and close as shave as possible to a hand razor.</li>
            <li> The digital readout on the handle is a plus as well in telling you how much battery life is available in addition to indicating when it should be cleaned.</li>
            <li> and I realize that many individuals may get a great shave with an electric shaver and as such my specific issues are based upon a person with sensitive skin and a fairly heavy beard.</li>
            <li> I would say those sources are generally accurate, and I&#x27;ll add the following comments.  </li>
            <li> Visual charge % is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> During the first week of use I did get some minor irritation on my neck area under chin and around adam&#x27;s apple, but after that it was smooth sailing.</li>
            <li> Wet gives a much better shave, meaning in the shower when your skin is very moist.</li>
            <li> I have still to use it wet in the shower as many have said provides a closer shave since I can&#x27;t fathom wasting that much water.</li>
            <li> The local shopping clubs (ones that require membership to get in, they offers better deals) has better deals because their shavers frequently come with an extra replacement head!  </li>
            <li> This is great for vacations, summer camp, music festivals, or just daily green living.</li>
            <li> I own cheaper and more expensive electric shavers</li>
            <li> LCD screen is really a great feature for letting me know when to recharge instead of it going dead in the middle of shaving.</li>
            <li> I have a coarse beard so ingrown hair is a huge issue with me.</li>
            <li> Maybe I asked too much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very disappointing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It holds a charge well and gives a reasonable shave.</li>
            <li> fits the hand very well.</li>
            <li> plugged in, but it charges fast if you forget to charge it.</li>
            <li> Charges fast too...</li>
            <li> and if it really keeps the blades fresh&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> VERY close face shave if you use shaving cream -</li>
            <li> really waterproof - use it in the shower with no fear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t do my neck very well- even with shaving cream</li>
            <li> Charges fast and holds charge well.</li>
            <li> We would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> But as I said before, it is a much closer shave than the Remington, and it is an electric, not a blade</li>
            <li> Its easy enough to clean, so no need to spend extra $ for it.</li>
            <li> The shave was also much faster.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Charges fast and lasts a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> I scanned Amazon.con reading review after review and settled on my ES8103 Wet/Dry shaver based on the reviews and reasonable cost.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, I really like this razor.</li>
            <li> it cuts very close to the skin, and I like that.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product!</li>
            <li> So I decided to spent more and get a the Braun Series 7 720s.</li>
            <li> Very close shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve replaced the blades three times but they really should be replaced every 6 to 9 months.  </li>
            <li> Knowing the time left before needing to re-charge in minutes or percent of battery life remaining is important to me.</li>
            <li> I tried it in the shower but didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in closeness</li>
            <li> After a month I&#x27;m really liking it.  </li>
            <li> so light that you might think you only got a shell with nothing inside</li>
            <li> really like the wet/dry option.</li>
            <li> I had a Norelco before which gave a closer shave but really tore up my face.</li>
            <li> Then after much research I found the Panasonic ES8103S.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this Panasonic foil shaver, In part because of the reviews-(also $[...] off $[...] instant rebate, got free spare blades).</li>
            <li> in my case, I much prefer using cream to shave.  </li>
            <li> and I would have to say that this shaver really dose hit the mark.</li>
            <li> And reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8103S Arc3 has given me the closest shave since I shaved with the straight razor.</li>
            <li> The pop-up trimmer works very well on sideburns and does not nick the skin like the Braun.  </li>
            <li> It give a fast and close shave every time.  </li>
            <li> The linear motor is fast and efficient and there are virtually no mechanicals to wear out.  </li>
            <li> It is also much lighter than the Braun.</li>
            <li> The LCD that shows the amount of charge available only shows when the shaver is turned on.   </li>
            <li> Once out of the box, it was charged and ready to run in under an hour.</li>
            <li> Razor works very well.  </li>
            <li> I really like the waterproof design--makes clean-up a snap.  </li>
            <li> About 2 years ago I bought a Home entertainment surround sound system and after a couple months the dvd player started acting up.  </li>
            <li> For those times when I want to head shave without using a Mach 3 blade, I really like this razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely baffled.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> I cannot tell how much power on the charge is remaining</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s delivery was very prompt also.  </li>
            <li> My husband has done very well to get 3 or 4 before it poops out.  </li>
            <li> I used the pro glide, which works VERY well, but  the blades are too much money.</li>
            <li> Second, the shave is exceptionally comfortable.  </li>
            <li> It is much louder than the Norelco but</li>
            <li> not so much so that I would return it.  </li>
            <li> just replaced both the foil and the blades and it really made a difference.  </li>
            <li> just replaced both the foil and the blades and it really made a difference.  </li>
            <li> In easy-to-shave areas there was no clipping sound during the second shave in both orders; so neither shaver had a closer cut in these areas.  </li>
            <li> Very close shave and no burning feeling at all.  </li>
            <li> the very close shave</li>
            <li> using it wet is even better.  </li>
            <li> The motor is much faster.  </li>
            <li> It is so fast I can hear the whiskers being clipped.  </li>
            <li> I really like the close shave I get with this shaver.</li>
            <li> And it is fast.</li>
            <li> really breaks you after a while</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> it charges fast.</li>
            <li> This razor just really gets the job done.....</li>
            <li> He really likes that it can be used in the shower</li>
            <li> None, really, but don&#x27;t believe any claims about \\&quot;one pass shaving\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Charges fast, 5 - 6 shaves per charge.</li>
            <li> If between showers you use an Electric Pre-Shave like Williams Electra shave, you will notice a shave as absolutely as close to a blade.  </li>
            <li> Been using for three months and it works very well.</li>
            <li> This model doesn&#x27;t have the automatic cleaning system, but that was a plus to me, because I didn&#x27;t want to keep paying for cleaning solution and have to go through the whole cleaning ritual.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave your face, so much as it plucks it.</li>
            <li> and it is much lighter.</li>
            <li> The percent remaining feature on the display for the battery is very helpful to determine whether or not I am going to run out of juice.</li>
            <li> The quality difference between the products was absolutely incredable.</li>
            <li> It works well and cuts as close as a straight razor.  </li>
            <li> Therefore when I do use it, it gets a real workout.  </li>
            <li> I was asleep at the time and he took my razor into the bathroom while he was getting ready for work.</li>
            <li> He loves this razor so much that I bought him one as a gift.</li>
            <li> and he wants to meet my shaver too, since he hates using a blade.</li>
            <li> so I really don&#x27;t care.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It charges fairly fast, but when you plug it in at night, who cares?</li>
            <li> so I really don&#x27;t care.  </li>
            <li> It charges fairly fast, but when you plug it in at night, who cares?</li>
            <li> This rechargeable razor works very well.</li>
            <li> It gives me a completely smooth shave the same as my Fusion 5 blade razor but without the irritation!</li>
            <li> shower before I shave and this cuts thru the damp hair really well.</li>
            <li> It produces so much noise when I use it.</li>
            <li> to get a reasonably close shave, shaving can take longer than desired, but it will get the job done.</li>
            <li> Cleaning is very convenient; much easier than Norelco.</li>
            <li> I can shave on the go or use shave cream either way it works very well.</li>
            <li> Almost as close as my 50-blade-or-more Gillette and so much easier.</li>
            <li> really like the idea that you can wash this item under running water with soap.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s got a 13,000 RPM motor, so it really hums along.  </li>
            <li> He absolutely LOVES this shaver.</li>
            <li> it absolutely does not irritates my skin, even under chin.</li>
            <li> This shaver works well on my head with a really close shave without that feeling on your scalp.</li>
            <li> If you shave just your face, you might not have as much enthusiasm.</li>
            <li> will say that the razor was light, but sturdy, and ran quietly.  </li>
            <li> Really liking this shaver.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic Wet/Dry shaver does very well.</li>
            <li> It was my experience that regardless if the shaver is Panasonic or Braun it doesn&#x27;t really matter that much.  </li>
            <li> which isn&#x27;t really a problem.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> It does not shave as close as razor, but it works better than I expected.</li>
            <li> His face did not break out and it is so much faster.</li>
            <li> I have a very heave beard</li>
            <li> Not as close as a manual razor, but very close still (some people may not notice a difference).  </li>
            <li> I think when this one wears out I will go to a straight razor.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am very satisified with the Panasaonic ES8103S.</li>
            <li> It cleans up with just a water rinse and really cuts close.  </li>
            <li> so I use a straight razor afterwards.</li>
            <li> Very close shave to a razor.</li>
            <li> This razor is as close to a straight razor I have felt.</li>
            <li> Oh, and in case you&#x27;re wondering; I do treat stuff gently and with respect.  </li>
            <li> Fast Charging.</li>
            <li> and the product works really well.</li>
            <li> but he tried it out and was amazed by how much closer the shave was.</li>
            <li> It is quite and gives a very close shave without razor burn.</li>
            <li> Fast charging also.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get much easier.  </li>
            <li> Very well thought out/designed product.</li>
            <li> Really fast charging.  </li>
            <li> The on-screen LCD showed 100% charge in about an hour...pretty darn fast.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic really seems to glide over my face and neck with virtually no pull.  </li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and get one,They are reasonably priced.   </li>
            <li> The battery charge lasts for 8 to 9 shaves and the recharge is quite fast.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t improved much even after use.    </li>
            <li> Never had much luck with electric shavers, and this one didn&#x27;t raise the bar much.  </li>
            <li> Ergonomic design and a really close shave.</li>
            <li> and it really works well.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he really likes it.  </li>
            <li> He shaves his whole head and face with it.  </li>
            <li> very close shave</li>
            <li> it may work even better wet.</li>
            <li> There is a display (100%, 90%, 80%...) of how much charge is remaining.</li>
            <li> therefore, I find it much easier to use.</li>
            <li> Safety razors were a real pain</li>
            <li> Produces fast close shave and at reasonable noise levels.  </li>
            <li> I just add the sizes of blades to suit the height of the cut, because the cuts are very close to the skin.   </li>
            <li> /&gt;This shaver has been much different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This razor also has a fast re-charge time, it&#x27;s done in an hour.</li>
            <li> It is so much hyped about one pass shaving.</li>
            <li> It uses a lithium battery, so it&#x27;s display always shows how much of a charge you have in percentage.  </li>
            <li> It gives him the shave that he wants and it charges in a hurry.  </li>
            <li> I really like my razor.</li>
            <li> It shaves close and fast.  </li>
            <li> Very convenient.  </li>
            <li> He really seems to like it and it is gentle on his acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> It even has a sideburn trimmer which he really likes.</li>
            <li> The motor vibrates so fast there is no tugging or pulling on your skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this Panasonic razor!</li>
            <li> A very Close shave  .  2)</li>
            <li> All in all I really like this razor</li>
            <li> Looking at the price, I must admit I really didn&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li> I have had issues with the battery and screen; however, given the benefits that I mentioned above, I am comfortable purchasing this shaver</li>
            <li> I have been much more careful about not letting it drop</li>
            <li> The screen lights up but does not display a legible value.</li>
            <li> The screen started to turn partially legible during the year</li>
            <li> Just wet the top a bit and put some liquid soap on it.</li>
            <li> This product is made really well, but does not shave as close as a razor for my liking.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic shaves much, much closer; almost disposable razor blade close.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a reasonable pricesince you&#x27;ll probably want to switch out every 6 to 8 months.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine the shavers costing four times as much can perform any better.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Now my husband wants it too.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers for 45 years and found them very dependable.</li>
            <li> It charges remarkably fast as well.</li>
            <li> I guess because it vibrates so fast, I</li>
            <li> That said, it still is a fast shave.</li>
            <li> &amp; He just told me He absolutely loves this shaver,</li>
            <li> Worked very well.</li>
            <li> After some tests I can say that both units perform very well</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fast.  </li>
            <li> It works very well on my cheeks but not that much on my neck.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t care that much.</li>
            <li> It works very well.  </li>
            <li> The water restistant feature makes it very convenient for washing the shaver, and gets an even closer shave.</li>
            <li> It does charge remarkably fast though - about an hour.    </li>
            <li> This really pleases me.</li>
            <li> Cleans very well.</li>
            <li> The real beauty though is in cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;D REALLY MISS IT</li>
            <li> Very close.</li>
            <li> And this electric shaver will still cut me if I go over a area too much or press too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I needed a replacement fast.</li>
            <li> chambers\\&quot; etc at a much lower cost.     </li>
            <li> but it does cut really close to the grain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very convenient for him to use before going to work.</li>
            <li> He gets the close shave he wants without irritation.</li>
            <li> However, I like it so much</li>
            <li> my whole life</li>
            <li> But, I really had to get used to it and its disadvantages.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my father, and he really loves this gift.</li>
            <li> Gives very close shaves and I would recommend this item.  </li>
            <li> im at 100%, really fast, but</li>
            <li> we all really like it.</li>
            <li> i guess i didn&#x27;t really know shaving until i got one of these</li>
            <li> and he says it works really well.</li>
            <li> But it cuts really well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much closer than I got with the rotary shavers.  </li>
            <li> I found I really like this shaver when I use shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> I also like the way it shows me how much of the battery charge remains.  </li>
            <li> This one will shave with three or four days growth -- although I imagine that depends on the person and how fast</li>
            <li> He loves it so much I decided to buy one for myself.</li>
            <li> After he used couple days, he said he really like it</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve decided to check the modern technology.</li>
            <li> Shaver is much rugged now, can be cleaned using running water, but it is still noisy and does not shaves well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very convenient to wash by water.</li>
            <li> Too much sound and takes different angles and movement</li>
            <li> &quot; is very true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> seems to work better as a wet shave</li>
            <li> I have owned this razor for about two months now and wanted to really get used to it before giving my opinion of it.</li>
            <li> this razor comes as close to a blade as I have ever had, much closer than the braun I replaced.</li>
            <li> He can shave very close without getting in-grown hairs or breaking out, which has never happened before.</li>
            <li> IT LEAVES TOO MUCH BEARD ON MY FACE AFTER SHAVING</li>
            <li> several rotations over sections of the face are required for a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> trimmer feature is not as beefy as the Braun trimmer.</li>
            <li> My primary shaver is a regular blade.</li>
            <li> Very comparable to blade/razors.</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver however:  </li>
            <li> It is also very noisy.</li>
            <li> Much easier on the skin, charge holding well.  </li>
            <li> We really like the razor.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t recommend this electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I find that this foil razor gives a much closer shave.  </li>
            <li> My RF41 4-head model works very well</li>
            <li> It shaves really well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> so much I bought another one for my son.</li>
            <li> It also really holds a charge.</li>
            <li> Also, it comes with a cord for fast recharge.</li>
            <li> check the quality and it is working very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually really like this shaver.</li>
            <li> It is much easier around the neck</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> This gets a very close shave and with no irritation.</li>
            <li> Maybe I expect too much -</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Very quite too.</li>
            <li> The Li battery should be a real plus too.</li>
            <li> only gripe I had about it was that there was no indicator light when you plugged it in.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice to see a green or red light to let you know that the unit is charging.</li>
            <li> Gentle pressure gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li> it handles very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is really horrible.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Have never gotten such a smooth shave as with this shaver.</li>
            <li> Charges fast, shaves closer than any shaver I&#x27;ve owned before (namely Norelco/Panasonic electric shavers).</li>
            <li> And he says it really shaves well.</li>
            <li> my face is very sensitve.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic really does what it is advertised to do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It recharges to 100% in roughly 1 hour if most of the power has been drained.</li>
            <li> He even lets me shave him sometimes (as he can&#x27;t see very well).</li>
            <li> I do not like the Panasonic shaver because it does not shave close and it makes too much noise.  </li>
            <li> He said he really likes the shave.  </li>
            <li> When I decided to purchase this, I had spent years looking for a shaver better and cheaper than blades.</li>
            <li> And it is ready to use at alltimes.</li>
            <li> It runs much quieter than the Braun, but it is not faster nor does it give a closer shave.    </li>
            <li> Seems to work reasonably well but doubt made by Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a blade for many years because I like the closeness of a wet shave.  </li>
            <li> This shaver has no problem handling 3 days of growth with no pulling, and gives a real close shave.  </li>
            <li> This item gets the job done without putting too much pressure on your skin.</li>
            <li> been using cordless/electric razors over 20 years, this one was costly but works really welll</li>
            <li> I bought it when it was a lightning deal, and figured it was cheap enough to risk it.  </li>
            <li> If you shave with an electric razor you really need to try this one.</li>
            <li> Very noisy and misses a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> Birthday gift for hubby was better than expected.</li>
            <li> I get a very close have with it</li>
            <li> Really dont use a blade much anymore as this shaver does</li>
            <li> I would have returned this shaver but the 30-day window had expired before I could really try it out.</li>
            <li> If you give this one a chance you will find that it shaves very close once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I really want to return this thing</li>
            <li> Very quiet.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> It does allow you to shave very close...closer than my Norelco did.  </li>
            <li> Charges fast.   </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t very noisy.</li>
            <li> it leaves so much hair on my face and I have to go over it with a razor blade.</li>
            <li> I got this on my budget and is very useful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really like this.  </li>
            <li> and it cuts very close.</li>
            <li> Where the Panasonic cuts much closer.  </li>
            <li> It gives a reasonable shave.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a reasonable priced electric razor that would still get the job done.  </li>
            <li> and then I used the shaver for 16 straight days before the charge indicator showed 10% remaining.  </li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t expecting much for a wet/dry for fifty bucks</li>
            <li> Received my shaver yesterday, charged it overnight and was ready to go this morning   </li>
            <li> I have been getting very close shaves.</li>
            <li> Fast &amp; very close shave.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> one straight razor like the barbers used to use, which I got on eBay.    </li>
            <li> So fast.</li>
            <li> My husband has had one for years and is very please with his razor.</li>
            <li> Can get at places on the neck that straight razor misses.  </li>
            <li> He prefers a much closer shave than this provided.</li>
            <li> Like it so much I recommended it to my son.</li>
            <li> Very close shave.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend purchasing this shaver!</li>
            <li> If you travel I also would add on this item as it is very inexpensive but</li>
            <li> The price of a foil and cutter was reasonable given replacement every 18 to 24 months.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> After one year now, the razor still runs very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The trimmer isn&#x27;t very convenient.</li>
            <li> The razor looks big, but is actually light and well balanced in your hand.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive or prone to chronically irritated skin like mine, this product is worth every penny.    </li>
            <li> Fast charge.  </li>
            <li> Wish Panasonic would have spent more money on a case.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t holding a charge and didn&#x27;t shave my neck very well.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the scent of any of the easily available commercial pre-shave preparations.</li>
            <li> This razor is gentle on the skin</li>
            <li> but he doesn&#x27;t use it much because it leaves it not well shaved.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for 3 years which is about as much as you should expect for a product that costs $80.00  </li>
            <li> I really like the handle and the battery time indicator.</li>
            <li> I have a real beard not some fuzz you need the sun in the background to notice.</li>
            <li> And much faster.</li>
            <li> I thought about buying a much cheaper model because once healed</li>
            <li> The razor works very well</li>
            <li> really like that it has a Lithium-ion battery.</li>
            <li> Very happy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave this shaver a cousin who absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> He finds it very convenient and has nothing to complain about.</li>
            <li> price&lt;br /&gt;Charge indicator is very usefull to me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
            <li> of a pain not being able to use it plugged in, but it makes sense, since you can get it wet.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor for women and men, alike!</li>
            <li> The attached trimmer works very well</li>
            <li> This thing shaves close and smooth, and it&#x27;s very quiet!</li>
            <li> Almost as much as the razor itself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for some 55 years and really like the design of the shaver and give it five stars for its performanace.  </li>
            <li> He just had radiation treatment to the face/neck, very tender skin.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit that taking an electricial appliance into the shower was an unnatural act, but it works very well.  </li>
            <li> He really likes it.  </li>
            <li> It cleans under water, and the trimmer works very well without blocking your view when using it</li>
            <li> The only con might be the lack of a zippered, protective catrrying case (it comes with a cheap drawstring pouch)</li>
            <li> Linear motor really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Not the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned, takes a while to get a semilose shave, some what disappointing.</li>
            <li> This is a very reliable shaver.</li>
            <li> Moving it gently over skin leaves, basically, semi-long stubble that the shaver has a much easier time with.  </li>
            <li> Two, the clipper is the only thing about this shaver that feels cheap.</li>
            <li> Yet still, it&#x27;s a very close shave, and feels like a well designed, thought out product.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The difference is marginal; it still cuts very close and clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , It shaves very well</li>
            <li> Received item as described, thanks ...</li>
            <li> The shaver is very</li>
            <li> Reasonable price for what you get.</li>
            <li> Quiet; Excellent battery life, enough for ten shaves before recharging is necessary.  </li>
            <li> I bought another one before but didn&#x27;t work as much as this.</li>
            <li> I guess, I should get used to instructions that say nothing in 14 languages - written by the legal department.</li>
            <li> Husband loves the razor and the price so much he bought another for a spare.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Cuts really close but does not irritate skin.  </li>
            <li> and I can tell how much I missed having an electric.</li>
            <li> This razor uses a straight, linear motion and provides a fast, close shave.  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s the front that really matters.</li>
            <li> If you have reasonable shaving expectations from an electric shaver then this product will not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> am really astounded that all the shavers made now are basically disposable.</li>
            <li> This is important to me because I can&#x27;t carry around one of those cleaning pods especially when traveling out of the country.</li>
            <li> The shaver is fast and has a meter indicating the percentage of battery charge remaining.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t go straight at it, but angle the blade a bit and take your time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Braun shavers for years with the cleaning bases, and having to buy the cleaning solution things all the time was really hurting my wallet.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this shaver.</li>
            <li> I would be very hesitant to buy another Panasonic w/LCD display or otherwise and must face Xmas day with stubble.</li>
            <li> Lots of missed hairs even though I spent more time shaving.</li>
            <li> really don&#x27;t want anybody to pay money for something that they will never get.....</li>
            <li> Re-charges fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks and have foound the razor to cut well, easy to clean and holds a charge for several days.</li>
            <li> Shaves smootly without much effort.</li>
            <li> He says &amp;#34;its really nice&amp;#34</li>
            <li> It charges fast and does the job.</li>
            <li> I really recommended.</li>
            <li> I like these so much that I&#x27;ve purchased one for each of my sons.</li>
            <li> and it is very nosie..</li>
            <li> but neither of those show much improvement.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Holds a charge for 6 to 7 shaves and is very lightweight.  </li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> He really likes it.  </li>
            <li> Gets really close</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work very well in the shower, but works well with or without the cord so...</li>
            <li> He likes it so much</li>
            <li> I use really like this Razor</li>
            <li> With almost 1400 reviews of this venerable old-timer already posted on Amazon, there isn&#x27;t much I can add.</li>
            <li> However, the fact that it constantly runs neck-and-neck with Braun&#x27;s 790cc as the number one seller of foil shavers at Amazon tells me there are two types of electric shaver buyers out there; those who are prepared to lay out the big bucks for what is often heralded as the best shaver money can buy (it isn&#x27;t) and another group who think that about $80 is the proper amount to pay for such an item.</li>
            <li> really like this shaver.</li>
            <li> Works very well on my face, neck and head.  </li>
            <li> Better for me as a wet shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son and he really likes it.</li>
            <li> Husband really likes electric razor.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have the face soap that I use with my straight blade</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t enjoy shaving with a blade because it irritates my skin, especially under the jawline.</li>
            <li> this is a perfectly reasonable product and price, however.</li>
            <li> And Panasonic really seems to have hit a home run at balancing the size for this shaver.</li>
            <li> It does shave really close...</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting this much battery life after reading some reviews saying it lasts about 3-5 shaves.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Much easier than my Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had to re shave the same spot over and over to get a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> skin is not at all irritated by this shaver, and the smoothness of the shave feels as close to a real razor as I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li> Even if you do get all of the hairs it absolutely destroys my skin even after the 30 days it suggests you take to get used to it.</li>
            <li> He still wants to lubricate it before each us.</li>
            <li> THANKS.</li>
            <li> Now, after two weeks of use, I&#x27;m ready to report in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one works really well.  </li>
            <li> The outer foil is much thinner and allow for a closer shave.</li>
            <li> VERY close shave and pivoting head makes it a snap.  </li>
            <li> Also, I purchased a shaving gel which really helps the razor shave closer.  </li>
            <li> Of course it will not get you the &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; shave that a straight edge will give you</li>
            <li> Except in SonicClean mode, which I&#x27;m not convinced really does much.</li>
            <li> Significantly better shaving wet.  </li>
            <li> Quiet, fast, close enough and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> It works very well and quite fast</li>
            <li> so it is also very convenient.  </li>
            <li> That really put a dent in my wallet.</li>
            <li> I really dislike when that</li>
            <li> He is very picky about razors.  </li>
            <li> and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> really good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &gt; The real advantages of this shaver are...</li>
            <li> significantly better wet</li>
            <li> I get a very close shave and it gets the difficults places like under the chin very well.</li>
            <li> The surprise was that the battery lasted for whole two weeks -</li>
            <li> face was smooth and I could go out in public without looking like I landed face-first in a patch of poison ivy.&lt;br /&gt;Being that this is a machine</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s understandable concerting how fast it is moving.  </li>
            <li> I really like the shaver</li>
            <li> This is a very well-designed product.  </li>
            <li> Is ok product but for the price I expected it to get a closer shave</li>
            <li> it really is just hit and mis</li>
            <li> Fast and reliable.</li>
            <li> Does not give a very close shave.</li>
            <li> He said that it works really well.  </li>
            <li> I am very please with it</li>
            <li> With that being said, it doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; the hair up.  </li>
            <li> the compartment that stores the hair doesnt really work all that well.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic products always seem to perform better than expected.</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> A bit pricey, but performs very well.</li>
            <li> But with the Panasonic ES8103S Arc3 Electric Shaver Wet/Dry, I have found real perfection.  </li>
            <li> It also charges fast.  </li>
            <li> It holds a charge well and shaves very close.  </li>
            <li> The pop-up trimmer works very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not as close a shave as a razor, but after you get used to it, you can get a rather smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really worked well for me.  </li>
            <li> This Panasonic shaver was better than I had expected.</li>
            <li> Much quieter than the Braun.</li>
            <li> It is very portable.</li>
            <li> This produce really works.</li>
            <li> I really like this Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shave much</li>
            <li> He uses it with soap and water (no shaving cream) and absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Will have to try the wet shave to see if it&#x27;s even better.</li>
            <li> Lives up to expectations, and a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been nearly as careful with it as I should have; my dog chewed up the charging end, and I&#x27;ve dropped it more times than I&#x27;d care to admit.  </li>
            <li> SHAVES CLOSE  AND FAST.  </li>
            <li> RECHARGES FAST</li>
            <li> It really does get close!&lt;br</li>
            <li> battery holds charges very well</li>
            <li> The battery does hold charge very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very close shave.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to trim before I start the real shaving.</li>
            <li> It is also much slimmer than Norelco rotary</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver for my needs, would buy one for my father too.&lt;br /&gt;Powerful and quiet, one charge last for three weeks of everyday usage.</li>
            <li> very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fact that they encourage you to use it wet speaks volumes about how confident Panasonic is in this product, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It charges fast, and it does provide a very close shave as promised.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s performing very well.  </li>
            <li> Never thought he &#x27; get such a smooth shave from an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Panasonic ES8103S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Silver and it is very usefull.</li>
            <li> But, Panasonic is getting very close with the ES8103S!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving</li>
            <li> The straight edge is efficient for my sideburns.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The description, also tells you what replacement foil accessories you need, which is very helpful as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My previous Panasonic razor, model ES8043, which is just an older version of this current razor, also worked great for about 6 years.</li>
            <li> Gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Dennis</li>
            <li> and he said it worked really well</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why Panasonic, a Japanese company, wants to use Chinese manufactures instead their own plants, but time will tell if this shaver will continue to perform well.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I really like it; would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have send it to my friend as a gift, He is  very like this watch.</li>
            <li> It shaves very close.</li>
            <li> This machine does not shave very close.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We can still order parts for it and separately not the whole head.  </li>
            <li> This is the most I&#x27;ve ever spent on a shaver.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic provides a closer shave , better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> That means to me he likes very well.</li>
            <li> is also very good，Some still do not understand icons</li>
            <li> the shave isnt very close</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cause ME any razor bumps on my neck and is still a very close shave.</li>
            <li> I do not get razor burn like with the straight razors, and still have to shave just as often.</li>
            <li> my husband said it&#x27;s very convenient to use.</li>
            <li> My head became very tender because of the bumps resulting from the use of the shaver on my head.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> and he wants another for travel......</li>
            <li> It cuts very close and doesn&#x27;t give me razor bumps.</li>
            <li> Gives a close, fast shave.  </li>
            <li> This shaver works very well...</li>
            <li> Very noisy but it up well.</li>
            <li> I recommend it for anyone who appreciates a very close shave.</li>
            <li> I completely got my money&#x27;s worth, and themsome.</li>
            <li> Razor works very well, shaves very close with no irritation.</li>
            <li> The Braun brand seems to have gone very high-priced and with features</li>
            <li> I really like the longer lifetime of the cutter and foil vs. the Braun.</li>
            <li> It is now ten hours since I shaved with this razor, and my face and neck are still smooth.</li>
            <li> cleaning is very effective……</li>
            <li> I have had it for over a month now and it works very well.</li>
            <li> Very close shave.</li>
            <li> Even gets the jaw line and neck really well</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Product very good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I  owned a panasonic razor before and it was one of the best cutting razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> This gives you a closer shave like using a straight razor.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really recommend this at all.</li>
            <li> It is very close to a blade shave</li>
            <li> This device can&#x27;t be for the whole body</li>
            <li> I like it so much.</li>
            <li> I have the 4 blade razor and just know how much he will appreciate it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t always deliver a smooth shave and sometimes have to shave over areas several times to remove hair.  </li>
            <li> It is not as fast as I would like</li>
            <li> and I really l like it.</li>
            <li> I also really like the wet/dry feature.</li>
            <li> It is also much lighter and easier to obtain that close shave.</li>
            <li> So much time saved.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t really need any cream either.</li>
            <li> My neck hairs grow at a very close angle to my skin, so I always have some sort of irritation regardless of the shaving method.</li>
            <li> The battery power lasts one week, and charges fast.</li>
            <li> and it pulled the hair out as much as it cut,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much to compare it too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very close shave too.</li>
            <li> It works VERY well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For one thing, it is very noisy.  </li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave, but not as fast as my Norelco.  </li>
            <li> Reasonably close.</li>
            <li> I transitioned to a 3 straight blade foil system.</li>
            <li> The razor also charges fast.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Not as close as shaving with a razor but also not as much of a hassle.</li>
            <li> and he really loves it .....</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower , wet, and just love it</li>
            <li> It shaves almost as close as a blade (no electric has ever shaved 100% as close as a blade, but this one comes very close).</li>
            <li> The technology has really improved.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8103S  produces a shave that is very close to that of a razor.</li>
            <li> w/h/b the same as a cheap one of this Brand).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clear cover useful for travel.</li>
            <li> I had tried another model before this one, and this one was MUCH easier on my skin, no pinches or nicks which was a plus.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Nothing of real note.  </li>
            <li> Very close and fast shave.</li>
            <li> the display tells you how much charge remains in percentage.  </li>
            <li> This is very convenient for me.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this product.</li>
            <li> The blades move so fast and the trimmer gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I dont have the thickest hair in the world, but I think its ready for just about any hair type out there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pivot (soft) action is great for uneven terrain.</li>
            <li> I find it FAR better than a Norelco rotary shaver I tried at the same time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you only have to do one pass over, it takes 2-3 on some sections on my neck where the hair grows at differ angels, but that&#x27;s better than my old razor</li>
            <li> Compared to the Norelco, it&#x27;s also pretty loud and feels hot on my skin.</li>
            <li> but I think these types of razors get warm on the foil after a few runs across the face.</li>
            <li> I am sure I&#x27;ll move on to a newer Panasonic model in the near future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks, and so far, so good.  </li>
            <li> - Fairly silent (but loud compared to razor :)).    SEMI-CONS:  </li>
            <li> When you factor in the initial cost plus the cost of replacing the blades yearly and the foil once every two years, it cost more than a blade razor, and didn&#x27;t shave nearly as well.</li>
            <li> The rotary was OK, comfortable, but not as close and so slow.      </li>
            <li> I did not get the cleaning system, that part seems kind of gimmicky to me.</li>
            <li> To give you my background, I am the kind of guy who has to shave everyday.</li>
            <li> The LED battery level display is a nice practical touch the prevents surprise dead batteries.</li>
            <li> My last couple of razors have been Braun&#x27;s and this one so far has been better than both of them.</li>
            <li> If your beard is very coarse, you may need to do it more frequently.</li>
            <li> Kind of a waste of money.</li>
            <li> So far, several months later, it seems to be a wise purchase.  </li>
            <li> If it had failed within the two-year warranty I would be good for a free replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My old Braun was on its last legs when I decided to start checking out shavers on this (my favorite) web site.  </li>
            <li> I was not that into a shaver, the last I had didn&#x27;t make me smile, I have to admit this worth the buy</li>
            <li> Shaves OK, but, I&#x27;ve had to replace the blades several times over the nearly 3 years I&#x27;ve had it . . .</li>
            <li> This is my fourth Panasonic of the same kind.</li>
            <li> I liked that shaver but had a few reservations about it</li>
            <li> I am curious how much abuse the ES8103S will be able to handle with extended use.</li>
            <li> have tried it wet with shaving cream once, and I feel like if I&#x27;m going through that much effort, a razor blade is just better hands-down.</li>
            <li> The battery life has been consistent with each shave using 10% of the battery (i.e. up to ten days on one full charge).</li>
            <li> for whatever reason, this shaver has poor performance for me, though obviously many others are satisfied.  </li>
            <li> As a military man, I am required to shave on a daily basis so the panasonic gets alot of work in and provides me with a good shave without the &#x27;burn&#x27; marks that I would receive using a rotary head razor.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nice to know that I won&#x27;t damage it with a few drops of water here and there.</li>
            <li> I am female and this is far better than any electric shaver I have found that is marketed toward women.</li>
            <li> but I have yet to own an electric shaver that didn&#x27;t require two passes over my heavy beard to get all the stubble.  </li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t think it is as good as a wet shave</li>
            <li> With only 10% remaining on the charge, I was able to do a complete shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Electric razors have gotten slightly better since the last time I used one which was in the early 1960&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> (the one I bought has basically the same specs as the ES8249S model that we also own, so I expect it to work similarly).  </li>
            <li> I need to go over my face at least 3 times and still don&#x27;t get a good shave.</li>
            <li> It shaves better than my prior twenty year old Remington electric shaver.</li>
            <li> The rotary was good for at least 20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this shaver after I lost the power cord for my rotary shaver.</li>
            <li> Then I was catapulted into the present and was amazed at how quiet and effective this electric razor is.</li>
            <li> However, the shave lasts only one day and you will need to use the shaver more frequently than when shaving with a blade.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and a beard that grows in many different directions.  </li>
            <li> Not a huge problem as you can kind of see it</li>
            <li> but it is still not as good as my old dead Remington.</li>
            <li> In comparison with foil electric shavers, I have found the Panasonic shaver to be much sturdier; the foil in previous foil shavers seemed to break very easily.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised with a little patience a fine clean shave.  </li>
            <li> ; easily shaves virtually all hairs growing tight against the face, unlike previous frequent exceptions  Long-lasting charge: as claimed, charges last about two weeks with no slow-down toward the end - best I&#x27;ve ever had in this respect; fast charge too  </li>
            <li> I like this shaver very much, and will buy new heads when it needs it.</li>
            <li> understanding is high RPM&#x27;s is a main characteristic to seek for a great electric shave and this certainly is much higher than any other I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li> at least its easy to clean!</li>
            <li> (I usually spend about 5 minutes in the morning for a shave.)I primarily use this razor for dry shaving (although it works well with shaving foam or gel), and it has been great so far.</li>
            <li> Having been a loyal Panasonic razor owner for many years, I have learned that you can keep these relatively inexpensive guys going a long time and they work really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> During those forty years I did not notice any significant change in the quality of the shave or the pulling, picking and burning that came from shaving certain facial sections over and over again.  </li>
            <li> It does well with long and short stubble, and the trimmer is more than adequate.  </li>
            <li> and it was clearly used!!!</li>
            <li> Even though it is hypoallergenic, people with sensitive skin will still get some irritation if used every day, so it&#x27;s still best to use up to only every other day (M W F, Sat), or 3-4 days per week only to avoid skin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use shaving cream, just dry, and does a fantastic job the first pass.</li>
            <li> This seems typical of most consumer gauges these days including car gas gauges; however, I would prefer one that meauures consistently at all levels.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> This one works and looks essentially similar to the older model, which is fine.  </li>
            <li> I took the first shaver apart and it was filled with corrosion trying to keep this one extremely dry even though I&#x27;ts advertised as Wet/Dry.</li>
            <li> Previous model died after a long life and was happy with its performance.</li>
            <li> I find the dry shave pretty comfortable and it seems to get a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My whiskers are not tough, but they tend to lie along the skin</li>
            <li> Re: ES8103S : I have had MANY Panasonic razors, originally because they were the only one that would do a wet shave.</li>
            <li> still highly recommend this shaver for the quality of shave and positive experience with Panasonic.</li>
            <li> It came promptly after the first attempt to deliver it came to naught because some nit-wit would not deliver it to the apartment house where I live in Anchorage, Alaska.</li>
            <li> And be aware that Panasonic does not make replacement cords, so if you lose yours packing for a trip you will have to buy a new shaver.</li>
            <li> After 8+ years I said time for a new new and found   this at a local store and love it.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s pretty new</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of Panasonic electronic items right from the days of the old tape recorders, VHS players, and it&#x27;s HDTV  and cordless phone sets.</li>
            <li> Not only can they shave in and out of the shower, but when you grab all the dirty clothes off the counter by said shower and throw them in the washing machine, said razor has a very good chance of surviving the endeavor AND coming out squeaky clean!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t plan to use it in the shower [wet] and likely won&#x27;t do any more than &#x27;brush&#x27; it out to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery lasts a long time, and it is even easy on the ears too.  </li>
            <li> , there&#x27;s not really any other problems, but then again if the shave isn&#x27;t that great who cares about the rest?  </li>
            <li> I can easily see brining this shaver when I go on long weekends and holidays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Really like the way it tells you how much charge is left and when you have to clean it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I have absolutely no problem shaving on my neck like other reviewers have experienced.</li>
            <li> It may not have the most blades or other bells and whistles, but I can get a very close shave with it.  </li>
            <li> The battery is strong and lasts long and the blade cuts close.  </li>
            <li> So, I purchased this one and it is still going strong and has a long battery life.</li>
            <li> The LED indicator is very easy to read and makes it very obvious how much charge you have left.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the design of the foil and blades, or if it&#x27;s simply that the motor continues to run at full speed, but it&#x27;s comfortable enough that I end up with a very close shave because I don&#x27;t mind going over an area until it&#x27;s cut.  </li>
            <li> A fast close shave, easy to clean, and stays charged long enough to get about 7 or 8 shaves before recharging.</li>
            <li> My old Braun had new razors and screen but was a dog in comparison how quick and close this shaves.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic on the other hand gives a pretty good shave when dry</li>
            <li> Norelco razors are much easier and timely to clean by just holding the open head under running water.</li>
            <li> Not only is it way lighter (Li-Ion battery), but it is so much easier to clean since you just rinse in water when it tells you to.  </li>
            <li> Although under the chin takes some effort to get it close and clean, overall its fast and neat.</li>
            <li> With this razor he can use it in the shower without the aid of any irritating cleanser and get a nice clean shave.  </li>
            <li> He had the kind that has round shaver blades before and would sit around buzzing away forever and still not get a decent shave.</li>
            <li> I purchased the shaver and quickly realized it was well worth the price as a dry shaver.  </li>
            <li> I clean it more than needed to try to improve performance and go slowly</li>
            <li> I used to have to brush my old shaver out, and even go so far as to use a compressor on it to get it clean.</li>
            <li> The display makes the level of available charge easy to see at a glance and it charges quickly for single shave use if you let it run down.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning is very easy using a little liquid hand soap and a rinse under the faucet.</li>
            <li> Washing this model is also very easy too; a little soap on the blades, turn it on, and let it shake it all off under the running water.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> The battery charge seems to last a long time, and it seems to be easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The 2nd shave was better than the first and by the 3rd time I knew what I was doing.  </li>
            <li> I agree with most of the other reviewers, this razor works quite well.</li>
            <li> It shaves my neck better than any other razor and shaves just as close as my Mach 3.</li>
            <li> The razor does require more than one pass, and as in other reviews, it is louder than a rotary.</li>
            <li> I have owned Panasonic electric razors since they came out on the market and have converted many other friends to them as well.</li>
            <li> Now to the shave, it is smooth as you can imagine almost as good if not the same as with a regular blade, it is fast as well, I liked it so much that afraid</li>
            <li> Quicker and more thorough than either of my other electrics.  </li>
            <li> much better than a safety razor or any other electric i have owned or tried.</li>
            <li> Panasonic makes my favorite other electric items like a camera and also a cassette \\&quot;Panasonic Walkman\\&quot; music player that I used to use (with Panasonic \\&quot;tapes\\&quot;)</li>
            <li> It is much better than their other shave creams since you can see your face.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Bought it for senior relative who dropped and broke his original.</li>
            <li> I have used the Panasonic now for about a month and am glad that I selected it over the other shavers I researched.</li>
            <li> The normal razor is far better actually.</li>
            <li> All in all, excited about my purchase and still have about 20% of battery life left after a week of use.</li>
            <li> ; XMAS day 2013: This is a follow-up to my original 4-star review as shown above.</li>
            <li> After my latest Braun&#x27;s battery ceased holding a charge I decided to look at other companies products.</li>
            <li> Replacement of blades and screen are required more often than other razors I have owned.  </li>
            <li> But it was better than any other I have used.  </li>
            <li> Best of all, this ins&#x27;t even that expensive in the realm of electric shavers!</li>
            <li> have read reviews stating that there are other shavers out there that are better.</li>
            <li> Or maybe the other razor is supposed to also be able to get close to your skin, but as a result of it being a part of this wretched machine, can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is noisy; but I am okay putting up with it for 10 minutes every other day.</li>
            <li> No redness noticed and each shave seems to be better than the last one, can now properly shave areas that I couldn&#x27;t at first.</li>
            <li> I originally bought my Panasonic razor, identical to this except the digital display part, in Japan.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s not one to say anything other that it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> .It is suit for me.much better than other one.de.rserve</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, wet/dry gives it more versatility than other razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the Panasonic better than any other razor to date.</li>
            <li> I originally got the one with only 2 foils, but found it didn&#x27;t cut several-day-old stubble.  </li>
            <li> I do have to go over certain parts a few times to get everything, but overall it is a very comfortable and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> First, the electronics are outstanding on two counts:  1) it fully charges in less than an hour, and 2) it continues to run at full speed even as the battery discharges--the motor has the same output at 10% battery reserve that it does at 90% battery reserve.  </li>
            <li> It gives a nice close shave with very little effort and holds a charge for a reasonable amount of time.  </li>
            <li> Keeps a charge for a very long time and cleans up easily.</li>
            <li> This new razor is 5db more quiet than my old one.</li>
            <li> On the top of the head I can buzz over the bumpy scalp smoothly and easily without cutting anything.</li>
            <li> I bought this for husband for Father&#x27;s Day this year as his old Panasonic was pretty much toast.</li>
            <li> This product is just the opposite--it cuts facial hair cleanly and without pain.  </li>
            <li> You HAVE to clean it constantly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using various non-electric razors for the past 45 years or so and would be happy to continue to do so</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get some of the long and fine hairs on my neck, but the trimmer does get them without burn.</li>
            <li> Clean up is very simple just soap and water.</li>
            <li> This shaver will actually remind you to clean it before each</li>
            <li> For the first few times it takes time, but shaves really smooth and no cuts and no irritation!</li>
            <li> As others said, it&#x27;s also not real good at catching clippings.  </li>
            <li> The problem I had was getting a clean shave all over without doing several passes over some contoured areas.</li>
            <li> To complicate my use approach, I have a full facial beard that I trim to a very fastidious level using the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> After much research, I settled on this particular shaver.....</li>
            <li> When I was cleaning it recently, I did decide to take the blades off and clean around in there a bit with a Q-tip.</li>
            <li> It requires a lot of work to get a clean shave, and even that only comes at the expense of my skin.  </li>
            <li> It still takes time and multiple passes to look clean.</li>
            <li> Had it now for several years and it is durable and provides a clean shave</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t clean the blades with a brush, and that is probably why they last longer.  </li>
            <li> Simple to use, clean.</li>
            <li> But above all, clean it after you use it.</li>
            <li> I read the many good reviews from others who have a similar beard problem as I do; easy to shave face but very difficult to shave neck (hairs don&#x27;t grow straight and skin is somewhat sensitive).  </li>
            <li> Works fine but takes 4 times as long to shave than razor.  </li>
            <li> Overall, generally well satisfied and would recommend this to others with the caveat</li>
            <li> The same way I monthly clean my houses sewer pipes....</li>
            <li> This razor lasts pretty long after a full charge.</li>
            <li> They had the plastic in the middle to push and clean between the two blades.</li>
            <li> I had to clean it a couple of times to get her back in shape.</li>
            <li> The battery technology is much improved over older shavers.</li>
            <li> dry feature for easy cleaning</li>
            <li> I also end up using a standard razor anyway to clean up whiskers that the Panasonic misses.</li>
            <li> I have been diligent with rinsing and keeping it clean (hot water + dish soap, as the instructions suggest), but if I don&#x27;t disassemble the unit to dry.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin, and this razor is very gentle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;ve missed a neck area for 2-3 days, I have to use the trimmer blade before the shaver will cut those longer coarse hairs cleanly.</li>
            <li> I only clean mine before recharge cycles.</li>
            <li> you want a clean shave, especially on your neck, this is not going to work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had basic Braun shavers in the past and was happy with those shavers at the $40-$50 range.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my boyfriend as a gift and it won&#x27;t clean properly</li>
            <li> I generally replace it once a year, which is actually cheaper than buying most razor blades.</li>
            <li> : To cheaply, easily clean, I bought Gillette fluid refills for their razor&#x27;s cleaning system.</li>
            <li> pulled apart outer foil blades [following insructions] to clean.</li>
            <li> I wish, however, that I got a clean shave without having to use a second razor.</li>
            <li> please let me know (particularly shaving below side burns and creating a straight side-burn end).  </li>
            <li> please let me know (particularly shaving below side burns and creating a straight side-burn end).  </li>
            <li> Very low maintenance - just clean.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean and nice to know how much battery life is left before the motor fails part way through a shave.</li>
            <li> It gives a very close wet shave and a dry shave is good with a couple of passes.</li>
            <li> I shave dry and my first shave was quick and close and left my face smooth.  </li>
            <li> As far as the shaver itself, it&#x27;s a very good shaver, good quality, although the trimmer on the back of the unit is worthless.  </li>
            <li> The device does heat up when using it dry, and it is not the smoothest run over the skin, but because it is a wet/dry shaver, I recommend using it with a little shaving cream and rinsing, works great.</li>
            <li> It quickly cuts through my beard and leaves my face smooth and with relatively little burn.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely agree with most of the positive reviews, but want to make a few remarks.    </li>
            <li> The Panasonic model had several more positive reviews than the Braun in the same price range.</li>
            <li> The only con I see is the battery life; which does a good 9 shaves and will probably go down to about 6 after a year of usage.  </li>
            <li> Unlike most electric shavers that ask you to shave with theirs for a few weeks to get use to the shave(most likely so that you will forget how much better your old shaver was than theirs);from</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull the hair at all, and the high rpm on the blades is very reassuring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also bought the wahl shaver which I don&#x27;t use very much because that one is a lot noisier and pulls my 4-5 or 6 day old beard.</li>
            <li> i suppose it would be ok at trimming that, but it&#x27;s much more difficult to use for buzzing your whole face, and because it flips up instead of sliding up, you have to prop it up with your thumb to really use</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like the high whine of the Panasonic motor and much prefer the lower pitch of the Norelco when shaving.</li>
            <li> Maybe a brand new disposable on the first half of my face was better?</li>
            <li> For this kind of money, you should at least get a decent shave within a reasonable amount of time!</li>
            <li> A lot closer a shave than any women&#x27;s shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned, has a higher RPM, easy cleaning and fast charging (less than an hour).</li>
            <li> Companys with a reputation for quality need to keep quality and the end user experience as their number one priority to survive in the new world of global cheap products, customers want quality; and if we know that is what we will get we will pay for it</li>
            <li> Bottom line is that I just put a new blade set in the Norelco Arcitec and will probably go back to that as my primary shaver.</li>
            <li> It was fragile, noisy, does not shave well and require special care.</li>
            <li> , I tried unlocking the pivot head and shaving, shaving right after hot shower, razor fully charged, different angles to shave the hair, etc.</li>
            <li> A little loud but overall great value for the cost.</li>
            <li> Just making sure to use a light touch and a little extra time.</li>
            <li> I have only had this for a little over 2 weeks, but so far it is a great shaver.  </li>
            <li> My 10 year old Norelco did a better job while dry.</li>
            <li> I have used it wet and dry and get a good shave either way.  </li>
            <li> So I do need to shave more often but it gets a much closer shave than my previous electric.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Edit- Razor had a decent long life (&gt;2 yrs) and took replacement blades just fine, but it stopped working one day.</li>
            <li> It recharges so quickly and really goes deep with no irritation..</li>
            <li> Works good wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for nearly 2 years, and after recently replacing the blade and foil it is still going strong.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get to the upper lip near the nose easily because of the bulky head.</li>
            <li> I also have a mild case of psoriasis, with patches of affected skin near my sideburns and on both sides of my neck near my larynx.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth cutting and gliding across each contour of my face, with no pulls to my skin, makes shaving pleasant and not a chore.</li>
            <li> Performance good wet or dry shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal Panasonic shaver user for about 25 years but am really dissappointed to watch the quaity degrade in the recent models.</li>
            <li> It gives me a very close shave, it charges in less than an hour, and the charge lasts more than a week.  </li>
            <li> This machine isn&#x27;t particularly cooperative when it comes to styling your facial hair, but I prefer to be clean shaven anyways, so it&#x27;s not a problem for me)&lt;br /&gt;Overall:</li>
            <li> Although the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; shave feature is a nice novelty, neither it, nor the standard dry shave experience</li>
            <li> My old Panasonic shaver was still going strong after almost ten years of use but decided to purchase this upgraded version and boy</li>
            <li> In fact, this shaver is superior to my recently purchased Braun, and is almost half the price.  </li>
            <li> half off I definitely recommend this product as it should work much better than other conventional shaving methods but do not expect a 100% perfect shave after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was excited that I was finally going to allow myself to spend more than the $49.99 I paid for my previous shaver,</li>
            <li> It delivers a very smooth shave and it does it in less time than the Norelco I used for years.  </li>
            <li> I tried getting by with cheap shavers for a long time but they kept yanking out hairs and not giving me a close shave.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it in the shower but it works fine when shaving dry.</li>
            <li> It puts out a sound that seems to be of a higher pitch but not louder than other shavers I have had, and is not annoying.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Great battery life; been using it a few months and only had to recharge once so far.</li>
            <li> And by far, after the first time I used this razor (</li>
            <li> /&gt; The second shave two days later went much faster and the shave was indeed much better and smoother.</li>
            <li> One full charge will last me about a week of every day shaving.</li>
            <li> I saw this shaver on a steep discount and I decided to try electric for a first time in my life (35yrs old).    </li>
            <li> and I did notice that the first time, but I&#x27;m not that sensitive and haven&#x27;t noticed it since.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin prone to razor rash, irritation and burn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only getting 4-5 shaves out of full charge.</li>
            <li> I soaked the head of the shaver in mouthwash, which helped a lot for about two weeks, but then the odor was back, full force.</li>
            <li> At first they had fixed shaving heads and since Li batteries hadn&#x27;t been invented yet, NiCd batteries instead.</li>
            <li> My past ES8065 and ES8092 had nice velvet bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin &amp; this has basically accompished exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was that the ES8103S took longer to shave with than my 5 year old Panasonic Linear shaver ever did.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor and I was pleasantly surprised at how close a shave this razor can provide.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the more expensive versions of Panasonic shavers do, but this model is plenty good enough in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> The first experience was WOW.</li>
            <li> Thus, I only get 6-8 shaves out of a full charge.    </li>
            <li> You normally see this as traces of rust but stainless won&#x27;t show you this and</li>
            <li> Only get about 6 - 8 shaves out of a full charge since the batteries are aging</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Brauns and Remingtons in the past - and liked them -</li>
            <li> I used enough force to burn my skin but did not get a shave even as good as my pretty ordinary shaver gives me.</li>
            <li> A full recharge with 10% left takes about 1 hour.</li>
            <li> One time full charge can last for a while.</li>
            <li> But definitely not worth more than $39.95</li>
            <li> ONLY TWO FULL BLADES.</li>
            <li> I figured that with the cost of maintenance for these shavors, its not worth it to get the most updated version.  </li>
            <li> aware that this shaver is loud.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually kind of surprised that it just suddenly stopped charging yesterday out of the blue.</li>
            <li> It did however get pretty darn close to the skin which I was surprised with.</li>
            <li> This razor is stellar as I get close shaves without hurting my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The razor is pretty far from anything I&#x27;d recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The noise this thing makes is pretty loud.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see more blade cutters like on the more expensive model helping much.</li>
            <li> It actually keeps full power until discharged AND</li>
            <li> My first ever electric shaver (I&#x27;ve been shaving for nearly 30 years with a manual razor up to now)</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s a bit loud.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried elec razors thru the years ( 60 yrs old ) and this the first that shaves well.</li>
            <li> But maybe it&#x27;s just never possible to get a full shave without lathering up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Braun electric shavers that were three times this price that didn&#x27;t do as good a job, which is why I didn&#x27;t replace my last one for several years and used a regular razor with disposable blades.  </li>
            <li> My skin is pretty sensitive</li>
            <li> /&gt;In reality, you won&#x27;t get a very close/stubble-free shave, and you will need multiple passes over the difficult areas, but as an electric shaver it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Gives me a nice, close shave without all of the irritation that I usually get from going &amp;#34;against the grain&amp;#34; with a manual razor.</li>
            <li> It is pretty dam loud.</li>
            <li> Now, it has some downsides, first of all it&#x27;s LOUD AS HELL compared to the Norelco.</li>
            <li> So I end up using a disposable blade if i actually want a good shave, kind of disappointing.</li>
            <li> and it not bad enough to bother.  </li>
            <li> Long hairs were a problem with other razors but this one does a good job with them.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s first tune up with new foil and blades, the display still operates like new and now the shaver does</li>
            <li> He has very sensitive skin and is very particular about the closeness of his shave.  </li>
            <li> It shaves better than Norellco and most of all I can clean the shaver with regular liqid soap and water(no need expensive cleaning solution).  </li>
            <li> Now granted this was my first experience with an electric shaver (I use the old school straight razor), but I thought it took a long time to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> It shaves fast, clean, and holds a charge much longer than my old Braun, plus it only takes about an hour to fully charge.  </li>
            <li> Charges quickly, and I love that I can see how much charge is left so it doesn&#x27;t die on me half way through shaving.</li>
            <li> Probably an easy fix, but it gave me an excuse to buy a new razor.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic is amazing and although it&#x27;s a foil razor, it performs just fine on my neck where the foils of yesteryear failed.</li>
            <li> This is a current model of my old razor  and is working fine.</li>
            <li> Better than the Braun hands down.....</li>
            <li> I just love going to work, looking down at my shirt and seeing clipping dust from shaving that morning.</li>
            <li> I need a better way to shave because I couldn&#x27;t look up, down or twist my head while shaving.</li>
            <li> Just need to make sure you don&#x27;t run the charge way down and forget to charge it.</li>
            <li> It seem to make the hairs lie down, and made it more of a pain to get them.</li>
            <li> Technique is critical, and it will take time to figure out the best way to use it on different parts of your face.&lt;br /&gt;The battery charges quickly and usually gives me 3 to 4 long shaves before recharging.  </li>
            <li> those who have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use razors, I highly recommend this machine, or the ES-LA63-S (for those with a slightly higher budget).&lt;br /&gt;The zero-irritation factor is something that I just can&#x27;t speak highly enough of.&lt;br /&gt;Add convenience into the mix and that makes this machine a true godsend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean that I had a few bumps, primarily by the throat area, but on my cheeks &amp; chin the shave was great.</li>
            <li> The only way I could ever get the skin to feel smooth to the touch required many passes pushing pretty hard.  </li>
            <li> This one seems to clean just fine with minimal time and effort (and no extra expense).</li>
            <li> only downside is that it discharges relatively quickly, but fortunately it doesn&#x27;t take long to charge up, either.</li>
            <li> I have not reviewed many electric shavers, and my old faithful Remington Rotary 460D titanium sounds tame and calm by comparison</li>
            <li> I was really hoping that this shaver would perform a little better.</li>
            <li> I find that it takes a little more time to shave in the shower than the Fusion blade number, but it is much safer.  </li>
            <li> I only bought this new one because of the sale price, and I figure the batteries in the original may be getting close to the end.</li>
            <li> I received my replacement shaver today and to my surprise Panasonic sent a brand new ES8243A!</li>
            <li> I hope the new one serves me well for years to come!</li>
            <li> It was easier and cheaper to just be a brand new one!</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m in the market again for a new shaver (not quite 3 years after buying this one!)</li>
            <li> Save the money and buy NEW!</li>
            <li> It looks almost like new; I HAVE NOT CHANGED THE FOIL OR THE BLADE IN THAT TIME!</li>
            <li> you have a tough beard and sensitive skin, you might not be 100% happy.</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard and shaver gets reasonably close (not as good as a blade) to give the appearance of close shave.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product, it may cost a bit more than your average shaver</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty loud as far as electric razors go, but doesn&#x27;t really bother me too much.  </li>
            <li> It just seems like with the flat blade it is easier to get your whole face quickly.</li>
            <li> website says to call an 800 number, and the 800 number says to use the website.&lt;br /&gt;If a little less than two years is good enough for you the shaver is ok.</li>
            <li> First up was the regular razor, which was the generic twin blade kind I get at \\&quot;Pay Cheap.\\&quot; Shaving in dry mode seemed really not the most efficient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only ever used Panasonic wet/dry shavers, so I have no other manufacturer to compare to, but I find these razors to be a perfect blend of the closeness gained from traditional wet shaving with the general lack of skin irritation associated with electrics.</li>
            <li> The Braun did better in tight concave areas and the Panasonic better in tight convex areas.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recall this being as much of an issue when the shaver was new.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recall this being as much of an issue when the shaver was new.  </li>
            <li> It takes two to three weeks of use to become accustomed to the new shaver which may reduce the number of passes required to get a really close shave.</li>
            <li> but I was ready for something new.</li>
            <li> I am new to modern wet/dry shavers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hubby loves this razor so much I&#x27;m buying him a new one for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Upon receiving the new ES8103S, I immediately noticed how much closer each shave was in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I assume though that this will cost one about as much as just buying a brand new shaver.  </li>
            <li> It was time for me to replace the blade on this ES8103S anyway, and since I really don&#x27;t care for it, I decided to just put that money towards a new shaver</li>
            <li> For that price I may as well buy a whole new one.  </li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t care, you buy something brand new</li>
            <li> if you are on a budget the norelco is a good shaver for the money it will do the job, but a little slower , i highly recommend es8103s especially if you get it on sale, around christmas k mart wanted 99$ for it, but i found one at target on clearance for 60$.</li>
            <li> I have used my Norelco rotary with 3-year-old blades to clean up stubble left over from a shave with the brand new Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely amazed at how comfortable a wet shave (with lather) is.  </li>
            <li> these are way better than those that are like $30 or less.</li>
            <li> If it can have less noise, that will be even better.  </li>
            <li> He thinks it works better than Norelco which was the shaver he had previous to this before it broke on him.  </li>
            <li> Sure, there are features that some people might like to have modified this way or that, but that is no reason to give less stars.  </li>
            <li> I previously had a Panasonic that lasted many years.</li>
            <li> Much more than my previous shavers had.</li>
            <li> Much more than my previous shavers had.</li>
            <li> Still its better than the Braun and Norelco shavers I had previously.</li>
            <li> I have primarily used it in the dry mode and a couple of times after wetting my face with tap water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great razor to use when you don&#x27;t want to take a chance at cutting yourself with a blade, or when you just want a quick dry shave to clean up before going out, without the hassle of shaving cream, etc.</li>
            <li> I find it&#x27;s easier to clean when i use it dry, and only need to apply soap and clean under running water about once/week.</li>
            <li> smooth dry shave  </li>
            <li> It shaves as close as a blade, and can be used when the hair on your face is longer than most shavers; i.e., two days growth was the maximum length of my previous shaver.  </li>
            <li> More than half off list.</li>
            <li> I tried more than fourty minutes but also could not shave half of my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also 2 settings for the head to allow more or less pivot.  </li>
            <li> But this shaver does the job in half as many attempts and with almost no irritation whatsoever.</li>
            <li> previously owned electric shavers from Remington, Norelco and Braun, all of them but the Remington cost more than this Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> although I did not like to use it under the shower (it is not as smooth as when your face is dry).</li>
            <li> I replaced my previous Panasonic shaver (ES8103), since I had dropped it in the bathroom one too many times.</li>
            <li> Much better than his previous three head razor.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in September 2010, after being highly satisfied with previous Panasonic shavers.</li>
            <li> It took my half an hour to shave with (more time than disposal</li>
            <li> Seems they&#x27;re just lightening and cheapening them up and charging more for less these days.</li>
            <li> However, it generates much more noise than the previous one I had.</li>
            <li> Top of the line Remington foil and Norelco rotary razors relegated to the linen closet after abysmal performances from previous years.</li>
            <li> This one cuts better and with less discomfort.  </li>
            <li> My previous razor was the panasonic 4 blade and this product is even better.</li>
            <li> I can easily say that it beats any shaver, including a wet blade razor.  </li>
            <li> gives you easy cleaning or the ability of a wet shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though with the very quick charge time, it&#x27;s not much to complain about.</li>
            <li> If you enjoy a dry shave, it helps a lot.  </li>
            <li> My husband chose this razor for several of the features, the quick recharge time,the built-in trimmer and that it is dual voltage.</li>
            <li> Often this quickly exceeds the cost of the actual shaver.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace an older Norelco</li>
            <li> Hope this would replace my older 4 blade panasonic</li>
            <li> This does the job but not as quickly or as easily as my older razor.</li>
            <li> I need a shaver that I can use while plugged in, and don&#x27;t want a shaver that if the battery is low I need to charge it quickly and wait around while it does so.</li>
            <li> - These comments are from my initial shave, I&#x27;ll try to remember to update later when I&#x27;ve had more experience.  </li>
            <li> Bought razor to replace an older Remington.  </li>
            <li> So I decided to give this a try, mainly because of the wet-dry feature.  </li>
            <li> I SHOULD have purchased another Panasonic, but I needed a replacement quickly and could not find anything locally.</li>
            <li> Overall, I give the edge to Panasonic for a better overall shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After more research and the reading of umpteen reviews on several different shaver brands, I decided to give Panasonic another chance and ordered the model ES8103.</li>
            <li> Main cons :</li>
            <li> There are a lot of in-depth reviews already, so I&#x27;ll make mine short and quick.  </li>
            <li> When I use the Shave Soap, the motor and blades create enough aggitation that it will actually foam the soap, making the shave even more</li>
            <li> The main part of the shaver head doesn&#x27;t shave, but the trimmer does.</li>
            <li> No electric will provide the closeness of a blade, so in that sense be realistic when you buy one of these.  </li>
            <li> I am using Remington classic to cut the rest of the hair with backside motion.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent, if not the closest shave.  </li>
            <li> this will be big issue in a year or so when the battery can&#x27;t hold the charge, I used my last razor for more than 2 year after battery stop holding charge by just connecting to plug and use it.</li>
            <li> but I keep buying this particular one because i like how it shaves.</li>
            <li> I switched from an older remington model.  </li>
            <li> and I needed to replace my older version as it no longer held a charge and the model itself was phased out.</li>
            <li> and then whip out my regular Gillette razor and just quickly hit the problem areas rather than spend 10</li>
            <li> It provides a decent shave but</li>
            <li> /&gt;- my hair is not \\&quot;kinky\\&quot; but more like in between mixed and coarse</li>
            <li> My older [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Also, there is no carrying case furnished, but I have an adequate one from a former razor.  </li>
            <li> Gives a reasonably close shave, especially when fresh from the box.</li>
            <li> battery doesn&#x27;t last all that many days, especially compared to my Braun shaver.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent shaver.  </li>
            <li> The razor charges quickly and the charges seem to last for 7-8 uses.</li>
            <li> main thing it saves you a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Had considered the more expensive Panasonic models, but I&#x27;m perfectly satisfied with this one.    </li>
            <li> I have tried many brands cheaper &amp; more expensive than the Panasonic ES8103S</li>
            <li> Like that it provides decent shave for ~90% of the face.</li>
            <li> but since Amazon only gives a 30 day window, which, when counting the day of receipt and time required to charge and then adequately go through the trial period, you pass the return period.      </li>
            <li> /&gt;It replaced his older Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Particularly around the neck.</li>
            <li> Any whiskers older than two days are quite rebellious to the shaving attempts made by the Panasonic ES8103S.</li>
            <li> I have one from an older razor, but this should be a part of the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product as far as I can tell is only available on line.</li>
            <li> Tried all the brauns starting from the 1990&#x27;s models all the way to their most current 7 series shavers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes a decent amount of shaving for me to achieve that (10+ mins for me), but it&#x27;s convenient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an older guy</li>
            <li> Inevitably, I&#x27;ve found the electrics notably inferior to blades and have switched back.  </li>
            <li> it actually reduces the underlying day-to-day irritation that accompanies mild cases of psoriasis like mine.    </li>
            <li> This is a replacement for an older weaker razor.</li>
            <li> When turned on, ES8103S is louder than my another older model ES4026.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I thought it would, because the charger has a decent length of power cord connected to the shaver.</li>
            <li> Some older models have.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my prior six year old Panasonic shaver that I use primarily when I travel.  </li>
            <li> The LCD display on the older model stopped working</li>
            <li> They lasted a decent time.</li>
            <li> Finish of course with the main blades.</li>
            <li> Even if it were the same performance, that one is more value for money as it comes with an extra head.</li>
            <li> I can only use a bladed razor to shave my legs about twice a week, even when using the super lubricating venus spa blades.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had an &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; razor, like the older version coveted Brauns with which to compare to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a big deal for me, because it again it&#x27;s really quick, but I mention it in case any one else needs</li>
            <li> This one is almost identical to my older one which I used for about 5 years without replacing anything.</li>
            <li> Gives a decent shave, but rather noisy.</li>
            <li> After my older Panasonic razor didn&#x27;t cut it anymore (after almost 3 years).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already getting a decent shave.</li>
            <li> This does a decent job</li>
            <li> Wet shaves are another story, often catching the hair and needing multiple passes to get anything resembling a acceptable shave.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer works as expected and it&#x27;s a nice simple design.</li>
            <li> Only problem is musty smell from washing and replacing cap to quickly</li>
            <li> quickly you can shave if your beard is short (see below)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Replaced an older Panasonic foil shaver.</li>
            <li> Alright, so as a razor this works... decently well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Panasonic gives me a much closer shave than the old Braun was capable of</li>
            <li> He has quite a bit of growth for a teen and shaves once or twice a week, if we are lucky.</li>
            <li> A main decision factor was that you could use it wet/dry.</li>
            <li> IS MORE NOISE,AND 1150 SEEMS TO BE A MORE EXPENSIVE ONE</li>
            <li> I need to shave quickly if I want this battery to last me 5 shaves.</li>
            <li> The reviews mainly swayed my purchase.</li>
            <li> The particular Braun and Remington models I used could not be cleaned in water.</li>
            <li> Having owned and used both and many others, I&#x27;m starting to think the latter group has it right.(As an aside, this model has been replaced by the LT41-K, which is currently selling here on Amazon for only $6 more than the 8103S.</li>
            <li> I recommend this shaver for older men.</li>
            <li> then use my Philips Norelco Bodygroom Shaver to make the whiskers short enough for the Remington to cut or else it would just skate over the top of my beard about after 15 minutes of shaving and loads of razor</li>
            <li> Faster and closer than Norelco and an older Braun.</li>
            <li> I have had various Braun shavers for years (most recently a 5885 model).</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shave Quality is only adequate.</li>
            <li> So if your charge is low, you can give it a quick charge to 20% in about 5 mins.</li>
            <li> I am not using since 6 months classic blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BATTERY</li>
            <li> but it took an age to get a decent shave with this</li>
            <li> IT IS NOISY - yes, particularly when you do your cheeks/sideburns</li>
            <li> This razor replaced the older model #8103.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it was a decent razor.</li>
            <li> I have had to use the rear trimmer to get my neck almost every time, as the main blades miss 55% of that area      </li>
            <li> Once I felt comfortable and got to know the shaver, I developed enough confidence to use it.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried  to find an electric shaver that was at least as good as an old fashioned blade.  </li>
            <li> I guess the difference is mainly the nanotechnology.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my older Braun 5000 series razor and never got the closeness and comfort from the Braun that I am getting from the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be able to go back to regular shaving.</li>
            <li> Gives a good shave but have to do multiple passes over my trouble spots.  </li>
            <li> Super quiet and efficient - I can even talk to my wife while shaving.  </li>
            <li> This is a decent shaver.</li>
            <li> If one is looking for a decent shaver, I recommend this one.</li>
            <li> (though it still works decently).</li>
            <li> I got a Braun 380s-4 last christmas that did better but still required multiple passes.</li>
            <li> So about late February, I remembered my old electric razors and thought maybe a good foil razor would be the answer to my problems.</li>
            <li> I purchased this one because it was on sale (around $60) and it had decent reviews.</li>
            <li> BUT FOR A RETIREE ON A DAILY BASIS IT&#x27;S CERTAINLY ADEQUATE.</li>
            <li> and I cannot imagine one of the more expensive ones doing a better job.</li>
            <li> Came the next day for  minimal charge and my husband was thrilled.</li>
            <li> It does a decent job for an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> Bought it to replace an older Panasonic shave with a dying battery.</li>
            <li> It looks and feels like decent quality</li>
            <li> some reason, I began to break out on my face and the sides of my head (non-razor bumps, mainly acne).  </li>
            <li> husband has had a Panasonic for more than a decade +, and I have hunted for the same Brand and type with same I.D. Number to no avail.</li>
            <li> Far better than expected.  </li>
            <li> Overall satisfied with this shaver as I have only had it a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Loved the old razor, and had been able to buy replacement cutting heads to keep it fresh, but this year the battery finally stopped holding a charge.  </li>
            <li> The batter is still holding a solid charge (uses about 10% per shave, so I can easily get 8 days worth of shaving on a single charge).  </li>
            <li> The batter is still holding a solid charge (uses about 10% per shave, so I can easily get 8 days worth of shaving on a single charge).  </li>
            <li> It provides a very close shave and leaves the skin very soft.  </li>
            <li> long story short, i bought norelco 7310x for 35$, shaved good but felt underpowered and trimmer felt the same, i&#x27;d rate the shaver 4.4 stars, then i bought panasonic ES8103s very powerful motor and trimmer, it got 3 heads on the trimmer, i liked it especially the trimmer vs norelco,, plus you can use it wet or dry</li>
            <li> razor, charge lasts a long time, close shave, easy to clean, can get wet</li>
            <li> Amazon replaced the first unit (with free return shipping), and the second one had the same problem.</li>
            <li> Because it get to hot for my confort, I started shaving with the wet option but in order to get a close shave then you have to spend more time going back and forth to get a desirable shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electrics mostly for convenience of not having the mess of cream and also not getting cut.</li>
            <li> I recently went electric for the first time in 18 years and this is better than expected.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be weak in power and not cut good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Braun, Norelco, Remington, pretty much all the top ones and this razor cuts the closest and gives me the least irritation.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I didn&#x27;t care for it, it was still better than any other razor, but the dry shave is just superb.</li>
            <li> you DON&#x27;T rely on the long hair pop-up trimmer, it actually does do a pretty close, decent shave, leaving my skin smooth without much irritation.</li>
            <li> It really lubricates and keeps the blade cool and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out..</li>
            <li> I have owned these razor&#x27;s previously and i am very satisfied with the shave i receive daily  from this electric razor .</li>
            <li> It has a narrower head, so it is better and getting into tight places.  </li>
            <li> I get a clean, comfortable shave every time - and it doesn&#x27;t grow back with sharp ends like I get with a blade.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is easy to like, because it works as advertised, has the percentage remaining charge displayed, recharges in less than 1 hour and has the detail trimmer conveniently located on the back side, easily accessible.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>

            <li> I would buy another one of these high quality shavers.</li>
            <li> I do think the price is too high.</li>
            <li> This is kind of a big negative because that was the only reason I was able to use my Braun razor for over 12 years.  </li>

            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in the market for an electric razor I highly recommend this model.</li>
            <li> The high pitched whine it gives off is indicative of its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I can recommend this unit highly.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I tried several different styles and brands of shavers, but I kept coming back to old faithful, my beloved Remington MicroScreen 3.  </li>
            <li> I shave my head with this and can get 2 full face/head shaves off of a single charge and still have 10-20% charge remaining depending on how much growth I had.  </li>
            <li> Gives a very comfortable shave, though not nearly as close as a Braun shaver of older but similar design.  </li>
            <li> The little pop-up blade on the back is ideal for small areas and a quick touch-up of the neck area between haircuts.</li>
            <li> He had another one which was fairly new which gave a poor shave, so I paid for fast shipping to get this one which had good reviews.   </li>
            <li> But now that ive used several times and the new factor has worn off, it doesn&#x27;t do as well as I thought, but they work, I use them almost till the battery is dead tho each use, so that isn&#x27;t to good</li>
            <li> I had tried Norelco and Braun and it would take a long time to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> Instructions not clear on how to \\&quot;wash\\&quot; under water, so I just brush clean.</li>
            <li> Now it works great equally well wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Works well,easy to clean and holds charge a long time.</li>
            <li> Versatile use dry or wet and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> So far, I am pleased with the performance of this shaver and, based upon my experience with other Panasonic models, I am not concerned at all about the light-weight construction.</li>
            <li> These are especially on my upper lip, and perhaps are laying more flat?</li>
            <li> My first one, and I&#x27;m near 75 years old!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it with shaving cream, only dry, but I&#x27;ve been very happy and have used it for at least two years now.</li>
            <li> but the wet option was fine.  </li>
            <li> The build quality is reasonable, and it shaves well enough, though requires more &#x27;passes&#x27; in these early weeks to give a clean shave than my, admittedly, far more expensive Braun.</li>
            <li> FAR BETTER THAN OTHER BRANDS</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver to replace a 5 year old, top of the line, other manufacturer&#x27;s shaver.</li>
            <li> However, rather than get new blades for it (which is all it really needed), I got a new razor.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive hearing, and I can say for certain that the ES8103S is not damaging my hearing.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> This new shaver is identical in design, but works much better and is slightly quieter.</li>
            <li> The price that I paid was a little better than WallyWorld.  </li>
            <li> It shaves a little closer, feels better in my hand, and moves easier over my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a top-of-the-line $300 shaver, so I understand if it&#x27;s got some flaws, but I was expecting a little more.</li>
            <li> The trimmer could be a little better</li>
            <li> I always spray a little cologne before I leave to the office and there is no awful burn after shaving with this panasonic.</li>
            <li> each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second use, a little better.</li>
            <li> I decided to spend a little more on a razor than the cheapest option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shave takes a little longer than the higher-end unit, but that&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> like not having to get my face lathered up and then shave with my razors for a quicker shave, but I would expect it work a little better with my neck and under-jawline</li>
            <li> All I can say is wow!!</li>
            <li> trimmer could be a little better.</li>
            <li> Took a little time to get used to this razor as I was using a rotery for many years.</li>
            <li> Little lamps would be more reliable than a LCD display, now i wait for it to die before plugging it in.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m 89 yrs old!!  </li>
            <li> I mean Heck-- for that price I&#x27;d probably just be better off buying a new one with fresh blades!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, daily use of this electric razor keeps me looking clean and my face clear.</li>
            <li> (With my old rotary blade razors I would get a clean shave with only one or two passes.)  </li>
            <li> to clean it, I merely remove the head &amp; hold it under running warm tapwater for 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li> First of all, I can only compare the Panasonic ES8103S to the crappy Walmart Remingtons I kept buying out of pure laziness.  </li>
            <li> I already have had one of these for several months, and I enjoy its ability to provide close shaves of three-day growths as easily as one-day growths of my moderately stiff beard.  </li>
            <li> It is only adequate and very loud.  </li>
            <li> It cuts closer than any other shaver that I have ever used, fits the hand well, and cleans easily.  </li>
            <li> The option to use Panasonics wet with shaving cream provides remarkably close shaves with little irritation.</li>
            <li> Shipped very quick due to being a prime member.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic also has the incredible ability to miss single hairs and leave very uneven, patchy shaves that I can&#x27;t really fix because the hairs are too short.  </li>
            <li> I can use it to take down some stubble, but still need straight edge for that super date!</li>
            <li> I have purchased replacement batteries on Amazon and replaced them myself, but these cheap China replacement batteries don&#x27;t last very long and are easily dislodged with regular use.    </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a little lazy, busy and smart like me :), I strongly recommend this product !</li>
            <li> My Norelco of many years was getting pretty dull</li>
            <li> (it has this neat little sideburn groomer feature that can also be used to prep/remove those longer personal hair areas before shaving and manicure/shape the outline if you prefer to retain a modesty patch, -- and on the QT, it can even gently remove hair from a lady&#x27;s upper lip) :P ...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s better in any other way, but this is all the difference I need!!</li>
            <li> This one does I really cant hardly believe it I am quite surprised and thrilled too&lt;</li>
            <li> I am aware the new razor has new foil and blade but my old razor with new foil and blades never got this close.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the end I simply returned this product and chose to go with the single bladed disposable razors and so far those have been the best for my sensitive skin and have eliminated nearly all my previous problems with razor bumps and acne.</li>
            <li> Even after buying all the new blades and foils for my remington MS2 300, it still didn&#x27;t give me a decent shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my es8243a has a decent number of years on it, and this shaver cost about as much as a new block &amp; cutters for the es8243a.</li>
            <li> However, I will say that my last shaver - an 9 month-old Braun that cost me $30 more than this Panasonic model - felt more solid, but literally fell apart in my hands after very little, light-duty use.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this shaver gives a very close shave without irritation.  </li>
            <li> It shaves much closer than his old one.</li>
            <li> Says it fits contours of face better than old more expensive razor.  </li>
            <li> It does cut much closer than my old panasonic.</li>
            <li> This razor is much lighter in my hand than my old one.  </li>
            <li> This gives it a much cheaper, flimsier feel than the old razor.  </li>
            <li> $80 is far too much to pay for this product.</li>
            <li> His old one was made in Japan and the material was real metal.</li>
            <li> After shaving a clean dry face there is no need to even activate the cleaning mode.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why a consumer protection agency has not forced a recall or issued a warning.  </li>
            <li> A much smoother shaver compared to my old</li>
            <li> not so much the pivot action even though this model has an intricate pivot mechanism.</li>
            <li> I have had Remington shavers my whole adult life.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this has been doing very well for me.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and remembered years ago really liking a Panasonic travel shaver I had.  </li>
            <li> great ES8065, mediocre ES8092 and problem-plagued ES8243A were made in Japan.</li>
            <li> My old Norelco was ready for replacement when it would not hold a rull recharge.</li>
            <li> Wow, it really does replace my blade and saves alot of time.</li>
            <li> My old electric shaver would not shave the neck no matter how much I asked it to.</li>
            <li> and it was much quieter than my old Braun.  </li>
            <li> It performs much like my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> Early models caused irritation and never gave me a really close shave.  </li>
            <li> Which he has sensitive skin with no breakouts thanks to this</li>
            <li> I am happy with it, it is not perfect, but does the job.  </li>
            <li> This ES8103S is much sleeker and lighter than the old model.  </li>
            <li> I find the ES8103s makes fast, nearly effortless work of my beard.  </li>
            <li> I primary used wet with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> And no messy sink from a straight razor.</li>
            <li> It gave me a clean shave usint the Dry application.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a week for wet shaving, using shaving cream and already find that it delivers as comfortable and close a shave as I have ever had from a blade.  </li>
            <li> Battery could have lasted a bit longer as it seems to run out of charge much quicker than my old Panasonic charger of 3.5 yrs</li>
            <li> My old blade  &amp;#34;Braun&amp;#34; was much  noiser.</li>
            <li> It is much easier to use and shaves a lot closer than his old Norelco.  </li>
            <li> The sideburn trimmer works really well compared to my old unit.  </li>
            <li> and he really likes it so far</li>
            <li> I clean it by rinsing off in the faucet, shaking the water and leaving it on the counter to dry.  </li>
            <li> The transition from a straight razor was seamless.  </li>
            <li> It shaves much faster and closer than any of my old shavers and doesn&#x27;t chew up my face like the Braun shavers.  </li>
            <li> I am happy with the overall product and future upkeep cost providing it lasts me a few years.</li>
            <li> If you want more, Panasonic offers a 30 day guarantee and you can try one of their more expensive self cleaning units.  </li>
            <li> Although, it doesn&#x27;t work that smooth on a wet face.  </li>
            <li> So far it works really well.</li>
            <li> Like the higher \\&quot;rpm\\&quot; and the general feel and ease of use and cleaning.</li>
            <li> Dry is a plus for clean up by</li>
            <li> The foil casing is quite smooth and when it is wet it can be a tad slippery.  </li>
            <li> The extra 20 bucks will be worth it.</li>
            <li> be buying a few more as Christmas presents for my family.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this shaver for a few months.  </li>
            <li> At first, because of how quiet the Panasonic was, I was debating if it was really even working - since I was used to the buzz saw Remington.  </li>
            <li> On 1 full charge, I get about 7 shaves, and it only takes 1 hour to completely charge.    </li>
            <li> 8168 wet/dry shaver finally gave out after 6+ years of pretty intense use -</li>
            <li> As far as the shaving, I can&#x27;t say I really see much of an improvement over my 7 year old razor.  </li>
            <li> This item shaves no better than either of the two low-end shavers I currently own, one of which is an old, crappy Remington with a Nickel Cadmium battery.</li>
            <li> Many of you may think, \\&quot;Why should I go to the trouble of using lather when I bought an electric shaver?\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Have to do a few more over the neck area</li>
            <li> Not only is the maintenance effortless it gives a fantastic shave with no drag.</li>
            <li> After using various Phillips/Norelco rotary shavers for most of my adult life, I finally got tired of replacing a perfectly good shaver because the battery died.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not top of the line, but it&#x27;s good enough to where I&#x27;ve bought two of these -</li>
            <li> For the most part you just won&#x27;t do it everyday because of that.</li>
            <li> I am coming up on 5 months with mine and needed a replacement blade set for it which I feel is resonable considering that I shave about 5 times the area as a normal shave of your face might have.</li>
            <li> I normally shave with a blade and still prefer that method.  </li>
            <li> , however, it is only so useful in the sense that it displays in 20% increments.</li>
            <li> No feeling of hypersensitivity after shaving, no irritation and most importantly, no nicks and cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this razor use it everyday.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s third or fourth shaver, and by far his favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve normally used basic razors and $40 electric shavers, but this is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> As I continued to use this razor I found that the electric razor irritated my skin more than my 3 blade razors ever had and my acne only got worse rather than better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had Norelcos and felt it was normal to use a Gillette every couple of days to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li> I think its useful for some people, but definitely not for everyone.</li>
            <li> The one draw back to the Panasonic vs. the Braun is the Braun has a better long hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Personally I wasn&#x27;t too concerned with the trimmer and rarely use it</li>
            <li> As an old man, I have probably used almost every brand of electric shavers, and Panasonic is head and shoulders above the others in terms of true value.  </li>
            <li> Although I didn&#x27;t notice it while shaving, it appears the shaver has the ability to shave a few microns off the top layer of \\&quot;bumpy skin.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I can get about a weeks worth of daily</li>
            <li> The Lock/Soft switch produces a noticeable effect on comfort &amp; performance - useful for different areas.</li>
            <li> I buy them for father,i  think it is ok for use everyday .hope</li>
            <li> This does not look normal.</li>
            <li> Former blade user with rare exceptions.</li>
            <li> I guess it might work better if I shaved everyday.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working better everyday</li>
            <li> It is more comfortable, but it also take 3 times as long to shave my face than it has in the past.</li>
            <li> Husband has not complained.</li>
            <li> (I use this one locked) and exotic cleaning systems are a waste of time and money for me.  </li>
            <li> Most rechargeables require a long initial charge to ensure the battery will work well.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> *( Just keep in mind that all shavers are meant to be discarded over time and replacement parts are normally priced extravagantly no matter what shaver you get, so don&#x27;t pass this shaver by just because of the cord issue, this is an industry reality)</li>
            <li> If you have just a few hair-you might be satisfied.</li>
            <li> When you skin dries under normal air humidity</li>
            <li> The unit doesn&#x27;t vibrate much at all, and is pretty quiet, though I would still say it&#x27;s going to wake up the spouse if used in a nearby bathroom.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally post reviews, but had to comment on this one...</li>
            <li> This baby lasts me about 10 shaves per charge and provides a close enough shave to be useful.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it,  but give it an honest try for at least 30 days.</li>
            <li> They warn you it&#x27;ll take 30 days for your face to get used to the switch, and maybe that&#x27;s true for a lot of people, but I don&#x27;t think it took that long for me.  </li>
            <li> (but no more than most others)&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t give as close a shave as real razor (but no electric shaver does)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since gone back to my old Norelco (battery charge lasts a full month).</li>
            <li> The cost for a 12 pack was about the same for this, so I figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a more heavy duty product.</li>
            <li> If you let the beard grow any longer than that, this shaver will start missing hairs and require more passes.</li>
            <li> but it just isn&#x27;t as good as they&#x27;ve been in the past for the same money.</li>
            <li> so normally just charge it on the weekend.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for a few months now and my neck has never looked better.  </li>
            <li> In terms of battery life, I get about a week&#x27;s worth of shaves out of it before it dies, invariably in the middle of shaving on Monday morning.</li>
            <li> Very quite, very close shave, long lasting battery life and the shaver is extremely light weight.</li>
            <li> but I was careful to nearly discharge it every time and occasionally fully discharge it as suggested for this kind of battery.</li>
            <li> I really love this shaver but after just a few months it&#x27;s not working well.  </li>
            <li> Normally about a week on a charge for my 4-5 minute shaves.</li>
            <li> exactly how much battery life is left.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have much success, and I vastly preferred a razor blade.</li>
            <li> the 3-Arc is waay smaller than the (albeit more powerful) 4 and 5-arc series which makes it literally much easier to handle for women&#x27;s body or/and facial hair issues, or those men with lighter facial and body hair issues in general.</li>
            <li> I still use my first (nearly 20 years old) as a travel shaver, now retiring it</li>
            <li> A few more things about the razor:&lt;br /&gt;-After</li>
            <li> I use this shaver everyday and love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But all in all it does a good job not great.</li>
            <li> The razor has good power behind it.</li>
            <li> Good not great.</li>
            <li> Little did I know that this new Panasonic was far superior in how it cuts for a truly razor close shave with total comfort.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overwhelming like the Panasonic four head blade shaver, essentially this is a trimmed down version of the best shaver Panasonic sells.  </li>
            <li> I had considered buying a new Braun (I&#x27;d owned two already), but I was a bit put off by the cost of the cleaning and lubricating cartridges for the high end models (</li>
            <li> But I would highly recommend this to anyone considering buying a new wet/dry rechargeable razor.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a new electric razor, I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> So hot that I have to let it cool down, to  avoid burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It charges very fast, typically an hour from 10% to 100% full, and</li>
            <li> I came here to order a new assembly, then saw that I could buy a completely new shaver for the cost of 1.5 new foil assemblies!</li>
            <li> My Remington was very loud, and the Panasonic has a much lower noise level; The Panasonic has a high pitched buzz to it, but it&#x27;s still about 1/2 as loud as the Remington, and took some getting used to.    </li>
            <li> This is somewhat less convenient, but the razor works very well, did not require a charge during a full week long trip, and is comfortable both in hand and on the face.</li>
            <li> Obviously, the charge lasts long as do most new razors.  </li>
            <li> If they designed it as a shelf while charging, that was pretty smart but because it&#x27;s flat and the body of the razor is curved</li>
            <li> If they designed it as a shelf while charging, that was pretty smart but because it&#x27;s flat and the body of the razor is curved</li>
            <li> The Panasonic 13,000 RPM motor cuts right through with no grabbing or tugging, whereas my last Braun would freeze up because it wasn&#x27;t powerful enough.  </li>
            <li> I have used Panasonic wet and dry shavers ever since I first saw one in a hardware store maybe forty or more years ago.</li>
            <li> I have a criticism, it&#x27;s that there is no hard case with it.</li>
            <li> Seriously, saving time can offset so many things!</li>
            <li> I would get 60% or better charge after a long shave in the beginning, but soon this dropped to about 40% or even 20% after a single shave following a full recharge.</li>
            <li> I have  occasionally use a manual razor to either give myself a fresh shave or a touch-up from that provided by my new</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed Braun shavers for a very long time and thought this one would be no different.</li>
            <li> I advised it for the old lady because her hands shake too much to shave herself and none of us, her caretakers, are confident enough using a razor on the rather loose and wrinkly skin on her</li>
            <li> Fast and smooth shaves in half the time are the norm.  </li>
            <li> Most of us are only going to use an electric shaver dry.</li>
            <li> While less that thrilled with that nugget, only time will tell whether that affects its longevity.</li>
            <li> so I will most likely stick to the dry shave.</li>
            <li> convenience of the option to use this shaver wet or dry is nice when I want to shave in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a nice feature because i&#x27;ve been caught before with a razor out of energy and only half way done with my shave.   </li>
            <li> Today I used my old Norelco and I got a better shave in half the time.</li>
            <li> I previously had a Norelco that worked fairly well, but never really gave me a close shave</li>
            <li> If I use the razor with a freshly whipped lather, the shave is very close; when I use it dry, with the assist of a pre-shave powder (Remington SP-5 Pre-Shave Talc</li>
            <li> I thought an electric would be nice for a quick shave, but boy was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> My last one lasted for over 5 years and was going strong, I simply wanted the &amp;#34;latest and greatest&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is a good shaver, but like many other reviewers have noted, the shaver&#x27;s display failed after about 8 months.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 32 yrs old) due to my inability to use any kind of razor without incurring massive skin repercussions.  </li>
            <li> The ES81035 shaves quietly, quickly, and closely, and stays sharp much longer than the older Panasonic razors I have had.  </li>
            <li> Success varied with these different approaches with the double edged razor giving me pretty decent results.</li>
            <li> With the foil removed, the blade vibrates at a faster speed than normal to facilitate easy cleaning; switching it on under warm running water immediately clears any debris from the blades, and any surrounding mess has a hard time adhering to the plastic beneath.  </li>
            <li> But when I tried the new Panasonic on one side of my face after shaving as normal, I could tell the difference - the electric got what the blade missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s both have MicroScreen 3&#x27;s yet, but one of them recently suffered a fatal fall, so we decided to buy 2 more of these Panasonic&#x27;s to centralize on a single shaver blade to have to buy.    </li>
            <li> It was definitely the right choice to get the ES8103S.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cleaned the unit multiple times according to the instructions, and even right after cleaning the shavings still fall out.  </li>
            <li> Assuming that&#x27;s right, you won&#x27;t need 2 sets of replacement inner blades.    </li>
            <li> Given the time it takes, one is better of using a plain razor and shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> I think you just need to experiment in different directions until you get the right one for each section of your face.</li>
            <li> It was definitely the right choice to get the ES8103S.</li>
            <li> I was amazed.&lt;br /&gt;For under $ 100, but to me that worn-customs iparcell came in the mail from abroad, says five-tana have a right to purchase following our progress with tc etc etc etc with no identity ....&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using blades for years, and while this shaver does leave a few hairs uncut from time to time, it is smooth, effective, has a long lasting battery, and is really easy to clean!</li>
            <li> I had the old model for many years but to replace the blade it costs about half of buying a new one</li>
            <li> First with the Panasonic electric shaver , formerly Philips products are used after shaving think this product is very fast, the only drawback is shaking too much.</li>
            <li> This shaver enables me to trim my mustache close, smooth &amp; quick which wasn&#x27;t possible with my previous Norelco.</li>
            <li> have gained a closer shave, the ability to know how much battery charge is left (via an LCD readout) and a prompt to clean the razor when necessary.</li>
            <li> It still holds a charge for a long time and recharges quickly.  </li>
            <li> The shaver is quick &amp; does not leave long hairs on neck like some shavers.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to go super cheap or super expensive.</li>
            <li> Again keeping the state of charge % between %80 and %30 is the trick to getting super long life out of the battery.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get the hairs within any contours and even the hair on flat surfaces where the skin can be stretched the shaver requires many passes.</li>
            <li> Gives my guy a clean soft shave with out the red burn marks that he got from his old shaver</li>
            <li> I looked at, and a little time searching around the web confirmed my suspicion that I would be FAR from the first woman to use a man&#x27;s razor to shave her legs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got very sensitive skin, and wanted to get away from using normal bladed razors because of what it was doing to my skin.</li>
            <li> The clean up was simple, love the wet dry feature for cleaning</li>
            <li> it is really easy and just requires a little liquid soap squirt onto the top of the shaver, a little water and then the push of a button.  </li>
            <li> I always shave fresh out of the shower, and clean the heck out of the razor, not sure why I&#x27;m so irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The neck area around the adam&#x27;s apple required a few passes, but all around was pretty close and clean.  </li>
            <li> Not as close of a shave as a blade, but certainly better than older electric razors that I used in the past.  </li>
            <li> It was better than the Remington, but similar problem in that it took a long time to shave and did not shave as close as my old Braun 2000.    </li>
            <li> This Panasonic is so smooth and quite compared to the other shaver.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it is cheap than other shop.</li>
            <li> I have found that using the soap on lightly wetted skin is enough lubrication to let the razor move smoothly, and does not clog the razor or foam excessively.</li>
            <li> However, you could buy other advanced model with cleaning system with 80 bucks.</li>
            <li> Since I have owned Braun razors for many years, I was a little surprised they doubled the price after being sold to P&amp;G.  </li>
            <li> Shaving your head with it really wears out the blades and foil a lot more than average because your actually pressing against skeletal bone rather than just a cheek or neck.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning the razor is simple and effective (a little liquid soap and running water), making it even easier to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine, but not right for me.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it if you currently have a rotary blade shaver or its just your first shaver.</li>
            <li> But - five or ten minutes of charging will be enough to let you finish - and a complete charge is pretty quick, too.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s because I was new to electric shaver and didn&#x27;t get used to the handling.  </li>
            <li> Before committing to a new shaver, look at the price of the replacement foil.</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d try something new.</li>
            <li> I figured it was time to get a new one and see what new technology has to offer.  </li>
            <li> , it works like new.  </li>
            <li> Will make it shave like new again.</li>
            <li> Rather than buy another set of replacement blades and a screen for over $30, I decided to buy a new shaver altogether for about $65.</li>
            <li> The new shaver&#x27;s PROS are that it is lighter and quieter.        </li>
            <li> This system still works as new.</li>
            <li> It was bought to replace a 4Blade ES-RF31which needed new blades and screen.</li>
            <li> It still shaves as well as when it was new.  </li>
            <li> I have a Braun 6520 that needed new batteries so as an interim shaver I purchased the Panasonic ES8103S from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Just received my new shaver.  </li>
            <li> so I decided to get something new.</li>
            <li> Two thumbs up and 5 stars from this new convert.</li>
            <li> Each new razor was a Norelco, some spendy and some not.  </li>
            <li> so I thought it was time for a new razor.  </li>
            <li> It holds a charge like new, shaves like new and I&#x27;ll update you guys in another couple of years.</li>
            <li> like the closeness of a razor, but at $14-15.00 for 4 razors, I&#x27;ll live with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After my Norelco quit I began researching for a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Somebody new what they were doing when they designed this shaver.</li>
            <li> Knowing that I needed a new set of blades, which BTW are pricey</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the difference this new razor makes.  </li>
            <li> Oh well, live and learn.    </li>
            <li> It was time to buy a new one again</li>
            <li> I have requested a refund for this item and will buy a new Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> I just bought this shaver 4 weeks ago based on lots of reviews on this site and some new technology.</li>
            <li> After about three weeks I received a brand new ES8103S in the mail.</li>
            <li> I went on-line to find a new one and saw the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> My new ES8103S is made in China.</li>
            <li> so I figured it was time to buy a new shaver.  </li>
            <li> The new Norelco specializes in yank-and-pull shaving, and takes 4-5 passes to catch all the bits.</li>
            <li> My new Panasonic Arc 3 razor changed all that.</li>
            <li> They seem to find a way to please me with each new iteration.</li>
            <li> Even with new blade razors I still have to go over and over my face to get the beard.  </li>
            <li> The instructions say to shave with it for about a month so that your beard&#x27;s growth patterns can adjust to a new shaver.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone who needs a new electric shaver.</li>
            <li> My husband was looking for new shaver, we was gonna buy from Costco.  </li>
            <li> And in fact, this new unit gives me razer burns and bumps on my neck where the ES8043SC didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably get a new screen</li>
            <li> so I can replace it in a year as recommended and then eventually get a new blade set to replace after 2 years of service.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to try this new technology</li>
            <li> It is brand new</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t have my shaved.&amp;#34; I suggested he use my new one.</li>
            <li> I replaced the rechargeable batteries and put a new shaver foil on it</li>
            <li> and it was like new again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten a new set of blades (this season I got the blades and foil).&lt;br</li>
            <li> When it was new</li>
            <li> I would like a new shaver or a refund.</li>
            <li> so I tried to allow sufficient time for my face to get accustomed to the new foil razor.</li>
            <li> I have been using the shaver for about 3 months &amp; the blade still works like new.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t about to shell out $200 to try one of the new electrics, but the $60 price on this one seemed reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received my new razor 3 day ago.</li>
            <li> Like any new electric shaver, it did take a while for me to adjust to it</li>
            <li> I am still in the market for a new shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this almost 2 1/2 years ago &amp;  just ordered new blades &amp; foil.</li>
            <li> They contacted me immediately and sent me a new one - an upgrade, even.  </li>
            <li> As with any new product there is an adjustment period.</li>
            <li> I needed a new shaver and noticed this was the &amp;#34;Deal of the Day&amp;#34; so I decided to purchase it.</li>
            <li> For Christmas now we send rebuild kits (new foil and cutters), one to each of them and one to me, part of our end of year</li>
            <li> I had to try a new brand.</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t until I started using my new ES-8103S</li>
            <li> after years with another brand i needed to get a new one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m searching for a new shaver now</li>
            <li> When it was new 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> This new Panasonic puts it to shame.</li>
            <li> Now I am on here once again looking for new clippers.</li>
            <li> I did not hesitate to order a new one.</li>
            <li> My Norelco took a dive so I was looking for a new one.</li>
            <li> no problems with the new one.</li>
            <li> It takes me longer to shave now than it did when new.</li>
            <li> It´s been 5 months and it works just as new.</li>
            <li> my wife got me a new razor.</li>
            <li> it helps with this new shaver.</li>
            <li> I gave it a couple of months thinking maybe it was just taking my face longer to adjust to the new razor, but it never improved.</li>
            <li> Not knowing a lot about men&#x27;s shavers, I knew my husband wanted a new one</li>
            <li> So I am returning it and buying new blade&#x27;s for my Norelco.</li>
            <li> He has been saying he wanted a new shaver and when Amazon had this on the deal of the day I bought it for him.</li>
            <li> I have always been a Norelo guy but the new models don&#x27;t have the pop up trimmer anymore.  </li>
            <li> but i dont live there.</li>
            <li> The wet/dry experience is new for my father(83y/o).</li>
            <li> I wish I had just paid for new blades for the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I live on the road so that&#x27;s why I carry an electric razor.</li>
            <li> Probably time to start looking for new blades and screen.  </li>
            <li> I live in Viet nam and had my friend buy this for me.</li>
            <li> He through it in a drawer and bought one for 10 dollars and when it wears out, he throws it out and gets a new one.</li>
            <li> So, I thought I&#x27;d check on the price of a new one:</li>
            <li> Foil was new to me and I was a bit cautious.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned or used an electric shaver before, so this was new to me.</li>
            <li> So I bought this new Panasonic Model ES8103S</li>
            <li> and it works as it was new.</li>
            <li> I will  be needing new blades soon.</li>
            <li> and I bought it at a garage sale for $1.00, bought new blades for it</li>
            <li> I decided that I needed a new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using a Braun for years, and yes I have put new rotary blades in it, but nothing shaves me as close as this Panasonic Electric Shaver.</li>
            <li> It gave me a closer shave than a brand new Fusion cartridge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shopping around for a new one for him.</li>
            <li> ordered a new one as a gift for my Dad.  </li>
            <li> , i change to new</li>
            <li> so I have to buy a new set of blades.</li>
            <li> its new I replaced&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on new shaving heads</li>
            <li> The Panasonic blades are cheaper and it cuts like a brand new 5hp lawn mower after using a push mower to do your yard.</li>
            <li> the shaving in the hard to shave areas like the point of the chin and along the jawbone is very easily done.</li>
            <li> Lets keep this short and simpe:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Wet/Dry, motor, floating or locking head, the foil appears more rugged than other foil shavers, decent for the price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> very sensitive skin and Braun is too sharp for me.&lt;br /&gt;Wet &amp; dry is nice</li>
            <li> After a year of use and the blades a still quite sharp and the battery is holding up nicely, I get 4 or 5 shaves on a single charge.  </li>
            <li> The bottom line is I was able to purchase the new model for far less than a repair plus new blades for the old model would have cost.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t take very long for me to give a quick once over</li>
            <li> The cost of the new Panasonic shaver was just a few dollars more than the replacement head for my old Philips so that is why I bought it</li>
            <li> Too bad the manufacturer isn&#x27;t more honest about the product.  </li>
            <li> I have used it in the shower with a light shave cream, at the sink with a light cream, dry with Williams&#x27; Lectric Shave and dry with nothing when time is short.  </li>
            <li> The shave is not as clean as others and is rough to use.</li>
            <li> I like the littel icon reminding to clean it, the wet feature</li>
            <li> I will ever get it wet, even to clean it.</li>
            <li> I will ever get it wet, even to clean it.</li>
            <li> Just be careful with the piece that comes off when you want to clean it.</li>
            <li> Lasts for about a week of shaving on one charge.&lt;br /&gt;- Very quick to charge - less than an hour.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> While this razor has capabilities that I do not use, such a being able to shave a wet face,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really like having the display that shows how much batter power is left...</li>
            <li> Panasonic wet shavers have been better, but with this current model ES 8103</li>
            <li> However, I had to go over the same spot numerous times in order for it to be smooth</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although this shaver will wet cut, I have not tried this feature, though it  sounds interesting enough to try soon, so I cannot comment in this</li>
            <li> The unit charges up fast and is considerably lighter and quieter than my 3 year old Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li> but after a couple of tries with my regular razor I figured that I would give electric a try for the top of my head.     </li>
            <li> I have a light beard and still it requires multiple passes over the same spot.</li>
            <li> I find modern life pretty empty and pointless without the possibility of a good shave looming in the future like a raccoon under your bed, so I thought I would try an electric Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I have shaved dry or with afta pre-electric lotion, and like how quick I can get done shaving, without using shave cream and water.</li>
            <li> Amazon delivered it earlier than expected and packaged appropriately.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mixed experience with Panasonic razors - the first one I had was great, the second was pretty mediocre.</li>
            <li> Works great for wet shaving and thick beards.</li>
            <li> I would have really appreciated ability to use standard batteries if Panasonic really didnt have intention to milk customers for supplies and spares.</li>
            <li> It cut my facial hair very close but never did very well on my neck.  </li>
            <li> thinner 3 foil (2 blade) unit is better for curved facial surfaces than its 4 foil wide cousins.</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves the shaver and can&#x27;t say enough about how much he appreciates it.</li>
            <li> This shaver has done exactly i hoped, given me that close shave without the burns and irritation i normally got when i used a standard razor.</li>
            <li> They engineered this to fit along the back of the shaver and is tiny.  </li>
            <li> I have to go over the same spot several times to get a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I have to go over and over again to get a decent shave, I never had to do that with my old Remington</li>
            <li> It shaves very close and doesn&#x27;t tear up my face (sensitive skin) like my old Braun and Norelco shavers did.</li>
            <li> I really like the digital readout showing the battery life, and as I stated it gives a really close shave.  </li>
            <li> pop-up trimmer is very useful for neck &amp; other body hair.</li>
            <li> Always liked the cheaper single head Panasonic shavers and thought I would try the more expensive version.  </li>
            <li> The battery charges really fast (full charge in an hour) and it doesn&#x27;t lose power as the charge goes down.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic shaver charged quickly, cuts smoothly and quietly and the price was 20% less than Target!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of electric shavers, other than that they are a bit more convenient than normal ones.</li>
            <li> After my face got used to the new shaver, I found that I am consistently getting a much better dry shave than with my previous rotary blade shaver.</li>
            <li> Braun used to be a fine shaver company with quality support - I think they&#x27;ve fallen down a bit (IMHO).</li>
            <li> The razor is loud, with a high pitched squeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and often cut myself with the blade razor.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li> My husband has very sensitive skin and refused to shave closely before receiving this razor.</li>
            <li> This Electric shaver was bought for my son who has very sensitive skin &amp; cannot shave with a blade</li>
            <li> The razor I was replacing (another brand) was very old</li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin and the Doc recommended I switch to electric.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was very surprised.</li>
            <li> it gives me a bit of razor burn/rash, but i have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> shave is very nearly as close as a Gillette Fusion or Mach 3, no noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> high speed is a must have, do not waste your time with lower speed</li>
            <li> It makes a very loud noise.</li>
            <li> This model met the requirements at a very reasonable price, about the same cost as 36 pivoting razorblades,</li>
            <li> His skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li> Very surprised at the quality.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband of whom has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband who has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Purchase this as a replacement for a very old Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very loud, like turning on a lawnmower.</li>
            <li> It is very soft on the skin and follows every contour.</li>
            <li> and I have very sensitive ears.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Shaving was something I dreaded to the point where I got fired from a job because I wouldn&#x27;t shave everyday (as if guys who work in lumber yards need to be clean shaven!)</li>
            <li> This is his second one -- the first lasted for almost two years before it needed new coils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will come right out and say no...this is nowhere near as close a shave as an actual razor.</li>
            <li> This is exactly just right for the average face.</li>
            <li> Flip up trimmer is a little flimsy feeling but does a good job tackling the longer hairs and doesn&#x27;t get jammed up like my old one.  </li>
            <li> After about a month the cutting performance has declined a little, presumably as the fresh edges lose their perfect sharpness.</li>
            <li> Cleanup is simple and easy and the charge on the device lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Minor annoyance is the sound it produces; a high pitched whine similar to a lawn trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Now, that&#x27;s an exaggeration, but the somewhat high-pitched noise at a decently high volume is something to be aware of, as some people are sensitive to such things.  </li>
            <li> It was a real pain using one of those little brushes to try to get the shaver half-way clean.    </li>
            <li> Based on the fact that this model is sort of an entry-level model for the Panasonic line, I can only imagine how well the higher end models perform.</li>
            <li> As the days passed, they got better and my beard wasn&#x27;t growing back sharp, like it did with the gillette.</li>
            <li> the replacement foil/blade cost is not excessive.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is cordless since our apartment bathroom is so small.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed with this shaver, is how quiet the Panasonic is versus the Remington.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted several years before breaking.</li>
            <li> I fully charged on January 11th and today February first, I shaved and still have 10% left as per the LCD.</li>
            <li> From the first shave, I was instantly WOWed.  </li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver I have ever owned that actually works as it claims.  </li>
            <li> (a squirt of soft soap and water, rinse, run it on \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; mode, DONE!)  </li>
            <li> I tried a Norelco rotary-style shaver first, which left a lot of stubble and pulled the whiskers.</li>
            <li> I always had Braun shavers and this will was my first and will be my last Panasonic.</li>
            <li> realized this shaver was different when I first turned it ON.</li>
            <li> The higher vibration rate of the Panasonic did not seem to make any difference relative to the Braun 6520 vibration rate.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> It was a gift and it seems to be working well so far!</li>
            <li> My first Remington was a gift from my grandfather when I had peach-fuzz, but lasted about 20 years all total.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for the exact same model that was stolen out of my luggage, so I have used it for about 2 years now.  </li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW!  </li>
            <li> Overall, this is exactly the type of shaving experience I was looking for.</li>
            <li> And that is no small feat.      </li>
            <li> When you think of shavers, Panasonic isn&#x27;t the first name that pops into mind, but before you make your next shaver buy, I would recommend that you give them a close look.</li>
            <li> Before then, I used my Braun and Remington (both of which had the MSRP of well over $100) for most of the past decade.  </li>
            <li> I gave it to him early and he loves it!</li>
            <li> although i&#x27;ve tried a higher end phillips and have had the same results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other pros I&#x27;ve noticed: The shaver is pretty quiet and not quite as jarring/heavily vibrating as some of the others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I definitely would recommend this product to anyone who is interested.</li>
            <li> I had to send my first one back as defective since the display went out after 2 charges.  </li>
            <li> BUT only if you&#x27;re willing to shave all your skin off with the hair    </li>
            <li> It may not equal the shave of a blade razor for closeness - but the Panasonic ERS8103s comes pretty close.</li>
            <li> but it replaced a 8 year old Braun 5601 and man o man, what a performance difference!</li>
            <li> This is a first shaver for my teenage son.</li>
            <li> My first shaver began to show problems with the screen after about six or seven months of daily use.</li>
            <li> Generally pleased with the shaver, especially in comparison with other electric shavers I have had over the years.</li>
            <li> He had been using his fathers, I think more for sentimental reasons then for practicality.  </li>
            <li> I wash it regularly with hot soapy water and then use a spray lube after it dries off.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a difference!  </li>
            <li> No small bristle brushes to rid the device of remnants...</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I use it when my face is required to feel baby soft and it does after using this shaver!</li>
            <li> Overall, it gives me a very close shave!</li>
            <li> so the shaver screens being to small, and non- cord use,  the shaver is ok.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this razor to anyone who is either buying one for the first time or for anyone who is dissatisfied with their current razor.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving daily for 3.5 years and the battery still holds a charge like the first day I got it.</li>
            <li> : I did not figure out how to use the trimmer properly for the first 2 years of use.</li>
            <li> I found this Panasonic that advertised the same features as the higher end Brauns.</li>
            <li> This is my second ES8103S which I purchased because I like my first one</li>
            <li> I like the style, but it only does an OK job of shaving, and I have to continually go over some areas several times till they finally get fully shaved.</li>
            <li> I have pretty coarse beard and the ES8103S is doing the job even if I skip a day</li>
            <li> The head snaps on and off, and from there it&#x27;s simply rinse with hot water.</li>
            <li> but if you aren&#x27;t in any hurry and are willing to go over the same spot 100 times it works.</li>
            <li> Overall, if this were my first razor without a frame of reference</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used an electric razor after 45 years of various blade systems.</li>
            <li> When I wanted to replace that last one, I was hesitant to get another Panasonic but the reviews seemed better than the other options (except perhaps those the $200+ range)</li>
            <li> This one was for my teenage son, it&#x27;s his first one</li>
            <li> if you have a coarse beard like me, this thing is pretty useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A simple hot water rinse while the razor is running will keep the razor performing well.</li>
            <li> I did not follow that advice on my first one and actually cut myself with it.</li>
            <li> several shaves.&lt;br /&gt;It picks up almost every hair at the &#x27;first strike&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> just Ordered a Remington Shaver, I&#x27;m hoping that I can get more than a year of use this time :-/</li>
            <li> The first two the batteries self destructed after 1 year, and the next, six months.  </li>
            <li> If you can get this razor for anywhere close to the price I paid, I am not sure why you would spend more on anything else.</li>
            <li> This machine doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to cut small hairs that get stuck to the skin, and I have to use the razor to remove them.</li>
            <li> The charger is a small wall-dongle, not built-in, so you have more to carry when traveling than with the Remington.</li>
            <li> so I can probably get away with this pretty basic model.</li>
            <li> I had sent a wish list of several that I was interested in</li>
            <li> The cleaning process is pretty simple and taking it apart for cleaning is a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll probably never go back to a straight razor again!</li>
            <li> This is my second electric shaver, the first I had left my skin irritated during the first week of use.</li>
            <li> , I forgot profits first and the living planet and future generations</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about purchasing at first but pulled the trigger and do not regret it, especially when Amazon had a $15 coupon.</li>
            <li> I was able to use it plugged in (which I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s suppose to do?), but worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers for decades and this is the first that didn&#x27;t have the option to run off of household current.  </li>
            <li> This is my first Panasonic electric shaver, since I was using Philip-Norelco shaver for the last 25 years.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I have used both brands and they are pretty much equal.</li>
            <li> pretty soon it gets red and irritated.  </li>
            <li> And this is more of a backup/last minute device as I usually use a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> but this was my first and will be my last.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd electric shaver I&#x27;ve purchased in my life and my first was about 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li> I wore the first one out and bought the second one</li>
            <li> I bought a second one in case the first ever wears out or breaks.</li>
            <li> its my second shaver, the first one was a remington</li>
            <li> Quiet and charges FAST!</li>
            <li> Despite this, and having used it daily for three years, it does as well now as it did the day I first used</li>
            <li> My reason for giving only four stars instead of five is because I have not experience using it during the summer when humidity levels are higher than now in February.  </li>
            <li> No complaints so far!</li>
            <li> The original blades almost sharp as the replacement blades.</li>
            <li> If i have to do it again, i will get exactly the same one.  </li>
            <li> I have used a Braun electric razors for the past 12 years, and have been quite pleased with how they worked.  </li>
            <li> This is usually an issue with most electric shavers, but this one take A LOT of passes.</li>
            <li> It works well with a pre-shave oil, Proraso, and my badger brush, though I would recommend making the lather a tad bit more watery than usual to allow the razor to glide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first lasted four years with no problems but suddenly died.  </li>
            <li> It shaves pretty close but obviously not as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li> Pretty plan and simple.</li>
            <li> I wash mine under hot water using the regular motor speed then into turbo speed to finish up.</li>
            <li> Works well as a wet shaver; I use it once a day so at a full charge of 100% I can get</li>
            <li> When my old Panasonic needed new blades and foil, I decided to shop for a new shaver.</li>
            <li> The new ES8103S measured at 52 dB, my almost new ES8077 measured at 54 dB, and my old, retired ES8077 measured at 75 dB.  </li>
            <li> I have used Braun shavers ever since my first shave and they always did an adequate job, though not stellar enough that I when it came time for a replacement I couldn&#x27;t be swayed by the high reviews Panasonic shavers were getting all over the web.    </li>
            <li> Pat a little water with a trace of soap on, and it does the job in an easy minute.</li>
            <li> But if you are African American, don&#x27;t expect a clean shave.</li>
            <li> Of course they don&#x27;t build them like they use to, but then again it&#x27;s also MUCH cheaper than the older panasonic ES model i had before the battery finally gave out.</li>
            <li> 20 seconds later you rinse it clean with another 20 second cycle.  </li>
            <li> It gets close enough that he can shower at night and still look clean shaven by the next afternoon.</li>
            <li> In comparison with rotary electric shavers, I have found the battery to last much longer; recently, it seems that I am not getting as many shaves per charge, but in my previous experiences with rotary electric shavers, I have had battery problems much sooner.</li>
            <li> This shaver works decent, it comes with a clipper that works very well, but the actual shaving part tends to miss a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> Yeah, I might have to shave with this Panny every 2-3 days now because it doesn&#x27;t cut as close as a traditional razor, but it only takes me a couple minutes to shave my face clean with this thing.</li>
            <li> You have to go over the same area several times in order to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> I simply submerge the head of this into that fluid and use the clean mode.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no way a Braun can compete with this shaver, also the cleaning is incredibly simple and the shaver is always clean for the next shave.</li>
            <li> so I am please that this one is now a year and a half old and still going strong.</li>
            <li> Taking longer than other razors to get a clean shave--for an electric.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll</li>
            <li> Again, these cons are super minor, and really don&#x27;t impact my overall feelings about the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only get about half the shaves from a full charge as Panasonic claims I should, but that is worth it for the close shave.</li>
            <li> This product is one of a very few items that actualy do what it says it will in many years.</li>
            <li> I guess i have been lucky, every shaver i buy is a little better than the previous one.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8103S provides a nice dry shave, but it leaves a mess below where you shave.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;d like a little more bell/whistle factor, get ES8243A, essentially the same thing gussied up, but costs roughly twice and according to one review the renewal parts (screens and cutters) cost much more than the</li>
            <li> So far, I am pleased with the performance of this shaver and, based upon my experience with other Panasonic models, I am not concerned at all about the light-weight construction.ll related spare parts.</li>
            <li> I own several electric shavers, one old-type SHARP, one Braun (bought last month) and this Panasonic.</li>
            <li> This razor started out strong, but the high quality shave started to deteriorate after 2-3 months, even though I was following the suggested cleaning protocol (and even though the foil and blades were supposed to last two and one years, respectively).  </li>
            <li> I guess when these things get old they get pretty mechanical loose and subsequently very noisy.  </li>
            <li> So instead of paying another $40 or so for a new battery and blades for the old Norelco, I tried this panasonic es 8103s.</li>
            <li> For this reason, I have deleted my old review and replacing it with this new review.</li>
            <li> The new blades would have cost me nearly $40.00 to replace, so I figured what the heck?</li>
            <li> I have been apprehensive about getting a new shaver because I need one for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> In fact, one of the reasons I decided to get a new model was because the battery on the old one was beginning to diminish in strength and duration of usefulness.  </li>
            <li> I needed a new electric razor to replace an old one that had stopped working.  </li>
            <li> My 16 yr old is new to the electric razor.  </li>
            <li> If your razor is old, if you&#x27;re considering a new one and thinking (I&#x27;ll just replace the cutters and screen\\&quot; - don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The shaver no longer shaves as it did when new, and the foil/blade assembly buzzes so loudly now that it is almost</li>
            <li> a new ES8077.&lt;br /&gt;I have to comment about some reviewers saying this shaver is so loud that it hurts their hearing.  </li>
            <li> Replacement blades for the new razer are cheaper than my old razer.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> You would think this brand new shaver would beat out a 5 year old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The issues....</li>
            <li> so I bought this particular product due to much research and positive reviews.</li>
            <li> The shaver last about 10 days on single charge &amp; does not loose power at the end like most shavers.  </li>
            <li> It looks like replacement batteries are available for less than $20</li>
            <li> My husband has used the three blade rotary style razor for 20 years and was not getting the smooth results with the typical brands, and it took a lot of time to shave.  </li>
            <li> replaced my previous panasonic shaver, that was over 10 years old and still working fine.</li>
            <li> I can easily get a usable charge, from totally dead, in the amount of time it takes me to shower.</li>
            <li> I do have to feel to find a few spots that are easy to miss.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts for about a weeks worth of shaves ( once a day) and charges quickly ( an hour or 2 tops)&lt;br /&gt;Ive used it in the hower with no issues, though I prefer the dry shave as opposed to wet with this razor..</li>
            <li> The first one I purchased (probably five years ago) lasted for nearly two years and only broke because I dropped it.</li>
            <li> Just a couple of notes: some reviewers mentioned the noise, and that was my concern at first, but it&#x27;s only as loud as a Norelco.</li>
            <li> am 70 yrs old now and lazy, so I can do a respectful job while watching TV.</li>
            <li> At first, the display started to fade and go in and out, and then the razor completely stopped working and the only thing I can think happened is that it got water inside</li>
            <li> normal routine is to shave with the electric and pass back with cream and a straight razor.</li>
            <li> this is my third Panasonic shaver, the first one is over 12 years old and still works.</li>
            <li> ran it over my face and several passes later, my face was still full of hair.</li>
            <li> I bought exactly the same model to replace my two year old razor.</li>
            <li> but I actually received a closer shave with this than my normal straight blade, and I wasn&#x27;t even using the wet-shave option.</li>
            <li> would strongly advise not to purchase it, as it will be waste of your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, these are WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!!  </li>
            <li> like I&#x27;m trying to massage it and no pulling, no pain, no raw feeling.</li>
            <li> In terms of shaving comfort and closeness, this model is very much the same as the Braun with the exception that it does create more neck irritation (at least for me) and the trimmer that comes with</li>
            <li> My now 5 year old Braun 9565 was beginning to fall apart and was always very loud.</li>
            <li> There is a tiny plastic gear nub (for lack of a better description) that vibrates the trimmer blade, and the nub either wore down or broke.  </li>
            <li> Limited success there.  </li>
            <li> Because of this price difference and rave reviews, I expected something special -- or at least something better than a $30 electric razor.    </li>
            <li> Even so, I still use Lectric Shave since I like its very light conditioning of the skin as opposed to something like Edge which would make it hard to see what I was doing.</li>
            <li> One positive, it is very quiet.</li>
            <li> In the product description the last line says, \\&quot;When you&#x27;re done shaving, simply rinse clean under water, click the shaver into the HydraCleanTM dock, and your razor will be ready the next morning.\\</li>
            <li> Once you get used to the feel of it, it only takes a light hand with only a few passes to manage a clean shave.</li>
            <li> Very close shave, easy to use either wet or dry!  </li>
            <li> the razor does not shave my beard on the first pass, the second pass, third pass, I really have to dig the razor into my face to get the hair off, I have tried shaving cream, shaving gel, shaving oil and nothing helps.</li>
            <li> The digital readout is also helpful in knowing exactly how much power is left in the battery.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty fast as compared to using the Braun, and is quiet enough as well.  </li>
            <li> I have had several models for women, mostly from Panasonic, but they aren&#x27;t as well made and just do not last as long in my experience as the men&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This has been true with other electric shavers I have used.</li>
            <li> One criticism of this shaver is that it&#x27;s noisy and hums along at the same frequency as one of those big municipal wood chippers at full rev -- not as loud, of course, but I do have to turn it off to have a conversation.</li>
            <li> But everything seems to be pretty much disposable anymore, even the more expensive models.</li>
            <li> With my other electric razor, my skin was not this smooth right after the shave, let along ten hours later.</li>
            <li> The new one works very well and battery charge lasts ten plus days.</li>
            <li> My last one was noisy, didn&#x27;t shave very well and when the screen started to go, I went looking on Amazon for a new shaver.</li>
            <li> The new razor is so much lighter in weight and gives such a trouble-free shave that I can&#x27;t wait to use it again.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I don&#x27;t like the popup trimmer angle, and that it emits a tiny high pitched whine when charging that you can hear if your hearing is good.</li>
            <li> but I think the wet dry shave option is so much better</li>
            <li> Currently, I am using a flexible (yet stronger / more durable) travel case from a previous razor to hold this razor, and this razor&#x27;s travel case to hold the power cord.  </li>
            <li> I am 63 and my skin is a lot more tender and subject to cuts than when I was younger.  </li>
            <li> Against my better judgment I purchased several, each time going up in price after the previous one stopped working.</li>
            <li> He had that previously and it was such a hassle and more money for cleaners.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Press and briefly hold the on/off button until the razor enters the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; mode (a digital indicator will show, plus the blade sound is clearly different), wet the foil (bladecover) under running water, apply liquid hand soap to the foil and allow the razor to clean itself.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with the razor both in wet shave and dry shave.  </li>
            <li> I have tried both wet and dry and I am completely satisfied with both.</li>
            <li> It worked well enough, better than my previous shavers.</li>
            <li> but this razor doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate my face like most razors (wet and dry) do.  </li>
            <li> Finally, though the manual says you&#x27;ll get \\&quot;about 14 shaves\\&quot; to a full charge, I was already down to 60% after the first 3 shaves.  </li>
            <li> The shaver is quiet, charges quickly and has a readout which shows the amount of charge left and when the razor needs cleaning.</li>
            <li> Charges quickly, and holds enough to last all week.</li>
            <li> He says it&#x27;s easy and painless to use and goes right through his tough beard.</li>
            <li> Using this on my legs I can get the skin smooth to the touch, but the stubble will be back the next day as opposed to using a razor which usually leaves my legs feeling smooth for closer to two days.  </li>
            <li> Shaves take more than teice as long as aren&#x27;t very close even with extra time spent going over the arrea.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Battery seems to last long enough (haven&#x27;t counted yet, but seems to last the week)&lt;br /&gt;-The pivoting head is a nice feature to contour to face/neck&lt;</li>
            <li> He has thick growth and this makes his face very smooth without any pulling or abrasion.</li>
            <li> If you take the time to do it right, you will get a shave virtually as close as a blade in the dry mode.</li>
            <li> It works really well for my light whisker type both wet and dry.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: My last \\&quot;FOIL\\&quot; type shaver seemed less loud and was able to charge and shave</li>
            <li> No one has made a better wet and dry so far.</li>
            <li> wet or dry better than my old Braun</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ok, so it says wet-or-dry shave (which I liked, and ordered for that reason), but you definitely get a better/closer shave dry than using it wet or with shave</li>
            <li> But this model is far better wet and dry.</li>
            <li> Razor generally works well, I particularly like the wet/dry option.  </li>
            <li> Not as good as other shavers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> It still keeps its charge surprising well, unlike a lot of other electric razors I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> And my braun, which is in desperate need of a new primary blade, still does a far better job than this razor.</li>
            <li> It is not only a very reasonable price, but I can comfortably get an extremely close shave which can only be exceeded by a razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can only hope that this shaver will last me through a decade of shaves like my old Remington, because I&#x27;d love to keep it for a very long time.</li>
            <li> The blade is very dull and it does not shave smoothly on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> very smooth shaving, has two net blades and trim, light weight, rubberized handle grip, battery charge indicator 0 - 100, also little sign appears on the screen when it needs to clean, the shaver head moves up and down slightly and left and right to avoid extra force on the skin.</li>
            <li> A little light in weight</li>
            <li> Smooth shaves with little heating and face soreness.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really need a new one but saw this one and bought it on impulse since I figured the old one would just give out some day and leave me high and dry.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint about any and all Panasonic razors is they work fine for about a year, then they quit working or start really having lots of problems.  </li>
            <li> The battery lasts a long time and it is simple to clean.</li>
            <li> Mine is a few years old and still working fine.</li>
            <li> tried it once as a wet razor with shaving cream, it did a fine job and the instructions for cleaning were simple and worked well.  </li>
            <li> Still working, also never as good as my previous Panasonic Wet/Dry one, feels a bit clunky and the LED that shows the loading status has given up on me, only two sections lighting up making it rather difficult to read, also you can if you hold it against the light and look very closely.</li>
            <li> I thought perhaps I got a defective device, but that is not the case because I gave to my dad to try (who has fine straight oily beard, that grows in one direction and isn&#x27;t as thick as mine.....</li>
            <li> It is smooth and very delicate on my skin (which is also very delicate lol).</li>
            <li> One final point the new shaver feels very light and delicate not like the older model.</li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, the actual shaving head and overall shave is close and actually closer on my face than i can get with a mach 3 , and leaves less irritation than my old norelco but leaves more irritation than my old braun series 1 (which i replaced with this panasonic as it was on sale here on amazon for $55 at the time).</li>
            <li> Gets most of the facial hairs with little effort.  </li>
            <li> It works a little better with daily use but still not good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Better than throwing dull blades every week or two.&lt;br /&gt;-Shave</li>
            <li> However, I doesn&#x27;t get the hard to shave whiskers any better</li>
            <li> In some hard to shave areas, I think the triple heads may be better.</li>
            <li> The blades can get dull but it&#x27;s nothing that a replacement won&#x27;t fix. :)</li>
            <li> It was hard to decide which Panasonic Shaver to buy from Amazon because there are so many models to pick from.</li>
            <li> I do have a hard time understanding why anyone would spend more than this...</li>
            <li> Granted my last Norelco was an older model but what can I say-this razor rocks!</li>
            <li> Requires pushing hard and alot more time to shave.  </li>
            <li> My facial hair is fairly soft and not very thick, but it doesn&#x27;t take much to cause the trimmer to hang up.  </li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t sure how this shaver would work with me having a tough beard.</li>
            <li> Remington was too flimsy, the foil broke not long after replacing it - right in the middle of a shave.</li>
            <li> I grow pretty heavy stubble very fast, So I returned to this brand hoping the quality hadn&#x27;t declined since 2006</li>
            <li> If not using it wet, it can get a little warm near the end of the shave.  </li>
            <li> It provides an amazing, close shave, with hardly a need to go over the same area twice.</li>
            <li> The only department where this shaver gets due credit is in that it is easy on the skin.</li>
            <li> this is a great product it gives a close shave with hardly any irritation and no razor bumps (if you use it everyday).</li>
            <li> I decided to try the ES-8103s due to the high ratings and significant price difference from the current Braun 5.</li>
            <li> Since I can&#x27;t wait that long on most work days, I have to finish my shave with a conventional razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> While it may not look as fancy as many other electric razors it is easy to handle and provides a close shave without irritating the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even after a good shave with razor however this thing cuts closer especially for hard to reach areas like upper lip.</li>
            <li> That is not such a big deal to me though since it has a quick 5 min charge for a single shave and takes only an hour to get a full charge.  </li>
            <li> No soap, no cleaning, no lather/re-lather/re-lather to get all of the angels covered, no mess, and no raw skin.    </li>
            <li> huge waste of $65.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately you really do have to shave every day since it doesn&#x27;t get as close to the skin as a manual, bladed razor, but it is still an amazing shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and it has done a great job on my thick stubble.</li>
            <li> All in all, it will take less time and clean up is a breeze.</li>
            <li> The results seemed nearly the same no matter how much I paid for each one.  </li>
            <li> It will rattel sometimes, but it is in a whole different league than my old shaver.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts about a week for me, as compared to 1.5 to 2 weeks for the Norelco, but I really don&#x27;t care since this shaver is a class above anything I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic&#x27;s is good for light touch ups but the Braun&#x27;s could really do some heavy cutting.  </li>
            <li> It is clearly well made.  </li>
            <li> it is well worth the price of more expensive shavers that do not work as well.  </li>
            <li> I like how this shaver tells you how much juice it has left (my old shaver just died).</li>
            <li> Not only does it provide me a FAR closer shave, it does it much, MUCH faster than the ES8103 ever could, and</li>
            <li> Do yourself and the wife a favor and stay clear of this.</li>
            <li> I was shocked that for the first time he liked something I bought for him!</li>
            <li> &#x3D;one clear area.</li>
            <li> With a close shave you can clearly see every hair that isn&#x27;t cut.</li>
            <li> Note: if you are switching from using a blade-razor such as Gillette Fusion to using an electric shaver, be aware that the electric generally does not give as close</li>
            <li> So far he loves it especially when he needs to get a fast shave in.</li>
            <li> When my facial hair grows in, it comes in fast and wild.</li>
            <li> Its a bit different than my 25 year old Braun which served me very well - no complaints there.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-Loud, too loud in my opinion, that it actually heats up fast</li>
            <li> Smooth shave especially if you wet your skin and use shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s no big deal, but if guys are REALLY that sensitive, this makes some noise.&lt;br /&gt;Charge</li>
            <li> With my old norelco, I had an issue with it getting switched on by accident in my luggage.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t expect how loud it is.</li>
            <li> So now it dies mid shave while getting ready for work.</li>
            <li> but so far he loves it for&lt;br</li>
            <li> Went to blades and used them for nearly 20yrs.</li>
            <li> The old Remington still shaved closer.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> ES8103S shaves as close as my old Remington, closer than the Braun -</li>
            <li> and I have not had any irritation of my face thus far.  </li>
            <li> He has extremely sensitive skin and just can&#x27;t do a strait</li>
            <li> And I must say that his face is now cuddly soft, even hours after shaving.  </li>
            <li> by far...</li>
            <li> Also, it is loud...</li>
            <li> I also have tried this with shaving cream while in the shower, and was I surprised once</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s really the opposite of \\&quot;convenient\\&quot; for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shaver does not cut any faster than the Remington, and it still takes about 5 minutes for a complete shave.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind how loud it is.</li>
            <li> have not had an instance where the razor died when in use because there&#x27;s a power meter that the power meter informs you how much juice is left.</li>

            <li> broke early on</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cleaning action.</li>
            <li> But this shaver is the least irritating, the closest shaving, and the most effective I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> so you knew how much \\&quot;life\\&quot; was left before re-charging.  </li>
            <li> but so far it is a thumbs up item in my book.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, he is going to break the (now two year old)</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, you may not have a problem</li>
            <li> If you forget to charge one night and don&#x27;t have much time in the morning to wait for it to charge, this could be a big issue.</li>
            <li> The blades last much longer because of the lubrication the lather provides.  </li>
            <li> My Norelco needed blades again, I&#x27;m not knocking Norelco, the razor still works (probably 4-5 years old)</li>
            <li> I have been a Braun user for nearly 16 years</li>
            <li> So, in short, it really depends on the structure of face and neck region.  </li>
            <li> I had an old Panasonic that I upgraded to a Braun 8595.  </li>
            <li> Close shave nearly all over.</li>
            <li> Had this since before Christmas, no issues so far.</li>
            <li> Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Rechargeable Linear Pivot Action Shaving System, Silver]]    </li>
            <li> It was almost $40 and battery would be still the old one.   </li>
            <li> Plus, I&#x27;m now having to make multiple passes on all planes of my face just to get a reasonably close shave.        </li>
            <li> I also looked at &#x27;value&#x27; lines like Remington, but reviews sounded like what I would have said about my old ones.  </li>
            <li> An LCD display shows how much charge is left.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and they have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The latest Braun I have been using is the 7570, and I have been using it for at least seven years.</li>
            <li> The shaver is loud.   </li>
            <li> seems kinda loud when shaving&lt;br</li>
            <li> My last Braun lasted well over 10 years and felt much heavier/solid than the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> When my old shaver broke I read the user comments here on Amazon</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m unimpressed with the quality of Panasonic products.</li>
            <li> It is very quite compared to the traditional electric</li>
            <li> Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Rechargeable Linear Pivot Action Shaving System, Silver]]</li>
            <li> It takes MUCH longer to get the same shave as with a rotary head.</li>
            <li> Think twice before replacing your old rotary type for this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 78 years old and figured I didn&#x27;t need a razor that lasted 15 years.so</li>
            <li> No so far</li>
            <li> My old shaver would take three or four passes to \\&quot;gitterdone.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So much for the \\&quot;solid</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the razor for nearly 6 years now and the battery is kaput.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic has an A/C adapter that can be plugged directly into the shaver and the shaver can be used with the cord attached.  </li>
            <li> I have been experimenting with different shave conditions and it has done very well.  </li>
            <li> The slide switch on the side of the razor allows you to let the head pivot for flexing around your face, or it locks the head in a fixed position.  </li>
            <li> Replacement blades are a very inexpensive $17 considering they only have to be changed every two years.  </li>
            <li> I really tried to give this shaver a chance, but I found that it did NOT give a close shave with only two days in between shaving.</li>
            <li> I have thrown my old razors away.</li>
            <li> Obviously, probably not a real challenge, but the Panasonic I definitely like better than the Remingtons I&#x27;ve been using.  </li>
            <li> With or with out sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My husband does not have sensitive skin and it did this to him.</li>
            <li> I had philips electro shaver old model.</li>
            <li> this panasonic model don&#x27;t have any advantages compared to my old philips shaver .  </li>
            <li> My old model ES8066 was made in Japan.</li>
            <li> Too early to tell.    </li>
            <li> I bought this razor looking for a replacement for my old Braun.</li>
            <li> He stays over frequently and I told him he could try it out, but</li>
            <li> My buddy will love me for letting me share, not that I won&#x27;t expect at least something in return...</li>
            <li> This baby shaves me completely to where I can&#x27;t feel any hair on my face at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also read that it is loud.</li>
            <li> Bought for my boyfriend for xmas and he can&#x27;t really use it because it cuts his face, especially under the chin.  </li>
            <li> I can get a complete shave in about 3-1/2 to 4 min.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also had a lot of problems with getting cut frequently because of a less-than-great water softener.  </li>
            <li> have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m way too old for breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The motor on this is also rather loud and you&#x27;ll notice it if you&#x27;re trimming near/around your ears.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Audible (I&#x27;m told) in the far reaches of the house.</li>
            <li> In fact it is so gentle that mid day or evening</li>
            <li> This gets so close as to feel baby skin soft with NO shadow at all when I am done.</li>
            <li> With this shaver, I can have a close shave, and no ingrown hairs, so it&#x27;s really the gold standard for me in terms of shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like my old Braun.  </li>
            <li> a traveler).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 69 years old.</li>
            <li> With the linear speed, I am surprised that it takes me a bit longer to shave than the old Panasonic this one replaces.  </li>
            <li> If you live/sleep with a companion, and your bathroom is anywhere near your bedroom, door-closed or no-door-closed</li>
            <li> Also, the shaver is incredibly LOUD.</li>
            <li> Some reviews had mentioned this, but even I did not believe it could be so loud.</li>
            <li> But as a replacement to Braun this has worked well so far...</li>
            <li> quite frankly all the reviews on Amazon written about different models really helped me decide.  </li>
            <li> My old Panasonic died after 5+ years of service</li>
            <li> I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 because after reading the reviews I had expected the shaver to do a better job with short facial hair; but it takes a bit of effort to do so.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin I recommend trying this razor</li>
            <li> So far the word is still out on performance.</li>
            <li> Look no further if you want a \\&quot;straight razor\\&quot; shave with an electric.</li>
            <li> and I take the blades of the shaver and soak them overnight in isopropyl alcohol and so far it has been 4 weeks</li>
            <li> I use the soft switch position.</li>
            <li> Well the Panasonic ES8103S completely changed my mind.    </li>
            <li> Wow, quality stuff</li>
            <li> I am 75 years old and have had about 50 electric rzors in my lifetime.</li>
            <li> Had some problems with my chin breaking out using old electric razor as well as bladed razor.  </li>
            <li> although not too loud - draws away from the shaving experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Based on my use so far, a charge should give me 7-10 shaves per charge.</li>
            <li> None of the women&#x27;s models lasted anywhere near that (if I recall maybe 12-18 months).</li>
            <li> Cons: -Loud</li>
            <li> to the point the noise hurts your ears when you shave any part of your face or neck near your ears        </li>
            <li> I have struggled with sensitive skin with shaving ever since I began shaving.  </li>
            <li> This review is for the Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Rechargeable Linear Pivot Action Shaving System,Silver.  </li>
            <li> Problems are it is very noisy, leaves hair on the outside of the razor, and the travel case is a cloth bag.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m much happier with this.</li>
            <li> battery lasts a long time and the digital percentage guage tells me exactly how much battery I have left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I replaced an old Braun shaver with this one (Braun Series 3 340 Men&#x27;s Shaver) in May of 2011 and paid a premium price for it.</li>
            <li> I chose the Panasonic ES 8103s wet/dry shaver directly from Amazon for $79.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad after his old one (9 years old) quit working.  </li>
            <li> The old one had a stand that you dropped the shaver into.</li>
            <li> I replaced my old razor with this gem.</li>
            <li> if you are busy .  </li>
            <li> Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Rechargeable Linear Pivot Action Shaving System, Silver]].</li>
            <li> I used to get burns on some parts of my neck from the Norelco, and I thought it was just my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> But, I have no idea how much battery power is left.</li>
            <li> He is 88 years old and marvels at the close shave he gets from this...</li>
            <li> I have been pleasantly surprised with this razor.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s easily fixed by using the retractable trimmer.</li>
            <li> As for the shave, I have a medium beard and a sensitive neck.  </li>
            <li> I just bought another one for $59.00 instead of replacing the head set for $30.00 for the old shaver.</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin when shaving, using either an electric or manual blade...</li>
            <li> That being said I use this razor 2-3 times a week for nearly 1.5 years....</li>
            <li> This shaves nearly as close as a blade but with none of the irritation.</li>
            <li> If I had known that they had improved them this much I would have switched back years ago.  </li>
            <li> then my old Norelco did.</li>
            <li> Then tells me how much charge is left.</li>
            <li> He uses it frequently.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Panasonic uses stainless steel blades that are just sharper and last longer than Braun&#x27;s nickel blades.  </li>
            <li> I just assume using my old razor in the shower - one pass</li>
            <li> At 49 years old, I read the review of this unit on Consumer Reports and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I have not had this happen once so far with this shaver.</li>
            <li> An electric razor seemed to be faster and easier than my old Fusion blades.</li>
            <li> I am 61 years old.</li>
            <li> Wow....</li>
            <li> After 1st charge the shaver worked very well, but on the second charge the LCD display stopped working</li>
            <li> This is BY FAR the closest shave</li>
            <li> Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Rechargeable Linear Pivot Action Shaving System, Silver    </li>
            <li> I have resorted to using my old shaver to do this area.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had an electric shaver since I was 13 years old.  </li>
            <li> You really have to go back and forth a lot.  </li>
            <li> AND... with no irritation compared to my old shaver.    </li>
            <li> My old ES8047 gave up the ghost after about five years</li>
            <li> And as far as their stating it gets longer hairs, thats</li>
            <li> Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Rechargeable Linear Pivot Action Shaving System, Silver]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I like all the features on it so far.</li>
            <li> And as for &amp;#34;downstairs&amp;#34;, unless you are completely bald and want to keep it that way EVERY DAY, it does not work well either.</li>
            <li> He has since donated the old razor to a men&#x27;s shelter.</li>
            <li> The 5 year old Braun still outperforms it</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who has sensitive skin and/or razor bumps.</li>
            <li> Probably works find on skin that isn&#x27;t sensitive.</li>
            <li> I bought this one to keep in a suitcase for frequent trips.</li>
            <li> I especially like Panasonic prolducts, and this razor has held up very well.</li>
            <li> Like others who have reviewed this, I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> my skin is relatively sensitive (caramel in</li>
            <li> I can sit 20 mins in direct sunlight and get a noticable tan&lt;br</li>
            <li> Despite being using this shaver already a month, as manufacturer suggests, I still need at least 5x more time to shave with this, than with Gilette Mach 3 system.</li>
            <li> , if you are shaving with rasor blade, even don&#x27;t think about electronic shavers, do not waste your money and</li>
            <li> This razor gives closer shave than old shaver did for my husband.</li>
            <li> He has had no trouble with it and it works as well as the day it came out of the package.  </li>
            <li> Also shaves well by using a gentle daily cleanser.</li>
            <li> I replaced an old Panasonic with this one</li>
            <li> This shave 2-3 times faster than my old Braun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a middle-aged woman, replacing an old ladies&#x27; razor.  </li>
            <li> So far the Panasonic has exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> Complete convert to an electric razor now....</li>
            <li> Panasonic seems to put this as a secondary feature and it rarely shows the same kind of careful design as the rest of the shaver.  </li>
            <li> Really like the digital battery level indicator.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts several shaves and charges fast.</li>
            <li> It replaced a ten + year old remington electric 3 round head razor and it does a better job.</li>
            <li> Because the motor of this shaver IS SO LOUD</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin on my neck and nothing;</li>
            <li> I had an eight year old Braun shaver that refused to die.</li>
            <li> I can shave much faster now and the shave actually does approach that of a blade shaver.  </li>
            <li> I keep another old shaver around for trimming.</li>
            <li> Replaced a 7 year old linear Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve never received a really close shave especially under my chin/neck and mustache area.  </li>
            <li> I think my 9-year old shaver still works</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for 7-10 days, just like my old one.  </li>
            <li> I may purchase a blade set for my old model and use it for travel.</li>
            <li> It takes longer to shave than with my old &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; Panasonic razor.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, but I&#x27;ve had no &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; from this guy.  </li>
            <li> It is two years old now.</li>
            <li> and it comes in a very close second.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this razor doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> I got it to replace my old Panasonic shaver, which I had bought refurbished, that lasted almost a decade.  </li>
            <li> It gives you a really close shave and has the wet feature that allows for ease of cleaning and clearly shows how much charge is remaining.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Shaves really well and fairly quiet.</li>
            <li> (the old panasonic had it built in).</li>
            <li> (I have sensitive skin and this product didn&#x27;t cause any irritation.  </li>
            <li> I use my old Phillips for this purpose.   </li>
            <li> I bought this 2 months to replace my 2 year old Norelco rotary.</li>
            <li> My old Remington, while still running well, has never had a change of blades in 35 years.</li>
            <li> WOW what a shave.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised to find the shave as close as the blade.  </li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> actual shaving, however, leaves MUCH to be desired.</li>
            <li> I am finally retiring a 10-year-old Panasonic because its battery is not holding much charge.  </li>
            <li> VERY QUIET AND SHAVES FAST.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to shave quite as well as my old panasonic from years ago.</li>
            <li> The hubby loves it so far, no complaints.</li>
            <li> Especially at the price now, it is a REAL steal IMO.</li>
            <li> It died completely a week or so before the shaver croaked.</li>
            <li> It does have trouble with neck hair, though persistence will get the neck smooth.</li>
            <li> But it is by far the loudest razor I have ever used!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used my old one again</li>
            <li> The ES 8103 shaves even faster and closer than my old one.</li>
            <li> and it was ready to go for the next use.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skins and am a fussy customer when it comes to shavers.  </li>
            <li> I next planned to move onto the straight razor but realized I&#x27;d accidentally thrown the whole thing away with the shipping box because it was \\&quot;recycle your boxes\\&quot; week at my local garbage establishment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So if you rely on the trimmer, (like I did from my 4+ year old Braun)</li>
            <li> My old razor died and i bought this during the amazon sale for ~50 bucks.</li>
            <li> Then i have to use a old school razor to shave my jaw line and neck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used foil razors and needed a replacement for an old Braun series 5 model.</li>
            <li> and it really takes care of my daily grooming</li>
            <li> I have used it for nearly a week and it still has 70% charge.  </li>
            <li> This razor was rated highly in nearly every site that I researched.</li>
            <li> When it was time to replace my old one I went for the an upgrade</li>
            <li> I really like the digital read out showing % of charge remaining.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer has said, if you have sensitive skin this is the shave for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Just unpack it, plug in the detachable charging cord and when the digital display reads \\&quot;100%\\&quot; it is ready for use.  </li>
            <li> that I realized how worn out my old razor had become.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m upgrading from my 3 year old Norelco rotary type shaver.  </li>
            <li> Now there&#x27;s no need to retrieve the tiny brush, and the results are much cleaner.  </li>
            <li> Period.[[ASIN:B001DNE3KQ Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Rechargeable Linear Pivot Action Shaving System, Silver]]</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> I bought this for a 99 year old man.</li>
            <li> This razor is very well made and recharges is only one hour.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s too early to say.</li>
            <li> Once out of the box, I charged it up and got busy on my face.  </li>
            <li> Shaves smoother, lasts longer and tells me how much battery power is left!</li>
            <li> My primary method of shaving was \\&quot;old school\\&quot; double edge wet shaving with vintage razors.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a young guy and have always had an issue with irritated skin and ingrown hairs in the neck area.</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every multiblade razor on the market as well as learning to use old school DE razors (Merkur HD).</li>
            <li> Not knowing when it needs charging has led to a couple of times using the old fashioned method.</li>
            <li> the speed of the shaver is affected, then you are pressing far too much.&lt;br /&gt;Wash</li>
            <li> Gave it as a gift to 20 year old college son.  </li>
            <li> But so far no redness caused by it.</li>
            <li> i wash it under the tap water after use no issues so far.</li>
            <li> For my whole life I just used a traditional razor.</li>
            <li> My old Panasonic ES8018 shaver was about 15 years old and had never needed any repair.</li>
            <li> seem to accidentally hit the off button fairly frequently while shaving.</li>
            <li> no missed hairs like with my old Remington micro</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works well enough, don&#x27;t really have any complaints.</li>
            <li> , use the case from your old shaver.</li>
            <li> It was just getting old and needed to be replaced.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge very well, and has an indicator with the percent of charge left.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that it doesn&#x27;t get as close a shave as my old rotary shaver, but that&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t pull the hairs up to cut them.  </li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;re at 10% it doesn&#x27;t indicate any lower, but in my experience it will shave at least 5 more times after it reaches 10%.  </li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;re at 10% it doesn&#x27;t indicate any lower, but in my experience it will shave at least 5 more times after it reaches 10%.  </li>
            <li> Loud noise, makes you nervous.  </li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> NEARLY AS CLOSE A SHAVE</li>
            <li> Clean-up is fast and simple using soap and water.</li>
            <li> and you have to work to get it open, and then turn the whole shaver 180 degrees to use it.</li>
            <li> It was incredibly loud.  </li>
            <li> The motor isn&#x27;t too loud, but this is a shaver I can&#x27;t endorse.</li>
            <li> Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Rechargeable Linear Pivot Action Shaving System, Silver]]  </li>
            <li> Replaced my old Braun with the Panasonic razor based on Amazon reviews.  </li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t that noisy compared to my 20 year old Norelco HP1122 that died.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Update Dec 2016: I&#x27;ve been using this razor for nearly 4 years.</li>
            <li> This unit just died today and is now completely unusable.</li>
            <li> Replaces my 10 year old panasonic razor that still works,but I couldn&#x27;t pass up the price....</li>
            <li> My husbands sensitive skin shows no signs of irritation.  </li>
            <li> have been very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Louder then my 30 year old Norelco.</li>
            <li> So far, no complaints; it operates as described and he gets a close shave.</li>
            <li> He raved about the 3 blades and swivel action.</li>
            <li> What a difference over my old shaver.  </li>
            <li> This is the second one of this model that we have had and we bought it again because we like it so much.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic gives a very close,quick (2 minutes if I shave daily)</li>
            <li> so far I&#x27;m getting 10 shaves a charge.</li>
            <li> The old Remington</li>
            <li> really wish they had just left the trimmer alone.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 21 year old son.  </li>
            <li> I replaced a 3 year old philips rotary shaver with this model.  </li>
            <li> Only time will tell but I do not , at this time see any real faults.</li>
            <li> Bought to replace a 15 year old Panasonic that still functions but won&#x27;t hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> But that buzzing is still loud...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m 70 years old.</li>
            <li> its not as loud as my panasonic rotary shaver.</li>
            <li> I like it because his early morning shaves</li>
            <li> : It takes 15-20 passes on my neck to get anywhere near done.</li>
            <li> : If you have areas where you let the hair grow (goatee, mutton chops etc), the razor pulls the longer hairs when you try to shave near them.</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s loud.</li>
            <li> and I believe it to be of professional quality.</li>
            <li> do like the LED that tells you how much charge is left.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those guys who shaves with regular razors and gets cuts and really red/sore neck.  </li>
            <li> My old Braun was worn out.</li>
            <li> I used an electric razor early on...but then switched to a safety razor @~30.</li>
            <li> Fast charge that last all week.  </li>
            <li> Also, immediately noticed it was LOUD, who wants LOUD when just waking up in the morning (or anytime), next to my ears.  </li>
            <li> , Panasonic is much heavier and larger).  </li>
            <li> but this one just has the cord that you plug in directly to the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> i was very pleasantly surprised with this product.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my 87 year old father for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> I find it works very well in the back of my head</li>
            <li> , no matter how much I maneuver it, it always misses the same 3 or 4 hairs.</li>
            <li> It is very well made, solid and sounds like a quality shaver because it is....  </li>
            <li> Pertaining to the noise level, it&#x27;s a masculine razor.</li>
            <li> No coil-cord and old fashioned looking plug-charger.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic seems to require frequent recharging whereas the Norelco goes on and on.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my 10+ year old Braun 5414 electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> It shaved my sensitive skin without irritation and redness and it got every hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After nearly two years of use, this razor is still kicking it.</li>
            <li> I must add that I&#x27;m 78 years old.</li>
            <li> and I purchased 3 so far.</li>
            <li> At more than twice the price of the now discontinued Remington Titanium MS2 series shavers, I was hoping that this product could compete--at least match the level of closeness and efficiency</li>
            <li> The description lead me to believe that it was marked used because the box may have been damaged.</li>
            <li> It keeps its charge for a far shorter time than my Norelco.</li>
            <li> Old shaver lasted twice as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Nivea sensitive skin shave gel&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I bought this Panasonic shaver to replace an old Remington DA-307 shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the sensitive skin shaving gels and after shave lotions.  </li>
            <li> I know that electric razors are very dependent on each individual&#x27;s beard type.  </li>
            <li> With the Panasonic, I felt it provied a close enough shave that I didn&#x27;t need to use my straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning feature</li>
            <li> None so far.</li>
            <li> Please do stick with if converting from the old fashioned shave.</li>
            <li> But, that&#x27;s a lot of time and money to invest in a 5 year old razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are only two parts, really: the body (including the blade), and the foil.  </li>
            <li> Cheap, but not cheaply made.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> It has not been 30 days but so far, it works well but not as close as a blade razor.  </li>
            <li> use it in the shower with a bit of shaving gel and in few weeks that I have been using it my scin got noticeably smoother and free from razor burns and bumps.</li>
            <li> (loud, but not too loud)</li>
            <li> /&gt;The razor is quite noisy, compared to my old Norelcos, and doesn&#x27;t shave as close.  </li>
            <li> Sort of loud, so I have to leave my tent if I don&#x27;t want to wake anyone else up as I shave.</li>
            <li> One charge lasts a really long time, and it shaves pretty close</li>
            <li> Display allows you to see how much charge you have left.  </li>
            <li> My Remington is quite old and decided to purchase</li>
            <li> This shaver has far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Maybe my skin is that sensitive</li>
            <li> Andis 17010 Professional Profoil Rechargable Shaver (with Titanium Foils).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shaver is billed as a sensitive skin shaver and close shave.  </li>
            <li> prone 18-year old guy).</li>
            <li> (I attribute these to having sensitive skin and going through the adjustment stage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Loud.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave my upper lip/cheeks as close as I&#x27;d like, but it does shave my neck really close.</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut near as well as my Norelco did</li>
            <li> It has a digital display that goes in increments of 10, so you always know how much charge is left.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite loud.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ever tried so far.</li>
            <li> I have always owned Norelco, but my wife bought this Panasonic for Fathers Day (early gift).  </li>
            <li> I asked Santa for this shaver for Christmas and WOW.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it will continue to impress me (I am thinking it will), but so far I think that it is a winner.  </li>
            <li> I have stubborn Italian hair, and have to shave every day since my hair grows so freaky fast.</li>
            <li> Bought Philips for over 50 years, yes I am that old.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I really like this unit and would definitely recommend a Panasonic razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my husband, after his old electric shaver broke.</li>
            <li> Do not waste you money on this product.</li>
            <li> Soft touch on face and close shave.</li>
            <li> Early days were with Remington.</li>
            <li> The only unusual aspect is shaving the moustache area.</li>
            <li> Grandson 14 yrs old wanted a shaver for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 85 year old father in law and he likes it.  </li>
            <li> The LCD screen shows how much charge is left [i.e., 90%, 80, 70, etc.]</li>
            <li> Just after one year [when the warranty expired, naturally] the LCD screen started giving me problems.</li>
            <li> From an old U.S.Marine, oooh rah.</li>
            <li> Husband had to get out old faithful razor to remove spots shaver missed.  </li>
            <li> My wife bought this razor to replace her old Remington R845.</li>
            <li> Oh it is loud, but at 75 who is going to tell him.</li>
            <li> I ordered the replacement Foil and Blade Set just to have on hand, but the foil is not showing any signs of wear so far.  </li>
            <li> It lasts about 10 shaves per charge for me so far.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s quite loud and my cat freaked out when I turned it on.</li>
            <li> do like the fact that shaver tells you how much battery you have left.  </li>
            <li> It does not seem to shave as close as with a razor, but it&#x27;s close enough and is much easier</li>
            <li> For nearly 30 years I&#x27;ve used electric razors -</li>
            <li> This Panasonic is like a Maserati compared to my old shaver (a dump truck).</li>
            <li> Ive used it once so far</li>
            <li> However, if you have sensitive skin I would stray away from the 4 foil.</li>
            <li> I also switch back and forth from straight razors to electrics, depending on time and how close I want to shave.</li>
            <li> I have used it three times so far and have not felt any pulling or irritation while shaving.</li>
            <li> this razor let&#x27;s you know how much of a charge is left</li>
            <li> Improvement over my old rotary.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with a Panasonic ES8066 for the last zillion years and it has served me very well.  </li>
            <li> My bumps have completely cleared up in the three days</li>
            <li> I would recommend changing your shaving routine if you are still having problems, or have problems with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It works well in the shower or with a gel, and the shave is smoother than my rotary triple head - so far.</li>
            <li> Nor,apparently can the razor&lt;br /&gt;by run directly from the AC outlet then.</li>
            <li> This one is no different: they like it, well, as much as they like to shave.</li>
            <li> This razor surprised me.</li>
            <li> long hairs pretty well</li>
            <li> Holds charge well, needs only infrequent recharges, and recharges fast.  </li>
            <li> Not too loud as some have</li>
            <li> As instructed, you can wash it directly with tap water.</li>
            <li> This also doesn&#x27;t get anywhere near as close as a razor.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to start shaving the next time.</li>
            <li> just don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth the money if it only last 1 month or 2.</li>
            <li> Not only did it not get anywhere near all my facial hair (which was short, hadn&#x27;t shaved in 2 days prior), but it cut me up more than any razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> &gt; The Panasonic choice was made over the last year from reading reviews, but more so probably because of their heavy presence on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> , the charge lasts me three shaves or roughly a week&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t comment on its loudness, but my friend said this electric razor was much more quiet than the one he uses from a few years ago.</li>
            <li> battery last long also, like 9 full shaves.</li>
            <li> Con - Need wash after each wet shave; feels not as powerful as I imagined  </li>
            <li> Buying  anything more fancy  would be a total waste  of money.  </li>
            <li> I thought the cleaning unit was a good idea until I got it and realized that it was a waste of time and money, especially once I discovered wet shaving in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shaver is ok but slow.</li>
            <li> anymore good buy expensive disposable razors.</li>
            <li> It saved me a ton of money on disposable razor blades and helped me get a good shave without irritating my neck, which traditional disposables roughed up to the point of embarrassment.</li>
            <li> A few things I like and see improvements on, compared to my older model: it charges quickly; the motor is quieter; provides a closer shave; is lighter weight.</li>
            <li> It works good with shaving cream too, but the shave secret lotion seems to &#x27;hold&#x27; the blades to the surface with ease and get it extra close.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy an electric shaver, since they tend to be rather expensive, and I did not know how good they could be.  </li>
            <li> I did buy a 2-year protection since this is an expensive product, although I got an extremely good discount during the holidays.</li>
            <li> EXPENSIVE DAMNED THING that did not shave good.</li>
            <li> After using it for about a month I can say that its good but not perfect.</li>
            <li> hope my warranty is still good because it&#x27;s too expensive of a razor to not work after six months.</li>
            <li> This is far superior to expensive Brauns</li>
            <li> It has the features I need: 2 weeks worth of shaving on a single charge, quick 5 minute charge for a single shave, 1 hour total charge time, showerproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get a full seven shaves though, and there is no noticeable change in the rpms, even down to 20% charge.  </li>
            <li> But Where it is excellent in this it is very bad at finishing my whole face and neck.</li>
            <li> The shaving head is impressively comfortable, not aggressive on the skin, very useful for shaving difficult parts like under the chin or below the jaw.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the wiry, stiff, Asian kind of facial hair.  </li>
            <li> That plus the fact the foil has such ultra tiny holes in it (glides right over the stubble)</li>
            <li> but it actually shaves my neck a lot closer and the pop up trimmer is right on the back.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how much better this is than my old, noisy, heavy, hard to clean model.  </li>
            <li> Shaves MUCH closer and faster than previous razor and seems to hold a charge pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, I don&#x27;t need shaving cream for such minor touch up work.    </li>
            <li> I normally use it in the dry mode and it gives me a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> charges quick and last a long time.</li>
            <li> You can complete a full shave with less than 10% of the battery used.</li>
            <li> extreme satisfaction continued until about one year later, when I first became aware of a foul odor in and around the head of the shaver, and it&#x27;s plastic housing.</li>
            <li> Other than that and the fact that getting it completely clean is a little tough, it&#x27;s a great electric razor.</li>
            <li> The delivery was right on, as expected as well as the packaging.  </li>
            <li> They never really worked right.  </li>
            <li> If I let my hair, beard, and mustache grow out for a week, I need to use my Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System to trim back down to an easily shavable length.</li>
            <li> The first day I did a dry shave.</li>
            <li> I use this shaver dry, though I did try shaving with shaving cream when I first got it.</li>
            <li> I also used this as a dry shaver for my first time.</li>
            <li> First thing I did to test this one was to dry shave a 3 day growth.  </li>
            <li> The  first one was generallly used as a dry razor, and has lasted three years, with a replacement blade and foil at year one.</li>
            <li> And it recharges from 20% to full in less than 2 hours.  </li>
            <li> And it recharges from 20% to full in less than 2 hours.  </li>
            <li> At 20% charge, it takes less than an hour to get full speed.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I prefer the three round blade style better than this flat blade style.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t even get mad because he loved it so much</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get a full charge in under an hour but the machine dies after about half an hour into shaving.</li>
            <li> The older model is superior to the newer one in closeness of shave, and in the power of the cutting action.  </li>
            <li> I checked the price of a new one and it was almost the same as a new razor.</li>
            <li> This was bought to replace an old norelco electric razor and this one is so much better, it doesn&#x27;t pull your whiskers if they get a little too long.</li>
            <li> This was bought as a replacement for a solidly-built Panasonic which gave 10 years of service, but the new razor, unlike the one it replaces, has such a weak motor that I thought it was some kind of mislabeled toy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much quieter than my old razor (not a fair comparison, though, I&#x27;m sure Braun has also improved over the last 10 years).</li>
            <li> The Customer service is basically non existent: the attached beard trimmer (which worked more for trimming longer hairs before shaving than actually making lines) broke off several &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; around 6 months in and filed a warranty claim to panasonic through their website as it left my face with some long scratches and received no response.</li>
            <li> Have bought many different electric razors in the past 20 years and would always go back to a straight razor because of the quality of the shaves.</li>
            <li> This is my first Panasonic shaver and as long as they build them with high RPM motors it won&#x27;t be my last.</li>
            <li> A good shaver, but replacement blades are very poor quality.</li>
            <li> to clean, it provides the usage remaining, and a little protective cover and travel bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shaves very tight and I don&#x27;t have to go over the same spots more than twice.  </li>
            <li> No matter how many times I go over it, or hold it very tight to my skin, it will simply not cut these longer thicker hair/</li>
            <li> Though the power drop down by 10% after using for 2 or 3 times, it can charge itself quickly.</li>
            <li> Four and a half years later, and it&#x27;s still going strong (bought in May 2010).  </li>
            <li> Panasonic really lost points with me when they switched to the current charger and cord, a major step backwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shaves as close as a razor and shaving cream, with no mess or cuts.    </li>
            <li> The first was with the most facial hair and it did quite poorly.</li>
            <li> No mess after the shave.collects all the hair in itself.  </li>
            <li> So in other words this warranty isn&#x27;t worth the paper</li>
            <li> The newer ES8103 shaver is more comfortable to use largely due to the pivot action, the blade action is much faster (although it doesn&#x27;t reduce my shaving time appreciably), the battery lasts about twice as long per charge, doesn&#x27;t slow down as it discharges, and recharges in a much shorter time.  </li>
            <li> If I could go 4.5 stars, I would have, but I just couldn&#x27;t go 5, due to the fact that I think the old Remington did a closer shave, and after all, that&#x27;s what a shaver is for, right?    </li>
            <li> so maybe it&#x27;s just illusory and (3) other reviewers are right, this thing is noticeably louder than my old Panasonics.  </li>
            <li> We all put up with lot&#x27;s worse for less results so this shaver is absolutely a keeper and at this price I am thinking that it will make a great present for others.</li>
            <li> The initial break in period was the hardest since my beard grows back very fast.</li>
            <li> Second, the motor is very quiet and, as is advertised, appears to move very fast, allowing for a pull-free shave.  </li>
            <li> The motor does not seem as strong and the body seems a little cheaper, but for a third the price of the old unit I didn&#x27;t expect perfection.  </li>
            <li> I replaced a Braun which was ok, but didn&#x27;t give the same shave quality the same as the charge ran down.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather just buy the blades, get it done right the first time without red, raw, painful skin, and a short shave that is successful the very first time.</li>
            <li> Some parts of the face can get a little tricky specially the neck area, below the sideburns and under the lip leading to the increased shave time.</li>
            <li> No issues with the charger, no issues with the digital display, nothing.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is that it isn&#x27;t as easy to clean as advertised (and certainly not self-cleaning, especially if you try wet shaving with it).&lt;br /&gt;By</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re poor like me, you&#x27;ve probably purchased many cheap electric shavers that were $20-$30 or less.</li>
            <li> Overall would say it isn&#x27;t much better than my Panasonic cheaper razor, only slightly.</li>
            <li> The flip up trimer is small but seems to do a fine job.</li>
            <li> The wet shaving with regular shaving creme is easy on the skin and close enough.</li>
            <li> the messy clean up defeats the purpose of electric shavers.</li>
            <li> After about 15 to 20 minutes of working on my face (which had just a few days of growth), I was almost clean shaven.</li>
            <li> It is a breeze to clean, dont waste your money on the self cleaner.</li>
            <li> Razors aren&#x27;t my thing and for my job i have to be clean shaved everyday...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m truly glad I did, and encourage those looking to switch from blades to an electric razor to give the ES8103s serious consideration.    </li>
            <li> get the automatic cleaning stand, messy to clean with soap and turbo mode.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have only used it dry, and it may be that it works better wet, but I would expect it to shave well in either mode.</li>
            <li> But I like to clean mine everyday</li>
            <li> With my old turkey neck, it would be impossible to get a closer or more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Not only has it given me a closer, smoother shave with easy clean-up of the razor between shavings, but its motor is quieter than I had expected and it holds a charge for several weeks.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve always had trouble getting an electric to pick them up cleanly.</li>
            <li> Excessive pressure won&#x27;t necessarily yield a better shave)&lt;br /&gt;-Blades</li>
            <li> Overall, I like this razor a lot, particularly for the price.    </li>
            <li> So, I alternate between them hoping to extend the life of the older device.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic definitely outperforms my rotery, although it&#x27;s an older model.</li>
            <li> (The ES8109 is exactly the same shaver as the ES8103, but includes the automatic cleaner, which stopped functioning several years ago).  </li>
            <li> While it works fine as a dry shaver, I am appreciating the ability to shave with a wet soapy face.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older Panasonic shaver, which mysteriously died on a trip to Europe.</li>
            <li> (so do I, less hair in my sink)and that it recharges quickly.</li>
            <li> Quickly  -Used less than 10 percent of a charge to shave.  </li>
            <li> Wet dry and charges so quickly!</li>
            <li> Completely dry it gives a decent shave which is very uniform over the entire face, but it takes several passes to get a reasonably close shave.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the charger cord would no longer make a consistent connection which kept me from being able to charge the shaver.  </li>
            <li> This was the second one that I purchased, bought my first one back in 2011 which lasted me through college.</li>
            <li> It is relatively quiet when compared to the older Remington I had.</li>
            <li> This was never a problem with my older Panasonic, but it&#x27;s a big problem with this one.  </li>
            <li> He had never used an electric shaver (&amp;#34;You can only get a decent shave with a razor blade&amp;#34; were his thoughts and opinion for all of those years).  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic&#x27;s battery also does not last as long, but I can get a week&#x27;s worth of shaves between chargings.</li>
            <li> I went back to a Gillette razor, which really does give you a closer shave--but just barely closer.</li>
            <li> Having to go over the same spots countless times as the razor got hot and irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> I am an older guy who always had facial hair and</li>
            <li> I have used an electric shaver from another manufacturer through many different models over the past 55 years.</li>
            <li> The ES8103S takes the same time to shave as the older Panasonic shaver that I was replacing.</li>
            <li> It saves me the hassle of using a traditional blade and seems to be of decent quality for the price.</li>
            <li> While others have commented that its required back-and-forth motion for shaving makes it harder to shave their necks, I have found just the opposite to be true.  </li>
            <li> It provides for a realistic shave compared to a razor cut and gets closer around and above the lips.</li>
            <li> and it definitely shaves closer than my older Braun (mid-level price)</li>
            <li> first electric razor after trying many razors from disposable to expensive.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted several years even after being dropped numerous times.  </li>
            <li> It does not fully shave my facial hair, which I usually grow up to a quarter an inch at the most.</li>
            <li> I feel it pulling as it cuts, particularly on the upper lip area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several shavers and s;pent a lot of money trying to find a decent shaver for my son.  </li>
            <li> The fact that it is small and inanimate are the only things that prevent me from making love to this shaver.</li>
            <li> if i could find the older one, i&#x27;d definitely buy that instead.</li>
            <li> I got a shave pretty much equal to what I get with my double edge safety razor!&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> After I&#x27;m done carving away my face with the back razor, I switch to the main one:</li>
            <li> I need multiple passes, particularly over my lip, but it does the job.  </li>
            <li> This was a present for my son in law, though I have the exact same model.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m satisfied with this shaver because I have owned several foil shavers in the past</li>
            <li> It also recharges really quickly, so if you&#x27;ve forgotten to charge it just before a week-long trip, half an hour will do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also charges quickly and the charge lasts a week and a half.</li>
            <li> Dry shaving seemed fine until I used the wet shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> or it&#x27;s something about this particular model, but it&#x27;s definitely not the closest shave</li>
            <li> On your first, second, and third shave will give your face a tingling sensation.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-I don&#x27;t mind the higher pitch hum at all, definitely not noisy enough to complain</li>
            <li> I end up using a straight razor to get the 2 inches below my sideburns straight and clean every time since this is very poor at shaving in this area in particular.  </li>
            <li> I end up using a straight razor to get the 2 inches below my sideburns straight and clean every time since this is very poor at shaving in this area in particular.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t do that great a job shaving my face, especially the long hairs on my neck and those high on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> At 10%, the indicator seems to last twice, possibly more, as long as at any other level.</li>
            <li> After several weeks of use I found that the razor head consistently gave a \\&quot;razor burn feeling\\&quot;, did not cut flat laying wiskers well, seemed to lack power, and did not shave as well as my well worn out old braun.</li>
            <li> No other issues with this product so far.</li>
            <li> This is my second Panasonic shaver to purchase because my first shaver was taken by my husband, who likes it so much he has trashed his other razors.</li>
            <li> I keep a closely trimmed, lined out beard, and this razor actually lets me keep a sharp and clean trim line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other electric shaves and have always had to clean up problem areas with a regular razor.  </li>
            <li> I have a tough beard and very sensitive skin, so blades don&#x27;t work, and most dry-only</li>
            <li> If the other reviews are right, we have nothing to worry about.</li>
            <li> I looked at the new Arc 4 options for Panasonic, and while they have good reviews, I found out that the replacement blades were very expensive, and didn&#x27;t make a large enough difference in the shave to warrant the price.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this shaver, I was hoping to shave my head and face at the same time in the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched high and low and read all of the reviews that I could find.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this razor, especially if you&#x27;ve been shaving with an electric razor</li>
            <li> Someone said it would last for two weeks, but I highly doubt that.</li>
            <li> Someone said it would last for two weeks, but I highly doubt that.</li>
            <li> The high pinch noise is noticeable, especially comparing with Norelco.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s overall a really high quality product that I plan on keeping and using for years to come.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver especially at this price.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using it in the shower with The Total Shaving Solution oil too.</li>
            <li> The low quality does not match the high price.</li>
            <li> which was very gentle and could get wet.</li>
            <li> 4 stars, only negative to me so far is that I cant seem to get a straight line shave precise just under my side burns..</li>
            <li> The areas that were more difficult to shave, especially under the neck and along the jaw line back my ears take forever to come smooth</li>
            <li> built.&lt;br /&gt;I must say though that my $40.00 triple foil Remington shaved much faster and easier.&lt;br /&gt;The third cutter probably helped on the old one, but this shaver labors through my beard where the old one glided.&lt;br /&gt;Battery only lasts about 6 or 7 shaves also.</li>
            <li> It really cuts deep and the battery last pretty long.</li>
            <li> His brother has an identical one and highly recommended that I buy the same for my husband.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various shavers for years and when my old Braun needed a new foil and cutter</li>
            <li> I had an old Braun that finally just died and was in need of a new electric razor.  </li>
            <li> In anticipation of the new razor arriving, I skipped shaving for three days to give it a proper test against my old razor.</li>
            <li> a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still later:  I told the company that I was dismayed by the early death of my shaver.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t want to go back to the old way for anything, except maybe permanent hair removal!!</li>
            <li> This shaver provides a comfortable and close shave reliably, with very little maintenance.  </li>
            <li> The bright side to that negative is that it is fully charged in less than an hour.</li>
            <li> - Fast, took less than 3min to shave my whole face   </li>
            <li> dry, wet, light shave oil</li>
            <li> Sensitive skin and thick, strong beard.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The high ratings led me to purchase this, more expensive razor over, say, the $30 ones I normally buy.</li>
            <li> and I kept it going with new batteries and old parts, but the screens were becoming very hard to find.</li>
            <li> It charges very quickly, and has a small digital window on the front telling you how much charge is left.</li>
            <li> , single blade, heavy vibrate, 8 hour charge and most of all.......</li>
            <li> A very smooth shave even in the hard to get places such as under the chin and at the jaw line.</li>
            <li> One in the car, one older one for initial cut, one new one for final pass.  </li>
            <li> The display will say 10% for weeks, so not sure how accurate that is.  </li>
            <li> comfortably in any direction (Moving a razor sideways usually meant 2 days of cleaning blood from my face.</li>
            <li> It tells you how much life it has lteft, so no unexpected shut downs.</li>
            <li> One charge is enough for 4-5 shaves (far from 10-13 they advertise), but it&#x27;s not a big deal, since battery charges in under 1h (I don&#x27;t know if the fast charge is going to kill battery faster).    </li>
            <li> It requires an esoteric level of technique for anything more arduous than a couple of stray hairs.</li>
            <li> * Cuts the long hairs as very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Did not like closeness of electrics in the past, even though I have light beard.</li>
            <li> My old shaver just had colored lights and would sometimes stop in the middle of a shave when it still had a green light.  </li>
            <li> To me, it&#x27;s not annoyingly loud so, the noise is really a non issue.  </li>
            <li> I have the most trouble getting hairs near the corners of her mouth and under her chin where her skin is very loose.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it does not give a very close shave; my old one did better.</li>
            <li> however, it is much lighter and thus feels a bit cheaper; not saying that&#x27;s the case, but we&#x27;ll see how long this one lasts.</li>
            <li> I guess it depends on how long your shaves are really.</li>
            <li> I generally need to recharge every 10 days vs. 14 days with my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> general note if you have sensitive skin or allergies:&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The first shaver I&#x27;ve ever had which I am allowed to get wet.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to normal razors.</li>
            <li> I use it as a wet shave with Zirh shaving gel and rinse the electric razor with hot water every now</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I have a pretty rough beard and have dreaded shaving for years.</li>
            <li> How can it charge so quickly, last so long, look so cool but pull out my facial hair like tweezers?!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lastly, the noise level of this razor is normal, it&#x27;s no louder than a Braun, Remington or Norelco.....</li>
            <li> Being my first experience with a wet razor</li>
            <li> Ten days of using it everyday have only made me like it more.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty rough on the unit, keeping it in the shower, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the first electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used, but have been curious about getting one for quite some time.</li>
            <li> I scoffed at first about the wet shave</li>
            <li> I normally shave with a Braun Series 3 Model 8985, which is a terrific shaver.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what was described and expected.</li>
            <li> Now I checked first on using this wet with bar soap lathered up.</li>
            <li> But that is what these reviews are for, full disclosure to help other potential consumers make an informed choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> wish I could stop there and say this Shaver lives up to its other reviews, but it simply doesn&#x27;t shave close enough and requires many passes over the same area to get an acceptable cut.  </li>
            <li> Comparing these 3, the Panasonic is the best one for me as I have lots of neck hairs that were very difficult to be shaved with the SHARP or even with the Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> The battery is pretty solid, a full charge gets me at least 4 shaves or so.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the first two weeks I shaved wet with shaving gel.  </li>
            <li> MY ONLY SURPRISE IS THE LOUDER THAN NORMAL OPERATING VOLUME.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts about 2 weeks with normal use and only takes about an hour to charge.  </li>
            <li> Now, at fifteen months, the razor is completely dead, and will not even turn on after a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After six months of use, a part inside shook loose and now it buzzes loudly and the whole unit shakes in my hand.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that the charging indicator isn&#x27;t very accurate.  </li>
            <li> you will definitely need to go over the same spot a few times if you want a super close shave (true with all electrics), but the irritation is minimal to non-existent, even with very sensitive skin like I have.  </li>
            <li> The short ones it gets clean, but leaves the longer ones, meaning you have to go back over the same area several times.  </li>
            <li> It is not efficient and you must spend so much time going the same spot back and forth until you get a clean shave, but you&#x27;ll destroy your skin this way!&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Still, it is worth that small inconvenience since it gives such a great shave -- and I do mean as well as when I wet shave with a blade.</li>
            <li> It provides a close, clean shave, at least for my normal beard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product very steadily for a few weeks, and I really regret purchasing this Panasonic electric razor.</li>
            <li> Used to get a week&#x27;s worth of shaving on a charge, and now it&#x27;s down to 2 days (3</li>
            <li> Charging lasts for about a week worth saves, recharge when it gets down to 30%.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However and having used several of these in the last 16 years, I wish they use metal instead of plastic for certain parts that are visible.  </li>
            <li> Expected a little more then what it does.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d only recommend using it with shave cream, even the cheap stuff, just to give it a little lubrication and get as close as it can.</li>
            <li> Easy to cut skin if you push a bit too hard.</li>
            <li> I have used different electric razors through the years and this is the first that I have used that gave me a very close shave on 3 days growth in half the time of others.  </li>
            <li> Easy to maneuver into the hard to reach areas of the face and jaw.</li>
            <li> It may last 5 or 10 years if you&#x27;re lucky enough to have replacement parts that long</li>
            <li> It runs a long time on a single charge and recharges quickly.</li>
            <li> but it is hands down better than any of the others I have owned (all other major brands).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effortless to use, even with tough facial hair like my own.</li>
            <li> It is small but yet very powerful.  </li>
            <li> The charger/converter section measures about 2 cm wide x 6 cm long x 6.5 cm deep, which seems smaller than most.  </li>
            <li> Satisfied with the product thus far with one exception, the screen is too small and does not give me a close shave unless I go over the same area numerous times.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic makes lots of shavers and are less costly than most of the other +$100 shavers out there.  </li>
            <li> It did a much better job on my tough facial hair, but left razor burn on my neck, to the point I could only shave every other day at most.</li>
            <li> The other style with 3 circular blades covers so much more of your face at once and shaving takes half the time.  </li>
            <li> The extreme speed of the motor and the quick, close shave are totally unlike any shaver that I have used before.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I have to go over an area many times, but only once or twice if I stretch the skin (hard to do without a mirror in the shower).  </li>
            <li> This is the second Panasonic shaver I&#x27;ve purchased (first was several years ago -- they last a long time) and this brand beats others I&#x27;ve tried by a large margin.</li>
            <li> Requires lots of skin streching and passes back and forth over the same area to get down to a decent stubble.&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended for a QUICK touch-up and go.</li>
            <li> I just think it is harder to shave without a mirror - takes longer, more damage to your face by going over spots multiple times due to not seeing what you must shave.</li>
            <li> am not aware of any cons, but i own it only a few weeks...</li>
            <li> About 10 days later a brand new replacement shaver showed up on the doorstep.</li>
            <li> after years of virtually daily use, I think this needs a new foil block.  </li>
            <li> I finally decided to bite the bullet and purchase a new razor.</li>
            <li> When the battery finally went south, I started looking on Amazon for a new one.  </li>
            <li> it says in the manual if you ever lose it the only way to get a replacement is to throw away your shaver and buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product if your looking for a new electric razor.</li>
            <li> I hope I feel this way for next 1-3-5 years with this shaver (of course with new razors from time to time).</li>
            <li> My current one needed new blades and screen and the battery was going as was the motor.  </li>
            <li> new 3-blade ES8103S shaves almost as well as the 4-blade ES8243A, but without the extra weight and bulk.</li>
            <li> My prior shaver was a Panasonic ES4025 model, and it is this shaver that I will be comparing to my new Panasonic ES8103 model.  </li>
            <li> But their recent price spikes into the stratosphere led me to venture out to new brands.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase (brand new) of this model...</li>
            <li> The display on the razor started going out two months before the warranty went out, so I sent it back to Panasonic and they sent me a new razor.</li>
            <li> only plus I can give to new users</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions on proper handling, care and shaving technique in order to allow my face the recommended 30 days to get used to the new shaving technique.</li>
            <li> This panasonic last 3 years or so before it needs new heads, gives a close shave and never caused me a rash, etc.</li>
            <li> So my ultimate solution is to buy a new cartridge for my braun and continue using it and donating this guy to the salvation army.</li>
            <li> I had been using the ES7103S shaver for years and decided not to buy new blades or foil, since the battery was only holding about a 3-shave charge.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it to everyone looking for a new shaver.</li>
            <li> I just bought a new one because it was a daily deal that I couldn&#x27;t pass</li>
            <li> I had the razor for several years and it was about time for a new one</li>
            <li> I am still new to using this devise but like the fact that I can shave wet/dry and daily.</li>
            <li> i keep buying the same one when I need  a new shaver.</li>
            <li> new shaver has performed well, and with several swipes, produces a shave that feels almost blade-like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to anybody looking for a new electric razor.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I was dissapointed about was that it doesn&#x27;t shave any closer as my braun [when it was new].</li>
            <li> This new one does not give me as close a shave as I would like, even though I have given it 30 days and used only that razor, just panasonic instructed.</li>
            <li> If you are just starting new to use an electric shaver it will take 3 to 4 weeks for your beard to  get use to an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Even though I have small hands, there is enough tapering in the middle that it is very comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> My husband likes this very much and he says it holds a charge a lot longer than other electric shavers that he has owned.</li>
            <li> I love Amazon, never had a bad product and always the shipping is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It is quiet, does a great job cutting my beard.</li>
            <li> The battery on my current Norelco (8845xl) isn&#x27;t holding a charge any more and the current crop of mid range ($75 or less)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a far better razor and less than half the price of the Braun, I can&#x27;t recommend a razor with defective electronics.  </li>
            <li> it will let you get a close wet shave in half the time and leaves your skin without irritation or bumps, the name Cremo shaving cream, is not cheap but for me is a great product, it says that one tube will last for 90 days, that I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> I use it dry and it gives me a fast, close shave.</li>
            <li> Does a very neat close shave, both with lather, or dry with a shaving powder.</li>
            <li> It was a very close shave, but often left me with razor burn, so for years, I used it occasionally.  </li>
            <li> I have to go over some spots a few times to be smooth but a tiny bit of stubble does not bother me...</li>
            <li> The first week I used it, I had only minor irritation, nothing severe.    </li>
            <li> and I only have to charge it every few weeks with light use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, but heavy enough to feel like a quality</li>
            <li> I have fairly firm facial hair, but relatively smooth skin.</li>
            <li> The battery life lasts pretty long even though there&#x27;s only 1 lithium battery inside of it, but i guess that&#x27;s all it needs for days.  </li>
            <li> I especially like that it tells you how much battery charge is left.</li>
            <li> He has a heavy beard and this left his face baby smooth.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic is TERREFIC..and the price was at least 20% better than local retailers.  </li>
            <li> Getting a reasonably close shave takes time and multiple passes over the same areas, unlike a blade where two passes (one \\&quot;with the grain\\&quot; and one \\&quot;against the grain\\&quot;) produces a truly close shave.  </li>
            <li> I developed moderate adult acne &amp; shaving</li>
            <li> I had to go over it so much that it left me with tiny bleeding spots all over my scalp.</li>
            <li> I should note that I have a relatively light beard, so those with heavy beards might want to look for a review of this product by users with similar features.  </li>
            <li> shave after the shower, when your face has dried just enough for the shaver to run smoothly over the face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough to use on the bikini area, underarms, back of the neck</li>
            <li> The wet/dry feature is useful for cleaning, though I can&#x27;t figure out why anyone would want to actually shave with a wet face.  </li>
            <li> All things considered a reasonable basic shaver that performs the basic function of removing whiskers well.  </li>
            <li> Also, compared to Norelco it was much larger in the hand and overall and much heavier.</li>
            <li> One the plus side, one long shave seem to only use 10% of my first charge.  </li>
            <li> First it is very noisy with  excessive vibration</li>
            <li> but it does not cut nearly as close as my old basic Braun.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before ES8103S, I had a Braun 7 series shaver which I think was one of the most expensive shavers at that time and cost twice as much as ES8103S.</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews and purchased this hoping to finally find an electric razer that would actually work like a straight edge.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t even want to waste to much time with this review.</li>
            <li> The price was less than one year&#x27;s worth of Fusion replacement cartridges.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was a discontinuted plug style, so I wasn&#x27;t able to find a replacement at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read the reviews, which looked pretty good, but I&#x27;m disappointed.  </li>
            <li> a few minutes is all you need if you want a quick shave and do not want to wait.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also an option to plug it in for about 5 minutes if the battery&#x27;s dead and you need a quick shave.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s harder to get equally good results on my chin and just under my nose - a bit frustrating  </li>
            <li> but I use the outliner for any heavy duty detail work, it&#x27;s adequate in a pinch.</li>
            <li> For thick stubbles try a wet shave with foam and warm water.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little low - good for probably a week long business trip (shaving every day) or perhaps a two-week vacation (shaving less frequently).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little low - good for probably a week long business trip (shaving every day) or perhaps a two-week vacation (shaving less frequently).</li>
            <li> This shaves almost as close as a razor (big compliment) but is more work and takes a little too long for me.</li>
            <li> First, if you shave with it regularly (every other day at least), shaving is extremely fast, clean, and painless.</li>
            <li> minor downside is the cover comes off a little too easily.</li>
            <li> I was actually very surprised at how quiet it was compared to the one it replaced.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have a constant rash on my neck from shaving.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and to boot I not only shave my face but my head as well.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and very coarse hair.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m not being lazy and make time to share every day, this is a lot quicker than a razor because I can shave my entire face, clean it, half my head, clean it, and then finish up, whereas a bladed razor needs to be cleaned after</li>
            <li> and I noticed very little difference, if anything, but the dry was slightly better for me.&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li> Very loud and doesn&#x27;t cut as smooth as my previous Panasonic that I bought for $29.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the battery doesn&#x27;t last as long either.</li>
            <li> It took some work the first time due to not being used to a electric razor and my face being used to a blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I know other people would probably say it gets hot.  </li>
            <li> This shaver works well, but there is one major flaw - While charging you can NOT use the shaver.</li>
            <li> life seems a bit weak after one shave&lt;br /&gt;should be able to shave while charging</li>
            <li> The blade is small enough to get into that area, but the electric is more convenient (especially when traveling).  </li>
            <li> After trying just about every major brand of shaver I bought this Panasonic and was amazed to find how well it performed.  </li>
            <li> No regrets!  </li>
            <li> My other Panasonic is a higher end model that came with an automatic cleaning system as well, but I find this razor works just as well</li>
            <li> This little guy works well, as I said, it&#x27;s better, lighter and quieter than my other foil shaver.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only a 72 year old man who has been shaving for almost 60 years!</li>
            <li> I hope it has the durability to last me a long time, because so far I really dig this purchase;</li>
            <li> the first one for myself, the other two for my father and step-father...</li>
            <li> I bought my first one over 20 years ago and won&#x27;t use any other brand.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t line up my goatee with it without major effort.  </li>
            <li> (about 10-15 minutes in total, usually), and requires me to go over the same spots many times.  </li>
            <li> I have had no other complaints with the quality of the device.</li>
            <li> But even then, it seems to cut exactly at the surface and seemingly lacks the \\&quot;lift and pull\\&quot; technology in use by almost every other manufacturer, which cuts the whisker below the surface.</li>
            <li> The switch was a major hassle too as you had to push it 10 times and hope it stayed on once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve taken up using lectric shave for first pass, then lathering up for second, to get an actual close shave i need to go back over with a razor still though.</li>
            <li> No other maintenance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And this is true for the new one, but the battery loses charge while being idle at the rate 10-20% per week.</li>
            <li> The first was stolen and I&#x27;ve missed it everyday until the new one arrived.</li>
            <li> So far he has had no complaints other than the replacement coil costing almost as much as a new shaver (we opted for a new shaver).  </li>
            <li> Even though you can use this in the shower I do not because the hot water runs low by the time I shower and shave plus dry shaving</li>
            <li> Easy to charge and even has a small orange display that provides the current power percentage.  </li>
            <li> and it is cool that it can work wet or dry.</li>
            <li> My old one had no such indicator, and you only knew how much charge was left by the motor slowing down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On a one day old beard its fantastic, on a two day old beard you will find some straggler hairs it did not cut, and a three day old beard is worse.</li>
            <li> I typically shave right after I shower.  </li>
            <li> From day one the new shaver (Panasonic ES8 103S) failed to provide a reasonably close or comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Usually I shave with the blade and then clean up my face with this razor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just big enough that you don&#x27;t have to go over too much ground, and yet it&#x27;s small enough to comfortably maneuver around the cut of your chin and under your mustache.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s a wet dry I can lather up wet me face and use it on the go mostly.</li>
            <li> I have moderately thick, fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Can the cheap plastic vibration link really transmit sufficient ultrasonic energy through to the razor head to the point where it actually cleans, rather than just buzzing weakly?</li>
            <li> Before I leave the house I spend about 10 minutes with this powerful little guy</li>
            <li> I owned a Remington few years back, but quit using it because it was a pain to clean and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had shavers at less than half the cost that worked much better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s main drawback was that it tended to go through a couple of sets of blades a year, as I shave daily, and have a fairly coarse beard.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping for something that would work better on really tough beards.</li>
            <li> This razor is quick and can be used wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I used to shave with a straight razor, but after I had a few strokes my hand was not so steady.</li>
            <li> If there is a newer version of this model, you might give it a look, but I can tell you it would be tough to top this model for the price.</li>
            <li> I also like the floating head, which can be locked for those who need to apply more pressure for a tough beard.</li>
            <li> Charging is really quick, and works well dry or wet.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it continues to preform at this high level for a long time.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve purchased a Braun instead based on reviews of long life and high reliability.</li>
            <li> I have to stretch my skin around more than I expected I would, and a couple hairs don&#x27;t get cut at all if they are laying down completely flat.</li>
            <li> Nothing but a cheap cloth bag to store it in, needs hard case to protect it.</li>
            <li> so I had to adjust to the light touch of the razor and not push it too hard as I shave.  </li>
            <li> Shaving up on the face got me really smooth, but it was hard on my skin, and shaving up on my neck was not an option.  </li>
            <li> The size is right, the blades stay sharp and it stays solid while in use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am not sure If this is the right product for me!</li>
            <li> The motor is very fast, quiet and produces minimal vibration.</li>
            <li> The blades seem like they are just becoming less sharp now.</li>
            <li> I can shave dry, wet, or with shaving cream and any way I choose this is better on my skin than any other razor I have ever owned.    </li>
            <li> I am very happy with the purchase at present.lowed to run while plugged in (as the recharger is in the outlet plug to the wall socket and other, less expensive brands/models do so).  </li>
            <li> Both provided an equally smooth shave with the same level of tugging and skin irritation which was very little.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s certainly much better than rotaries I&#x27;ve owned, and my only small complaint is that it seems to need recharging a little more frequently than some others.  </li>
            <li> The only real benefits of this razor are it makes less of a mess than regular shaving and can give a decent shave quickly in the morning.</li>
            <li> Yet, to my fingertips at least, it&#x27;s a close and smooth shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A friend bought another product much more cheaply and complained that it worked poorly.</li>
            <li> Electric razors in general just do not shave as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li> The cost is generally $35-$50/face session.</li>
            <li> The primary negative is the time it takes.</li>
            <li> That is important, since you need to know when to recharge this shaver, and it uses up at least 10% of the charge with each shave.  </li>
            <li> I generally split the difference and replace everything at 18 months.</li>
            <li> I like blade-close shaves, and electrics never worked for me, generally making my face feel as though it had suffered a bird stampede.</li>
            <li> It holds its charge well and clearly shows what percentage is left.</li>
            <li> Like my legs, it usually requires multiple passes and directions to get the skin to feel smooth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was a Braun person for years before trying this Panasonic unit, and generally I&#x27;ve always had good luck with Panasonic products, so have been unhappy with my experience on this shaver.  </li>
            <li> Long battery life (about 10 days), but you have to run the razor from different directions to get a reasonably close shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 70 years old and had Norelco&#x27;s and could not get the soft grey whiskers to cut.  </li>
            <li> it, but it&#x27;s clear they just gave you a refurb as my units were definitely not mine (they had distinguishing marks).</li>
            <li> Years ago I had a Norelco which barely produced an acceptable shave.</li>
            <li> I would not really recommend this product, maybe to someone who wants a starter or a travel razor.</li>
            <li> My old Panasonic razors simply had bars that indicated the charge remaining.</li>
            <li> loud, I had to go over the same areas again and again</li>
            <li> It takes several passes to completely shave this area.</li>
            <li> Last was Norelco with the 3 rotating heads (about a 5-year old product).  </li>
            <li> But if you shave wet with shaving cream or soap you get a much closer shave.  </li>
            <li> Charger cord - I prefer the old style cords that are curled, can stretch, and simply plug in to the wall without a converter.  </li>
            <li> I have NO REGRETS in purchasing this model.  </li>
            <li> (so far they&#x27;ve always come back eventually).</li>
            <li> No regrets.</li>
            <li> Apparently I just can&#x27;t use an electric razor.</li>
            <li> Even on my wedding day, a professional barber left rash, and that man was a master.  </li>
            <li> I can barely feel it gliding over my skin.  </li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t think I would ever pay near list price for it, at the recent Amazon deal, it was a bargain.  </li>
            <li> I had finally settled on a Remington electric razor that I have been using for nearly 10 years.</li>
            <li> needed to replace my old Braun shaver which was totally worn</li>
            <li> I realize now that the only review you can really trust on shavers is from a dude who has the same beard as you, and the same skin sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I have coarse whiskers, but it doesn&#x27;t even come close to shaving as well as the old lower-end Braun that this unit was intended to replace.  </li>
            <li> I have used Braun for years and was a devote user until my last Braun shaver (3 years old)</li>
            <li> With the Braun prices going up and the quality of the Braun razors apparently going south, I decided to switch brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 100% recommendation for this product, especially given the rather modest price.</li>
            <li> It has a digital display near the on/off button for the battery strength.</li>
            <li> and I like the battery level display which allows you to judge whether or not there&#x27;s a complete shave left in the battery.</li>
            <li> Been buying the same model for over 15 years, have had 3 so far.</li>
            <li> With the extended life, I have to change my economics from above - the razors have averaged a 2 years plus lifespan; and, the economics are far in the favor of the Panasonic vs.</li>
            <li> With the extended life, I have to change my economics from above - the razors have averaged a 2 years plus lifespan; and, the economics are far in the favor of the Panasonic vs.</li>
            <li> model is smaller,  softer and lighter than old model.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Only have to charge it once a week so far.</li>
            <li> I recently chucked my old Braun shaver because it was hurting my skin.  </li>
            <li> I am 66 years old and have had several electric shavers.</li>
            <li> No regrets.</li>
            <li> The shaver does shave much closer than I expected.</li>
            <li> I tried the &amp;#34;for women&amp;#34; shavers, they wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge and barely cut butter.</li>
            <li> Going back to my 10 year old Braun.</li>
            <li> This shaver isn&#x27;t quiet, but it&#x27;s not too loud either.</li>
            <li> I used to have a Remington electric razor that barely lasted me 5 years...</li>
            <li> However my face is sensitive to manual razors and so electric shaving is currently my only way to shave.</li>
            <li> only negative comment is that it cannot be left charging for more than an hour.  </li>
            <li> I really like the wet/dry feature as I don&#x27;t always have time to do a wet shave.</li>
            <li> B0009DT342 Panasonic ES8043SC Pro-Curve Pivot Action Linear Wet/Dry Shaver, Silver]] gave up the ghost recently.</li>
            <li> Body is plastic and not metal (again, the 20 year old Braun was all metal), so not expecting it to last 20 years.</li>
            <li> The micro screen holes must be pretty small, as it take a lot of work with back and forth movement to get a reasonably close shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Husband loves this early Christmas present!  </li>
            <li> This is now my daily shaver and an old Braun is the backup.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a step up from my old shaver.</li>
            <li> Obviously not as close as a razor/blade would, but not too far off the mark.</li>
            <li> I now do a wet shave every 4th time, to get a really close shave.</li>
            <li> This is where the wide trimmer really excels.</li>
            <li> This razor really does shave wet without losing its edge</li>
            <li> I recently pulled this out and shaved with it again (face and head) and I felt like I had betrayed an old friend.</li>
            <li> I have facial hair of medium thickness and have been using electric razors all my adult life(20 yrs)</li>
            <li> I will probably buy my old shaver again or try a different brand.</li>
            <li> to closeness of shave-- the old Norelco left a lot of stray hairs, esp.</li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion gave me the fewest scratches--but even then, I could barely shave every day.    </li>
            <li> + Barely any stinging when I apply aftershave.  </li>
            <li> This is real value for the money spent.</li>
            <li> Went back to my old Remington.</li>
            <li> My last razor was nearly identical and was given to me as a gift.</li>
            <li> The fact is works wet is very helpful and</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 71 year old dad who has short term memory loss from a stroke.</li>
            <li> In comparison to my old Braun though, I think it falls a bit short.  </li>
            <li> but I prefer the one on my old Panasonic because it came out further</li>
            <li> QUIET, compared to my old Remington.</li>
            <li> I bought this when my $39, 5-year old Remington finally wouldn&#x27;t take a charge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For 91 year old female face:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can barely read anything.  </li>
            <li> cleans simply without costly cartridges like my old braun self cleaner.</li>
            <li> I could not seem to find any razor that would shave me as close as my old Remington would, especially under the neck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> much have to go over the same area multiple times in different directions to get all hairs</li>
            <li> Been using the ES8103S for several months now and have had no problems so far.  </li>
            <li> I have only used this razor 3 times, but so far I like it.  </li>
            <li> My wife surprised me with the Panasonic ES8103S Arc3 after searching the internet and watching multiple videos.</li>
            <li> This shaver is a big improvement over my old electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> It shaves much closer and is not much louder.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s apparent that no electric will provide a shave as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li> Especially compared to my old Braun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a head shaver, and frequently use this for a daily shaver.  </li>
            <li> Seems fairly sensitive to direction of motion on different parts of the face.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my bf&#x27;s birthday present because his old one was eating his face.</li>
            <li> The problem is, the razor can barely do this.</li>
            <li> I got this for my eighty eight year old father who has only ever used a safety razor except for maybe once.</li>
            <li> The battery shows no obvious signs of weakness so far</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve left it nearly a week unplugged</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace an 8-year old Panasonic after the last one died.</li>
            <li> cleans simply without costly cartridges like my old braun self cleaner.</li>
            <li> I use the shave gel for extra comfort on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to the old strait edge razors.</li>
            <li> It is not even remotely close to a straight edge.</li>
            <li> I like the ES103S and would not go back to my old Braun.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor as a present for my 90 year old grandfather&#x27;s 91st birthday.</li>
            <li> would definitely buy another Panasonic shaver when it&#x27;s time to replace my old one.</li>
            <li> No regrets.</li>
            <li> He had gone back to a standard razor because his old electric one was just worn out and too old to get replacement parts.</li>
            <li> As far as a razor, I use my S4 Eclipse headblade, and a Double Edge for my face.  </li>
            <li> I have not tired using it wet.</li>
            <li> Not much of a problem except the first time I used it to trim the hairs on the back of my neck, the cuttings got into the collar of my shirt</li>
            <li> Would recommend to others, especially those interested in a wet shave.</li>
            <li> People have complained that the shaver is loud and compared to others, this may be true.  </li>
            <li> I decieded to work with it, and when I finally used it as a wet shaver, I was amazed at the shave&#x27;s closeness (it&#x27;s my first wet/dry shaver).  </li>
            <li> First time trimming the big stuff wet.</li>
            <li> This is particularly true because a fully charged battery lasts me about 2+ weeks with everyday use that likely exceeds my time for any/most travels abroad.  </li>
            <li> and I cannot tell when the shaver is fully charged making this shaver kind of useless.</li>
            <li> the screen failed after 8 months of use giving me a nice cut on the chin.</li>
            <li> Leaves some whiskers behind no matter how many passes.</li>
            <li> When I went online today to return, I saw I was past the return deadline for a full refund.  </li>
            <li> Not as close a shave as a razor but good for someone with disability or inability to use a cutting blade.</li>
            <li> it goes from full function to dead in an instant.</li>
            <li> That said, I found the cleaning station to be kind of useless anyway.</li>
            <li> Works better with thin beard hairs in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It does get warm, but not at all uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll take a good ribbing all day if you are seen cutting yourself with an electric.</li>
            <li> It get&#x27;s most of my beard but still leaves a lot behind that I have to do a back-up sweep with a blade to finish off.</li>
            <li> This was worse than most.</li>
            <li> I have a fairly heavy beard but even so it can handle up to about 5 days worth of growth.</li>
            <li> It is not cheap, but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve put up with poor imitations for too many years.  </li>
            <li> You are only applying it to your face and when it dries after a few seconds, it has no bad effects on the shaver.</li>
            <li> :  Not very good on fine neck hair (need to use trimmer), somewhat noisy, short charge life&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have a pretty tough beard and this goes right through it without any irritation or redness.</li>
            <li> For me - for the price of the unit and yearly foil/blade replacement, it sure saved me a ton of money on traditional blades and has been a very convenient / quick part of my daily grooming, so I&#x27;m not too disappointed in the 5 year span I got from</li>
            <li> Most likely it is related to allergies, but I needed a shaving solution in the mean time.  </li>
            <li> I really love using a conventional blade razor, so I was not easily</li>
            <li> I like the shaver very much, but I would rather have a charging stand like the previous Panasonic shaver I had for 15 years.</li>
            <li> I bought this one to replace a model ES 8016 which is 9 years old and still works although it doesn&#x27;t hold its charge as long, down to 7 days from 14 when it was new, and the blades really need replacing.  </li>
            <li> last tip for the first-time electrical shaver users - for the smooth shaving, make your skin very dry or very wet.</li>
            <li> so it takes less time for me to shave than usual and with far better results.</li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars because trim side it not enough strong, you can only make small changes on your beard.</li>
            <li> Their steel had gotten so bad that I couldn&#x27;t get a good shave in a year from buying new heads or razor.</li>
            <li> My husband is crazy about his new razor and goes around rubbing his face saying how amazing the quality of his shave is now.</li>
            <li> I simply chalked that up to the new shaver being lighter and just using a smaller battery.  </li>
            <li> So I sent my shaver back for a replacement and the new one is no different.    </li>
            <li> Any new razor will take a few days for you to get the hang of, for your skin to get used to, and for you to really see the pros and cons.</li>
            <li> Instead I will gladly live with it as the total shave time was only 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> After my last electric shaver bit the dust, I tried going back to blade shaving with a new 3-blade Gillette razor.  </li>
            <li> dry feature is very useful if you&#x27;re trying to save a little time by shaving in the shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nosier than other shavers I have used -- it&#x27;s a loud high pitch type</li>
            <li> Two years ago I bought a Braun for around $80 but it does not shave very close and the charge does not last very long.  </li>
            <li> It was also very noisy and reached a point where it could not hold a charge very long, even though I religiously followed the recharging directions.</li>
            <li> My facial hair isn&#x27;t very think nor very long.</li>
            <li> The plug is quite large, so not exactly travel</li>
            <li> My only negative is that while cleaning is easy, I&#x27;ve had to replace the foil as the stock one started rusting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it as a dry shaver and it shaved very close without any irritation.  </li>
            <li> The Norelco had to make numerous passes over the same long stubble to clean it all up, but eventually it got there, and it&#x27;s so quiet that nobody sleeping would care how long you kept at it.</li>
            <li> Second, while quieter, it seems to be because the motor is a lot less powerful.  </li>
            <li> I have only used this shaver a few times but it gets a super close shave.</li>
            <li> Super Loud  Slow Shave</li>
            <li> Battery runs out after only a few shaves, but it charges quickly.</li>
            <li> It is odd, however, that the shaver head moves from left to right instead of front to back (like my old Braun) which requires some getting used to.</li>
            <li> I mean I wasn&#x27;t looking for discounts or free things, despite the fact they&#x27;ve sent me a faulty product</li>
            <li> It is more expensive than some other shavers, but is worth it</li>
            <li> its up, down, left, right, diagonal, repeat.</li>
            <li> Some 12-15 years ago I used a single head foil induction charging Panasonic which I loved but the charging mechanism failed</li>
            <li> I had the three day extra long stubble and this shaver cut right thru it all (dry shave).</li>
            <li> Each time after he was done his face turned red and raw within 30 minutes after shaving with or without special products that prevent aftershave irritation.</li>
            <li> I had been using a previous Panasonic foil shaver with two blades and the first thing I noticed about this shaver</li>
            <li> I typically shave the first thing out of the shower, with no gel.    </li>
            <li> Lasts for 8-10 shaves per charge which is better than other shavers I have had in the past (Panasonics and Brauns).  </li>
            <li> To do this I first shaved with one of the shavers then immediately followed this with a second shave with the other one.  </li>
            <li> It took me three tries to find a decent replacement for my old Braun 2000 series shaver after it finally died.  </li>
            <li> I have owned other Panasonic raizors in the past and have always been pleased with the results I have gotten.</li>
            <li> The little raised knobs where the thumb holds to shaver could be raised a little more</li>
            <li> Every other rechargeable device I have had a vertical orientation or one that rotates to allow for small spaces that many bathrooms have.  </li>
            <li> I was never able to find one that can adequately shave my neck.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just hard for me to justify the significant difference in price.</li>
            <li> AS OTHER ELECTRICS BUT VERY HIGH ON COMFORT AND SMOOTHNESS.</li>
            <li> This is in stark contrast to my old Remington, which slowed down as the battery discharged, making shaving more and more uncomfortable each day.  </li>
            <li> From this I conclude that both shavers shave better in certain situations and this was due to the shape of the cutting head as applied to a certain shape on my face.  </li>
            <li> but you have to press the foil pretty hard against your neck and do a few repeat passes to get it smooth.</li>
            <li> I tried to replace it with several other common brands to no avail either they did not shave smooth enough or really were too abrasive for my sensitive skin,until I bought this one.    </li>
            <li> so it usually takes me an extra 1 minute to put soap it, put it in sonic clean mode, and rinse it out.</li>
            <li> I can heartily recommend this shaver to anyone who&#x27;s looking to get a clean shave daily on a small budget.</li>
            <li> If you have a long beard it will not cut properly but shaving part result almost as classic blade.</li>
            <li> Second, it is not easy to judge whether the head outer blade part is completely put on the body, and therefore the outer blade is easily damaged due to the incomplete installation.</li>
            <li> and they stay sharp for a reasonable time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bottom line is, my last Panasonic worked really well, and this one works just as well - no better, no worse.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I was pleased with its performance although it does take at least twice as long to shave with an electric versus a blade</li>
            <li> I hardly ever clean it, just shave.  </li>
            <li> but the trimmer is very lightweight compared to his other shavers.</li>
            <li> The charger is very compact unless all the other bulky ones I was used to.</li>
            <li> Other than that, this product works very well</li>
            <li> if your ingrowns or blemished skin (due to hair growth and shaving) are really problems for you</li>
            <li> He has had other razors and they did not hold a charge, so we were really concerned with that...  </li>
            <li> This works very well and does not irritate his skin as much as other razors.  </li>
            <li> but the other not so much.  </li>
            <li> With the Panasonic ES8103S, I&#x27;m back to the Flintstone&#x27;s days of the old 5:00 shadow, only it&#x27;s apparent by 3pm.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know much about other electric razors</li>
            <li> $ stars due to the battery draining really fast.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any experience with other electric shavers but can say that I really like this one.  </li>
            <li> it is very convenient in the morning compare with other razors.&lt;br /&gt;anyway</li>
            <li> I think the smoothness of the shave is the result of Panasonic&#x27;s use of narrower foils than other models so there is not as much metal contact with the skin.  </li>
            <li> It has a very high-pitch noise that my other models never had.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works very well and shaves as close if not closer than any other electric shaver I have owned.</li>
            <li> I believe this shaver is far better than any other on the market due to its 30 degree blade and all other manufacturers use a 45 - 90 degree blade which requires multiple passes.   </li>
            <li> I believe this shaver is far better than any other on the market due to its 30 degree blade and all other manufacturers use a 45 - 90 degree blade which requires multiple passes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard, so I was expecting a little more after reading some of the reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like vacuuming your face.. back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.. when with a normal razor, one swipe and your done.  </li>
            <li> I bought this on a lightning deal and thought I&#x27;m getting something good since it&#x27;s quite expensive!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at how long this runs for such a high speed motor.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s no more noisy than my last Braun shaver and gives far better results  at half the price</li>
            <li> Te battery holded a little less time after first year on my first shaver.</li>
            <li> When my older ES8103S was due for a foil and blades, I thought I would just buy a whole new razor, thereby at least getting a new battery and motor in addition to the foil and blades.</li>
            <li> If you read the other reviews you will see that the only detractors are the ones who are expecting a nice razor-like barber-house shave, and that is just ridiculous.</li>
            <li> buying the new blades &amp; foil make this a bargain, almost like getting a new shaver for less than 1/2 price.</li>
            <li> He came back to me a few days later saying now that he is used to it he gets a better shave than any other razor he has tried.</li>
            <li> A little irritation at first then my face got used to the shave much faster than with my other razors.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a great alternative to walking several hundred meters to use cold water or just shaving dry with a razor.  </li>
            <li> After using this razor, my face hasn&#x27;t felt so smooth in years (seriously).  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately no such luck, it is late July and the indispensable LCD display has already given up.  </li>
            <li> The only negative would be the sound:</li>
            <li> One complaint is that it does not shave as close as my cheap AA battery powered shaver I bought for ten dollars.</li>
            <li> I had owned a previous wet and dry shaver from Panasonic for many years until it finally gave out.  </li>
            <li> A standard Gillette Mach 3/4/5/6/726 whatever works better, is cheaper, blades cost less, and can be used dry or wet without a recharge.</li>
            <li> Shaving is much quicker because there are few do overs and it does not irritate sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this model to replace my old Panasonic Linear which had finally come to the end of it&#x27;s life, to which I thought I would be getting one equal to what I was used to.</li>
            <li> My only complaints about the old razor were the noise, and that I did have to make multiple passes around the neck / Adams&#x27; apple to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li> (so far, only 5 days, daily shave).&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> My second Panasonic as the battery was starting to go on the old one.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver for my 92 year old father as a Christmas present last year.  </li>
            <li> But, if I go longer than a few days, it takes longer to shave with the ES8103S than with a razor and cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still using this item after about 3 months or so, the battery has held up well so far, and the foil does not seem very warn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 31 year old Asian male.</li>
            <li> I expected the foil and blades to last much longer than this.  </li>
            <li> One negative is that the battery discharges too quick after a complete head &amp; facial cut.</li>
            <li> and I get very close to the same smoothness I received before MINUS</li>
            <li> Then I started to notice in the second week that I could go over the same spot and miss hair repeatedly and not getting nearly as close of a shave anymore</li>
            <li> Looking back, I realize I don&#x27;t really need the wet shave feature.  </li>
            <li> I finally bought some replacement parts for my old Norelco, and am back to using that now.</li>
            <li> It costs about the same as changing the parts in my old shaver and works about the same.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised that you cannot shave with this plugged in, can only use when unplugged, that&#x27;s not a big deal for me though.</li>
            <li> Precision is also average, not comparable with a true wet shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The two minor cons: You can&#x27;t use the shaver while it&#x27;s charging, and it is shipped with an empty battery, so you have to wait a bit for first use.</li>
            <li> Perhaps this particular model is rough on the face.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for a rotary electric that was OK, but not great (the battery on that one finally died).</li>
            <li> It is a good as my old Braun and the replacement parts (blades/foils) are less expensive</li>
            <li> He usually uses razors and because of that, it didn&#x27;t give him a super close shave the first few times.</li>
            <li> Shaving surface gets just warm enough at times to be slightly uncomfortable    </li>
            <li> The biggest problem is this shaver does not get most of your stubble and leaves a lot behind even after numerous passes.  </li>
            <li> The battery lasts through a weeks worth of shaves and charges on only a few hours.</li>
            <li> More like couple times/week, the other times I shave with a blade, but I really only shave a couple times week in general since I work from home and am lazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t really tested it using wet, just seems odd to me, since my Braun couldn&#x27;t get wet.  </li>
            <li> I found the Norelco shaving head somewhat difficult to remove whereas the Panasonic foil was very easy to remove/</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast, extremely comfortable, and plowed through my very tough beard painlessly (both figuratively and literally).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He has used Norelco brands in the past, but says this Panasonic is hands down better.  </li>
            <li> I wish that Panasonic had repair centers in major cities so that you could possible get it repaired quicker and avoid the expense of sending it out of state.</li>
            <li> No other calls, email, or follow-up was necessary on my part.</li>
            <li> I used my first one for a little under two years, shaving in the shower almost every day.</li>
            <li> the first time or two my skin had to get a little used to it</li>
            <li> I start by running a little hot water over the foil while the shaver is running.  </li>
            <li> It is not sharp enough.</li>
            <li> I just put a little soap on the foil, switch it to turbo mode while it&#x27;s under hot water, let it run</li>
            <li> I was told I might have a little razor burn at first, but it never happened.  </li>
            <li> A little liquid shower soap on the foil, run it under a hot faucet after removing the foil/cover, done.</li>
            <li> Ironically, my first Panasonic, a little battery powered travel unit purchased in 1990 blew my socks off..........</li>
            <li> When I was using a safety razor, it would take upwards of 30-40 minutes to shave because of the 3-4 passes + touchups I needed to get close, and the extra slowness I took to minimize irritation.&lt;br /&gt;-Three, the pop-out trimmer is relatively weak compared to my old cheap Panasonic, so I still use that to trim my sideburns every once in awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have major problems the next day.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it leaves less rash then a high end</li>
            <li> /&gt;Electric shavers are larger than disposable shavers, so you will need to prepare for that (the first time you try one is like the difference between trying to manicure your bikini line with hand held disposable shaver or something the size of a small blow-dryer (awkward)...) :P</li>
            <li> but it takes just as long to get a good shave as it did with my previous Panasonic which ran at less than half the price  </li>
            <li> (@$68), Consumer Reports rated them high too,  plus allegedly you can take one to an authorized Panasonic repair shop and have them replace the battery.</li>
            <li> As much as I have come to appreciate this particular razor, it appears that the small digital LCD-info display has given up the ghost; that is to say that the display has become unreadable and therefore unusable after just nine months of service.</li>
            <li> It would be fine for someone with a thin soft growth... like an adolescent just starting out.  </li>
            <li> The one issue I have is if not used at least once or twice a week, it can cause irritation and in-grown hairs, as it did when your first getting adjusted to the new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> Loved the braun 6520 (which is now obsolete) but was somewhat disappointed in their new 7 series model when I bought it a year ago.</li>
            <li> First it charges in less than an hour, second</li>
            <li> I originally wanted this due to hearing that electric razors irritate less than cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> It looks close enough at first, but my shadow grows in (visibly and to the touch) about half a day sooner than the es8243a.</li>
            <li> I noticed that there was absolutely no drag or irritation, but it did make my skin very flaky and slightly bumpy</li>
            <li> Was not sure how well my skin would react to having an electric shaver, but for my relatively sparse facial hair, it actually does better than a standard razor which I had been using for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Electric razors in general require daily use over a blade which might let you skip a day depending on your beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had several other electric razors none of which I found very satisfactory.  </li>
            <li> It is not totally silent but much quiter than other brands.   </li>
            <li> All other shavers in my life made my face red and then after shave really burned.</li>
            <li> The battery goes longer between charges than the other razors, and I like the indicator telling you how much battery is still left.  </li>
            <li> However, if I don&#x27;t shave with it at least every other day it is more hassle than a razor with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> One more thing - other reviewers have complained that the razor won&#x27;t work while charging.  </li>
            <li> It provides a much smoother glide over my face and does not draw at the skin as much as other multi-head foil shavers I have tried recently.  </li>
            <li> I want in an electric razor and the price was much lower than other models that basically did the same thing.</li>
            <li> It took no where near as long as a safety razor shave.</li>
            <li> The shave is not nearly as close as the 45 year old Norelco.  </li>
            <li> my next barely looks like I touched it with the shaver.  </li>
            <li> That being said, there must be something odd with my facial hair as I still have to follow up with a quick dry shave with my razor for touch</li>
            <li> and it goes so long that it doesn&#x27;t need frequent charging.&lt;br</li>
            <li> People say the battery lasts a long time but I completely disagree.  </li>
            <li> It also seems to take a really long time to get a complete shave.</li>
            <li> After a few years I traded up for a Braun, which was my first foil shaver.</li>
            <li> My first shave with it after a year with a safety razor is just as close after going over my skin a few times.</li>
            <li> For women who are first transitioning to an electric shaver, remember that it will take a few weeks for your skin to adjust before you start getting close shaves.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now, it gets pretty close to the skin</li>
            <li> Purchased this for myself to replace my normal razor and shaving cream in order to save money, however, the product did not work as I had expected it to.  </li>
            <li> However, after a few months does not give the razor blade-close shave that it did at first.</li>
            <li> For those occasions when I have a few days growth, I like to &#x27;pre-shave&#x27; by running the trimmer across my neck and face first to remove the longer hairs before using the shaver head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried foil shavers in the past and was sorely disappointed - this razor is by far the best razor I&#x27;ve used...ever.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely loved that shaver, it worked like a charm for over 6 years with only 1 blade change, sadly though the battery would no longer hold a charge long enough for an entire face.</li>
            <li> Yes, the first time I tried with shaving cream, it was quite messy.  </li>
            <li> I tired many different razors, blades, shave soaps, and post-shave products, but the results were the same.</li>
            <li> That didn&#x27;t seem like a problem at first except if I missed a few hairs one day</li>
            <li> The sideburn trimmer is somewhat useless but other than that the razor itself works good.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product, and will never go back to the other major brands.</li>
            <li> I was a little surprised with how high the hum of the motor is</li>
            <li> the shaver does ok, small size I like gets into tight spots,</li>
            <li> This simple and rather old tech gives you a shave that for an average growth person such as myself, will still look decent going out after a day at the office.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic cuts easily through tough stubble.</li>
            <li> I expected a transition period going from a rotary shaver to this one, but still have trouble getting a clean shave.</li>
            <li> Something else worth mentioning: I find I it takes much less time to complete my shave these days - again, this is likely due to the high-speed motor.</li>
            <li> If you have very thick strong beard hair</li>
            <li> comparison, the Norelco was whisper quiet, the battery live was 10 times longer despite the fact that with the longer stubble it took the Norelco twice as long to deliver the same shave as the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Likewise we have extenuating issues with the skin on many of our faces due to our hair being tough yet our skin being soft causing ingrown hairs &amp; razor</li>
            <li> The battery last only about half of the Norelco,but I think it is because of the higher motor speed.</li>
            <li> As such, I would often be a bit sweaty, after taking a hot shower and drying off in a bathroom with little ventilation.  </li>
            <li> all of my shaves, my stubble still appears to be a little dark, even though it is smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li> The Norelco razors always gave a decent shave, but this Panasonic comes extremely close to the results obtainable with a blade.</li>
            <li> Other cons include the lack of maneuverability, particularly in the case of the trimmer, and the faulty LCD display.)</li>
            <li> It was finally time to replace my 10-year old Norelco razor with rotating heads, and I decided to try a foil razor for the first time since I&#x27;ve had my \\&quot;grown-man\\&quot; beard (my first electric was a foil, but I merely had peach fuzz).  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve noticed that, in my case at least, wet shaving yields slightly better results, particularly in the way of less missed hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you hate wasting your money and want to have a good shaver that will last a reasonable amount of time, then buy a different brand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t a particulary close shave (and resulted in terrible burn afterwards), but I&#x27;ve never had much luck with razors (I irritate very easily), so it was pretty much my only affordable (less than $90) option, &#x27;till I found this lovely little piece of technology</li>
            <li> The shaver is not very good, I have to go over the same areas multiple times and still have to use a regular razor to clean up and get a close shave</li>
            <li> I first tried it dry like any other electric razor I have used.  </li>
            <li> If I had to change, I wanted a shaver that was easy to use every day, worked well for tough, thick whiskers, charged quickly and had a pop-up trimmer.    </li>
            <li> Never having owned an electric razor before, I heeded the advice of many others plus the manufacturer to give my skin at least three weeks to adjust due to the different type of shaving.  </li>
            <li> know this review will get many negative voices, but this is my personal opinion, not biased by discounts, trade-ins and other goodies people get for &amp;#34;proper&amp;#34; review.</li>
            <li> also highly suspect that wet shaving will keep the blades from dulling as fast as they would when dry shaving, being that wet hair is easier for the blades to cut through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It went back, I&#x27;m trying the braun wet and dry next, but the head on that looks pretty soft, delicate, ultra tiny soft and gentle holes in the foil as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The new ES8103S has been used almost exclusively as a wet razor with Edge foam.</li>
            <li> New to wet shaving</li>
            <li> I think it tells you when to clean or and other prompts on the little display as well.</li>
            <li> After the shave they will dry further and shrink into their pores.&lt;br /&gt;Never, never use pre-shave powder, it may make the shave feel more comfortable, but it will soon grind the sharp cutting edges round.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li> It shaves the face and neck clean, don&#x27;t worry but other body parts you will have to use the little shaver on the side that pops out.</li>
            <li> - it is a small in comparison to the shaving head, it is tricky to find the right angle</li>
            <li> Had high hopes for this shaver after reading other reviews.  </li>
            <li> I decided to stop using Gillette razors, due to the high price of the replaceable blades and use an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I had an old Braun foil shaver that finally wore out, and the replacement parts were half the cost of a new 3-head rotary shaver from another brand.  </li>
            <li> I use canned air to dry the thing completely-</li>
            <li> I do not like the flip up trimmer as much as the previous unit, but it works.    </li>
            <li> It shaves really close, doesn&#x27;t hurt the skin, and does the job in half the time a razor blade requires.</li>
            <li> However, I use it dry most of the time, because its less messy.</li>
            <li> and once I cleaned off my face, half of my beard was still there, and I don&#x27;t have much of a beard</li>
            <li> Plus, it took up less space on the counter and looked much nicer.</li>
            <li> Not to mention it cost about half as much and</li>
            <li> Cuts close without irritation (dry) and, if you have really sensitive skin, you can use shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I am old school and use the razor dry.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and the dry shave was a bit irratating</li>
            <li> I received the shaver really fast and took less than an hour to charge it as it was already at 50% charge.</li>
            <li> handle is too narrow, and that does not make for a comfortable grip even for average sized hands.</li>
            <li> Razor shaves usually left me with a bare, red look on my neck.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Time will tell if this model will last as long as my old model.  </li>
            <li> As mentioned before, it is a tad loud and the battery doesnt last too long.</li>
            <li> The battery in the ES8103S lasts just as long as my old ES8077, and the shaving results are similar compared to</li>
            <li> It has a digital read-out that let&#x27;s you know if the power is low, and thus, needs to be charged, which doesn&#x27;t take too long either which is also convenient, so in theory, it is a unit that should last a long time with reasonable care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hoping it will last a long time and so far I think it will.</li>
            <li> Marked at 4 because it leaves occasional long hairs.</li>
            <li> I use it on my legs and it works just as well as a normal razor, as long as you don&#x27;t go too long between shaves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a wide range of electric shavers, from low to high dollar, but nothing in the last 5 years.</li>
            <li> Next 3 times, I cut down my beard as much as I could with scissors and tried shaving.</li>
            <li> It folds down when attempting to use it and really takes a lot of work to get it to actually cut anything.</li>
            <li> Experiment with different strokes beyond straight up and down to include circular and side-to-side motions.</li>
            <li> have found that I can get a feasibly close shave with a little effort and some patience, but this electric razor just makes the most annoying high pitched whining sound when it is on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but in 1/3 the time a very acceptable shave with very little multiple pass action.  </li>
            <li> It seems hard now days to find a good electric shaver that gives a reasonably close shave and doesn&#x27;t cost a small fortune or have a shaver head and blades that go dull after a month or two of use.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, in order to get a close shave, wet or dry, one has to shave for quite a long time, to the point where the shaving blades are very warm.</li>
            <li> Now that I have reached the 7th decade of life, really turned off with the mess of shaving cream and bladed razors</li>
            <li> So I naturally turned my back on electric shavers long ago as I figured if I couldn&#x27;t get a close enough shave with a razor</li>
            <li> but it just does not cut as close as my old Braun - charge does not seem to last as long, either - will give it another 60 days and, if there is not any perceptible improvement, then perhaps I will go back to Braun -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the trouble considering that it&#x27;s a really noisy shaver</li>
            <li> The pop out trimmer has given me consistent problems, but in the last few weeks its gotten totally unusable.  </li>
            <li> I promise you, only a razor or waxing will get you a closer shave--A funny tip, if you want to use a cream hair remover a few days before you try it such as Nair/Neet/Veet, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;m just plain getting a better shave than I have in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;m just plain getting a better shave than I have in the past.</li>
            <li> As a shaverthis unit is great, but for me personally the trimmer on it is placed in too awkward of a spot to trim with because the tiny trimmer sticks out of the side which makes it very hard to see exactly what I&#x27;m trimming with</li>
            <li> Wet shaving has also made my skin much softer, which seems to prevent the shaving bumps and ingrown hairs that I would get when using an electric shaver on dry</li>
            <li> Wet shave is much nicer than the dry shaving I have been using for years.</li>
            <li> I really like the wet or dry feature.</li>
            <li> Have used only as a dry shaver so far, but that&#x27;s my routine.  </li>
            <li> I also like that it remains just as fast when the battery is low unlike the previous one i had.</li>
            <li> Works very well wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> Works very well as a dry or wet shaver.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for days and delivers a really close shave wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> The shave is really close wet or dry.</li>
            <li> He is looking forward to trying it with shaving cream and thinks it is a real advantage that it can be used wet or dry.</li>
            <li> - Yes, it&#x27;s loud, but less loud than my Braun.  </li>
            <li> While the placement is odd, it works better than any other trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had on an electric razor (including my $200+ previous razor).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Panasonic certainly has the \\&quot;cutting edge\\&quot; with this fine shaver.</li>
            <li> Shaves right down the center of the head and leaves the sides untouched.</li>
            <li> Also, the rounded head shape itself can make it difficult if you need to shave very precisely.  </li>
            <li> What you need to be careful of is not to push too hard and make sure your skin is stretched out enough so the middle blade does not take a nip out of you.</li>
            <li> if I can&#x27;t shave fast enough to ensure that I&#x27;m doing it with a cold foil, then I shave until I feel the thing getting warm, then put it down and brush my teeth or get my clothes out,</li>
            <li> It was definitely not a good clean shave that he can achieve with a manual razor.  </li>
            <li> less so the shave is outstanding if hair is no more than 3 days long to begin.</li>
            <li> I am a black male with very stubborn facial hair.</li>
            <li> the shaver can be used wet or dry and the screen shows how much battery is left...</li>
            <li> I can report no changes necessary to my earlier review, except to say that it takes less time to fully charge than originally reported (30 minutes or less as opposed to 1 hour).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a decent portable shaver with average battery life.</li>
            <li> I used this shaver it doesn&#x27;t shave properly especially it tough to shave  underneath your chin and near neck region,though the trimmer to the side is good.</li>
            <li> the Arc 3 will help you - The bigger head really reduced shave time to my last Panasonic and it goes a week with out a charge plus being wet dry</li>
            <li> I like the pop-up trimmer but don&#x27;t use it much since I have a little Wahl beard and mustache trimmer.</li>
            <li> A little too much style over function.</li>
            <li> It has taken a little time to get used to it, but now shaving is much easier and quicker.  </li>
            <li> This razor is very good at cutting the hard to get at hairs on the neck - 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> other reviewers were writing about, I ordered it anyway since I like Panasonic shavers and needed an new one.  </li>
            <li> it was due for new blades anyhow.</li>
            <li> This time when it was due to buy new blades</li>
            <li> So far I have only used for dry shaving (saves me water &amp; soap!)</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine facial hair.</li>
            <li> older braun model that was breaking down</li>
            <li> Once I move to my face the razor is very fast, one pass usually gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> He has commented how easy it is to use, it does not tug the hair (he has thick facial hair), and it gives him a very close shave like a regular razor blade without irritating his sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It still has some trouble around the neck, but my next razor will be a Panasonic for certain.</li>
            <li> I have not tried the $200+ Brauns, but I find it hard to believe they could be worth the price premium over this shaver.</li>
            <li> I soon realized my neck was red because that entire region had been rubbed raw and my skin felt like a first degree burn the entire day.  </li>
            <li> My current blade razor is a Gillette Mach 3 and new blades for it have continued to increase in price to the point where I am not willing to purchase them.  </li>
            <li> As close as the Panasonic ES8103s shaves, neither it nor any other electric shaver will shave as close as a blade - especially some of the new, multi-blade razors.  </li>
            <li> He has very thick facial hair and this shaver gives a smooth close shave.</li>
            <li> Other than occasionally buying a new foil and blades, they seem to last forever.</li>
            <li> Usually, it takes 30 days of use to acclimate the face to a new electric shaver, but after 3 days, the skin is responding extremely well (even the neck area), as it did upon first use.</li>
            <li> My one other comment is that this unit is very loud.</li>
            <li> You put some liquid soap on the blades and hold the start button until it goes into some sort of high speed function and then the unit shuts down when it is done.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Philips tri-cyclone design actually forms a 3D pocket when laying the shaving surface on my face, unlike the Panasonic&#x27;s lateral (parallel) blade(s) movements that only make minimum contact(s) to the face, and I have to go back to the same area a few more times, or I have to pressure it hard against my face with a Panasonic unit</li>
            <li> This shaver was not all that bad - but not all that good, either.  </li>
            <li> Which is both good and bad.</li>
            <li> Too bad because it&#x27;s a really good shaver...</li>
            <li> Too bad because it&#x27;s a really good shaver...</li>
            <li> I read the good and the bad review on this product.</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s so easy to clean without the stupid self-cleaning station.</li>
            <li> This is a very lightweight and smooth cutting shaver compared to my Braun shaver.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic does not try to force you into a lot of expensive cleaning cartridges, filled with rubbing alcohol as far as my nose can tell, like the Braun people do.  </li>
            <li> If I get lazy and wait more than few days to shave I use the andis outliner as a beard trimmer and mow off the long hair so that the shaver can get the hair in its foils.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had high hopes for replacing my standard razor with this Panasonic, but after about half a year I am probably going to switch back to the old-fashioned approach.</li>
            <li> I have the luck to try both the highly rated Braun 3Series 380S-4 Wet &amp; Dry Shaver AND this Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> It is a little more expensive than other, but is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Does seem to shave a little closer, and it does clean well with a little liquid soap added when rinsing off.  </li>
            <li> I am now down to a 30% charge after 10 shaves, so the rechargable battery seems to last a long time and only takes an hour or less for a full charge.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great item, and it made shaving SOOO much less of a unpleasant chore to accomplish.</li>
            <li> It lacks a little around the cheeks, but other than that it is well worth the value.  </li>
            <li> I like it and use it it at home, but replaced it with a small battery operated panasonic model I purchased in Japan during travels as this one is quite heavy, bulky and noisy (it is noisier than Phillips I own as well, but cuts closer with less effort).</li>
            <li> I have dense, thick facial hair and very very sensitive skin which bleeds under normal blade conditions.</li>
            <li> For those tough spots I have to use a regular razor to get a clean cut.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t inhibit the performance of the razor one bit but its more than a little annoying to have a brand new musty smelling razor - it doesn&#x27;t exactly make me look forward to shaving my face in the morning!    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought and tried other electrics and hated them all, but somehow these Panasonic machines have been great!</li>
            <li> All of these tests were on a dry face not wet.  </li>
            <li> Both of these shavers rated nearly the same amongst other Amazon reviewers and were the top-2 rated shavers under $100.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews before purchasing this because my husband is 74 years old and he wanted to know what other people had to say about their personal experience.  </li>
            <li> My only gripe is that it is quite loud, mostly due to the vibration.</li>
            <li> , so I typically use this during the week, and use a normal blade razor when going out.</li>
            <li> So far only downfall is this razor seems rougher than other electrics.  </li>
            <li> Wanted something not crazy expensive I could take to and from the firehouse and get a decent shake on the second day I worked.  </li>
            <li> Other electrics/rechargeable shavers didn&#x27;t do a good job of cutting some of the stubborn whiskers on my neck.  </li>
            <li> If this razor ever broke down, I would immediately buy another.ace my electric shaver blades and still got shaves as if the blades were new.  </li>
            <li> I realize it&#x27;s new, so as time wears down the blades</li>
            <li> My beard is of average thickness but is quite coarse, and I am surprised by this shaver&#x27;s perseverance with such regular use.</li>
            <li> Well, I had a Braun 7000 series and wanted a new one that offer wet or dry shave.</li>
            <li> I got a decent shave but a little noisy.</li>
            <li> It does not hug the face and particularly the chin area as well as the Norelco, but it seems to cut a little closer.  </li>
            <li> Also this beast is damn noisy, and foil gets considerably HOT, even when ussing very slight pressure!</li>
            <li> I follow the instructions on how to clean it; I am afraid to plug it in with this much water.  </li>
            <li> I switched because my current occupation requires a clean shave every day and a blade was irritating my skin.  </li>
            <li> i had an older model of this razor, which i bought a few years ago, and it suddenly stopped working one day</li>
            <li> , this shaver (1) shaves much much closer than my previous two Panasonic linear shavers (2) this has a wider head than my old shavers and may have problems getting into tight spots, but haven&#x27;t had those problems yet</li>
            <li> He had very sensitive skin and has never had any problems breaking out at all with this one using it wet or dry.</li>
            <li> The hair trimmer is mounted on the rear of the razor and as other reviewers have noted this limits the users ability to clearly visualize where the trimmer will cut.</li>
            <li> I have other razors just as loud.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a close shave with the Braun, but nothing so far other than a blade shaves as close as this Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I replaced the old one due to me dropping it and breaking the trimmer......</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t fault that decision at all as the charge on this shaver far surpasses any other brand&#x27;s shavers that I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> alittle loud compare to other shavers I&#x27;ve used....</li>
            <li> At 85 decibels this far out shouts other razors...</li>
            <li> This chronic, genetically inherited skin condition means I have a sensitive face that is prone to razor burn and other shaving-related irritations.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve had other electric razors you might be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Extremely loud when compared to other electric shavers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it some time ago due to the difficulty with my sensitive skin--particularly on my neck.</li>
            <li> Third, the charge seems to last for a long time [longer than my recent Braun].  </li>
            <li> If my Dad hasn&#x27;t shaved in a few days, I help him by using the trimmer to get his beard short enough to use the normal head portion.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic shaver is very loud and seems to run down the battery faster than a Norelco.</li>
            <li> Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Rechargeable Linear Pivot Action Shaving System, Silver] shaver cuts my tough beard like it was fuzz, saving much time and my face!</li>
            <li> Even a two day old beard did not cause any problems and I have a pretty tough beard.</li>
            <li> In order to get a close shave, I have to press pretty hard, and in doing so, I&#x27;ve managed to make myself bleed on several occasions!  </li>
            <li> Able to use in the water  Ability to lock the head     Cons:  Can miss small stubble and be hard to get it  </li>
            <li> The only negative is the blade spacing seems to be just such that a lot of dead hair gets trapped between them requiring a more through cleaning than the old one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it over a year and a half, and it still works like it&#x27;s new.</li>
            <li> Instead I just purchased another model new shaver for less than $30.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m thinking as they are almost half the price of a new one</li>
            <li> It does get quite warm after 2-3 min, which may be uncomfortable for sensitive skin, especially if one is pressing hard, which is, actually, not helpful.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I should say I love it, since I don&#x27;t shave that much, but it is rather decent, and nothing bad that I can find</li>
            <li> am most disappointed that it does not give a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Even with the converter as is, I would prefer a curled cord versus the straight cord.&lt;br /&gt;- Travel case - this seems much smaller and flimsy compared to travel cases of the past.  </li>
            <li> I have a small brush that I think came with it, or might have been from my last shaver, I don&#x27;t really remember.</li>
            <li> I have a small brush that I think came with it, or might have been from my last shaver, I don&#x27;t really remember.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge very well (through to the next week usually)</li>
            <li> Needless to say that my husband LOVES this shaver and says that it cuts his shaving time almost more than half the time it took with his old razor.</li>
            <li> That does not compare favorably to my previous version (5 years old), with which I got six to ten such shaves.  </li>
            <li> This razor has a motor that cycles much faster than the older model, which overcomes some difficulties the older model had with cutting longer hair with the clipper.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s my fault, but in order to get the same close shave as I got with the Norelco, I have had to keep going over the same area several times with this shaver, which caused irritation on dry shaves.</li>
            <li> For the past year I have been shaving with regular straight razors.</li>
            <li> - This thing charges FAST and held the charge well over past 5 years of daily use.</li>
            <li> Take a few times to get use to, but really made me sold after I saw how long my shave lasts now without the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve had that lasted this long with regular use in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want water spots on it and my gut tells me that it wouldn&#x27;t last as long simply being made of some metal parts.</li>
            <li> I cant beleive how long it last w/o charging, I like having the charge meter on the razor to tell you the amount of charge is left, It the smoothest shave from an electric razor I have ever had.</li>
            <li> By the way, I left it on the charger 24/7 and never had a problem with staying charged long enough to shave my head and my beard.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shaving took twice as long to get the same closeness, because it move only in one direction and then has to be turned to another direction, to cut against the grain.  </li>
            <li> the digital battery indicator helps me decide if I need to charge prior to taking it on long trips.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only downside is that my short-hairedness doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as with a blade.</li>
            <li> The only question now is how long will this gizmo last.</li>
            <li> I always would cut myself the first few times using a razor no matter how careful I was,  </li>
            <li> It got the whiskers on my neck the my older model were missing.</li>
            <li> but after the novelty wore off in a few days I put it in the lock position so that it would stay steady.</li>
            <li> Battery is not as heavy duty as much older units.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty thick beard especially around the chin area.  </li>
            <li> I was always a little curious about the \\&quot;wet and dry\\&quot; from Panasonic but, hesitant to waste any more $ on a closet relic.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s smaller and a little more difficult to use than that of the old model.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer on this Panasonic ES8103S is VERY small (but also very sharp) and in my experience easy to make a mistake with.</li>
            <li> Over time, the 8595 broke down a couple of times and I had to go back to the old Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> At first I failed to keep the foil flat against my skin, was using too much angle...need to have all three blades in contact...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just shaving the day&#x27;s stubble off - not a full beard or anything, but the new razor struggles</li>
            <li> So the true question is for Amazon: When you raise the price for $30, what does $30 discount mean?!</li>
            <li> I went on using it over the months, I noticed the battery life on this shaver was also a lot LESS than my 5 year old shaver!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t provide you with comparisons to all the other brands on the market like many reviewers here, but I have a real hard time finding any fault with this shaver.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this shaver, mainly for long hairs, I still use my ES-SA40 for a once over to pick up all the missing stubbles that the ES-8013S left behind.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Oh, you&#x27;ll get there with this</li>
            <li> The razor doesn&#x27;t exactly need to be mooshed up against you hard anyway, and that pressure generates heat.</li>
            <li> I found if you take your time and don&#x27;t press to hard on your face for the first week or so, that you can avoid it.  </li>
            <li> The new one has a plug which is on the tight side.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to electric razors, give it a few weeks for your facial skin to become accustomed to it.  </li>
            <li> I recently got a new job where I had to shave everyday.  </li>
            <li> The price of replacement blades for the outdated Braun were as much as I paid for the new Panasonic, so no contest.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery doesn&#x27;t last very long, but you will always know when it&#x27;s about to run out because of the lcd displaying percent left.</li>
            <li> Shaves very close and shaving takes very little time.</li>
            <li> I am at 4 months now and cannot even notice any dulling, whereas most dry Braun shavers dropped off after one month and were useless in 6.  </li>
            <li> I am a recent owner of this razor and have only used it dry</li>
            <li> So far, my husband loves the fact that it could be used wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Since skin absorbs applied moisture, causing the skin to swell around facial hair, I always dry shave, preferably 20 to 30 minutes after a shower in order to get a closer, longer lasting shave.  </li>
            <li> I was getting ready to purchase a replacement foil and cutting block for it, which luckily I had not</li>
            <li> I would not say this is much faster than using a razor, but you can be way less careful.  </li>
            <li> So far this razor has exceeded all my expectations, wet or dry.</li>
            <li> could use it out of the shower on dry skin, but I prefer the results I get using it to shave when the skin and hair are all wet and soft from the shaving lather.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since I shave every morning, the longer shave time is a slight bother, but only when compared to my old Panasonic.</li>
            <li> If you use it wet, it probably wouldn&#x27;t feel so hot, but I&#x27;m used to shaving dry and not having to mess with shaving</li>
            <li> I just spend it going up and down and side to side over the same areas with little to no progress beyond the first sweep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What it did was glide over my whiskers and gave me a shave closer then a single blade razor but just short of a double blade.  </li>
            <li> A single charge will likely last a week.  </li>
            <li> It claims a &#x27;one-pass&#x27; shave, which is a small exaggeration, but not by much.</li>
            <li> It was becoming expensive to replace the blades for my &amp;#34;Gillette Turbo II&amp;#34</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not expensive - about $70, or half-off list (at least on Amazon).  </li>
            <li> Very close shave and no more itchy arms.</li>
            <li> This is a loud and average quality electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;My only two minor complaints about this charger are:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long the blade will last.  </li>
            <li> The Braun cartridges, stretched out, will last about 2 months but still they cost me about $15 or so per cartridge.  </li>
            <li> My only regret is that I waited this long to try it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long an electric razor is supposed to last at peak performance but 2 years was my experience.  </li>
            <li> I am a bit peeved how Panasonic shavers do not last as long as, for example, Braun shavers</li>
            <li> The battery was starting to not hold a charge as long</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want water spots on it and my gut tells me that it wouldn&#x27;t lastas long simply being made of some metal parts.</li>
            <li> The cord on the charger is long enough to be convenient, but not be all over the counter.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know  if the blade will chew holes thru the foil head.</li>
            <li> Shaving long enough also generates heat.</li>
            <li> The trimmer on the back is convenient to have for detailing or just getting those stray long hairs.</li>
            <li> So I purchased about 6 of these over the last 5-8 years (can&#x27;t remember how long).  </li>
            <li> and I would recommend this shaver as long as a perspective user does not think he will be getting the ultimate shave.</li>
            <li> Battery seems to last reasonably long.  </li>
            <li> Plus, long lasting battery.</li>
            <li> The only minor drawback is the charger.  </li>
            <li> And with a back problem, cannot stand in front of a mirror for too long.</li>
            <li> As it has only been a month or so, there is no way of knowing how well it will hold up over the long run.</li>
            <li> The heat and noise though are only minor inconveniences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of course if you intend to use this shaver wet your experience might be far different than mine, but as I never once used this wet</li>
            <li> It is quiet, keeps a charge a long time.</li>
            <li> The battery seems to last a long time in between charges.</li>
            <li> bought it from Azerbaijan, it took long time to arrive to my country, so now I cant also send it back</li>
            <li> The only issue I have with it is that it wont stay charged for long.</li>
            <li> but, it still holds a charge a long time (20 shaves?), and I haven&#x27;t ever actually replaced the blades or screen.  </li>
            <li> Battery does not last long (but it charges in an hour).  </li>
            <li> will see how long this shaver actually lasts.</li>
            <li> I will see how long this shaver actually lasts.</li>
            <li> The blades last for a long time.</li>
            <li> The battery doesn&#x27;t last as long for me as some have suggested.  </li>
            <li> this one lays flat</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t shave for 5+ days, and rely on the trimmer to actually trim off the long hair before I start my shave.  </li>
            <li> only flaw is that unlike my trusty Braun, it will not work well on 2-day growth or longer, it just takes too long, and you migt as well break out the blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like keeping on spending the money on blades that don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Long lasting battery with LED display of percentage remaining.</li>
            <li> The battery also doesnt last particularly long.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts for several days even after several years of use and I could not imagine going back to a shaver that can&#x27;t get wet.</li>
            <li> Battery doesn&#x27;t last as long as the box says either.</li>
            <li> The trimmer broke off for no apparent reason as it wasn&#x27;t abused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can not speak to the long lasting effects of the razor and I will follow up after I&#x27;ve had it for awhile.  </li>
            <li> last long time -some</li>
            <li> It has a lithium battery and last long between charges.</li>
            <li> Recently I decided to see how long it would run after the monitor showed 10%-RECHARGE.</li>
            <li> Also in comparison, the battery doesn&#x27;t last as long as the rotary did.</li>
            <li> Shavers are very personal and each person will have very personal experience - it is for referecen only but not really a thing to argue with.</li>
            <li> This razor works well enough for me as long as I shave every couple of days.</li>
            <li> That may not be a big deal for me as I keep it plugged in, and am anal about bringing a charger, but it is strange as my Braun held charges forever.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> The documentation, like every other razor, says it may cause irritation for the first few weeks or so but not for me.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought another electric razor and don&#x27;t know if I want to waste my money as you can&#x27;t exactly re sell a used razor like other products.  </li>
            <li> Using my old Braun was like holding a small brick and was very uncomfortable to use, even though it gave a good shave.  </li>
            <li> I do not have a rough, thick beard at all - I could go a few days without shaving and most people might not notice.</li>
            <li> Not bad, but certainly not great.  </li>
            <li> Not bad but definitely not great.</li>
            <li> It took a little time to get used to this new lighter model.</li>
            <li> The new shaver should be here tomorrow, I&#x27;ll review it after I have a little time to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I travel every week, and it seems like most higher end shavers come with a cleaning/charging docks that are impossible to travel with (Ask TSA!)</li>
            <li> Beats my old Braun hands down.</li>
            <li> Nano technology is supposed to be a super tough coating that allows the foil to be thinner and resist wearing out.  </li>
            <li> You can completely forget using it on sideburns, mustache edges, or take down any amount of beard.</li>
            <li> Since the early eighties the quality and life expectancy has gone down hill.</li>
            <li> The other problem is the little screen that indicates how much charge is left.</li>
            <li> There was a certain amount of discomfort in this process though and a bit of chafing also, so I waited a few months for that to resolve before trying the twin razor in wet mode.</li>
            <li> This has turned out to be a complete none issue for me (everyone&#x27;s face is a little different</li>
            <li> It takes a little longer to shave with the Panasonic, but I am getting to most of the hard-to-get whiskers like the ones around the Adam&#x27;s Apple of the throat and the hairs behind the jaw under the ear lobe.</li>
            <li> I seem to have to press pretty hard to get the stubble on some areas such as under the jaw bone and on the neck, but it can even be difficult to get a clean shave on flatter areas such as below my sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I chose it due to the high reviews from other customers.</li>
            <li> that said this razor does shave really close with just a couple few passes, and I do have coarse hair of facial hair, with an average amount</li>
            <li> Let me also point out that I&#x27;m African American, so other races might not have the same issues that I have.</li>
            <li> The only weakness in this shaver is it&#x27;s performance on the neck, probably due to the shaver&#x27;s inability to pivot front to back (it only pivots side to side, and up/down if you apply pressure).</li>
            <li> The major issue with the Panasonic shaver was the noise level, as mentioned in other reviews I read.</li>
            <li> PS -- you may note that Amazon shows other users purchasing the WES 9013PC replacement kit (outer foil/inner blade) plus a second inner blade only replacement kit.  </li>
            <li> Beyond the 10% though, there is absolutely no other warning, when the shaver decides it&#x27;s out, it stops abruptly.  </li>
            <li> Beyond the 10% though, there is absolutely no other warning, when the shaver decides it&#x27;s out, it stops abruptly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for almost 2 years now and have no major complaints.</li>
            <li> trimmer is not engineered properly so you can see where you are cutting, creates a \\&quot;blind spot\\&quot; and is a guessing game where you are shaving.&lt;br /&gt;-Does a very good job of shaving under chin but struggles mightily at shaving north/south below side burns.  </li>
            <li> trimmer is not engineered properly so you can see where you are cutting, creates a \\&quot;blind spot\\&quot; and is a guessing game where you are shaving.&lt;br /&gt;-Does a very good job of shaving under chin but struggles mightily at shaving north/south below side burns.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks, I decided to buy a new electric model.  </li>
            <li> With the nicad batteries in my norelcos I could continue to use them plugged in for a very long time (over a year) after the batteries stopped holding a charge before they would finally give out.</li>
            <li> It is the closest shave next to my Gillette Pro-glide, which I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using for a very long time now, hopefully if all goes well with the longevity of this Panasonic.</li>
            <li> The battery life is very long, lasting about 2 weeks for me between charges.  </li>
            <li> Again, a standard dry razor did better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only used it dry.</li>
            <li> I only use it dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used mid range Norelcos my whole life, keeping them through at least one battery upgrade (6-8 years or so).</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really need one, but was not real happy with my razors.  </li>
            <li> I only have used it as an electric razor on a dry face.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it dry on both my face and head and would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> also when used dry only.</li>
            <li> I only use it in the dry mode.  </li>
            <li> My wife likes it because it is a lot less noisy that my old ones.  </li>
            <li> only used it dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it dry</li>
            <li> I have only used it shaving dry.</li>
            <li> I have only used it dry shaving</li>
            <li> only use it for dry shave.</li>
            <li> I have only used the dry cycle.</li>
            <li> The only thing wrong with the Panasonic ES8103S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade shaver is that it has a light that flashes after its charged so you cannot keep it plugged in all the time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It take slightly longer to get a complete shave.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the trimmer part never worked very well</li>
            <li> I started using it dry, but recently begin using it with Aveeno shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> I still do a dry shave with my disposable blade shavers after using this Panasonic if I&#x27;m going out in public.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, I have only used the razor dry.  </li>
            <li> I shall mention though that I only use it dry; I haven&#x27;t tried this in the shower.</li>
            <li> (I have only used it dry).    </li>
            <li> I only use it dry...</li>
            <li> close enough shave dry.  </li>
            <li> I always hated shaving until I got this razor when it was on the deal of the day for 54$. What a great deal, now I shave 2 times a day without any irritation, granted it does not give you the ultimate close shave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a female and have always had issues with eczema and dry skin.  </li>
            <li> After my Norelco gave up being just a year and a half old, I decided to go with this one.</li>
            <li> I tried several brands from expensive ones to the cheap multipacks you can find at any drug/super store.</li>
            <li> I use this for dry shaving my face and neck with no pre-shave products, and it only took about a week for my skin to get used to it.</li>
            <li> He loves this shaver - especially since he can use it dry or in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I use it for dry shaving only.</li>
            <li> I can no longer shave dry and achieve the same smoothness</li>
            <li> The razor has to be taken apart after every shave and left to dry, otherwise it will develop a bit of a funk (smell).</li>
            <li> The consumables for the ES8103 are at least reasonable (especially when on sale at the brand&#x27;s online shop, hint hint).</li>
            <li> I only dry shave without any lotion or foam which I did with my norelco and its a closer shave but</li>
            <li> I now only shave dry at night time unless I forget, then I shave in the morning during my shower so my skin doesn&#x27;t get flaky.</li>
            <li> In fact, they make it such a hassle to send \\&quot;back to the factory\\&quot; for a 5 minute, $50 replacement fee, that takes two weeks even if I drop it off at the service center itself</li>
            <li> Well, not really because my next 2 Brauns (5735) only lasted about 2 yrs each.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the Panasonic because of the very favorable reviews and because I was tired of shaving for 20-25 minutes with my Philips rotary which was just over a year old.</li>
            <li> It takes a few extra minutes to complete the shave compared to razor (maybe 7-8 min vs. 5-6 min).</li>
            <li> Now there is only about $30 separating the two, and I can tell you from experience that the extra $30 is money WELL spent.</li>
            <li> but now their quality is in the toilet.</li>
            <li> which is sort-of to be expected, but, I wish the blades would last longer (and I don&#x27;t even have thick/coarse facial hair).  </li>
            <li> You still need to go over some areas repeatedly, making the battery not last as long, but it lasts 4-5 long shaves, so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not a close enough shave to justify the price and time spent vs using a regular razor.</li>
            <li> Didnt get a close shave with this product and it usually left my face feeling irritated, especially if I did a wet shave.</li>
            <li> i bought this electric shaver hoping it will give me a close shave since a few people who commented said it did, especially with my sensitive skine, will it did not do any thing for me.</li>
            <li> It was used wet for the entire span and had only one problem - the battery display fogged over and became unreadable.</li>
            <li> I have only dried shaved so far and may try it in the shower soon.  </li>
            <li> I spent a couple days researching different brands and models and going through all of the \\&quot;verified purchase\\&quot; reviews, and I finally decided on this</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it for actual wet shaving with foam (which may helpwith stragglers, see in Cons), but it&#x27;s still neat relative by my Braun.&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer -</li>
            <li> (I always touch up with a straight razor anyway as my beard is way too thick for ANY electric to get close enough).</li>
            <li> My facial hair is thick and straight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky I received this gift because I was getting tired of the razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m taking a trip overseas and wanted a single shaver/beard trimmer combo (at the time I was using a separate ancient Remington Triple Action shaver and Wahl trimmer) that also had an international power supply (neither previous device had).</li>
            <li> The high speed cutting action is that fast it can burn you, I&#x27;ve done it once or twice over the yrs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> Later I replaced it with a Braun single head foil shaver ($35 at Walmart).  </li>
            <li> Daily use for 2+ weeks on a single charge.</li>
            <li> It is quiet and gives a closer shave than my single head</li>
            <li> However, you can get enough charge for a single shave within 5 minutes of plugging it in if you forget to charge it and need to get out</li>
            <li> I have a tough (but not thick) beard, along with very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I also shave my head every few days and the first time I tried this shaver I was blown away at how close it gets with only a few passes.</li>
            <li> A couple of other things to keep in mind: the shaving block replacements for the Panasonic are approximately $25 to $30 and cheaper than many of the other shaving blocks.  </li>
            <li> If hairs are too long they will lay flat and not get cut by the razor.</li>
            <li> I really thought after reading the reviews that electric razors had come a long way but they are still slow compared to a standard razor.</li>
            <li> Before this shaver I had a $20 Remington that worked for years (it still works, but the blades are so dull it pulls my hairs like this shaver does brand new), which is what compelled me to purchase a more expensive one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I shave dry long hair or short</li>
            <li> Now, I run it on my face dry twice every week when the stubble is pretty thick, and it works like a charm.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been eyeballing this Panasonic shaver for over a week, and finally ordered it a few days back, and earlier today it arrived - I charged it - and it DOMINATED my facial hair!  </li>
            <li> is that it&#x27;s really quiet and the battery lasts a long time on a single charge.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Beware... if you are switching from a regular razor blade or from a different electric one, it does take time (at least for me) to &amp;#34;readjust&amp;#34; your beard to a new device.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some bad and good experiences with other Panasonic shavers.  </li>
            <li> After serious research, I bought this for my son&#x27;s first razor.</li>
            <li> My bf seems to like it, says you don&#x27;t have to go back and forth constantly to get the job done, doesn&#x27;t pinch your skin, and can use it wet or dry.</li>
            <li> The amount of hair clipping during the second shave was the same in both orders; so there is no discernible advantage of one over the other.  </li>
            <li> Have used other brands but my last a Panasonic) finally gave up the ghost</li>
            <li> He said all the other electric razors were not working for him and they weren&#x27;t doing the job he had to constantly go over the same area.  </li>
            <li> The shave is close for an electric razor not perfect but better than any other electric razor and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like a non electric one.</li>
            <li> I shave everyday just to keep it very close, but I could go every other day with this shaver.</li>
            <li> After a month the blades are still sharp, but a small change in the quality of the shave vs. the first out of the box.</li>
            <li> &#x27;m a Black man with very coarse facial hair that grows in multiple directions.  </li>
            <li> The only con&#x27;s are some initial razor burn that goes away after a couple of weeks and (like other reviews)</li>
            <li> The only thing I dont like is the beard trimmer is hard to use because the main heads block the view in the mirror.</li>
            <li> Gives a decent shave, but it takes a lot of back and forth and pressing hard to get a close one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even shaved dry a couple times this week as a quick touch up, or due to time constraints, and no more flaky skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not concerned, but the foil screen is very thin and would damage easily if you banged this without it&#x27;s plastic cover.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how close the shave was and how little pressure is required.  </li>
            <li> Battery life is 4-5 shaves (depending on how much time you spend getting the last little bit) with little fade in battery life over time.  </li>
            <li> Use the soft mode which gives you a little Norelco swivel effect.</li>
            <li> Just a little loud.</li>
            <li> His old shaver had a little stand that also recharged it</li>
            <li> I seriously considered using ear plugs - but didn&#x27;t want to look at a goofy self image every time I shaved and so decided against it - at least for now.  </li>
            <li> I have only been satisfied with the ES8077S, which unfortunately broke due to rough handling of my travel bag by airport personnel.  </li>
            <li> I have very coarse facial hair and other electric shavers pulled the hairs more than cutting them.  </li>
            <li> The flip out cutter is very small and will nick you if you are not careful when trying to cut down on the hair length first.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed is that it didn&#x27;t have the same cutting power as the older one.</li>
            <li> the only negative is it is very loud!</li>
            <li> I did much research on electric razors considering they are verrrryyy hard to shop for and decided to get this one with my price limit.</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful that this would be the answer to my shaving needs, but I hardly think it is going to.</li>
            <li> Operates a little on the loud side, but I don&#x27;t mind as long as it continues to be reliable.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when buying this item because I didn&#x27;t think these shavers actually shaves like a razor blade, and so said so proven, it takes too long get that clean shave.</li>
            <li> The head is really flexible, and does well on the hard to cut areas.  </li>
            <li> I find it hard to believe some of these reviews that think this razor cuts real close.</li>
            <li> In trying to pick a razor, it looked like the same model was highly rated, at least for the money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean (I don&#x27;t have the cleaning base) with just a little hand soap.  </li>
            <li> A couple of other cons are that the Panasonic is made almost entirely of plastic, and I have my doubts it will last very long.</li>
            <li> The other 1/2 star is because it seems like my older electric shaver cut just a little closer.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I wasn&#x27;t expecting to need a new razor ASAP, and didn&#x27;t have a large amount of money to spend on the replacement.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well built, has some nice features, and doesn&#x27;t do a bad job shaving.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad too, the shaver gives a nice close shave without any razorburn.</li>
            <li> I have a graveyard of electric razors, some expensive some cheap</li>
            <li> I have absolutely nothing negative to say about his shaver and believe me if there was something, I&#x27;d tell you.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely nothing negative to say about his shaver and believe me if there was something, I&#x27;d tell you.</li>
            <li> My only real complaints are the pop up trimmer is a bit awkward for trimming side burns and the charger has a really long straight cord.  </li>
            <li> The motor after so many years of cutting my \\&quot;wire beard\\&quot; sounded like it was laboring.</li>
            <li> Some spots would be smooth, others would have stubble, and others would just have hairs that looked uncut.  </li>
            <li> But the shaver acts more as a belt sander than a blade cutting hair.  </li>
            <li> honestly no one really &amp;#34;needs&amp;#34; those self cleaning shavers.</li>
            <li> This razor sucks, it doesn&#x27;t cut the hair very well, and it does not cut the hair on your neck at all.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a perfect fit.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a perfect fit.</li>
            <li> i have the 4 blade one which does  a better job at cutting.</li>
            <li> Was tired of cutting my face up with regular razor, so figured even if it wasn&#x27;t a great shave, I&#x27;d try one of the newer model electrics out there.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s better than cutting face up I guess.</li>
            <li> Since I figured my skin might clear up in a few months as my medication starts to take effect, I did not want to spend a lot on a shaver.</li>
            <li> I used to use a Gillette Fatboy flat razor but only shaved every other day.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for my teen son with his soft skin, this  thing didnt do the job and started to harm his skin without even shave the small hair in his face.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in a few years and was pleasantly surprised how well it worked.  </li>
            <li> The ONLY option to get it repaired is to send it a Texas repair center.</li>
            <li> It seems to hold a charge a fairly long time.  </li>
            <li> I charged the razor and washed my face and left it wet.</li>
            <li> I waited a long time to buy an electric razor again while continuing to use a blade razor.</li>
            <li> I spent 3 hours reading reviews on their current line before buying ES8103S.  </li>
            <li> Question now is if the Panasonic will hold up as long.</li>
            <li> I holds a charge for a LONG time.  </li>
            <li> The battery will go dead without warning and, since the shaver can&#x27;t be used when the cord is attached, you&#x27;re stuck waiting for the charge to complete until you can continue</li>
            <li> The battery will go dead without warning and, since the shaver can&#x27;t be used when the cord is attached, you&#x27;re stuck waiting for the charge to complete until you can continue</li>
            <li> But time and technology have come a long way.  </li>
            <li> It took as long or longer to shave with this razor as with a blade razor, and still required using soap or shaving gel to get a somewhat close shave.</li>
            <li> I finally decided on this one, partially because it was on sale.  </li>
            <li> The shaver can&#x27;t be used while connected to the AC house current to prevent electric shock while shaving wet or in the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving with a razor for several years, but like having an electric around.  </li>
            <li> Initially the shave was not very close</li>
            <li> I wish I would have tried it long ago and saved my money on all those \\&quot;rotary\\&quot; shavers.</li>
            <li> I kept rubbing my face all day long in dis-belief.  </li>
            <li> My grandfather gave me this tip a long time ago.</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin but do not have a heavy beard.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin but do not have a heavy beard.</li>
            <li> When wet shaving, it&#x27;s close enough to a blade shave that I can&#x27;t tell the difference.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts a long time between charges.  </li>
            <li> The adjustable head flex, the ability to get shaver wet when either shaving or cleaning it is a big plus.  </li>
            <li> Just hope it lasts as long as the braun did.</li>
            <li> Used it daily while in the military and 2-3 times a week now that I&#x27;m out.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have switched a long time ago.    </li>
            <li> Battery lasts a long time (1 month for me @3 times per week)  </li>
            <li> (No, I&#x27;m not naturally balding.</li>
            <li> It took a long time to shave and some patches and locations just would never shave away.  </li>
            <li> I should have put the trust in Panasonic and got their non-rotary shavers long time ago.</li>
            <li> I gave up on electric shavers years ago when I couldn&#x27;t find one that did not irritate my neck regardless of how long I tried to let my skin \\&quot;adjust\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t see any cuts yet for some reason the center of my neck was extremely red.  </li>
            <li> Takes just a minor amount of getting used to but, once done, it works like a charm.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin almost as a regular blade would do besides the fact that I can use it while my skin is still wet.</li>
            <li> I am sending it back and (hopefully) will receive the partial refund.  </li>
            <li> and you have to keep shaving because if it gets too long it won&#x27;t shave it</li>
            <li> still do get some minor razor burn from this, though I&#x27;m not attributing that to a shaver defect at all.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> I hope it works as well long term</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to shave.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for an electric shaver for my boyfriend ( he had been looking for one for a long time)</li>
            <li> Minor Con:</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to shave.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my father not too long ago</li>
            <li> i haven´t try it in wet shave, i would just recommend i tiny brush for diary care.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time and I like the display in the handle that shows the percentage of charge remaining and the percentage of charge attained when it is attached to the charger.</li>
            <li> I have an old Norelco with the round heads</li>
            <li> have only used this shaver wet, with shaving</li>
            <li> I prefer to wet my face prior to shaving.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely NO idea what % battery life is left anymore.  </li>
            <li> also appreciate how the whiskers don&#x27;t fall out like grey snow while shaving like with my Braun</li>
            <li> It takes me a long time to shave with this thing.  </li>
            <li> both times, after only a couple of months the LED screens begins to die...although it is advertised as a WET razor...</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have always had trouble with getting a close shave with an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> I hope it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s a twice a day thing, it shouldn&#x27;t take that long.</li>
            <li> but it depends on how long it takes you to get the shave you want.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a long time too.</li>
            <li> but we&#x27;ll see how long it operates.</li>
            <li> So far it looks like it holds a charge for about two weeks (using it everyday).</li>
            <li> Runs a long time on one charge and cleaning is a snap.  </li>
            <li> I have always been the lather/blade type, but that takes too long every day.</li>
            <li> seamlessly does savings and not having any trouble.</li>
            <li> The Norelco type shavers need to be replaced 2-3 times per year and cost roughly the same if purchased again, here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The curving, pivoting, \\&quot;soft\\&quot; shaving head makes it conform to various parts of the face with minimal irritation.</li>
            <li> After using it for several months, I decided to try it with a wet shave.</li>
            <li> and now IT feels strange in my hand.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s such a drag</li>
            <li> If you use it I would always do same in the wet mode.</li>
            <li> The Braun will stay in a box for a long time until I cannot find another of these.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge sufficient for a week long use</li>
            <li> I bought this razor and directly compared it to a braun 340 that I have had for a few months.  </li>
            <li> However, the extra contact can cause irritation, even when using wet.  </li>
            <li> This shaver, while it eventually can get all the hair off of my face, takes an annoyingly long time to do so</li>
            <li> Long battery life</li>
            <li> I have been using Panasonic (or National) shavers for a long time.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge a long time.</li>
            <li> It has been a long time since I owned an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> all those years I put up with the Norelco product thinking that it was the only wet shaver made.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> heavy beards and sensitive skin beware.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Keep the charge up, because it does not run with the charger cord plugged in - the only drawback I can mention, but it makes sense as you probably do not want to be wet shaving while plugged into a wall outlet.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in over 25 years, but minor surgery required me to buy one.</li>
            <li> Battery charge lasts long time before recharging is required.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t shave for a few days you definitely need to use a regular razor or trim your entire beard before using this.</li>
            <li> This can lead to really long shave times and irritation&lt;</li>
            <li> Would recommend if you shave every day, but not if you like to grow your beard long then shave (i.e. once every 4 days)</li>
            <li> Works through my stubble so long as I don&#x27;t let it get too scruffy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, not nearly as troublesome as some razor&#x27;s out there.</li>
            <li> One minor suggestion: the thumb rest should be a non-slip surface.</li>
            <li> it takes much to long to shave in the morning....</li>
            <li> a long time Amazon and Panasonic shaver customer</li>
            <li> This unit can&#x27;t cut long hairs like your tri-blade shavers can.&lt;br</li>
            <li> battery life seems about the same, as does wet performance.</li>
            <li> Long Handled Safety Razor]].</li>
            <li> The battery doesn&#x27;t have a long charge.  </li>
            <li> so it takes a long time to shave.</li>
            <li> but it still took a long time.</li>
            <li> Problem, it takes me twice as long to shave and it dosent seem to pick up all the stuble.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect a long life for it.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my 25 year old son who has a heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> It also goes a long time between charges.</li>
            <li> Years ago I tried an electric razor, different brand, and using it felt like rubbing my face with rough sandpaper.  </li>
            <li> Why did I wait so long before getting this one?</li>
            <li> It takes twice as long to shave as the Braun that I retired and, frankly, I&#x27;ll soon by another Braun.  </li>
            <li> Not necessarily for shaving wet.</li>
            <li> He went on blood thinners a few weeks ago and shaving with a razor is completely out for him.  </li>
            <li> (i.e., how long it takes from shaving start to finish).</li>
            <li> I have only used it wet with Nivea shaving gel and like the closeness of the shave.  </li>
            <li> Does not handle long stubble as well.</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to shave.</li>
            <li> This shaver is the fastest shaver that I have used in a long time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-I have not had any problems with steam getting under the battery screen even though I&#x27;ve held it completely under water a few times.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that this razor does not tug on your whiskers when it is long.  </li>
            <li> Tried daily for 2 months and no real improvement.</li>
            <li> It ended up taking longer than a wet shave with a razor, and was only about 80% of the quality and closeness.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not terribly sensitive (eg.</li>
            <li> My wife tried it (wet) shaving her legs and had the same problem - lots of stubble.  </li>
            <li> It takes a long time to shave with it.  </li>
            <li> below my ears had long hairs growing no matter</li>
            <li> - This is a minor irritation for me, but I find that this misses about 5-6 neck hairs each time.  </li>
            <li> I hope it lasts long.</li>
            <li> It cleans well and the charge lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> so the stubble is quite long when I shave.</li>
            <li> Previously, on long hairs, I had to trim and then shave.</li>
            <li> The side trimmer is helpful with longer hairs but does not completely solve the problem.&lt;br /&gt;-Side</li>
            <li> shaves take so long</li>
            <li> The side trimmer is helpful with longer hairs but does not completely solve the problem.&lt;br /&gt;-Side</li>
            <li> shaves take so long</li>
            <li> I had an electric years ago and because of that, I&#x27;ve been a blade man for a long time.</li>
            <li> For myself, I think the body is a bit long</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I lived with a 12 year old shaver that wouldn&#x27;t work unless I plugged it in and waited a few minutes before using.</li>
            <li> I hope this one lasts as long.</li>
            <li> Only reason i didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because if your shaving and its been awhile, it tends to miss the longer hairs, i only have this problem on my neck and not a huge deal, just hit with a regular blade, Battery lasts a long time between charges.</li>
            <li> razor itself works fine (as does my previous one), it is just frustrating that the mfr&#x27;s have to change these things from model to model.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver for more than 10 years, as I pretty much hated them.  </li>
            <li> It generally only takes a shade over an hour to charge fully, and the battery life doesn&#x27;t seem to have decreased at all since I first purchased it.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s still a few places on my face where I have to make a few passes but those are for the more thick whiskers.  </li>
            <li> It cuts very close even on my thick hair.</li>
            <li> Very close shave, but slow.  </li>
            <li> The shave isn&#x27;t as close as what you get with wet shaving (as is expected), but I do notice the irritation on my neck has gone down considerably (though I don&#x27;t think it will ever go away totally).</li>
            <li> The battery lasts me for about 6 days before recharging and I have used it when it read only 10% left with no problems of the razor slowing down.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed however that it takes multiple passes over the same spot to get the hairs cut all the way down.  </li>
            <li> It does not take kindly to facial hair that lays down, especially those on the under the chin</li>
            <li> I recently bought another one of the same, when the price went down - just to have as a backup.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I know some guys respond very well with the double edged (and even straight razor) shaving, but my face is just too sensitive and dry, and my beard too thick,</li>
            <li> While I have to tilt it different directions, I find it ultimately does a better job than my previous razors that used a circular cutting motion.  </li>
            <li> I tried fast, slow, holding it in the same place, wet, dry, shaving cream - nothing worked.</li>
            <li> The first few shaves were inconsistent and not very smooth but after using it for a short while, the shave becomes quicker, less tugging, and does its job as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Emits</li>
            <li> My complaint is that I only get two or three of these shaves from the battery of this new product.  </li>
            <li> Cold water or a dry razor shave was better than that.  </li>
            <li> By shallow charging and shallow discharging it, you will be rewarded with a battery that lasts and maintains its functional life for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li> I have tried it both wet and dry and works equally well.</li>
            <li> This is my second Wet and Dry from Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Wet or Dry, this is a terrific electric razor!</li>
            <li> I have tried the different modes with dry shave and wet shave</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s odd, is after 30 years of trying everything, I&#x27;m back to the same approach to shaving my dad used...</li>
            <li> alot of time, i guess every body will have a different opinion and i can use it wet or dry</li>
            <li> I have not used it wet, as I only dry shave, so</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it, especially because he can use it wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Works equally well in wet or dry conditions</li>
            <li> He dry shaves only (never used for wet shave).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to keep going over the same area half a dozen times before it felt close enough.</li>
            <li> I am coming off of 1 year of use and previous experience with a Norelco which didn&#x27;t have any of the drawbacks above but didnt get the neck hairs that lay down nearly as well.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Braun&#x27;s replacement screen for the 1775 has a slightly different pattern and does not seem to cut as quickly or as closely.  </li>
            <li> Also, since a man&#x27;s beard doesn&#x27;t grow in only one direction, it is difficult if not impossible to get all the hairs lined up with the one directional slots.  </li>
            <li> and I mean so very almost as close as shaving with a razor blade against the grain.  </li>
            <li> I got it to really just knock down the tree like stubble I get after 2 or 3 days that dulls any razor down to a single use.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I would have it is very loud.</li>
            <li> I am anxious to try this new type which I just received in one day (Prime).</li>
            <li> It works marginally better than my previous rotatory shaver (Norelco) whose battery charging mechanism did not work well as it failed to retain a charge for very long.  </li>
            <li> My main complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t give a very close shave on the delicate skin toward the bottom of my neck.</li>
            <li> wrote this tip in another Amazon area to advise on keeping the razor blades sharp as long as possible:  </li>
            <li> you have to go over the same spot multiply times in multiply directions to get a half way descent shave other</li>
            <li> It fits well in my hand and isn&#x27;t too heavy for the approximately 10 minutes it takes to shave, yet its solidly built and comes apart easily to clean.    </li>
            <li> It is not a new model with just basic functions but enough for those who have less beard.</li>
            <li> Since the motor runs faster on this, the noise is a little more high pitched than other shavers and some may consider that annoying or loud.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really shave that close, and misses hairs on each pass, sometimes entirely and then once they get longer it has a VERY hard time getting them.</li>
            <li> If you do decide to get this Panasonic ES8103S and plan to use it on a bald head, then be prepared to by replacement foils/blades every 6 months because top of head stubble is tough and will dull</li>
            <li> Second, the trimmer is placed behind the large head and limits visibility.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewers have stated you need to go over your beard multiple times to get a somewhat close shave.  </li>
            <li> I chose the 8103 because I didn&#x27;t need the massive 4-foil heads of some of the other wet/dry models.  </li>
            <li> My neck was left extremely irritated around the collar line (where my beard ends) each time I have used the shaver.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other electric razors, all of which fall short of my expectations.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic does not seem to have a sharp enough blade on their trimmer.  </li>
            <li> and I have tried several other types.</li>
            <li> Not big and clunky like a number of the other \\&quot;full-featured\\&quot; electric razors on the market.</li>
            <li> This is likely due to the high-speed, 13,000 RPM motor.</li>
            <li> The other thing is that the battery level is only displayed in tens of percents (ie 100%, 90%, 80%, etc).</li>
            <li> My shaver came a day earlier than expected (woo hoo Amazon Prime !).</li>
            <li> Other than that, it is a close shave with none of the regular razor side effects.</li>
            <li> I came from a Gillette fusion something or other and its not even a close second.</li>
            <li> With a little dab of &#x27;shave secret&#x27; lotion, this razor will give you a smooth shave with no problems.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect or user friendly, but if you learn how it works, you can get the job done.</li>
            <li> As all Blackmen know our skin and hair type are different from all other ethnicities.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is washable and the blade is sharp enough for me.</li>
            <li> The charging cord is long...VERY LONG!  </li>
            <li> I have been using Panasonic Razors for several years now after trying other brands.</li>
            <li> other point is Panasonic doesn&#x27;t describe enough about the battery</li>
            <li> Panasonic recommends replacing the outer foil once a year and the inner blades every OTHER year.  </li>
            <li> I did a lot of research, starting with Consumer Reports&#x27; ratings and a lot of user reviews at Amazon and other sites.  </li>
            <li> One of the other reviews said it shaved as close as a blade, and I totally agree.</li>
            <li> It recharges within a few hours; it&#x27;s always finished charging when I think to come check on it, so I&#x27;m not sure exactly how long</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d buy it again for the price, especially when compared to other options.</li>
            <li> He had purchased in the past much more expensive shavers but always went back to blade.</li>
            <li> It can even be submerged in water but not for long periods of time!</li>
            <li> The problem I had with those shavers is that if I didn&#x27;t shave every day or every other day then come back to use the electric shaver, the shaver would PULL the hair and not cut it so well.</li>
            <li> I would recommend other people who have never tried a foil shaver to definitely give this one a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had numerous other shavers, but I have not had a closer shave with any of the shavers.</li>
            <li> Around six or seven months, the LCD screen all but went blank (you could sort of read the numbers at a sharp angle if you squinted).  </li>
            <li> I have to say I was extremely hesitant to try an electric razor as I always felt they didn&#x27;t get all the hair or shave close enough.</li>
            <li> daily use, Panasonic recommends that you replace the outer foil once a year and the blade every other year.  </li>
            <li> it charges in only an hour, as opposed to eight hours on other shavers I have used.  </li>
            <li> I did try two other brands of similar shavers and another model from Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t mind the dark look, it&#x27;s only minimal anyways.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a while now and the only shortcoming is that it&#x27;s occasionally lacking in getting a close shave on my neck, requiring just a little effort on my part to ensure I get  every hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other similar mid-level models that shaved with one pass, so either they&#x27;re using cheaper blades</li>
            <li> Every other electric I have ever tried pulls these facial WIRES and hurts like heck.  </li>
            <li> Using it 3-4 times a week (and regular shaving on other days)</li>
            <li> Lastly, it fell of the bathroom countertop once, the trimmer popped open and a little piece of plastic flew out.</li>
            <li> does a decent job with the shave, over time the display gives out and it is hard to see what charge remains on the razor</li>
            <li> I was given this as a gift from my wife to replace a phillips/norelco brand because I kept using my wife&#x27;s older norelco because it was faster, smoother and not as hard on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, dark hair, and shave my whole head daily.  </li>
            <li> I have used it only dry as any other electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> Its hard to do your upper lip and near your nose.  </li>
            <li> I have used a safety razor for a very long time and have NEVER achieved a shave like this.</li>
            <li> , ZERO burn (after getting used to it, which only took about 5 days, otherwise very minimal burn the 1st time), and ZERO ingrown</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll take the very minor tradeoff for no cuts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;CONs:&lt;br /&gt;- Very minor issue.  </li>
            <li> I clean the shaver with a little liquid soap after each shave rather than waiting for the prompt image to show up on the display because I&#x27;m afraid otherwise the Alba product (which I also highly recommend) might gum it up.</li>
            <li> Had major problems with the Remington MS2-390 as the motor would rev up and down while plugged in and shaving corded!</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that you can&#x27;t use it while charging so you better keep it charge .</li>
            <li> I was hyped as well by the idea of \\&quot;dry shaving\\&quot; and \\&quot;no</li>
            <li> Never tried an electric-wet shave, always dry.  </li>
            <li> It was uncomfortable to use as it pulled the hair rather than cut it cleanly.</li>
            <li> Then leave it out in the air to dry.</li>
            <li> I do not like a dry shave- for a close shave</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for about a month, and I use it dry.  </li>
            <li> However, I prefer to use it dry with a pre-shave lotion.  </li>
            <li> I almost always shave dry</li>
            <li> the Braun dry.  </li>
            <li> Using it dry it works well. . .</li>
            <li> Then remove the cover and the foil and let it dry.</li>
            <li> Even bone dry</li>
            <li> I still got razor burn on my face from this product when using it on dry skin.</li>
            <li> I tried both a wet(with shaving gel) and dry shave</li>
            <li> can shave dry or with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> it is a breeze, rinse it off under running water and blow it dry</li>
            <li> I shave dry.  </li>
            <li> , I started using this shaver on dry skin, no prep whatsoever, before showering.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything about dry shave quality for this razor.</li>
            <li> (that is to say that you don&#x27;t towel or paper tissue dry it immediately)</li>
            <li> It even cuts close dry.  </li>
            <li> I shave dry</li>
            <li> I shave dry.  </li>
            <li> You then take off the head, rinse and let it dry.</li>
            <li> I never had this problem dry shaving with Panasonics.</li>
            <li> AND IT CAN BE USED IN DRY CONDITIONS OR AT THE SHOWER ...</li>
            <li> I let it air dry while I shower.</li>
            <li> I drop a couple drops of Lectric Shave on the foils after its dry and before putting it away..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always found shaving dry skin is faster &amp; gives a closer shave.</li>
            <li> I shave dry</li>
            <li> Dry shaving is so so.  </li>
            <li> It can be used dry or in the shower (it is waterproof).  </li>
            <li> wanted to switch to dry shaving to reduce time needed for shave and also avoid all that clutter.</li>
            <li> and it gave a closer dry shave.</li>
            <li> use this dry.  </li>
            <li> I would rather dry shave</li>
            <li> dry shave with electric shavers.</li>
            <li> Note that I always use the razor dry</li>
            <li> It works well as a dry shaver too, but I rarely&lt;br /&gt;use</li>
            <li> Works in shower and dry.</li>
            <li> Dry, it just hurts.    </li>
            <li> Remove the foil and shake the water out of the blades, then blot the blades on a dry towel--do not rub dry.</li>
            <li> I have tried it both dry and with shaving cream, but always after a shower and washing with a scrubbing face wash.  </li>
            <li> husband loves it bc if he is in a hurry and can do a dry shave</li>
            <li> Rinse the now-exposed blades and the foil, and let dry.  </li>
            <li> I have used it dry twice and with water once</li>
            <li> I was using dry for about 6 months.</li>
            <li> then dry bc</li>
            <li> Works decently dry also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I have never used it in the shower, always shaving dry, with no shaving cream or oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also used dry with shaving powder.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Panasonic (dry) for over a month</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried both dry and with gel and gel is closer for me.</li>
            <li> It provides a close dry shave every time.  </li>
            <li> It did a mediocre job but what I disliked the most was the noise.  </li>
            <li> The dry time is also longer.  </li>
            <li> I had to dry my face thoroughly and then shave again to get a closer shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt; dry.</li>
            <li> It works well dry.</li>
            <li> Once thing I would like to note though is when dry shaving, I noticed that my skin became a lot dryer while shaving.  </li>
            <li> , it took me a couple of minutes dry</li>
            <li> so it is not lying in a puddle on the sink to dry.  </li>
            <li> Dry shaving with the Panasonic ES8103S gives me a &amp;#34;safety-razor-like&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I prefer a dry shave and used it in that fashion.</li>
            <li> In actuality it doesn&#x27;t save any time because it is maddeningly difficult to get a clean shave without any missed hairs in the area below the jaw line.</li>
            <li> I use it dry</li>
            <li> Gives me a close shave even when using it dry.</li>
            <li> I prefer dry with a bit of LECTRIC SHAVE oil which makes all the difference in the world.</li>
            <li> usually go dry for the convenience (shave in 3-4 minutes),</li>
            <li> soap, water, alcohol, air dry.</li>
            <li> I am mostly dry shaving.</li>
            <li> I shave dry with no shaving gel or anything.  </li>
            <li> The shave was closer than I was getting from the blade (dry shaving).</li>
            <li> I tried it both ways in the shower and the dry way neither works.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower since I always dry shave.</li>
            <li> one: I did it completely dry.</li>
            <li> I prefer the ease of dry shaving with electric razors, and this fits the bill.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT ON THE TOP.&lt;br /&gt;IT IS SELF CLEANING AND CAN BE USED WITH SOAP AS WELL AS DRY</li>
            <li> I run mine under the tap after each shave and let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> so just used it in dry mode.</li>
            <li> Dry - I like the fact that I can clean it with water, as opposed to the expensive Braun alcohol cleaning system.  </li>
            <li> prefer a dry shave</li>
            <li> Then I use canned air to dry it off and it removes any stray hairs that the water didn&#x27;t get.</li>
            <li> This is my second one so their life expectancy may only be a few years.  </li>
            <li> That is the only negative so far.</li>
            <li> My only concern is that, while my last one was made in Japan, this one is made in China, and has the lighter (read: less substantial) feel that I for one expected given that piece of information.  </li>
            <li> I feel it necessary to write a review of the Panasonic ES8103S shaver because I heavily based my purchase on such reviews.  </li>
            <li> I would have you consider stepping up to the next step for a few bucks to get one extra shaving foil.</li>
            <li> I only shave about 2-3 times a week and so after growth of a few days it cut my hair above satisfaction.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the battery on the old razor wasn&#x27;t holding much of a charge</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t bother me in the least, since none of my old shavers had numbers on them, only bars.</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t bother me in the least, since none of my old shavers had numbers on them, only bars.</li>
            <li> The last few weeks I only got 2-3 shaves before I have to recharge it.</li>
            <li> You need to go over the same area over and over and my facial hair is by no means heavy.</li>
            <li> We tried wet with shaving cream and dry he gave it several tries hoping there would be a learning curve.</li>
            <li> If only I had started using this a few years earlier.</li>
            <li> After a year the display went out, but a few months later it came back.</li>
            <li> After shaving with traditional blades all my life, I was using Philips rotary shaver ($40 range) for last few months and always had to struggle around the neck area.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is noise - this thing is loud, but not deafening.  </li>
            <li> Heck, I had to shave at least two directions with my blades to try to get a decent shave.</li>
            <li> My main complaint with this unit is the battery recharge.</li>
            <li> Holy cow, I will never go back.  </li>
            <li> The only negative thing I can say is its kinda loud.</li>
            <li> It cuts close enough at some areas and the charge last a few days.  </li>
            <li> It takes longer than a normal shave and you will have to shave with a normal razor once you are done to get all the random whiskers that this shaver cannot get.</li>
            <li> But if you use it wet, water gets trapped in the foil/guard and by the time you get home from work - the thing smells like an old towel.</li>
            <li> I ordered a second one for a 91 year old woman who prefers to shave, not tweeze, the thick hairs that grow on her face and under her</li>
            <li> I got tired of buying expensive blades and wanted a good electric razor.</li>
            <li> price was very reasonable, at least $100.00 Less than rotary types.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually pretty tough, aside from that one incident.</li>
            <li> It shaves well, leaving me with far less \\&quot;five o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot; than I had with a conventional razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a traditional shavor with either the Gillette power fusion or something similar, but I was tired of shaving and sometimes cutting my mole (which is very handsome when not gushing blood) and continually going to the store for shaving supplies.  </li>
            <li> I have tried every method that I have read about to include: using &#x27;Lectric Shave, Shave Secret, wet shave in shower (with and without shaving cream), dry shave, before shower, after shower, in the evening, in the morning, and even during the middle of the day and each time produced the same result; a very close shave on face and jaw line but an extremely irritated neck line.  </li>
            <li> As mentioned in other reviews this razor is a little on the loud side</li>
            <li> I have found that I can get 6-7 shave cycles on a single charge.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s a soldier, so he has to shave EVERY single day, and he was always saying he wanted an electric razor.</li>
            <li> They advertise single pass.</li>
            <li> The shave has always been patchy and I have had to follow it up with a twin razor every single time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not yet as close a shave as with a conventional razor - maybe the next one...</li>
            <li> I still get 8-9 shaves out of a single charge.</li>
            <li> I still get 8-9 shaves out of a single charge.</li>
            <li> Close shave every single time.</li>
            <li> CAN&#x27;T FIND A SINGLE THING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT....</li>
            <li> I have not had a single problem with it, whether I am shaving in or out of the shower.</li>
            <li> probably all Panasonic&#x27;s now have a 2 year Parts and Labor limited warranty just like the Norelco&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> ， you can use a single charge BY A week</li>
            <li> I like the small LCD that shows battery strength, and it didn&#x27;t take very long before the shaver was completely charged.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid to go wet with my nice little Wahl trimmer.</li>
            <li> Previously I didn&#x27;t know how long the shaver would last between charging.</li>
            <li> Battery doesn&#x27;t last quite as long between charges (4-5 days vs 7-ish days), but it recharges in less time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also, the slight arc in the foils and the central long hair cutter probably reduces the amount of metal to skin contact and aids in shaving comfort.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tolerated reduced cutting performance of those old style units as the replaceable parts aged because replacement is nearly the cost of new shaver.</li>
            <li> plus I was tired of using that little brush to clean it, so I decided to try this Panasonic.</li>
            <li> only once at the end&lt;br /&gt;-Beard grows back smooth, not sharp&lt;br /&gt;-Chances of facial cuts decreased by at least 90% (I cut myself only once and that was pushing the shaver too hard into my face.</li>
            <li> ; half the noise of all prior razors;  I don&#x27;t always shave every day and my beard lays down causing me to either use the trimmer or shave extra long with lots of irritation.  </li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin and usually after shaving (electric and Mach 3)</li>
            <li> Hair pulls do happen, mainly due to the design of the 3rd center blade.  </li>
            <li> My whiskers come in a bit faster and stiffer than average, but nothing drastic, and it takes multiple passes to do the job.</li>
            <li> but I think its just above average.</li>
            <li> I suppose my only complaint it that the battery only last for 4 shaves.</li>
            <li> Ordinarily I charge once a week, but recently I forgot and ran out of juice and discovered that it will not run while the shaver is plugged in to the charger--a minor inconvenience as it charged enough to use in a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve sometimes had to \\&quot;finish up\\&quot; with a blade razor over parts that my old Panasonic didn&#x27;t do well on, but I don&#x27;t have a problem at all with this model.</li>
            <li> However, it has become unpleasantly loud in the past six months.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver about 2 months ago, and it is only average in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> but I was tired of the pretty coloured ladies shavers that did nothing.  </li>
            <li> Now it will be harder to know when to charge and how long to charge it for.  </li>
            <li> This one gives a pretty poor shave.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about 5 months ago about switching to an electric razor, but I trusted the reviews on Amazon and spurred by my need for a more efficient and time saving shaving solution, I decided to purchase this Panasonic.</li>
            <li> It is funny how a manufacturer &amp;#34;improves&amp;#34; a product and makes it worse.  </li>
            <li> The parts for this Panasonic aren&#x27;t too expensive, and I bought a full set with the shaver just to have them on hand.</li>
            <li> Rough and abrasive shaves that were the cause of razor bumps, ingrown hairs, and raw skin, and these effects increased throughout the day, making my skin extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li> and you can use it wet or dry which he prefers dry.  </li>
            <li> Even though it can be used either wet or dry, I find myself using it dry almost every morning.  </li>
            <li> several times.&lt;br /&gt;the battery seems to run down fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li> May break down adn try the Braun one in the similar price range.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what brings it down into value pricing, especially with Amazon discounts.  </li>
            <li> My beard actually slows the blades down.</li>
            <li> Charging only takes one hour if the battery is completely down</li>
            <li> Started off with a Remington and was not happy, it would take forever to produce only a halfway decent shave.    </li>
            <li> it gets down to ten percent it flashes to remind me</li>
            <li> It does the trick on my facial hair, gets the hair down almost flush with the skin.</li>
            <li> Only down side is it&#x27;s not impact resistant--blame the operator not the machine....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a simple up and down...</li>
            <li> I give it a ten thumbs down...</li>
            <li> This does knock down the stubble well enough</li>
            <li> - the power supply is a little noisy while charging -- it&#x27;s such a minor issue</li>
            <li> It is a little strange though, it does not want to glide over the upper lip, it seems  to not want to move, so I rotate it.</li>
            <li> Thought this would be limited to dry shaving and tried wet shaving (shaving cream and / or in the shower)</li>
            <li> I use it dry and wet, on my face and on my head, and have never had a single issue with it.</li>
            <li> An extremely close shave that will leave you skin raw and cause more skin irritation than any regular razor or a uneven shave that looks like you just decided to randomly press the razor against several spots on your skin and then just stopped there.      </li>
            <li> This product was chosen as a gift for my 17 year old son, and was based on a recommendation from my oldest son who has a very heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> I had moderately high hopes for this shaver, and expected it to, at least, shave my face well.  </li>
            <li> I know people mentioned that it was loud, but this high pitched buzz is difficult to muffle in the morning&lt;br</li>
            <li> motor does hum a bit loud, but as long as hair is being shaved it seems to dull the hum</li>
            <li> Lastly, I&#x27;ve had the Panasonic for less than six months when it suddently began shutting down involuntarily at 50% battery life left.  </li>
            <li> The first still charges and runs after a few years of use but the blades are dull and it didn&#x27;t have the trimmer</li>
            <li> Simply does not give as close a shave as expected, especially limited on longer hairs of the neck.</li>
            <li> It requires very little fluid if you use the protective cap that comes with this razor as the fluid reservoir.</li>
            <li> This razor is so much better than my old piece of crap Remington triple head razor its not funny.</li>
            <li> I expect to get at least 5 years from this new shaver&#x27;s battery.</li>
            <li> At the least, panasonic ought to send me a new set of blades to see if that would help</li>
            <li> The battery life indicator seems to be rather dumb, the shaver does charge very quickly and holds a charge long enough to work for at least 2-3 weeks off charge, but the indicator predictably drops by 10% intervals every morning that you use the shaver.  </li>
            <li> Most importantly -- other than pulling hairs occasionally (particularly when battery is low) and missing hairs occasionally (probably at least partly an operator error) -- this one does NOT burn or chafe as badly as my rotary or manual razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to find any negatives about it, I would say that the flip-up trimmer is kinda weak, it tends to bog down and miss hair if you plunge it into a patch of thick beard, but if you&#x27;re patient it works ok.  </li>
            <li> The only negative I&#x27;d point out (and it&#x27;s a small one) is that the on/off switch is right in the center of the unit, and because of my hand position when I&#x27;m operating it, I&#x27;ve accidentally turned it off; no big deal, I&#x27;m just re-training my hand to keep the thumb off of dead center.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle and efficient cutting...</li>
            <li> It can be used either wet or dry and cleans easily with cold water when done shaving.  </li>
            <li> I am about to do that having gone back to Amazon to get the invoice to show my proofof purchase and had the razor for less than 6 months.    </li>
            <li> You can choose between wet or dry shaving.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it dry, wet, and with shaving cream -</li>
            <li> It functions well wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> Whether wet or dry</li>
            <li> I had this same model previously and used for about 3 years until the battery gave out on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve charged it only once, and after using it a half dozen times, the charge indicator shows 90%.   </li>
            <li> I use it in dry mode, but you can use it wet if you prefer.</li>
            <li> I tried shaving both wet &amp; dry and found no difference.</li>
            <li> but the results were the same as my previous all-dry tests.  </li>
            <li> wet use or dry use.  </li>
            <li> The shaver head design is similar to the Braun I was looking at, but at half the price.  </li>
            <li> I can tell ya, if it fails for any reason, I&#x27;ll be looking for the exact same model.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic shaver is a solid piece of equipment backed by a 30 day money back guarantee if you&#x27;re not satisfied.  </li>
            <li> It does not give a close shave (dry or wet).</li>
            <li> I have tried them several times in the past - from a Remington foil type my dad got me when I was 16 to a Norelco rotary in my 30&#x27;s and a Braun Series 3 several years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dry shaving with it and would imagine a wet shave would be even easier.  </li>
            <li> I typically use about 10% battery per shave, so it will definitely last a week before needing a charge.</li>
            <li> (my previous one was the same model).  </li>
            <li> I plugged the charger into it last night and it was charged to 100% in less than 90 minutes.</li>
            <li> Wet and Dry</li>
            <li> However, what they don&#x27;t tell you is that, if you do end up washing the razor or having a wet shave - and you let it air dry</li>
            <li> , I prefer to use it dry instead of wet.</li>
            <li> It stays in my ruck sack and will keep enough charge for me to shave every day for about a week and a half without a charge.</li>
            <li> It can shave wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> My two ES8103S shavers have averaged about a year and a half lifespan (although my current razor is still usable).</li>
            <li> Only slight criticism is that the charging pack is USA spec</li>
            <li> I tried it with a Dry face, a wet face, and using baby oil.  </li>
            <li> Works wet or dry or even in the shower.  </li>
            <li> wet or dry</li>
            <li> i tried it wet, dry, with shaving cream, with shaving gel.</li>
            <li> Unit is made in China (surprise!), but compares well to the German made&lt;br /&gt;Braun shavers previously owned.</li>
            <li> I have been using it dry, but may give the wet test soon.</li>
            <li> Yet it STILL takes me 8-10 minutes to shave (wet or dry) using the ES8103S.</li>
            <li> No pulling or chafeing, or electric razor burn using it both wet and dry.</li>
            <li> It works well wet or dry...</li>
            <li> At the same time it&#x27;s considerably less money than the ES8109.</li>
            <li> Can be use both, wet and dry.  </li>
            <li> Lot less time used for the same end result</li>
            <li> my husband was looking for a wet dry chaver.  </li>
            <li> Last, I would not remove the blades unless replacing them because they have seated themselves with the foil and reversing may render a less close shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So as a dry shaver, I&#x27;d rate this one three stars, but as a wet shaver five stars.</li>
            <li> Change the blades about once a year, runs wet + dry.</li>
            <li> Also, if you can use it both wet and dry</li>
            <li> In wet mode it seemed to shave my face, and in dry mode it seemed to also shave my face.</li>
            <li> You can also use this wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I usually have to essentially scrub my face with this shaver to get solid results, and I didn&#x27;t expect to have to do this.  </li>
            <li> me, the wet / dry shave ability is the clincher.  </li>
            <li> Works wet or dry</li>
            <li> Only reason did not give it 5 stars, is you do have to past repeatedly over same areas but it does closest shave of my 3 electric razors that I have owned in my 50+ years.</li>
            <li> I am using this as a wet shaver after having used dry shavers for decades.  </li>
            <li> You can also use it wet and dry</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to push and stretch and repeatedly go over stubble that would otherwise be left by my previous shavers.  </li>
            <li> I have no particular complaints with it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver for my personal use that was suggested by ny son for a replacement of previous shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried wet and dry shave, putting more/less pressure, nothing works.</li>
            <li> This electric is much smaller than my previous razor</li>
            <li> I had come to expect a wet and dry shaver</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dropped it several times over the past 5 years but not recently.</li>
            <li> Replaces an earlier identical gift to a brother who had the battery finally fail on his first Panasonic.</li>
            <li> have used this both wet and dry.</li>
            <li> This razor shaves both wet or dry.</li>
            <li> a half hour later it still showed 10%.</li>
            <li> In less than a year, the digital display failed--so I could no longer monitor the amount of charge remaining in the battery.</li>
            <li> It has an option wet or dry.</li>
            <li> In the last 6 months it&#x27;s sold here twice for less than $55.00,</li>
            <li> Can use wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> wet / dry feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used every other day due to its initial effectiveness.</li>
            <li> report on the wet / dry feature</li>
            <li> Not to mention the waterproof feature which allows for dry and wet shaving.</li>
            <li> i have shaved wet with shaving cream and dry.</li>
            <li> Wet, dry, angle, sweet-talk ...</li>
            <li> Also, you CAN NOT use this plugged in, as a previous person wrote in their extensive review.</li>
            <li> I tried every technique I could think of (wet, dry, soap, no soap,</li>
            <li> Big advantage is comfort and less irritation.</li>
            <li> Wet or dry.</li>
            <li> does close shaving, wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> after two weeks my face is smoother and less red</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d previously been using a cheapo, generic foil shaver</li>
            <li> this is like the 5th Panasonic wet and dry</li>
            <li> I purchased the Panasonic ES8103 after going through a number of razors in the previous ten years.</li>
            <li> The only criticism I have (and it is slight) is that it doesn&#x27;t cut longer hairs well.</li>
            <li> With past electric razors, I have HAD to ensure that I shave daily in order to prevent having my beard yanked out while shaving on the 2nd day.</li>
            <li> The only small compliant he had was when he was in the shower he missed just a tiny piece on the curve of his chin even though he said he shaved there.</li>
            <li> I have used it both wet and dry</li>
            <li> I have had several electric razors in the past and always ended up going back to a blade.  </li>
            <li> Wet or dry flexible and this is a plus to me.  </li>
            <li> you want to save money, you can spend less and get a very similar shave.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what I could have gained by purchasing a much more expensive razor.</li>
            <li> I use it both wet and dry.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is wet or dry.</li>
            <li> You can use it wet or dry, so I can shave any time of the day.</li>
            <li> works well close shave with either wet or dry application</li>
            <li> but I am captivated enough to try their Arc IV which adds an additional blade with the hopes it will take less passings to shave.  </li>
            <li> but I am captivated enough to try their Arc IV which adds an additional blade with the hopes it will take less passings to shave.  </li>
            <li> It is noisier that my Norelco, but also it has a speed of 13000 rpm&#x27;s, while the Norelco has only half the speed.</li>
            <li> But you may get lucky and have it covered under warranty if it fails before that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who has been wrestling with an expensive brand, self-cleaning electric shaver that started off working well, but quickly went downhill.  </li>
            <li> Electric shavers are EXPENSIVE (luckily, this one was on sale, for under $70</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a well made little machine, but, it doesn&#x27;t like cutting into hair more than .0055334 microns long.</li>
            <li> after I first used the shaver I noticed (just under my lip, above my chin) were approximately a dozen little sores (they looked like zits).  </li>
            <li> It gives a really nice close shave, and even gets the hairs around my neck and throat with little effort, which were impossible with my Norelco.</li>
            <li> This razor gives me an acceptably close shave in a short time with little irritation, even when I shave dry.</li>
            <li> I agree with other comments about the body not as substantail as my earlier Panosonic (late 80&#x27;s!); however, today&#x27;s materials tend to be stronger and lighter, so my hopes remain high</li>
            <li> Not much but enough that I&#x27;d rather not have to wipe down the sink when I&#x27;m pressed for time.  </li>
            <li> Though, the manual suggest two weeks of shaves should be expected from a single battery charge, I doubt that it will happen - after three shaves</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard, but this little gem gets it after just a few easy passes.  </li>
            <li> My positive experience with this shaver was the driving force behind my decision to purchase another Panasonic model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My positive experience with this shaver was the driving force behind my decision to purchase another Panasonic model.    </li>
            <li> the only advantage this has is the mess.  </li>
            <li> Hope it stays sharp and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This shaves extremely close and stays charged for a long time.</li>
            <li> I like the indicator; the battery lasts long; the shaving is smoother than in other shavers; and I like it that it is washable.</li>
            <li> Let me start my review by saying, if you&#x27;re looking for an electric shaver that won&#x27;t mangle your neck into a red blotchy mess, look no further!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I have to spend twice as long shaving than I do with my other razor.</li>
            <li> Must make several sweeps over the same areas to secure a close shave..  Disappointed</li>
            <li> i tried the Braun ultrasonic after having great luck with my ultrasonic toothbrush, but I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed, considering all the great reviews.</li>
            <li> My old one survived a couple of knocks off the counter over the years -- -- unlikely the new razor will fare as well.  </li>
            <li> The design is little different from my previous Panasonics, same head dimensions.  </li>
            <li> so i bought the inner and outer foil and when bad very quick this time</li>
            <li> The replacement lasted 10 months before its display started going out, so I replaced it with a Panasonic Arc-4 ESLA63s, which has a slightly faster vibration speed and more cutting blades.</li>
            <li> Panasonics can be used wet or dry, but I have not used them wet</li>
            <li> This product works well wet or dry, but if your going to use wet buy the gel that foams not the foa out of a can.</li>
            <li> do like the ability to use the razor in the shower (i.e. wet) or at the sink (i.e. wet or dry)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it wet and dry - wet</li>
            <li> I have tried it wet and dry and wet</li>
            <li> the subject indicates, my experience in the wet condition was not as you can see it in the TV commercial.</li>
            <li> Only drawback is it does not get into tight places well, like under the nose or close to ears.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and with previous electrics, I couldn&#x27;t shave within 24 hours of a previous shave due to razor burn/sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the wet shave; it actually seems to go a little faster than dry although it definitely takes a little longer than shaving with the Fusion.  </li>
            <li> This is somewhat of a disappointment as the razor continues to deliver a close shave and is otherwise a fine product.</li>
            <li> The only problem is a small area on my neck where the whiskers seem to lie flat instead of standing up.  </li>
            <li> I opened this order, a terrible surprise, the original box from my ES8103S was already opened and immediately realize a used product full of (someone) beard on it.</li>
            <li> I use the trimmer only every other day on average.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first due to the &amp;#34;different&#x27; shape of the shaver compared to my old school Remington MS2-390 but, now couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Because he viewed the shaver as essentially &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34; item, with an expected useful life of two years, the decision was made to go with the 20% less expensive</li>
            <li> I replaced a Remington triple header, MS3-2000 that I had used to several years because the battery was wearing down to the point where I had to recharge it every other day plus it seemed to be getting so noisey.</li>
            <li> I know he&#x27;s planning on taking it with him on his next deployment to make his life a little easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d had enough of the scraped-raw feeling and the little droplets of blood.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had all major brands in the past.</li>
            <li> I still wince when I intentionally put water on an electric shaver, but you remove the foil, put some liquid soap on the blades, put the foil back on with a little water and run it.</li>
            <li> so I was looking for something a little smaller and lighter.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Shaving takes a little longer compared to a regular razor.</li>
            <li> A little louder than my last electric shaver.</li>
            <li> though it&#x27;s definitely functional &amp; shaves comfortably w a little shave gel.</li>
            <li> With pre-shave oil and/or shaving gel it only improved the results by a little.</li>
            <li> big discount，but make a little noise</li>
            <li> I believe I would have fewer ingrown hairs if the foils left the hair a little longer.  </li>
            <li> When using the Philips rotary I always used to end up with a little bit of irritation in the areas where I had to use the shaver multiple times to get a closer shave.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic gives me a closer shave although the sideburn trimmer is a little smaller.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, it works with a little big noise.</li>
            <li> It is taking me a little longer to shave than with the blade, but especially above the mouth, the shave is closer than the blade.</li>
            <li> My beard grows fast and is fairly tough.  </li>
            <li> He has a very thick n fast growing beard.</li>
            <li> Even after replacing the foil three times the blades continue to hit the new foil and in the past they quickly broke through and resulted in cutting my face.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the display can be a little flaky in its read out when getting wet.  </li>
            <li> works as expected, my last one lasted a little over 4 years</li>
            <li> I must admit that with a little practice, this shaver gives me a close shave comparable to wet shaving with double edged razors, without the occassional nicks.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a flat face, &amp; I typically shave every 2 or 3 days.</li>
            <li> My third complaint has been the screens that fail to pick up the stray fine hairs that seem to sprout around the lower neck area.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Still haven&#x27;t used it in the shower and probably never will - old habits die hard</li>
            <li> The extreme negative is it doesn&#x27;t count down the time left before re-charging; it shows only a \\&quot;low battery\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The only negative thing for me is the NOISE this little razor is LOUD as in humming with its linear motor..very noisy when I use it at 5am..</li>
            <li> I do like the ease of cleaning it, and the ability to use it wet or dry, but I think other than the ease of using an electric razor on him in bed, I believe I&#x27;d prefer using a disposable razor for closeness and comfor.</li>
            <li> Due to irritations, for the last year and a half</li>
            <li> As advertised, it works extremely well for dry or wet shaves.  </li>
            <li> I have to turn the shaver in circles to get but not the shavers fault as the other three previous shavers I&#x27;ve used were the same way.  </li>
            <li> Blades were also so expensive and hard to find for my favorite Hydro 3 (Schick).  </li>
            <li> His hair is fairly coarse (which I would say regular man&#x27;s facial hair) but very thick.  </li>
            <li> AT830) is very slow and doesn&#x27;t shave close enough requiring multiple passes over the same areas taking 3 times longer than it should.  </li>
            <li> The other annoying thing about the flip-up trimmer is that you can only effectively use it in a downward motion, if you push up ever so slightly, it starts to flip shut and disengages from the motor.  </li>
            <li> Granted, since my experience is limited to just a few electric brands, there may be other electrics that work equally well...or gasp...</li>
            <li> I bought this newer Panasonic shaver because the cost of replacing the foil and blades of my previous  5-blade Panasonic cost almost as much as this new, less expensive shaver.    </li>
            <li> After spending almost $200 on the top of the line Braun I decided this was not so bad after all.</li>
            <li> decided to try an electric shaver despite bad experiences many years ago.  </li>
            <li> I use the shaver with a light shaving cream after a shower, and rinse the foil in cold water while shaving.  </li>
            <li> , so I was kind of stupid for using it for that length of time.</li>
            <li> Most of the time I got frustrated and finished with Gillette razor.</li>
            <li> with this thing is the most painful activity I have ever attempted in my life.</li>
            <li> Normally I would not purchase a product again that has proven to be unreliable - failing during the warranty period is not a good indicator of the product design.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it can not be used corded, as it only turns on when not plugged in.  </li>
            <li> it works better &amp; I am sorry I went and got this Panasonic (it sucks)</li>
            <li> My five year old Norelco doesn&#x27;t lose any charge for at least a month.  </li>
            <li> It is at least twice as loud as the Norelco it replaced.</li>
            <li> I use an electric only for touch up or occasionally for a late day shave.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is that the sideburn trimmer does not have as solid of a feel as my Braun.</li>
            <li> If I had to say anything negative, it&#x27;s a tad loud</li>
            <li> Considerably more expensive but at least I won&#x27;t be irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d usually leave the cleaning fluid in too long, so</li>
            <li> I have a dense course beard and sensitive skin and found that using an electric foil razor gave me the closest shave with the least irritation.</li>
            <li> The battery in this one is small and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> My second complaint has been the ni-cad and NiMH batteries that never seem to last.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews as to where some folks complained it to be too loud ...</li>
            <li> Its soft a doesnt hurt the skin, at least its no my case.</li>
            <li> I just upgraded from an old Braun 7570, circa late 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> One time I did not completely put it back on the body, which made a small hole on the outer blade.</li>
            <li> It also stays charged for at least a couple of weeks for me so far.  </li>
            <li> he has not tried using it as a wet shaver</li>
            <li> The box documents carefully state that you should give your beard \\&quot;some time to adjust to the change\\&quot;, so I did.</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard and this shaver provides a close enough shave without skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the wet shave option yet</li>
            <li> I have not used it wet or in the shower.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it on my face wet</li>
            <li> Can use wet and with cream</li>
            <li> I would expect the lithium battery in this to last years and years without having any problems like the nicads, but it is a concern as once the battery dies, it&#x27;s dead as you can&#x27;t use it plugged in.  </li>
            <li> So, minus 1 star for the lower quality shave,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I favor wet, using Proraso shave  cream ,with brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve using a few different Norelco rotary razors over the years.</li>
            <li> I will still use thise one for a while as I like the fact that it is a wet shaver that I can use with a shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> The ability to use it wet is its strongest asset.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it wet</li>
            <li> I have not used it in the wet yet, so</li>
            <li> I have been through a number of electric shavers, and read these reviews carefully before pulling the trigger.</li>
            <li> I did try testing the Panasonic wet and</li>
            <li> There was no advantage shaving wet with the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> It can also be used in the shower, though I prefer shaving after, so I can&#x27;t comment on its wet performance.    </li>
            <li> Used wet with shaving cream it gives me as close a shave as with a hand razor but with no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> Quality construction - heavy, solid feel  </li>
            <li> The $69 spent on this one</li>
            <li> and I use it for wet</li>
            <li> The last couple however, have not wanted to hold a charge after a few months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been blowing it with compressed air once in a while, still have not gotten it wet</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I am going to use it wet because of the additional steps of applying shaving cream and</li>
            <li> I would like a pop out trimmer that isn&#x27;t partially obscured by the shaver&#x27;s head.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a few minutes though.  </li>
            <li> I was used to shave manually and somehow got curious (again) about electric shaving.</li>
            <li> I had a few years back</li>
            <li> I have a horribly rough beard.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the wet option yet.</li>
            <li> i have to shave everyday and found this to not be a close enough shave and feeling</li>
            <li> I received the panasonic es8103 shaver in the expected time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Braun user for 15 years... and expected to buy another one.</li>
            <li> After only a few months the display has stopped working, so I have been having to guess when it needs recharging.  </li>
            <li> The manufacturer claims that you can have a wet shave with this razor - and indeed you can.</li>
            <li> I laugh when I think of the over-engineered cleaning/charging station used by the Braun...expensive, took up needless counterspace, and time consuming.  </li>
            <li> my face smells like a wet nickel after shaving with water.</li>
            <li> I selected this shaver after careful research for a electric shaver for shaving the head</li>
            <li> It has the finesse of a Gillete Mach3 minus the cuts and bruises.  </li>
            <li> It works well and performs as expected.</li>
            <li> Yes, I periodically replace blades and foil; that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> I have never tried shaving wet.</li>
            <li> The worst part is that my husband now spends more time shaving than he did with his old shaver, and it never seems to get close enough.</li>
            <li> It looks like he has a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, even after he just spent 10 minutes shaving.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;s even tried it with a wet shave yet.  </li>
            <li> In this case, we felt our money was well spent.</li>
            <li> I used to have trouble getting the hair on my neck, this razor makes short work of it.</li>
            <li> that I would just wet and use without any shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> it is much harder and will be pain after using it.</li>
            <li> I have used Remington (a few years back) then Braun (2).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve thrown the Norelco into the trash can (minus the battery of course).</li>
            <li> I ahve only had this razor a few days,  Still getting use to it,but it  seems to shavel well.  </li>
            <li> I have not used the wet shave method yet and can not comment on how that method works out.</li>
            <li> I use them wet while showering.</li>
            <li> After some time the display stopped showing information and 2 months later the unit went dead.</li>
            <li> Over all, I would recommend this shaver to anyone, even heavy users such as myself.  </li>
            <li> Even If I go over it forwards or backwards 20 times it still leaves me with patches of fluff.</li>
            <li> The bottom line: this shaver gives me the closed shave ever</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had to do this with the 8103 yet, but I&#x27;ve only had it a few months.</li>
            <li> and even then it seems like it just won&#x27;t get those last few pesky hairs.  </li>
            <li> It took only a few shaves for me to get used to using it.</li>
            <li> Have not tried wet yet but intend to.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few razors over the years and gave up on all of them and went back to a blade.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I expected it to outshine Braun.</li>
            <li> I never really use electric shavers before  </li>
            <li> I prefer a wet shave, and this shaver performs&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used it wet</li>
            <li> Admittedly a remote chance but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this electric razor every day for the last few weeks.</li>
            <li> This razor gives as close a shave as using a blade when shaving using shaving cream, or a wet shave.</li>
            <li> on wet shave</li>
            <li> The user manual states that the shaver should supply roughly 14 shaves of 3 minutes each when fully charged.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t dare get it wet.</li>
            <li> Wet shaving with blade will allow a closer shave but takes longer.</li>
            <li> Delivery as I expected.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after reading reviews of a number of men with extra heavy beards got</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s expected.</li>
            <li> No real complaints.  </li>
            <li> I have used Remington electric razors for decades going back to a few of the corded type.</li>
            <li> Have not tried the wet shaving feature.</li>
            <li> but if you are careful not to leave it somewhere when out of town, then you should have nothing to worry about.     </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it performs with a wet shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum...</li>
            <li> I had never before done wet shaving with an electric shaver, but will continue doing so now.</li>
            <li> It still shaves well as a wet shaver.</li>
            <li> I cannot speak to its wet shaving capabilities.</li>
            <li> I decided to use water for the wet mode (cheapest) and air for the \\&quot;dry\\&quot; mode (plentiful).</li>
            <li> Absolutely no razor burn.  </li>
            <li> have never tried the wet shave option.  </li>
            <li> After a few hours of online research and reading numerous reviews, I bought this shaver.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the &#x27;wet&#x27; option, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it four stars instead of five only because I feel like, for the price, it should include a cradle, and because of my concern about the charging contacts standing up to rust over a few years.  </li>
            <li> This is a pity.</li>
            <li> and of course you can use it wet, even in the shower if you want.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t use the razor wet</li>
            <li> I do think the wet soap on my face helped.</li>
            <li> The way I shave, with the wet soap.</li>
            <li> but this is NOT NORMAL use since he takes an extended amount of time shaving due to his issues.</li>
            <li> the automatic cleaner is a total waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I have a medium to heavy beard and don&#x27;t use it daily.  </li>
            <li> I have not tried wet shaving with it yet</li>
            <li> Louder than expected.</li>
            <li> I am a lifelong user of electric shavers, and I have owned this shaver for over one year.</li>
            <li> never once dropped it or ever used it as a wet shaver (even though it was designed for it).</li>
            <li> faucet image when needs cleaning (showed that sight once after 10 shaves)&lt;br /&gt;lock (used to lock the head) is slipping sometimes with force causing mobility of head</li>
            <li> Went from a razor to this product without the pain expected.  </li>
            <li> When you use this one wet, it is as close as I remember a blade to be.</li>
            <li> Never tested it in wet.</li>
            <li> and was rough.  </li>
            <li> I called the support line and was told I needed to take it to a service center, since they didn&#x27;t show that icon as something that should be there.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s plugged in and you decided to use it WET</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> It does that well when it works, and shaves well also, but the sideburn trimmer started giving me trouble and finally got so unreliable</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shave wet or in the shower, so that&#x27;s not why I purchase this.</li>
            <li> i drag it.</li>
            <li> You have to keep going over and over your face, which results in missed hair and not a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> came just as expected</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago the LCD display started acting up and became unreadable; however this did not seem to affect the shaver function, so I continued to use it thinking it would become my travel razor.</li>
            <li> doing a wet shave&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does work either wet or&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the closest shave, I use the Arc 3 wet with &amp;#34;Kiss</li>
            <li> Just empty the hair clippings, and rinse the blade under running water</li>
            <li> Minimal irritation and no cuts.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give a closed shave</li>
            <li> I tried a wet shave with it</li>
            <li> It is also not very noisy</li>
            <li> I did not use this razor wet</li>
            <li> battery lasted forever, and it worked wet and</li>
            <li> ive only shaved with it a few times....</li>
            <li> TOTALLY dissapointed, dont waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> The only negative is with this type of open face razor, you need to be bending over a sink because it does not capture all the shaved hair (be careful if wearing a shirt)</li>
            <li> and I was curious to try a newer model.  </li>
            <li> I came across Panasonic wet shavers about a decade ago.</li>
            <li> BUT... be careful if you have any moles or bumps on your skin.</li>
            <li> I have not used it wet.  </li>
            <li> I never use it wet, so I can&#x27;t attest to how well it works in that regard.</li>
            <li> I think the wet shave has made the difference.</li>
            <li> if I shave every day there are some areas on my face that require a repeat performance and, even under wet conditions, this causes my face to react.</li>
            <li> In replacing it I opted for an update to the ES8103S because I like the linear drive, wet</li>
            <li> Looking back at my purchases, it seems this razor lasts me about 3 years while shaving a heavy beard 25 of 30 days of the month.</li>
            <li> It was not too heavy or too big.  </li>
            <li> I will come back after a few months and add comments about how the battery holds up.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels rough after I am done.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the machine both wet and dry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I shave wet now to achieve the results I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Panasonic ES8103S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet</li>
            <li> One plastic part that invariably breaks after two to three years use, is the one that moves the center blade.  </li>
            <li> I do not use it on wet hair</li>
            <li> Plan on re-rating to 5 stars if it holds up over the next few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> definately gives a closer shave, however it is harder to get everywhere in the shower.</li>
            <li> I was told by the service center after sending it in.</li>
            <li> I tried wet shaving with this razor using &#x27;king of shaves&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given up on the wet shaving.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really any closer at this point for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not particularly fast,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still have not tried the wet shave yet but will do so over the coming weekend.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried to use it in the shower because there is no real need to.</li>
            <li> I did not notice an improvement, and perhaps the wet shaving isn&#x27;t as close for me.</li>
            <li> This razor will leave longer hairs and does minimal shaving all around.  </li>
            <li> Should have spent the money on another Remington or Braun</li>
            <li> I have not tried it, but this shaver can be used wet.</li>
            <li> I have not tried to use it as a wet shaver though.</li>
            <li> hesitate, this is money well spent.</li>
            <li> and if it lasts like the last one did, I should be set for quite a few years.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this shaver and used it for approximately 6 months.</li>
            <li> I am a lifelong blade shaver, and I needed something I could use for travel and convenience.</li>
            <li> , let&#x27;s just say I was tempted to go back to Schick quite a few times.</li>
            <li> only a few bumps on my jawline and neck</li>
            <li> CAN SHAVE WET OR DRY.&lt;br /&gt;CONSUMERS REPORTS RATES</li>
            <li> I have to shave over the same spot a few times to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> it was not as close a shave as I expected;</li>
            <li> I spent tons of time shaving with this</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a lot easier to trim compared to a wet blade.</li>
            <li> It works well with wet shaving cream.</li>
            <li> The Electric Razor does not shave as close as I expected.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this shaver in the shower so can&#x27;t rate it on its wet performance].</li>
            <li> Now, the only way I know it needs a charge is when it goes dead.</li>
            <li> and if I let my beard grow for a couple of days I just do a wet shave with shaving cream and don&#x27;t have any skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> Be careful not to bang or drop the foils</li>
            <li> wet</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use shavers wet</li>
            <li> My face looks just like I had a shave with the Gillet razor minus no burning and</li>
            <li> not much time spent.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve owned a wide variety of electric razors.  </li>
            <li> I WILL GO BACK TO THE 3 HEADED ROUND SHAVER.</li>
            <li> My allergy bumps have almost 99.99% cleared up, and the few remaining are constantly shrinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you go without shaving for 2-4 days it has a harder time with that length of hair.  </li>
            <li> think that using a brush on a razor dulls the blades.  </li>
            <li> Just a minimal amount of gel was required.</li>
            <li> My two minor gripes are: (a) the battery life isn&#x27;t exactly phenomenal (I&#x27;m getting about 10 shaves on a charge v. 14 per users&#x27; manual), and (b) the spiffing 0% - 100% battery indicator is just for show; it moves in 10% increments just like a 10-segment LED.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got thick, course Italian hair, and it grows in different directions on my neck.  </li>
            <li> Even more annoying is the beard trimmer, which is clearly of low quality construction.</li>
            <li> After several months, the screen went blank and the battery slowly stopped charging.</li>
            <li> A bit loud and a bit slow, but never a knick.  </li>
            <li> Worse yet, I developed the same ingrown hairs I&#x27;ve been trying to avoid for years.</li>
            <li> My husband used to shave once a week using a razor because he has sensitive skin, but mostly because he just hated shaving.  </li>
            <li> One last tip, even if your facial hair grows slow you should still use it once a day.  </li>
            <li> liked their stereos etc., but was doubtful as to how they would do with razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only other issue, it is a little on the noisy side.</li>
            <li> He said the razor might be getting a little dull, cause it takes a little longer to shave than it did when he first started using it, but he still loves it.</li>
            <li> The foils are very slim and sharp, so there&#x27;s no irritation, but at the same time you could blindly hit and drag this thing across your face and never cut yourself.</li>
            <li> The battery charges quickly, holds the charge a long time and with yearly replacement of the cutting foils the shaver works well.</li>
            <li> The problem is after you use the wet shaving the dry shaving seem average.</li>
            <li> The cutting blocks don&#x27;t seem to oscillate as quickly, and the motor actually slows down as I get to the denser section of my chin.  </li>
            <li> Skin was left red, raw, and bloody and gave me many ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Note: must shave daily if not very good on long hairs.  </li>
            <li> In my estimation the tilt head may be an asset, but I&#x27;m not certain it&#x27;s a necessity.  </li>
            <li> If cut too short, my stiff neck hairs grow horizontally and then under my skin causing the ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My previous shaver had a self-cleaning system and I found it to be noisy and the cleaning process took quite a long time.    </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take a long time for me to get all the stubble (unlike my previous razor), and works will even if I go a couple days without shaving.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as noisy as his previous shavers.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s cut my upper lip very, very slightly</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do a worse job than other brands or models, but I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s much</li>
            <li> the interceptor cutter between the foils irritates the skin just as bad as razor burn, if not worse because you don&#x27;t even get a decent shave with this product.</li>
            <li> The foil is then easily removed by depressing two black buttons on either side of the razor head.  </li>
            <li> I find that shaving dry rather than wet gives the closest shave and requires less cleaning of the head.  </li>
            <li> and I spent the day with an itchy neck and redness due to that.</li>
            <li> Other than it&#x27;s not advisable to leave them in a wet environment after use.  </li>
            <li> I did try a wet face shave but found this shaver, like all other electrics I have tried, just can&#x27;t compare to a blade.</li>
            <li> At first glance I will admit that I was confused and a little alarmed.</li>
            <li> I have yet to use it wet due to  reviews I&#x27;ve read of the display shorting out.</li>
            <li> and I may have to use it every day (instead of every other) in order to not look too rough,</li>
            <li> After wasting a lot of money on the other shavers, I spent a lot of time researching before settling on this shaver.</li>
            <li> The cutting blades actually dive away from the cutting screen when presented with a strong beard and it doesn&#x27;t even cut the hair much.</li>
            <li> Very quick and efficient, yes it is a little loud but not in annoying way.</li>
            <li> Very quick and efficient, yes it is a little loud but not in annoying way.</li>
            <li> Keeps a very long charge  Blades are very sharp  </li>
            <li> It will, however, give me a good-enough-for-the-office shave in about the same amount of time and with less mess.</li>
            <li> Simply rub a little liquid soap over the head and hold down the power button until it enters Turbo Mode which oscillates the blade at 17,000 rpms.</li>
            <li> but I could care less as long as I continue to get a close shave!</li>
            <li> The travel electric left me raw with ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> The razors always left my skin a bit raw and the prep work felt like a choir.</li>
            <li> The sound is not quiet (as others have pointed out) and quite high-pitched, but I don&#x27;t find it painfully so and it is still quieter than my previous shaver.</li>
            <li> But the unreliable display is a serious inconvenience, and is clearly a problem with this model.</li>
            <li> While running, it makes a funny buzzing noise with different tone when it is cutting.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave as close as other electric razors I have had, but I have absolutely no skin irritation, which I have gotten from every other razor I have used.</li>
            <li> It does provide a close shave but also creates serious razor burn on sensitive skin ..</li>
            <li> Look pretty, but the sound is horrible.</li>
            <li> A higher pitched buzz, similar in volume to the Braun, louder than a rotary, but closer cutting than either.</li>
            <li> This one&#x27;s about half as loud and heavy as one from a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> but the amount of crap being produced has many people buying cheap crap because when they buy a supposed quality brand these days they are actually buying the same quality as off brand junk.</li>
            <li> The charge is about 1 hr from below 10% to full, which can stand for approximate 20 shavings at least.</li>
            <li> Decent, not great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done traditional wet shaving for the last few years and was getting slightly tired of all the time it takes to shave properly.</li>
            <li> After one year of using this shaver, I still hate it as much as the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> This is low, because I&#x27;m at the age where I spend a little time with the trimmer removing hairs from places I&#x27;d rather they didn&#x27;t grow!</li>
            <li> not a very smooth shave easy to use and lightweight but not sure why it was so expensive</li>
            <li> Dry shaving leaves my beard with little stubble and  wet shaving is as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li> It is a little smaller and maybe less robust but seems to do the job for me.  </li>
            <li> I end up using a disposable razor to get the hairs the Panasonic missed, after wearing the battery &amp; my face down by 30% just trying to get the last few hairs.</li>
            <li> biggest complaint though was the big mess this shaver makes the entire time you use it.  </li>
            <li> That is a major negative for me.</li>
            <li> Too slow and not sharp at all.  </li>
            <li> I am not down on this shaver mind you, but I feel some of the reviewers went a little overboard.</li>
            <li> The secret is the high motor speed.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend if you were tired of blade prices</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this replacing my Gillette Fusion but the quality of the shave is a lot worse with the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> I end up having to make several passes in all different directions, and even then there are a few hairs left behind.</li>
            <li> I do not normally purchase Panasonic items, however the previous reviews and cost convinced me to try this.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to replace a 6 year old ES8077 shaver which was no longer giving close shaves even with a new cutting block and foil.  </li>
            <li> This razor has caused very little irritation over the last year plus.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type that has very little to shave, only mustache area, chin and neck, couldn&#x27;t grow a beard if I tried, and it couldn&#x27;t even handle</li>
            <li> It is less irritating and much easier to maintain.</li>
            <li> - You can&#x27;t go wrong with this shaver for fast dry close face/neck shave.</li>
            <li> The actual cutting surface of the head is so small that you have to really work hard to cover your face in any reasonable time.</li>
            <li> I waited more than 6 months to write a review, just to see how this would last - BAD!</li>
            <li> no good for two day old shaves.  </li>
            <li> Not good to sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li> In general, will do with it, there is no handy in hope</li>
            <li> Took away one star due to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product comes with a money back guarantee if not satisfied.  </li>
            <li> &quot; a two or three days growth when I&#x27;m too lazy to shave properly.  </li>
            <li> The only drawbacks one might discover is the louder buzz this shaver emits while working and the tendency to heat up considerably after about two minutes of cutting (which is actually beneficial on some chillier mornings).</li>
            <li> I have not used it for wet shaving yet, but do look forward to taking advantage of that feature too!</li>
            <li> I had the other brands</li>
            <li> BTW, shaving with a razor took me 20-25 minutes due to the coarseness,thickness and curly whiskers.  </li>
            <li> I have read other reviews about it.</li>
            <li> Cannot use a blade due to irritation and ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I had 2 other kinds of electric razor&#x27;s &amp; they did not shave my beard well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a few stragglers that get missed and grow long, this shaver doesn&#x27;t do that - it never misses a hair.</li>
            <li> - No pain on my neck, unlike all other razors I&#x27;ve owned   - Dry/Wet shaver.  </li>
            <li> I never found the Norelcos really satisfactory; slow, irritating, not close, but they&#x27;re quiet.    </li>
            <li> The trimmer is also pretty useless.</li>
            <li> I used both shavers for 3 weeks, shaving one side of my face with the Panasonic and the other side of my face with the Norelco.  </li>
            <li> Other:  The Panasonic has a built-in trimmer, the Norelco requires that you remove the shaving head and pop on the trimmer head.  </li>
            <li> : Takes some getting used to, not exactly contoured to a face, unit takes up lots of room in a dopp kit&lt;br</li>
            <li> MY other razor has been retired permanently.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t even tried it as a wet shave yet!  </li>
            <li> I replace screens every year and cutters every other year.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a bargain compared to some of the other shavers on the market.</li>
            <li> Due to the economy I didn&#x27;t feel I could afford to replace my Braun with another $250 electric razor.  </li>
            <li> Shaves in 1/4 the time that it takes with other models.</li>
            <li> Removing the foil holder and rinsing it and the inner blades separately under the running water is usually sufficient.  </li>
            <li> Other than that I&#x27;ve no complaints.</li>
            <li> No more shaver dying mid shave before work and showing up looking like a bum (unless you are a bum by profession, in which case you would like that).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to get a lot on my neck when using a three blade razor (or something like it) and even other electric shavers.</li>
            <li> but i guess thats due to the nature of my beared.</li>
            <li> The shaver seems to get quite hot after a prolonged usage, which can be uncomfortable for some.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about other shavers</li>
            <li> will advise in due course</li>
            <li> I have read other reviews and my conclusion is that the quality of the shave depends on your beard thickness.</li>
            <li> Yea, it cost $70, but it will pay for itself in just over 2 months of replacing my other razor heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ONE OTHER THING -</li>
            <li> Had never happened to me on any other Braun.  </li>
            <li> but since this is my first electric razor ill mention it.</li>
            <li> This also has a cleaning mode to help keep the blades sharp longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d leave my other models plugged in overnight or longer.</li>
            <li> This razor does not shave as close as a blade, but neither does any other electric razor I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I take it into the field with me when I do military training as well, and it stands up to everything!</li>
            <li> But i have other units to trim with</li>
            <li> I had tried other electric razors before, but they pulled and burned.</li>
            <li> It may work well on other types of beards but my beard is a challenge it can&#x27;t meet.</li>
            <li> Apparently, Panasonic doesn&#x27;t approve of Americans working overseas, or at least doesn&#x27;t want Americans to shave while they are overseas.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is small, but not a big deal.  </li>
            <li> One day with one and another day with the other.</li>
            <li> I have only used Norelco rotary razors in the past.</li>
            <li> I was just disappointed that the battery could not do better (overcome by rapid recharging).  </li>
            <li> Other than not doing what it was built for.</li>
            <li> My husband can use other razors without problems and we followed instructions.</li>
            <li> Any other electric razor does not come close to the shaving ability of this razor.  </li>
            <li> I shave every other day</li>
            <li> One other small issue is that it won&#x27;t run when it&#x27;s plugged in and charging, so cordless only.</li>
            <li> There is a small piece of plastic that comes in contact with this tiny vibrating arm.</li>
            <li> personally have used \\&quot;Magic\\&quot; shaving depilatory for the past 12 yrs now</li>
            <li> The ES8103S shaves no better than my only ES8043SC did.  </li>
            <li> I have no experience with the Braun or other</li>
            <li> Almost close shave if I shave &amp;#34;every other day&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The unit is extremely quiet in  comparison to other electrics I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  </li>
            <li> I can go almost 2 weeks on &amp;#34;10% charge&amp;#34;, shaving every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10, would recomend</li>
            <li> Cleanup is very simple small amount of soap and water</li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t try to use this to trim other parts of the body...</li>
            <li> I will recommend this product to other</li>
            <li> The reason for all this is to reduce oxidation of the blades sharp edges.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s faster, smoother, closer and gentler than the other Panasonics, Norelco 3 head rotary wet/dry or Brauns that I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> The question is, does your face like linear shavers like this one, Norelco type tripple circular floating blades or some other fangled contraption?</li>
            <li> The reason is that the longer I used it, the noisier it has become, until now the noise is extremely aggravating.</li>
            <li> : hasn&#x27;t ever pulled at a whisker like happened occasionally in the past  </li>
            <li> I prefer Panasonic razors to the other brands.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not noisy, despite what I read in other reviews.    </li>
            <li> I would recommend it to other women.</li>
            <li> It works well on other areas as well.</li>
            <li> look forward to using nothing after using this and 14 other electric razors</li>
            <li> Due to surgery on my neck</li>
            <li> In other ways.</li>
            <li> I have had one similar Panasonic shaver in the past and it lasted for years.</li>
            <li> My experience with the Panasonic is: Extremely noisy, in fact I suspect some degree of hearing damage with this thing screaming while shaving close to your ears.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s just my personality, so I settled on this Panasonic due to other reviews and price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unlike some other electric shavers I have used, this unit does not function while recharging.</li>
            <li> My two other shavers also had battery and charging problems.</li>
            <li> I will say that I was skeptical about a Panasonic brand shaver at first;</li>
            <li> have read some other customers&#x27; reviews, and although this is supposed to be \\&quot;waterproof,\\</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also shaves closer than other shavers I have owned, although not as close as a blade.</li>
            <li> The linear motor used in this shaver will outlast every other component in its assembly.</li>
            <li> and I find that it shaves extremely well.  </li>
            <li> When I do get lazy, the sideburn trimmer works decently enough to cut through everything, but there&#x27;s a trick to how you have to angle it.</li>
            <li> quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHARGING and OTHER FEATURES</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several inexpensive electric razors over the past decade.  </li>
            <li> possibly due to a slower motor speed.  </li>
            <li> Howerver I usually follow up after using it with a razor because I don&#x27;t like to continuously go over my face to get the last hair</li>
            <li> In the past I have tried Remington and Braun and both left something to be desired.</li>
            <li> I usually need a trained medical staff to stop the bleeding and a couple units of blood before it&#x27;s all done.  </li>
            <li> Does not pull hairs as easily as other razors I have used.</li>
            <li> I choose the product due to the RPM.</li>
            <li> Due to movement disorder, husband had to give up other type razors.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care about any other features.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I have tried any of the other shavers in this price range</li>
            <li> This would allow me to get closer to the skin and shave off everything the other razor couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Then my other son kept borrowing the razor</li>
            <li> What about the other 10%???</li>
            <li> I hope this deters other people like me from wasting their money.  </li>
            <li> and I agree with the other reviewers.</li>
            <li> I bought this one six months ago, and it is still as sharp as then.  </li>
            <li> , I feel that the motor runs faster than the other 2.</li>
            <li> It shaved as well as other electric razors that I have used.</li>
            <li> and it performs as well as all the other reviewers said it would.</li>
            <li> ZERO IRRITATION unlike some other foil razors I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> All other shavers burned my face and I always had to use an after-shave product to stop the burning.</li>
            <li> A week after receiving the ES8103S the other razors ended up in the trash.</li>
            <li> Husband has gone through several electric razors over the past 50 years.  </li>
            <li> With my other shavers I have to trim.</li>
            <li> You still need to use two hands - one to hold the razor and the other to stretch your skin.</li>
            <li> Other than that:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> I have not tried a wet shave yet!</li>
            <li> replaced with my  LA63s  due to the battery dying.</li>
            <li> You have to learn how to twist your face to get a close shave under the neck and other spots, but like I mentioned before,</li>
            <li> The cleaning is unlike any other I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I usually shave with a blade after several day of growth (weekends) and use the electric shaver on weekday for maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;Overall,</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands like Norelco and Remington, but they just didn&#x27;t work as well for me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Quick Charge - I haven&#x27;t watched it extremely closely, but it seems to charge in a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;Build</li>
            <li> so it cannot be due to water.</li>
            <li> Usually it&#x27;s you can plug it in and use it at the same time (but it will not charge will you use it).</li>
            <li> The shave is extremely close.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Love that my husband isn&#x27;t cutting himself anymore!</li>
            <li> other electric</li>
            <li> I have had Brauns for the past 20 years, I went through (3) of them in just the last twelve years.</li>
            <li> I eventually found that I could shave totally dry with little to no irritation and get almost as close a shave.</li>
            <li> Every time I dry shaved, I put cotton balls in my ears because my ears would ring a little after using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get used to how fast it is since you hardly feel the whiskers being removed.</li>
            <li> A huge disappointment that&#x27;s not worth the price for the slight convenience.</li>
            <li> and I usually can get by shaving once every two days or so and even though I tried this razor every day for a few weeks dry, with soap, and with shaving cream and no matter what I continually had the same problem and the hairs never \\&quot;adjusted\\&quot; to the razor as everyone claims they do.  </li>
            <li> Just a slight nick will have me walking around with a little dot of toilet paper on my face</li>
            <li> However, with a few passes and a little extra pressure, it still gets the job done.</li>
            <li> it is very weak especially when compared directly to the braun.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin but a tough beard.  </li>
            <li> I will be very careful before I buy Panasonic again.</li>
            <li> Then he got placed on a blood thinner and was so afraid he would knick himself that he started mumbling and grumbling how long it took to complete his daily shave since he had to be so careful.  </li>
            <li> I had to really think hard and come up with a negative</li>
            <li> I have tried several Brauns (dry shaving) and have always been disappointed at the short blade life and high cost.  </li>
            <li> However, you must live within your means in today&#x27;s poor economy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not a single complaint.  </li>
            <li> Works wonderfully, especially dry.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the display is dim and difficult to read.  </li>
            <li> I shaved with it dry for a few days without any skin products and thought I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> With my old Remingtons, I still had to go over my face with a disposable to get the difficult close to the skin hairs they missed, especially my neck.</li>
            <li> This alleged wet/dry razor is not adequately water proof.</li>
            <li> For the results I&#x27;ve gotten, I suspect I could have spent half the money.</li>
            <li> active</li>
            <li> They&#x27;d get dirty between the blades quickly.</li>
            <li> They still get dirty quickly.</li>
            <li> I do not sport a heavy beard and simply dry shave</li>
            <li> the previous trimmer was as about as wide as the head of the razor, and slid up to use.</li>
            <li> I was sad when my old Panasonic wet/dry shaver finally died.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me it not cut nearly close enough.</li>
            <li> Recently, the poor thing finally gave up the ghost.</li>
            <li> I need a shaver made for mans face panasonic, not a mouses soft, pink, delicate little tummy!</li>
            <li> The only drawback is if I let my beard grow for over 3 or 4 days it is very hard to trim it down with the beard trimmer to cut with the regular foil blades.</li>
            <li> I shave once every 2-6 days, and usually will trim all of the hair down with the trimmer prior to shaving, to avoid the hairs getting pulled out.  </li>
            <li> Cons: Not as close of a shave as I expected, takes a little longer than other shavers</li>
            <li> If I wanted to mess with a wet shave, I would just use a blade.     </li>
            <li> the first shave was pretty bloody, but once I got used to it, no more issues.</li>
            <li> Should have been informed the item was not suitable for use in Australia only USA.  </li>
            <li> So for right now I have gotten Shave Secret to see if that helps, at least until my face becomes used to the electric again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little irritating when near the ear, which of course isn&#x27;t for very long.</li>
            <li> I usually use it for less than one minute, so no big deal.</li>
            <li> Though it turned out to be my failure later, you should be careful.</li>
            <li> , it just took a little long considering my dull dying Norelco could do the same job in less time.</li>
            <li> the machine itself has little problem reaching any tricky spots, but the trimmer is very limited.</li>
            <li> Lot of reviews on \\&quot;hear\\&quot; indicate that is a problem, it is not IMHO.&lt;br /&gt;-Shaves closer than any other electric I&#x27;ve owned hands down</li>
            <li> Overall, I would still recommend this razor highly, but look at other razors to see if you can find a closer cutting one.</li>
            <li> The only other issue I&#x27;ve got could be a common issue</li>
            <li> like it due to the close shave and after recharging it last for at least four shaves...</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t find it any more annoying that any other razors noise.  </li>
            <li> I bought this Panasonic shaver because it&#x27;s difficult for me to shave until the hair grows to a certain length.  </li>
            <li> I kept the conventional for my neck because the electric just didn&#x27;t seem to cut every whisker, and for some reason gave me razor burn.</li>
            <li> Compare it to the cost of conventional blades now days</li>
            <li> I then started shaving wet with a little shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about cleaning it and getting it wet</li>
            <li> and it seems to shave a little closer wet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a tough beard and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> And believe me, my beard is as tough as an old boar&#x27;s bristles.  </li>
            <li> I always hated to take the time to clean my old razors.</li>
            <li> this model has a ridiculous flip-up trimmer that is only about as wide as your sideburns.</li>
            <li> I shaved half face with one and the other half with the other.</li>
            <li> I have owned 2 other electric shavers previous to this one: another Panasonic, and a Remington.</li>
            <li> So I was not only shaving for longer than Joe Blow does, but I was also pressing too hard.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the power cord is a bit hard to take out from the shaver.</li>
            <li> So the next time I decided to not press so hard and go slower.  </li>
            <li> Hard to tell, I only had two shaves with it before my son took it over.</li>
            <li> One draw back - hardly -</li>
            <li> I usually use a little hand washing soap and that&#x27;s enough to provide lubrication for a close shave.</li>
            <li> The only con is I have a goatee and it´s hard to get a close shave around it.</li>
            <li> : Hard to use sideburn/long-hair trimmer (it&#x27;s on the back</li>
            <li> It is very noisy, and the high pitched whine can be annoying.</li>
            <li> Shavers were always cutting him, not cutting close enough, pulling too hard, or leaving his skin irritated.</li>
            <li> sound this thing makes is terrible, very unusual, reminds me of some kind of alarm you would hear, nothing like any foil or rotary shaver I&#x27;ve had, very annoying and loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> last electric razor was a corded Remington, which was a pretty bad razor.  </li>
            <li> I still use a blade for my sideburns because I find it almost impossible to get a clean line using the electric</li>
            <li> I am not sure that my shave lasts as long.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to catch the hair so my husband will shave before he dresses.</li>
            <li> but instead I left it at my office for when I forget to shave or I&#x27;m running late.</li>
            <li> And in my husband&#x27;s opinion, not really worth the savings compared to Arc4.</li>
            <li> I agree with others that state that the cleaning stations are just not worth the money because you always have to buy the solution.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 58, have a medium beard, and average face.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s just an average shaver.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the position of the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> An average shave takes 10% of capacity, so ES8103S can shave for aprx a week between charges.  </li>
            <li> Battery life could be improved, but at least it lets you know when you&#x27;re getting low on battery thru the battery indicator.  </li>
            <li> My number one complaint why I went back to razors: Cleaning the unit.</li>
            <li> This shavers blades are so thin, they don&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> I would expect the foil to last at least 6 months to 1 year.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have mountain-man beard thickness, I&#x27;d consider my stubble average.</li>
            <li> Use time is probably average.</li>
            <li> Use time is probably average.</li>
            <li> Before that, I have used Gilette Mach 3 blades and my neck would end up red for at least 4-5 hours and irritated even longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it took 20 days to arrive.</li>
            <li> I recently found myself in a situation where I needed to shave at least twice a day.  </li>
            <li> but it is not your average shaver.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that when you shave with the Panasonic, the stubble goes everywhere and is not contained within the shaver head.  </li>
            <li> I like to save time when I shave, especially if I&#x27;m running late.</li>
            <li> If I have to use two shavers to get a one day shave, it should go to the drawing board again and worked on it and tested extensively before releasing into the common market.</li>
            <li> Also means.if using on Continent, that I have to have a British 3 point plug,the USA adaptor,+ Continental travel plug in order to charge-rather cumbersome to say the least.</li>
            <li> I only have one complaint, and it&#x27;s that you can&#x27;t use it while it&#x27;s plugged in.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this razor late in 2010 and have used it regularly since.  </li>
            <li> only complaint about this razor would be the underpowered trimmer.  </li>
            <li> This replacement is at least its equal in all ways, except for the plug in charger.</li>
            <li> It is not a one-swipe shaver; you have to attack your whiskers from at least three different angles to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li> so that is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> The only negative is a high-pitched whine while shaving.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it does not have a travel switch.</li>
            <li> What I do know is that I decided to revisit this shaver, and while it&#x27;s not perfect, it really does shave close</li>
            <li> The fancy pivot mechanism seems to add at least an extra inch of bulk</li>
            <li> It simply doesn&#x27;t cut your beard and it feels clumsy.</li>
            <li> However, it is not powerful if you have not shaved for a couple of days   </li>
            <li> The back trimmer is clumsy, and it drips hair as you are using it</li>
            <li> only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a brush to use for cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> If it last&#x27;s at least 5-6 years</li>
            <li> The only negative is it does not come with a charging stand.</li>
            <li> Therefore, if Panasonic needs assistance to do its job then its not worth the 80 bucks.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that after a year, the monitor display no longer works.</li>
            <li> even realize that I am finished but can&#x27;t believe it as I have been taking so long to shave in the past with that Norelco product.</li>
            <li> : both minor for me - it&#x27;s noiser than any of my past electric razors &amp; I</li>
            <li> If the battery dies, it requires at least 20 minutes to recharge enough to finish the shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I researched shavers for at least 3-4 weeks trying to find a quality corded only powered non disposable shaver.</li>
            <li> I needed a razor to keep in my laptop bag for those days one gets up too late for a proper shave.  </li>
            <li> took a few years to break, but i was disappointed, as i really enjoyed the product.</li>
            <li> Its just an average razor in two weeks time.</li>
            <li> Only negative is the pop up trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what happened to Braun, but there is no reason to even consider it as long as Panasonic is making shavers like this.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it can&#x27;t operate while charging; it must be unplugged.</li>
            <li> This IS NOT a useful alternative to a razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s worked very well for me along my jaw and for the majority of the cheeks, but just shy of the mustache</li>
            <li> It does not worth the price at all.</li>
            <li> I just have had no success with the shaving part.</li>
            <li> The power needed to achieve each shave is at least 20% and can reach 30% of the total stored power.</li>
            <li> Only complaint I have is that it&#x27;s noisy.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the trimmer could be a bit stronger/tougher.</li>
            <li> It shaves at least as close as the similarly priced Braun</li>
            <li> This shaver really works.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is it can&#x27;t be used while charging,</li>
            <li> One complaint I have is that it only works in cordless mode.</li>
            <li> Probably spend at least an extra 2 minutes each day working at it.</li>
            <li> My only negative comment is that you can&#x27;t shave with it while it&#x27;s plugged in.  </li>
            <li> I am in the military and purchased a battery operated electric travel shaver a few years ago for the field.  </li>
            <li> Like many men I HATE shaving.  </li>
            <li> I tend to grow facial hair slowly</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have thick facial hair.  </li>
            <li> So, I cannot speak to how this shaver would work for someone with coarse thick</li>
            <li> So, I cannot speak to how this shaver would work for someone with coarse thick whiskers.  </li>
            <li> Nano technology is worse than the old technology.</li>
            <li> takes way longer than a blade, far worse results, irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d have to be real rough on this thing to break it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple of brauns that I liked a remington I hated</li>
            <li> If Panasonic would put the pop-up trimmer from the ES 8097 on this shaver and add an induction charger base to this shaver, it would be phenomenal.</li>
            <li> (my body hair is soft and thin) and it does the job.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Works way better than any 3 shaving head shavers I have used, those are just worthless on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thick, dark facial hair</li>
            <li> It is still early in the game</li>
            <li> (I have a thick middle eastern hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a bit noisy, but far from irritating.</li>
            <li> Alas, I was totally surprised and amazed at this product&#x27;s ability.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used base model Panasonic wet/dry shavers for 15 years and been satisfied.</li>
            <li> The one thing you have to keep in mind with this unit is DON&#x27;T LOOSE THE POWER CORD!!!</li>
            <li> : doesn&#x27;t slow down like the Brauns when shaving 2-day whiskers, especially toward end of charge  </li>
            <li> The shaver also doesn&#x27;t slow down and stall when it starts to run low on power.</li>
            <li> The main issue I have with the product is that I have accumulated razor bumps due to using razors for a while, and this machine is unable to differentiate between the raised bumps and the hair on my face.</li>
            <li> If i let it go for 3 days and tried shaving with this razor I sometimes pulled which is not very comfortable.</li>
            <li> you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only (slight) negative</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have particularly thick facial hair, but it takes half a dozen passes to come close to getting it all, and even then I can see some hairs it missed.</li>
            <li> No charging base means less to manage/ more space on my counter top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I have had at least a dozen and a half or various models.</li>
            <li> /&gt;pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Amazon cut down the price</li>
            <li> I used it down to 50%, and it had no bog down on the razor.  </li>
            <li> so on until it seems to automatically shut down.  </li>
            <li> You must shut down the razor for it to re-store the battery&#x27;s life.</li>
            <li> Hands down</li>
            <li> Stroking down on the face after a shave was as close a shave as a blade would give.  </li>
            <li> HOWEVER, it is, hands down, the noisiest shaver I have ever heard.  </li>
            <li> If this razor ever broke down, I would immediately buy another.</li>
            <li> I narrowed my search down between the Braun and Panasonic brands.</li>
            <li> I used tape to hold it down for 2 years.  </li>
            <li> just hold it under running water and hold the button down for two seconds so it can go into its sonic cleaning mode.  </li>
            <li> Just hold the start button down longer</li>
            <li> down rather then circular motion technique.</li>
            <li> I have been using the shaver for three weeks now and get about six shaves per charge, which takes the readout down to about 10%.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun as well, but this one beats it hands down.  </li>
            <li> When I shave, I am covered in whiskers and need to wash down the sink and dust off my shoulders and collar afterwards.</li>
            <li> Would consider another product down the line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with Panasonic until they let me down.  </li>
            <li> In my experience, the battery goes down about 10% with every shave so</li>
            <li> It has a cleaning mode that is activated by holding down the power switch for about 2 seconds.  </li>
            <li> The Braun was a hand me down</li>
            <li> For whatever reason  Norelco no longer makes a razor (that i have found) that has a battery indicator count down.</li>
            <li> Never let me down.</li>
            <li> With my beard, shaving down with a razor looked just</li>
            <li> I did figure out that going at my face from all angles with this shaver (instead of just up and down) seems to help.  </li>
            <li> I use up &amp; down on the jaw line, mouth and chin.</li>
            <li> I ran the battery down until it was 0% and charged it again</li>
            <li> So if you don&#x27;t shave for a couple days and have some longer hairs that are being stubborn about going down into the foil to get cut...</li>
            <li> that is 6 shaves - before it got down to 10% and the charge indicator started blinking.  </li>
            <li> With stubble going, I need to use the trimmer to cut everything down to a shorter length before using the shaver.</li>
            <li> You could still tell when it needed to be charged however because it blinks when it gets down to 2 percent.</li>
            <li> (I think it goes down in 10% increments).  </li>
            <li> So this should help in that cost down the road and pay for itself in some time.  </li>
            <li> After use, once it goes down to 10%, recharge.</li>
            <li> Beat the competition hands down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quick charging and lots of shaves on one charge (and the display counts down the charge remaining in 10% increments-cool).&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> On the 4th shave I&#x27;m down to 10% charge</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a little louder than my other electric razors.  </li>
            <li> The one downside I find is that it&#x27;s a little noisier than other shavers I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li> when I&#x27;m at home and not traveling for business, I shave every other day, just because the day after I shave with my Panasonic, my face looks like it did immediately after shaving with the Braun!</li>
            <li> Oxidation is a slow process that prematurely dulls any sharp steel edge when wet.</li>
            <li> My husband LOVES it and now shaves every other day!  </li>
            <li> The noise is a little sharp and noisy.  </li>
            <li> Battery life could be a little longer, but other than that, I does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other electric razors and this one surpasses them all!</li>
            <li> and it just went right over it without cutting it.  </li>
            <li> Bad in the sense that as I have thick hair I sometimes have to go over a patch of skin several times before I get a clean shaven look and feel.</li>
            <li> I usually shave dry, but I did try it on one occasion in the shower with shaving cream with unimpressive results.</li>
            <li> Thus I average it out at four.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum after using it a year and a half.....</li>
            <li> It is also very sharp and I feel that this can mow down any beard.</li>
            <li> but, I have sensetive skin with a heavy beard, the head screen openings are a little to small for the size of my wiskers, so it takes several passes to get all the beard.  </li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t really matter, it&#x27;s just a little weird that it&#x27;s not very accurate.</li>
            <li> Even a single small hole on an outer blade scratches your face.</li>
            <li> Takes a week or two for your beard to become &amp;#34;accustomed&amp;#34; to the up and down motion vs the previously used rotary razor but once that happens,  it&#x27;s a close shave.....</li>
            <li> so I will know when to charge the shaver before it runs down to nothing, unlike my previous shavers.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s probably due to the high speed of the head as it rubs against the very thin foil.  </li>
            <li> i tried a few options, like pushing it down hard towards my face and all it did was turn my face red and no shave.</li>
            <li> Yes, the blades are very sharp, and well designed.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is a little noisy.     </li>
            <li> The blades will stay very sharp if (after a cleaning) you remove the blades and soak them in rubbing alcohol overnight (90%+ alcohol).</li>
            <li> I used to shave every other day with reg razor now its everyday with electric</li>
            <li> My nine year old Braun was getting a little tired</li>
            <li> This razor was terrible, its EXTREMELY LOUD, it only worked the first time I used it, which I guess dulled out the blades</li>
            <li> , I have to go over and over and over my face until this tiny, delicate little \\&quot;shaver\\&quot; can cut the stubble.</li>
            <li> It flat out sucks.</li>
            <li> I have trouble shaving every day due to my neck area breaking out.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the shave the Panasonic gives, but very disappointed in the battery life.  </li>
            <li> On my face the shaver caused no irritation, but because you have to press the foil so hard against your neck skin it can give a slight burning sensation for the next few hours even after lotion is used.</li>
            <li> Expensive replacement blades (though mine is working for 3rd year without changing and with daily shaving)</li>
            <li> I get a smoother shave in less time than it took my previous razor to cut.</li>
            <li> It seems that the blade design has changed from a previous Panasonic razor that I had.  </li>
            <li> Some shaver models require really expensive replacement parts that last only 3 - 6 months.</li>
            <li> Compared to the Norelco, it shaves noticeably closer, with less irritation, but not quite as close as with a blade.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s day finally came to an end when it became too difficult to find replacement blades recently.    </li>
            <li> Can hold both under water, but on the Panasonic there are less spaces for the hairs to get stuck in.  </li>
            <li> With that said, the shaves with this shaver are shorter than my previous.  </li>
            <li> Definitely less passes to get it</li>
            <li> Less than optimal:  </li>
            <li> + less irritation    </li>
            <li> My previous shaver was the ES8109 model, which I have had for 5 or 6 years and continues to work well.</li>
            <li> My previous machine used to pull my hair and it was quite uncomfortable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> unlike my previous panasonic electric shaver this one seems to hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> It shaves almost as close as a Mach 3 razor in much less time and without the irritation.  </li>
            <li> Shick, Sunbeam, 3 Norelcos, 3 Remingtons, 2 previous Panasonics.  </li>
            <li> It just buzzes slightly.  </li>
            <li> so it won&#x27;t have the premature aging of the previous nickel-cadmiums.  </li>
            <li> The motor is slightly faster.    </li>
            <li> My previous shavers have been from Norelco and Braun.</li>
            <li> I used previously.  </li>
            <li> My previous foil shaver was a Braun.</li>
            <li> I am getting a closer shave with less irritation in the lower neck area.  </li>
            <li> When it wasn&#x27;t getting stuck, and painfully tearing out my facial hair, it wasn&#x27;t doing much else.</li>
            <li> I stopped shaving with a traditional razor decades ago and those with 5 blades now days are in my opinion ridiculous, not to mention cost a fortune</li>
            <li> It sells at a well known box store for about $110, but I paid exactly half of that online (plus shipping).</li>
            <li> I stopped shaving with a traditional razor decades ago and those with 5 blades now days are in my opinion ridiculous, not to mention cost a fortune</li>
            <li> It sells at a well known box store for about $110, but I paid exactly half of that online (plus shipping).</li>
            <li> get 10-12 shaves on a charge and it takes less than 30 minutes to fully recharge.</li>
            <li> is the cost of replacement blades and foils (typically up to 50$ for both, depending on where you shop)  </li>
            <li> My wife said that my face was as smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind (except that the crack was going the wrong way.)    </li>
            <li> I bought mine on Amazon for almost half off.</li>
            <li> it takes less than an hour to charge it fully.</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s less efficient than Philips&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone to using an epilator now, which seems to effect my skin less.</li>
            <li> the previous models I had.  </li>
            <li> There is a smoother cut, and less clippings.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it and it recharges in less than an hour.</li>
            <li> And guess what, it now (within way less than a year&#x27;s time) it holds charges way and way shorter.</li>
            <li> The battery on this shaver has lasted me less than a year, since I now need to charge it after every use.  </li>
            <li> Previous Brauns and Remington&#x27;s just don&#x27;t compare to this shaver.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic shaves my face closer than Braun with less effort.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning took less than a minute.  </li>
            <li> My display has been &#x27;black&#x27; now for over a year.  </li>
            <li> None of them produced as close a shave as a razor but for me it was acceptable that I was trading the close shave for less damage to my skin.</li>
            <li> -Deceiving charging meter fails to show individual percents (such as 1%,2%,3% and so on)</li>
            <li> They do this so when your battery starts to lose it you have to replace the battery (probably at half the cost of the razor).</li>
            <li> Typical throw away technology.</li>
            <li> It gave me as close a shave as my 4 blade razor does and with less skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I just shaved 2 days growth in less than 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li> The razor&#x27;s battery died in less than 9 months.  </li>
            <li> I have had the unit for a week and a half now and</li>
            <li> I have been using the previous Panasonic model almost 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Their \\&quot;new\\&quot; lithium-powered shavers run at about half the speed (or less) of my \\&quot;antique\\&quot; Norelco shaver that used AA-size rechargeable batteries.  </li>
            <li> I just take a bar of soap and lather my face slightly.</li>
            <li> I switched from a norelco and find that this razor causes me less irritation.</li>
            <li> Shaves closer, and costs much less than my Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I have to say that was correct, it took about 3 weeks before I felt this razor was shaving as close as my previous one.</li>
            <li> It wont even get me through the work week before recharging is needed - 3 days is typical.</li>
            <li> And speaking of junk, this unit is a lot lighter and appears to be less sturdy than my ES8043SC.  </li>
            <li> news is that Black Friday is upon us.  </li>
            <li> He says he can shave his face in less than 90 seconds.</li>
            <li> I have found that Panasonic shaves a lot closer than my previous shavers.</li>
            <li> Shave is typical for electrics.  </li>
            <li> then previous shavers that I have owned.  </li>
            <li> For that I use my trusty $40 Norelco three-head shaver (which I keep hidden under the towels on the shelf).</li>
            <li> This cost less than just the replacement blades for the Remington Arcitec (or however you spell it).</li>
            <li> me, one charge takes less than an hour, and it powers the shaver&lt;br /&gt;through</li>
            <li> Closer shave and less passes.</li>
            <li> Anyone want to buy a slightly used Braun??</li>
            <li> The battery lasts about one week less than my Norelco</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as close as a razor but a lot less hassle</li>
            <li> I can use it for a week and a half before recharging.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell any difference between the ES8103S (previously ES8109) and the $200-$300 shavers.  </li>
            <li> It shaves close as a typical racer.</li>
            <li> I have the previous model to this one also, es7103.</li>
            <li> I had previously owned a Panasonic linear shaver and that is why I purchased this one.  </li>
            <li> There is no super shaver out there, unless you find it at a firesale or craigslist</li>
            <li> , that does all those things for less than 100 bucks.</li>
            <li> You save on replacements in exchange for a less fancy shave.</li>
            <li> The old charger base was so much nicer to use.</li>
            <li> After using an electric shaver for years I needed an upgrade since my previous one will no longer hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> Typical Panasonic quality item.</li>
            <li> Typically I&#x27;ve use double-bladed disposable razors.  </li>
            <li> Miss the charging holder and this one does not shave as closely as the previous Panasonic I owned.</li>
            <li> But I now know I can get an equivalent shaver for 40% less than I paid for this.</li>
            <li> Based on my previous experiences with rechargeable electric shavers, this was a deal-breaker.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not your typical men&#x27;s shaver user</li>
            <li> I have thick beard hair and have to shave everyday and all this did was pull my hair and left me with bumps and in grown hair.</li>
            <li> I find myself shaving in half the time...</li>
            <li> It also holds its charge for a longer time than previous razors.</li>
            <li> The shave seems closer and less effort to cut the whiskers.  </li>
            <li> Yesterday my shaver died after less than one year.</li>
            <li> There is less irritation than the blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It recharges in two hours or less.  </li>
            <li> :  Slightly noisy</li>
            <li> I did not like my previous Remmington razor either</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: After a two and a half years, the battery quit.</li>
            <li> I previously owned a Norelco rotary razor.  </li>
            <li> Battery charge lasts less than a week when fully charged.</li>
            <li> ON BLACK FRIDAY</li>
            <li> AND SO ON.I PAID LESS THAN 100$ FOR EACH</li>
            <li> No need to pay for more expensive razors and their cleaning systems.&lt;br /&gt;All is not perfect.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic shaver does not give me as close of a shave as my previously owned Remington shaver.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a black Friday sale.  </li>
            <li> and it is still half charged.</li>
            <li> replaced my Braun shaver for a lot less</li>
            <li> I had to keep going over the same spots to try and get the hair, eventually ending up with a rash and facial hair still uncut.</li>
            <li> I find that it shaves almost as well as rotary, though takes longer, hence less skin-friendly.</li>
            <li> half against the grain (45 degrees) to ensure a uniform shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shaver does very well on short hair however on beards it is painful.</li>
            <li> No mechanical issues after half a year of use.</li>
            <li> I find this shaver is less forgiving than my previous shavers if you don&#x27;t pull the skin taut as you shave; for my skin and beard, anyway, that&#x27;s mandatory.</li>
            <li> I previously have been using a Braun 8595 shaver.</li>
            <li> I found I prefer the Arc 4 models, as I get a slightly faster shave with them.  </li>
            <li> This shaver replaced a three-headed rotary electric razor that I had owned previously.  </li>
            <li> I just need to get used to holding it after my previous one.</li>
            <li> It also takes less time.</li>
            <li> Anyways, about a year and a half ago I switched to razors.</li>
            <li> But I was getting maybe 90% less flaky skin, and</li>
            <li> Needless to say I don&#x27;t grow too much facial hair, but enough to have to shave every day for work.  </li>
            <li> I previously shaved with disposable razors and water without shaving cream), so</li>
            <li> It does have a problem with the jaw line and neck -- seems to be typical of electric razors; so I use a safety razor for those areas.</li>
            <li> Typical battery life.</li>
            <li> In that case it outperforms my previous model.</li>
            <li> I did think it seemed like it was made of cheaper plastic than previous shavers.</li>
            <li> I get less scratches,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s odd, but it seems like the charge dissipates on</li>
            <li> my previous Braun shaver.  </li>
            <li> Fry.com for $10 less than Amazon.</li>
            <li> so I have all but given up on razor shaving, it always makes my skin scaly, blotchy and red (a real eyesore and sometimes painful).  </li>
            <li> This typically takes about 10-12 mins for me to shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My previous shaver lasted about 4 years.</li>
            <li> I watched a couple weeks before Black Friday, to see what was coming on sale, and Wah-lah</li>
            <li> not shave as close as my previous shaver</li>
            <li> So after many years of using gillete razors, I thought I would try an electric, as I was getting tired of nicking my self on cold mornings.  </li>
            <li> I never had an LED indicator fail on my older Panasonic razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> The manual says to use with an up and down motion and to pull the skin tight.</li>
            <li> I used to have an old single blade Remington that probably only cost 35 bucks which gave a less painful shave.</li>
            <li> Even worse, this shaver holds water like no other.  </li>
            <li> You just add some liquid hand soap, turn on the high speed mode, rinse it in cold water, dry it, and in no time at all, you are done.  </li>
            <li> so very much and was afraid it might become unavailable.</li>
            <li> As long as you do not push too hard, you get zero irritation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> FYI, I do not have a tough beard and only need to shave every other day or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> I usually shave that area with a quick and dirty DE job just so I can get out of the door.</li>
            <li> No special solution like my previous Braun.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Whether I have bad luck or not,I can&#x27;t say, but after only 6 months of using the machine (daily basis), it seems I have to replace the inner blades already.</li>
            <li> Panasonic takes electric shavers to a level that is comparable to a blade (which still gives the closest shave) without the mess and pain.  </li>
            <li> and it makes quite a mess, dumping whiskers all over the counter and my shirt.  </li>
            <li> Metallic smell even after a month of use and cleaning every time  Cleanup makes a mess</li>
            <li> But that is just not true.</li>
            <li> Before It would take at least twice that long.  </li>
            <li> Moreover, it doesn&#x27;t make the mess my Braun used to.  </li>
            <li> It gives him a close shave without the mess of shaving with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> No need for shaving cream or any sort of mess.</li>
            <li> , no razor could put up with the clogging mess, I thought.  </li>
            <li> Not good enough to use by itself, but that might just be me as I have that problem with every electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I usually make one pass carefully shaving all the nooks and crannies; then another pass where I run my hand over my face to find the missed stubble.</li>
            <li> Eventually any type of wetness will mess with the device.  </li>
            <li> Overall not good for shaving and way too noisy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the wet in wet/dry means...</li>
            <li> I wanted to switch to an electric shaver from my straight-blade because it was becoming too time-consuming and annoying to buy blades all the time.  </li>
            <li> The blade is too small and the action is pitifully WEAK.</li>
            <li> Why because I was unable to get a close shave due to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> One, I feel like it heats up a little faster than the Norelco did, so for extended use it can wear you down a little.</li>
            <li> I use it about half the time I shave, and I think my skin is a little happier than it was with my rotary.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a little sleeker-looking and dressed in black instead of silver.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The shaver has trouble mowing these down</li>
            <li> but it is meant to be used until dead some years down the road and thrown away.</li>
            <li> I still use blade razors on occasion, but for those tight areas around the mouth, my Panasonic is my go to razor.</li>
            <li> The battery volume is a little small, yet the charging is faster than expected.</li>
            <li> had grown frustrated with Norleco wet/dry shavers, and had high hopes for this one, but this breakdown is totally unacceptable.</li>
            <li> Other shavers I have used in the past gave a closer shave in less time.</li>
            <li> This new Panasonic proved me wrong.</li>
            <li> Pressing harder also leaves me with pretty bad razor burn.  </li>
            <li> In my book that equals to a bad deal and not a good way to spend $80.-  Would appreciate learning of better alternatives, if they still exist in an era where almost everything is plastic from China.  </li>
            <li> The saving grace for this slight disappointment is that the battery charges to full capacity in much less than an hour, so I can travel or do whatever at home without any serious shortage of availability to shave the way I have come to do this thing.  </li>
            <li> At the time I bought the ES8103, it was far less expensive than the ES-LA63, about half the price.  </li>
            <li> at least if you shave dry like I do.</li>
            <li> and even then the shave was not clean...</li>
            <li> It does not cut that well and takes about as long to get all the spots that have weird shape as a standard razor.  </li>
            <li> After less than a year the battery goes dead at about 30% capacity.    </li>
            <li> I switched to an old fashioned safety razor last year after my very expensive Braun ($140) died after one year of use (it would no longer charge or turn on).</li>
            <li> I have used at least 8-10 different shavers over that past 20 years.  </li>
            <li> it took me almost a full charge to shave my face completely, with horrible results.</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars if it were not for 2 things: first, for that awkward and WAY too narrow of a trimmer.</li>
            <li> I owned a few previous shaver</li>
            <li> For the small price this Razor costs compared to others costing twice as much, you can&#x27;t go wrong buying it.</li>
            <li> The instructions state , Do not clean the shaver with Alcohol, so I was concerned about the pre shave&lt;</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t let your beard get too long though as it does struggle cutting a 4-5 day old beard.</li>
            <li> In my experience with electric razors, none of them shave as close as a blade, none of them!!&lt;br /&gt;a few have come close, but only after dragging it over my face repeatedly while pressing hard, the resulting rash made this pointless...</li>
            <li> It is however a very slow shave needing multiple passes to achieve a close shave and thus takes longer than my previous shavers.  </li>
            <li> Seems like I get at least a dozen shaves from a single charge.</li>
            <li> My single biggest complaint has been the overpriced replacement head and screens.</li>
            <li> My beard is really tough, and with other razors I had to go over it several times, and then always wait a day or two before shaving again because my face was so raw.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-The machine is a little noisy.</li>
            <li> I will update once I have used it for a little longer.  </li>
            <li> It is a little disappoint me.</li>
            <li> Having never used an electric razor before, I was a little apprehensive about giving this a go.  </li>
            <li> A little hand soap and water on the screen and turn it on and rinse...</li>
            <li> this part of using the trimmer is a little tricky, but it is for the sideburns, and that you will have no problem doing with the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Also even with cleaning as recommended sometimes this thing has a little bit of a funky smell.  </li>
            <li> this ES8103S will last at least 10 years!</li>
            <li> But over time, like me, they get a little slower, a little nosier, and have to be replaced.  </li>
            <li> but did not wait until the little indicator said to do so.  </li>
            <li> Stroking up and a little stubble was felt, but all in all I was amazed.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit louder, but</li>
            <li> ) shave with little or no irritation (a little around the neck).  </li>
            <li> I was furious with this little shaver.</li>
            <li> The shaver is a little lightweight and parts are made of plastic - that&#x27;s why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5.</li>
            <li> Put a little liquid soap on the surface and it cleans and lubricates.  </li>
            <li> It struggles a little bit on the neck area, but so does any electric razor.  </li>
            <li> After years of having a beard and the little hair from having a hippocratic bald head, I decided to shave it all off.</li>
            <li> It comes in a little pouch for travel that takes no space at all.    </li>
            <li> : Here&#x27;s a little update, I guess I pressed the shaver a bit too vigorously against my skin, because 24hrs</li>
            <li> It takes a little time to learn how the closest shave is achieved.    </li>
            <li> It leaves little shaggy strands of hair on my face.</li>
            <li> Also, yes, the shaver does heat up a little bit on your face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little noisy but it works like it should.</li>
            <li> I\\&quot;m used to a rotary shaver so this one is a little</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this a little over a month</li>
            <li> The charger is a little bulky,that&#x27;s why the 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Since it takes so little time to get a close shave, it is tolerable.</li>
            <li> is a little slow~&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> Just got this, so cannot comment on battery life and the LCD display that others have mentioned as potential weak points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dislike that it leaves 10% or so with a little bit of hair.</li>
            <li> A little liquid soap put on the screen, start it up and put the head under running water and cleaning is done.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t need to shave every day if I decide to leave a little &amp;#34;shadow&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Suddenly, a little faucet with a drip appears.</li>
            <li> It is a little noisy but no more so than any other electric razor.  </li>
            <li> The shaver also cuts a little too close for me.  </li>
            <li> As you can tell from my tag line, got a little caught up in reading all the reviews and variations on the brands, price points, features, etc...   </li>
            <li> Just a little tweak</li>
            <li> Just a little tweak</li>
            <li> However, it is a little bit on the pricey side</li>
            <li> but the head was a little too bulky for me</li>
            <li> Charger is a little clunky</li>
            <li> And finally, it&#x27;s a little noisier than my Norelco was.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver a little over a month ago.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face a little sore which i never got with Braun shavers.</li>
            <li> A little over a year ago my Remington electric razor was stolen while on a trip in Las Vegas.</li>
            <li> I have used an electric razor for years and this one works just as well if not better than any other I have used.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to rely solely on a rechargeable battery</li>
            <li> and I could feel a little bit of a pull when running across my skin.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;the seller i got the razor from sent it with a little travel baggie...</li>
            <li> so its a little messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, it will take a little bit longer, but your face will thank you for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> During the shave in a car little bit beard dropping on my shirt</li>
            <li> if I was a little too aggressive which the ES8103S does not do.</li>
            <li> but it also becomes a little difficulty in the study</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my fiancé, when it arrived we notice the packing seemed a little off, as if it was opened and re-taped!&lt;br /&gt;Took</li>
            <li> It ruins the point of shopping online!</li>
            <li> , I could with my other electric shavers which is what extended their lives past what they probably should have been.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little louder than others out there</li>
            <li> -- I just want the hair not to be visible and not to be prickly; maybe I&#x27;m imagining it, but the little bit of hair that remains seems softer than when I used a disposable.</li>
            <li> I guess I had to curb my expectations a little when I started using this.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a little over a week.</li>
            <li> Shaving time was a little longer than the three (3) minutes given in the adds.</li>
            <li> I have not been hard on this razor, using it on average every other day.</li>
            <li> This razor does not give near the close shave then our less expensive rotary razor did.  </li>
            <li> Unlike some other razors, I don&#x27;t have to press down hard to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li> Since it is a wet or dry shaver I simply hold it under cold running water and turn on cleaning mode.  </li>
            <li> I got tired of all the hassle and mess of shaving cream and blades and all that, and I&#x27;ve never looked back.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is a little narrow.</li>
            <li> If you skip a few days however, expect a little pain using the panasonic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with cream/good news razors for over 35 years and started having trouble with little cuts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now, and I have to say it gets a little getting use to.</li>
            <li> the very least the manufacturers should be mandated to take back the shavers they sell and remove the toxic battery.</li>
            <li> I am a guy who has very thick facial hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick facial hair which means one whisker could lift a 1940 buick into the air.  </li>
            <li> The buzzing sound is a little annoying though.</li>
            <li> The only drawback with this model is the noise it makes, a little irritating.</li>
            <li> A pity it does not come with a hard storage casing for traveler.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor after years of being disappointed with various high priced norelco models.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed after reading reviews from a leading consumer magazine giving this product such a high rating.</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on other reviews and even though it is a well built razor, the closeness of the shave is not very good.  </li>
            <li> only disappointment with this purchase is that the shaver comes with a soft cloth travel bag, rather than a hard case.</li>
            <li> My only disappointment with this purchase is that the shaver comes with a soft cloth travel bag, rather than a hard case.</li>
            <li> Like other such models, the cleaning base is a nuisance and, to my mind, a negative rather than a positive.</li>
            <li> It had finally gotten to where my Remi battery caused me to shave once before I shower, then put it back on charge and finish after breakfast...but even that was cutting it close [no pun intended].&lt;br</li>
            <li> The speed of the cutting heads gives me a very close shave in minutes.</li>
            <li> I was afraid of spending so much money for something I might not want once I get it.</li>
            <li> Trimmer not good for long beards.</li>
            <li> Its LCD readout misses few bars after 2 years&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> Gets closer then my razor (G Fusion) ever did without the harsh burn after.</li>
            <li> (Although I always wet my beard at least twice for comfort)&lt;br /&gt;-Not</li>
            <li> I bought the Series 3, used it for a few days and returned it.</li>
            <li> in my 80&#x27;s where a close shave is not important, I would buy another shaver.</li>
            <li> I had a Norelco shaver with three round heads.</li>
            <li> I hope it will since I shave everyday.  </li>
            <li> For example you can get a $110 Panasonic 4 blade shaver that goes through $50 foils every few months.</li>
            <li> I intentionally didn&#x27;t shave for a few days to see what the shaver could do when up against a tough,course beard like mine.  </li>
            <li> it takes a few days for your face to get used to it.  </li>
            <li> takes a few days to get used to after years of razors.</li>
            <li> I have had this one a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t ever buy one of those again--a waste of money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is narrow and does not perform as well as the shaver.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what is wrong with my face, but it doesn&#x27;t cut short, medium or long hair.</li>
            <li> He uses the shaver everyday and just loves it.  </li>
            <li> So I researched for a few weeks and decided on this Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> I have a fairly heavy beard but the Panasonic doesn&#x27;t miss a beat or a hair.  </li>
            <li> for the \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; construction mentioned by a few reviewers, this shaver is indeed light-weight.</li>
            <li> The foil tore after a few months.</li>
            <li> If the battery in the Norelco goes dead you&#x27;ll need to recharge it before you can use it.  </li>
            <li> Would not recommend buying this shaver unless you expect to pay $30 for a foil or $50 for foil and blades every few months.</li>
            <li> I used to have an electric shaver and abandon it a few years ago.</li>
            <li> but unlike Remington it can&#x27;t be used with the cord attached if the battery goes dead.</li>
            <li> Like any electric shaver I&#x27;v owned, it still takes a few passes...</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and what a waste.</li>
            <li> Poor guy&#x27;s face was all irratated and red.</li>
            <li> It felt like my hairs were just destroying the blades.</li>
            <li> Pros: I have had this shaver for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this Panasonic electric razor a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I have a heavy beard.</li>
            <li> After a few months, the LCD screen went out.  </li>
            <li> I just picked this up a couple of weeks ago to replace a Norelco shaver with the three round blade configuration.</li>
            <li> It does miss a few hair here and there</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shaving quality: Not comfortable</li>
            <li> few downsides.</li>
            <li> However, if one uses a regular nonelectric razor after using this one for the worse of the stubble it will suffice.</li>
            <li> I would say there were a few that made me rethink about buying, but I bought it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a bit heavy</li>
            <li> The few times that I shave each year with a blade, I would pay for it.  </li>
            <li> a is an acceptable shave for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Even when I go a few days without shaving and the forest starts it will get through it.</li>
            <li> I use this for a few minutes every morning and end up charging it every couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> and uneven shave        </li>
            <li> This time I found the shave completely uneven and my neck was still slightlyraw even using shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> It arrived in a few days and was promptly put to use.   </li>
            <li> well - until a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> So if it goes dead half-way through, you&#x27;re stuck until it charges a while.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks, I find I&#x27;m getting a close shave and no irritation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a heavy beard and if I attack three days growth then it&#x27;s going to take a while.</li>
            <li> Two of the LEDs are dead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this a few months now.  </li>
            <li> Besides the battery going caputs, I was having to go over some areas over and over to get a few missed stray hairs.</li>
            <li> and I use this razor everyday.</li>
            <li> Not a smooth shave at all.</li>
            <li> He uses this everyday and says he gets a close shave, but he has to keep moving it around and around to get it close.  </li>
            <li> no matter what you do it seems there is just a few hairs it won&#x27;t pick up.  </li>
            <li> This shaver will shave the neck, but it will take a few passes.</li>
            <li> As far as I am concerned you can&#x27;t go wrong with a Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li> Man of few words</li>
            <li> Also, no problem going through my beard even after letting it grow for a few days.  </li>
            <li> It does take a few passes to get all the hairs</li>
            <li> However I have a round face</li>
            <li> The only exception being the built in trimmer, which has become broken on the Norelco.  </li>
            <li> By mid-July, it was dead.  </li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like is that it misses a few whiskers .that</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> The rubber skin of handle start falling within a few month.(see</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard</li>
            <li> because the display has gone totally dead . .</li>
            <li> It sometimes does take a few passes</li>
            <li> It is not a one swipe shave you do have to go over an area a few times</li>
            <li> it will accidentally turn on and be dead when I land.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for hubby and he&#x27;s using it everyday and loves it</li>
            <li> I used it a few times now .</li>
            <li> I had trouble under my jaw line and on the neck area.</li>
            <li> , it is, but there are always a few hairs that just don&#x27;t get cut.  </li>
            <li> I shave as I have unruly hair and a few bald patches.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have been using it a few months now.</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard, and this gives me the closest shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> My beard is heavy but not dense.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also nicked myself a few times with this thing too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> then I can have trouble.  </li>
            <li> This frequent replacement is silly.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for those few times when I don&#x27;t want to bother doing a &amp;#34;wet shave&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Never mind the few reviews that call attention to what the reviewers perceive as a \\&quot;freakishly large\\&quot; head.  </li>
            <li> Maybe if I had a heavy beard and took longer to shave it would get hotter, but it seems to get warmed up and not continue getting hotter as I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If i can get my point across in a few words that should be acceptable.</li>
            <li> I need to shave everyday.  </li>
            <li> I find it takes me approximately 10%-20% charge per shave, with the biggest variable being if I have not shaved for several days.</li>
            <li> i must say that i am not a happy camper its doesnt perform like its rating i wish i could get my money back on this one</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t wave up and try to shave with a dead battery.</li>
            <li> I say almost because it&#x27;s not exactly secure there - a bit of a bump might knock it off.</li>
            <li> over a few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I say almost because it&#x27;s not exactly secure there - a bit of a bump might knock it off.</li>
            <li> Shaving function is disabled when it&#x27;s being charged.</li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t get the docking/charging/cleaning stations that are a waste and force you to buy supplies you don&#x27;t need.  </li>
            <li> It ain&#x27;t heavy.</li>
            <li> Round blades never made sense to me and now I have no reason to struggle with round blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> Just a few years ago I was shaving once every 10 days.</li>
            <li> I bought one for myself a few year ago and just bought one for my dad for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> I feel I need another shave in a few hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One morning I turned on and dead - no warning.  </li>
            <li> Unit came on for maybe 5 seconds and now is completely dead - in under 2 yrs from purchase</li>
            <li> I gave it a few months to see if it&#x27;s just my skin adapting, but to no avail.</li>
            <li> I should mention I do not have a heavy beard</li>
            <li> &quot; I believe this is what killed my razor.  </li>
            <li> There are always a few that won&#x27;t get cut and need a blade to be shaved.</li>
            <li> Those shavers are a waste.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut well on heavy beard.</li>
            <li> I changed the blade and foil set together a few months ago.</li>
            <li> Just to get the hang of it, I have been using it everyday</li>
            <li> I bought this Panasonic Wet/Dry electric razor last February 2013 to replace my tired Braun 5614 Wet/Dry.</li>
            <li> and it was completely dead.</li>
            <li> This morning when I went to use it was completely dead, so I tried the plug-in routine again and</li>
            <li> I wasted my money trying this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a serous waste of countertop space, to say nothing of the costly cartridges).</li>
            <li> so I need to everyday if I want to avoid looking like a hobo.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard and shave about every 2 or 3 days.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t just trying cheapy brands or models either but certainly not top of the line ones average price was $120 to $200.</li>
            <li> .....it&#x27;s just that you&#x27;ll feel every irritating scrape/jerk/bump along the way.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be moving to a Braun for my next shaver.</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard and find it gives me a close shave.</li>
            <li> and I have a heavy beard</li>
            <li> it took a few weeks to 2 months for my face to get used to it.</li>
            <li> His beard is not so heavy though.  </li>
            <li> ; which is why I used it 4 times, &#x27;cause I don&#x27;t want to waste it.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have to shave everyday as I am retired.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t have the time to waste.</li>
            <li> No matter what I tried, it took me over ten minutes to get even a poor shave.  </li>
            <li> Norleco is round and can move in any, multi-directional.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and some weird curves in my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I shave everyday and don&#x27;t miss any spots</li>
            <li> (this area is difficult to shave with a Mach 3 because of frequent clogging).</li>
            <li> It may not sound like it</li>
            <li> I can *see* spots of hair that the shaver is missing, but going over those spots again and again still doesn&#x27;t remove them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Final Score:&lt;br /&gt;The Shave: 8/10 (since it&#x27;s not as close as a razor and missed a few hairs which I have to get with the trimmer.</li>
            <li> The charging cable has a sideways orientation (perpendicular to the tongs) and will not fit into the outlets in my bathroom because they are between two cabinets.  </li>
            <li> Plus it didn&#x27;t take but a few minutes to do it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> Had it for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> No tugging at my face required, but a few passes may be needed.</li>
            <li> Had trouble with foil heads</li>
            <li> I was hesitant before buying this product, but realized that my hesitation was a waste of time after a few days of using this shaver.</li>
            <li> I was durned if I was gonna pay that kind of outrageous price for a power</li>
            <li> Bye, bye Panasonic, just another corporate game of engineered life span.</li>
            <li> and I was constantly missing hairs.  </li>
            <li> It also seems to drop a lot of debris, so it can be a bit messy.  </li>
            <li> This was on sale a week or so back for $44.00, and I&#x27;ve always been using Norelco all my life, and was just tired of it snagging my beard,</li>
            <li> This was not a cheap shaver to begin with.</li>
            <li> he doesn&#x27;t have a really heavy beard</li>
            <li> It took about a week of shaving everyday to not have any razor burn or problems.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on all those \\&quot;gimmicky\\&quot; cleaning stations.</li>
            <li> I especially like using it with shaving cream and get approximately 5-6 uses before recharging it.</li>
            <li> It does give my face a smoother look without any sign of stubs left behind.</li>
            <li> I switched from norelco wet/dry for a few years and used Gillette in the interim.</li>
            <li> Used for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> After one month, I haven&#x27;t found anything about it that I disliked, yet.</li>
            <li> Gives a close shave in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> A few days of growth and a rotary razor would hurt like hell.</li>
            <li> but it is a part of my everyday routine.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve made a few upgrades.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> It has now stopped working completely, it is dead.  </li>
            <li> I also use Shave Secret which is a blend of essential oils and recommend it to any one that shaves with water.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up giving this shaver 4 stars instead of 5 for a few reasons:&lt;br /&gt;-One</li>
            <li> plan to update this review in a few months or so</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> and i have to go over my face a few times.</li>
            <li> It wasted the money.  </li>
            <li> In addition, it is faster and doesn&#x27;t require messy cleanups.  </li>
            <li> The foil that came with razor broke after few months of use.</li>
            <li> I bought a replacement but it also broke after few months.</li>
            <li> The popup trimmer is so narrow, it&#x27;s a joke and does not cut</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to razor shave everyday.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;I had been using a Gillette Fusion for quite a few years.</li>
            <li> Had this a few months now and still can&#x27;t figure it out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the Braun 7.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy that can go a few days between shaves.</li>
            <li> Heavy Duty</li>
            <li> Unlike my Norelco, once the battery is dead, it will not run when pluged</li>
            <li> I used my Panasonic ES8103 put me not adapted to the type of blade, because my beard is very sawn and difficult to make, in the area next to the nose is also difficult to remove the beard.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know where all the negative reviews are coming from but this razor is everything I expected.</li>
            <li> It is not noisy and gives a close shave without irritating my skin, especially on the neck.</li>
            <li> Trouble is, I can&#x27;t grow a beard to save my life.</li>
            <li> As I age and my skin changes, I was getting a few nicks and cuts with a blade, so I switched to the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I was a wet blade and shaving cream kinda guy, and decided I could cut out at least 5 minutes with this shaver while in the car.  </li>
            <li> Again, not a huge issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m keeping it, but I consider it slow and mediocre, but at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Firstly, I found out that Braun had made some changes and their quality had decreased over the last few years.  </li>
            <li> Almost because there were small patches of hair that refused to be cut down.</li>
            <li> it is no more cuts and sitting down while I&#x27;m shaving.</li>
            <li> The other negative is that I have to go over and over the same spot with the P, when the N used to do the same cutting in 2 or 3 swipes, it takes 6 or 8 with the P.</li>
            <li> I have probably tried three dozen electric shavers over the past 45+ years and never liked a single one of them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, since this shaver is brand new, I can only base my opinion about construction quality on previous experience with Panasonic models.</li>
            <li> I can shave now in less then 10 minutes!</li>
            <li> The shaver stopped working after less than a dozen shaves!  </li>
            <li> Its not much better than my previous model which does not have \\&quot;nano\\&quot; technology.   </li>
            <li> He previously had one of the self cleaning Braun shavers (lost in a move- doh!)</li>
            <li> I usually get about six shaves before recharging which is less than projected but acceptable.  </li>
            <li> It literally took me a minute and a half to shave!</li>
            <li> This shaver was much less irratating to get used to than past shavers also.</li>
            <li> but I would say that the Philips has a small advantage because it is much less noisy than the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> I usually follow-up with passes that are half across the grain, and</li>
            <li> If you push too hard, it will irritate your skin, like any other electric.</li>
            <li> I have had two other brands, the last one with the expensive cleaning cartridge system.</li>
            <li> : Some hairs are hard to shave due to growth direction.</li>
            <li> almost went for the expensive shavers that are sold by other brands, such as the SensoTouch.  </li>
            <li> The other 10% (hair uncut) can be trimmed using a regular safety razor.</li>
            <li> A very uncomfortable shave, like it&#x27;s grabbing whiskers and very hard to smoothly move across face,</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d get ingrown hairs or raw skin if I didn&#x27;t replace my (expensive) disposable blades frequently and the inexpensive ones tore up my face.  </li>
            <li> It does not irritate in the least as other always have.  </li>
            <li> that is if I use it at least every other day.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how it works on the tough facial hair that men have, but I do not recommend using this shaver if you are a woman.</li>
            <li> For years I used only the common cartridge razors but got sick of the skin irritation and high cost of refills.</li>
            <li> It just plain doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> (well, I only have 4 weeks for testing...  too bad because general return policy)&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has annoying clean</li>
            <li> It was not easy on the face like the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> -- The battery life indicator is difficult to see unless you&#x27;re in a dark room and there is no audible alarm that indicates that the battery is getting low.  </li>
            <li> -- The battery life indicator is difficult to see unless you&#x27;re in a dark room and there is no audible alarm that indicates that the battery is getting low.  </li>
            <li> of use: Not easy, I have pain in my hand after each shaving -1</li>
            <li> The head is not easily maneuverable and it is cumbersome.  </li>
            <li> , unfortunately it works to the same extent as I remember these 15 years ago, not 100% efficient and not worth the time.</li>
            <li> hairs are not easy to cut.  </li>
            <li> I have a fairly heavy beard and it did not even slow this thing down.  </li>
            <li> My shave is complete in 3-4 minutes and it&#x27;s got a stray hair cutter in-between the two stubble foils to get those long ones your other razor leaves under the base of your jawbone.</li>
            <li> I had always bought the little rinky dink electric razors and was never satisfied with their performance.</li>
            <li> there is a con, I think this item is a little noisier than past razors</li>
            <li> the lack of quality in the components has me believing that it will not make it much past the warranty period before it fails or breaks due so a short drop to the counter while shaving.</li>
            <li> There was someone else&#x27;s little shavings and dried skin ALL OVER the inside!</li>
            <li> They say that you need to keep using the shaver, tough it out and your skin will get used to it, I&#x27;ve owned all of them long term</li>
            <li> It not only does not trim very well, but because it comes off of the side of the shaver and does not extend past the shaver head, it is nearly impossible to see what you are trimming!</li>
            <li> I only got half my use out of the expensive $45 foil/blade kit</li>
            <li> I had one of these several years ago and when it wore out, I downgraded to a less expensive model.  </li>
            <li> Of course, using it wet or with some shaving cream makes it less irritating.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t heard a single complaint from him in all the months he&#x27;s been using this!</li>
            <li> Pressing down too hard taxes the motor and will wear out the foil faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first one had bad LED indicator after 1.5 years and was replaced by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty bad.</li>
            <li> My first bad experience with you guys.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only real complaint I have is that this doesn&#x27;t suck in the cut hairs as well as</li>
            <li> My only real complaint with the Panasonic would be the noise.  </li>
            <li> Wet shaving is not good the wiskers gum up the blades.  </li>
            <li> my only real complaint is with the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have tried electric shavers in the past but have always gone back to a traditional razor, even after using the very expensive electrics.</li>
            <li> One small drawback is that it leaves a few whiskers in the neck area</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve usually let the battery go completely dead before recharging, as I believe this keeps the battery from developing the memory effect and shortening the duration of the charge before needing plugged in again.  </li>
            <li> I have had a Remington and a Braun over the past few years.  </li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t shave everyday, usually 3-4 times a week.</li>
            <li> I have used a Braun razor for 10+ years, but am tired of how long it takes to shave.  </li>
            <li> He usually get the shavers with the 3 round blades.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t slow down progressively as the battery runs lower.</li>
            <li> Been through three Norelco shavers and they all eventually slow down, and none provide a closer shave than the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Initially I felt a little uncomfortable using it</li>
            <li> The trimmer on this unit actually pulls out your long hairs more than cutting them off; I couldn&#x27;t believe how terrible it is.  </li>
            <li> I typically add a bead of liquid soap and a little water which has the double-benefit of keeping it cleaner and is less irritating on the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I have a few trouble spots that this shaver just seems to have a hard time with.  </li>
            <li> is not very effective.</li>
            <li> I have tried electric razors for decades but they always leave my face raw.</li>
            <li> This product was a deal of the day, so I grabbed it since I desperately needed a new shaver.</li>
            <li> The angle on the new trimmer is awkward to use.</li>
            <li> At the beggining when i first used it, i was a little shocked because it cut my skin in my neck area, but it was because I press it too hard against my skin, and it needs to get use to it before I do that, so after that i continued using it</li>
            <li> At last I had to leave the plug in because there wasn&#x27;t enough reserve power to even get a bad shave without leaving it plugged in.</li>
            <li> I was previously using the Panasonic ES7037 and found it to be a slow but workable razor.  </li>
            <li> The battery features alone areworth at least half the price of the shaver.</li>
            <li> I use wet shaving techniques: badger brush from Parker Safety, Proraso Green soap, plus Shave Secret as a pre-shave.  </li>
            <li> There was little bits of hair on it!</li>
            <li> This was purchased for a man whose illness caused his skin to become very sensitive and any cuts would have been dangerous.</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to shave around my chin.</li>
            <li> I have tried electric razors in the past with no real happiness.</li>
            <li> I did try it once both with a wet shave and with shaving cream and it felt weird to me probably because I never tried it before with any other shaver</li>
            <li> Cleaning is a little complex, since you use liquid soap as well as water, but it&#x27;s not a hardship.    </li>
            <li> The little itty bitty trimmer sucks.    </li>
            <li> - I shave every day with very little irritation, if any.  </li>
            <li> Apply very little pressure and let the speed of the blade do the work.</li>
            <li> Not only can I not shave my face without experiencing excruciating pain and left a bloody mess, but I can&#x27;t even fully shave my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very little burn.  </li>
            <li> (If you have a tight or average jawline the head of the razor will be too big and make it nearly          impossible to shave hairs along the jawline even though the head flexes side to side)        </li>
            <li> It does absolutely nothing for my neck; unless I don&#x27;t shave for awhile.. then it&#x27;ll act like a bad trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too bad, it really seemed like a bargain based on its reviews.</li>
            <li> I have to blow on the cutting head anyway to clear it, and it doesn&#x27;t make any difference which speed I use.</li>
            <li> you have Gillette Fusion, don&#x27;t buy it, it&#x27;s waste of money!</li>
            <li> The pop-up trimmer is small, but it does the job.    </li>
            <li> It was purchased as a replacement to his similar (Arc4) shaver which failed just before the 2 year warranty expired.</li>
            <li> and I am not sure how it would perform if you were the beast man?</li>
            <li> The sideburn trimmer stopped working after 40 days, 10 days past the return date for Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I shave wet with Panasonic ES8103S, with a thin layer of shave gel and lots of water.</li>
            <li> I was not sure it was working until I felt the smoothness of the shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco and Braun products for over the past 15 years</li>
            <li> Now it is well past 30 days.</li>
            <li> Braun is quite expensive; none of what I see of Braun today seems to suggest that it will be similar to what I have.</li>
            <li> After using disposable razors for the past fifteen years, I decided to return to an electric.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what could improve this.</li>
            <li> Not sure that I&#x27;m going to get the number of shaves per charge that they said  </li>
            <li> I have owned a Braun in the past and after it was stolen from my vehicle</li>
            <li> I have a difficult to shave beard, so I have to shave with an electric, then shave with a regular razor.</li>
            <li> - Not sure if over charging will hurt anything.</li>
            <li> However, this is pointless.</li>
            <li> I thought the handle was a bit small</li>
            <li> I used Norelco shavers for years, but took the leap to Panasonic this past Christmas.  </li>
            <li> The quality of the product is questionable, but only time will tell.  </li>
            <li> It is no better than the 20 dollar shaver I had before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 2 of these razors over the past 2 yrs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> I use this when I don&#x27;t have time to shave with my DE shaving kit (usually M-F).</li>
            <li> I and my family have used Braun electric shavers for the past 9 years.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver with the hopes that it would prevent ingrown hairs that I usually get when I shave.</li>
            <li> I have owned two ES8103S shavers over the past three years.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not sure when)</li>
            <li> (And this is usually time to recharge).</li>
            <li> it  is too small and holds to hair.  </li>
            <li> Usually use it in shower.</li>
            <li> However similar Brauns to my 7000 Syncro are now quite expensive.  </li>
            <li> It requires a lot of time to remove just the fairly small amount that it accomplishes.</li>
            <li> My past experience includes rotary and track shavers.</li>
            <li> I am NOT a satisfied Panasonic customer.</li>
            <li> No more razor rash from the manual approach...</li>
            <li> He used to shave with a razor blade everyday, now he never touches that!  </li>
            <li> NOTE that because these areas are shaved EVERY DAY so there was just small stubble.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;m retired and lazy and don&#x27;t want to take the time to pull out the shaving cream and razor.</li>
            <li> After using rotary shavers for the past 14 years, I decided to try a foil type.  </li>
            <li> SO small nick from safety razor was causing problems</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves it and uses it almost everyday!</li>
            <li> I usually used phillips brand when I change to Panasonic product.</li>
            <li> I remembered using a Norelco as well as one of these in the past.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect and in several ways not better than my rotary shaver.</li>
            <li> Usually go w/ the Norelco circular blades, but wanted to give this a try.  </li>
            <li> My son refused to use electric razors after only finding ones that pulled and were uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> And because it lasts a while I don&#x27;t usually pack the charging cord and I would be screwed.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor as a travel companion to my usual razor.  </li>
            <li> No more rashes or bumps.</li>
            <li> I usually use a manual blade instead.</li>
            <li> Braun makes 100 times better shaver than this crap Panasonic!!!</li>
            <li> I used a blade for the past 20 years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Brauns, Norelcos and Remingtons and it usually takes weeks for an electric razor to shave closely</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Braun&#x27;s and Panasonic&#x27;s in the past</li>
            <li> I have used Braun shavers for the past 15 years and always felt they were a quality product.</li>
            <li> It just seems like the cutting blade may be a tad bit too far from the foil</li>
            <li> Bag is too small to store the charging cord.</li>
            <li> No more 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  </li>
            <li> mostly if not all Norelco&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully the battery will outlast the 1 1/2 years I usually get out of the Norelcos.</li>
            <li> I usually   find what I want on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Husband was not pleased with the closeness of shave.</li>
            <li> I usually shave with a blade in the shower, but I wanted a reliable electric that would come close to the blade&#x27;s effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> It never got past what I&#x27;d call halfway done, leaving me me with patches of stuble all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I shave usually twice during the week electric, once on the weekend blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it can&#x27;t cove small hairs</li>
            <li> I got a picture of a faucet on the small screen and couldn&#x27;t find out what it meant (in fairness, it was buried in the instructions).</li>
            <li> NO MORE.</li>
            <li> , dead!</li>
            <li> Takes getting used to, and there&#x27;s not magic to it.</li>
            <li> faucet about twice a week for the past two years.  </li>
            <li> It does a terrible job on my neck no matter how many times I go over it.</li>
            <li> I was not sure about foil</li>
            <li> I usually get irritation on my head and face from electric razors.  </li>
            <li> no more.  </li>
            <li> Its supposed to be a wet/dry shaver and is even worse when wet.</li>
            <li> past</li>
            <li> Shaving with a razor blade is a thing of the past - time to move on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco buy was never satisfied with the pinching I got, I&#x27;ve used the the Gillette 5 blades and 4 and their 3 and 2.</li>
            <li> usually run the machine in alcohol afterwards</li>
            <li> Three of the shavers used in the past had this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will usually use a manual razor in the shower, then use my electric to pick up anything I missed.  </li>
            <li> He has yet to recharge the battery, and he&#x27;s been using it every day for the past three weeks.  </li>
            <li> I usually had to use razor additionally for this</li>
            <li> Not too difficult, of course, but time consuming for me personally.</li>
            <li> but no better.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately with the Panasonic I feel stubbly the very next day.</li>
            <li> so not sure what the performance would be with that...</li>
            <li> Only one  thing wrong doesn&#x27;t have a stand to hold it, for the price it should.</li>
            <li> There are still the usual spots on my neck</li>
            <li> Worked ok around the chin and under the nose, but did an awful job under my chin and on my neck.  </li>
            <li> not sure if this is for safety as it&#x27;s a wet/dry unit</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I wish I could send it back.</li>
            <li> : I started shaving after my showers and it seemed to not shave as close, not really sure why.</li>
            <li> I usually take about 10 minutes to shave in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;-It.</li>
            <li> was just past warranty.</li>
            <li> I usually charge when it hits 10 or 20%, and it&#x27;ll charge in under an hour.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a couple times because I hate shaving in general.</li>
            <li> Small vibration than I</li>
            <li> It even peels of the skin at edges and bursts small acne.</li>
            <li> he used it after not shaving for quite some time and even though he usually has to use a trimmer</li>
            <li> I have had many razors in my life, but this is probably the worst that I have used.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would buy again  </li>
            <li> No more shaver&#x27;s bumps with this razor..</li>
            <li> big problem is the shaver failed (it won&#x27;t turn on) after 23 months, and panasonic support/warranty service cannot be contacted.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> However, it will always leave larger hairs uncut.</li>
            <li> Can be use just for littler things :/</li>
            <li> one small setback, the re-chargeable battery has to be unpluugged , when at 100%.</li>
            <li> Not sure why I waited until 40 to try an electric.</li>
            <li> Lazy man&#x27;s friend.  </li>
            <li> This Panasonic ES8103S shaver is the worst I&#x27;ve ever used of the many I&#x27;ve had now at age 59.</li>
            <li> Have used Electric razors in the past But to get a close shave, I would have to use a blade razor .</li>
            <li> The only thing I was not impressed by was the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li> Was never satisfied.</li>
            <li> the usual Braun or Norelco&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This is by far the closest cutting electric I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> CONs:   - A little hard to shave at my upper-lip to nose area but nothing worse that other electrics   </li>
            <li> Also, running it down to zero at home is no great inconvenience; if it stalls in mid-shave just a few minutes on charge will let you finish.</li>
            <li> I have used Braun shavers for 25+ years, but their less expensive shavers are now crap and even the expensive ones don&#x27;t usually get good reviews.</li>
            <li> While not a great shaver, it is a lot quieter and vibrates less than a Remington electric shaver I bought a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> I gotta do like 5 passes to get it to look at the very least like 5 oclock shadow, and that was with the wet shave!</li>
            <li> but that is very messy.</li>
            <li> - maybe I have very heavy beard.</li>
            <li> If you are tired of paying, what seems to me to be an endlessly increasing cost, for razor blades you should give this a try.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is poor and extremely abrasive.  </li>
            <li> The shaver should have been allowed to run while plugged in (as the recharger is in the outlet plug to the wall socket and other, less expensive brands/models do</li>
            <li> After a few months, the display went bad, and after just a year, it died completely.  </li>
            <li> It appears to be the same razor as the next one up which has the liquid base unit.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in having to buy one of these every year, if they even last that long...  </li>
            <li> I have a sensitive face with slight acne and sebbhoric dermatitis, and this helps keep me from irritating everything or cutting often.</li>
            <li> found this shaver painful, particularly in the mustache area when using pre-shave lotion or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I might miss a day or two (busy, tired, want to go for that rugged, unkempt look, etc.,) and this razor has a bit of difficulty in compensating for even one missed day of growth.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> I had tried all the major brands and was generally unhappy with them.</li>
            <li> Not very good.  </li>
            <li> Cons:  Sideburn trimmer is not very good.</li>
            <li> change an electrical shaver/razor when the battery gets weak, or typically about 2-3 years.  </li>
            <li> I bought this model since other razors had comments about the round design heads being difficult to get in between mouth and nose and mouth and chin.  </li>
            <li> Returned didn&#x27;t work very well, my husband was disappointed..</li>
            <li> Sorry I waited so long.</li>
            <li> I used to hate shaving, this razor changed that after my first shave with it.</li>
            <li> I have owned the early norelcos to the very expensive braun&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> My hair is rather thick, though not coarse, so perhaps those with thick hair should be wary of this...</li>
            <li> Would shy away from the long hair of sideburns.</li>
            <li> This is worse paying extra for the wet function I think unless you want to use dirty blade shaving your skin</li>
            <li> You can not go wrong purchasing this shaver for less than half</li>
            <li> Bottom line, I can lean over on my elbows or sit down when I get tired.</li>
            <li> Not good on hard or heavy beards.</li>
            <li> importantly, no more underarm rashes and no more shave bumps!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ugly, I do not like this new faux chrome look</li>
            <li> The razor doesn&#x27;t hurt near as bad as others have in the past.</li>
            <li> Absolutely useless dry -</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve established this thing is useless dry.</li>
            <li> The shave is smoother and less irritating than any electric shaver I have used, including the Braun.</li>
            <li> After using it now for 4 or so shaves I must say how stupid I was to wait this long in trying something different.</li>
            <li> I personally find the trimmer on this too small and awkward for trimming around my beard/mustache.</li>
            <li> I have never experienced as close a shave with any previous electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The reason I hate shaving with a regular blade is it takes so long</li>
            <li> a bit tight on the tough curves of neck region ..</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard, so it does take a little work.</li>
            <li> and it was hard to get the hairs on the neck.  </li>
            <li> For the money, I think it would be hard to beat this Panasonic shaver.  </li>
            <li> A toothbrush would work too, but might dull the razors over time.</li>
            <li> A toothbrush would work too, but might dull the razors over time.</li>
            <li> However, this razor seems to have a hard time on the neck area, which is probably attributed to its linear blade design.  </li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t press the thing against my face so hard.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to push it hard against my face to get a close shave</li>
            <li> and it gets all the hard to shave face and neck areas.</li>
            <li> Hard to get close shave.</li>
            <li> started pulling hard on my whiskers.  </li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re doing the neck and don&#x27;t hardly shave it.</li>
            <li> Hard to believe but this cuts as close as a blade</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have to press hard --</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to think that there is something else with this level of quality at this price.</li>
            <li> This is the fastest electric razor I&#x27;ve ever hard.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to get information on how Panasonics repair process works.</li>
            <li> He thinks he has to work too hard, but it could be his technique.  </li>
            <li> I tend to be hard on things</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s why you gotta press hard on the foil to get close.</li>
            <li> It hardly causes any abrasions.</li>
            <li> but as with blades they get dull, and can irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this shaves just as close without irritation, without the need to keep replacing dull blades.</li>
            <li> You can press fairly hard to get a close shave without irritation or razor burn.  </li>
            <li> Its hard to get rid of the neck beard.</li>
            <li> I get 3 probably because I am trying too hard to get close shave at the curves.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend pushing hard with the trimmer at all; it looks like it could pinch/tear skin that managed to get caught.  </li>
            <li> I hardly ever even use a blade because this makes shaving easier.</li>
            <li> hard would that be?&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because it is perpendicular to the shaving head, it can be hard to see what you&#x27;re doing.  </li>
            <li> Hard to get a close shave on the neck.  </li>
            <li> Leaves some area no matter how hard you try.  </li>
            <li> If stub is &amp;#62;1 day then hard to get it off with this.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time justifing wasting all the water a shower produces just to shave.  </li>
            <li> (not I push hard against my face)&lt;br /&gt;-Take</li>
            <li> Do not press hard.  </li>
            <li> I tried really hard to like this product.</li>
            <li> I used ~ 10 times, it already dull.</li>
            <li> The battery no longer held a charge and it was hard to find replacement blades for it.</li>
            <li> Used every day it gets dull in about 12 months.  </li>
            <li> like it&#x27;s dull but it didn&#x27;t look used since all package seals were intact.</li>
            <li> It may be hard to believe</li>
            <li> On this model, the little display screen is poorly thought out.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find no noticable improvement from my older razor, or at least no design improvements.</li>
            <li> bought this because of the high reviews and was sorely disappointed...</li>
            <li> Past the 30 days of use it makes my skin raw, red, and painful.</li>
            <li> The first one I had 15 years ago was very unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> Was not happy with other less expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Ok I have read all the good,the bad and the ugly comments concerning this shaver</li>
            <li> One complaint, which prevents my rating this at 5-stars, is the side-trimmer.  </li>
            <li> By late in the day, a touch up shave would be required if you were going out.  </li>
            <li> overall, a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my Panasonic ES8067, which lasted at least 9 years.  </li>
            <li> The manual requires you give at least 30 days for your face to get accustomed to the razor.</li>
            <li> I shave 5 times a week, at least.</li>
            <li> Recently, I have had to go on a blood thinner and have been worried about cutting myself.</li>
            <li> Remington sucks.  </li>
            <li> Having owned several electric razors in the past I was very skeptical of this product, however it has exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> At least for that Braun.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve never liked any of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was hesitant on this razor after seeing some of the negative reviews: I am one of those &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Such a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> so I complained to them about it to no avail.    </li>
            <li> would recommend it, if you are looking for an electric shaver and care at least a bit about the money.</li>
            <li> the only disappointment is the trimer</li>
            <li> And 6 months after using it I haven&#x27;t heard one complaint yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But instead of apologizing for their product&#x27;s shoddy quality/design, they advised me that my warranty was cancelled because I&#x27;d taken the razor out of the US.</li>
            <li> at least $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> works as expected and nothing goes wrong so far.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Do not believe the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> Having recently started shaving and cutting myself with ravors this product helped.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of anything negative to say about the razor.</li>
            <li> The thing I like the least is that the clippings have to be cleaned out all the time.</li>
            <li> At least once per shave.</li>
            <li> Almost two years after purchasing this product, shaving at least 5-7 times per week, I have yet to find one complaint about this product.</li>
            <li> complaint...</li>
            <li> In my case, my wife constantly reminds me that I am the reason the sink and counter are dirty as there is hair dust all over.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was really heavy and loud and did not come with a base.</li>
            <li> (duh).</li>
            <li> The instructions that came with the razor said to give the razor a try for at least 30 days.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping using an electric shaver would be quicker but it isn&#x27;t, at least for now.</li>
            <li> (at least if you have course hair)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used an electric give this a try for at least 30 days</li>
            <li> However, at least you&#x27;ll attain peace of mind knowing that your shaver and toxic battery didn&#x27;t end up in the landfill.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> The cover screen for the cutting blades only lasted 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> like all electric razors that I have desperately tried to like, it fell short.  </li>
            <li> but recently, my facial hair started to grow like crazy.</li>
            <li> disappointment came about two weeks after initial use.</li>
            <li> issues of redness or difficulty adjusting at least for</li>
            <li> Battery life still seems to be holding up (couple of hours with each charge) and the razor is still cutting the same.</li>
            <li> It took almost an hour to refit it delicately.</li>
            <li> When engaged, it is not readily visible making any trim work blind.  </li>
            <li> Give it at least 2-4 weeks, just like the instructions and videos say.</li>
            <li> Panasonic was a big disappointment and not just because I was accustomed to Norelco.  </li>
            <li> I can still at least tell when my machine needs to be charged, though.</li>
            <li> But that is also because my beard grows awkward and not all hair grow in same direction.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a few bad things but not enough to take away a star:&lt;br /&gt;Pop-</li>
            <li> glass cap that comes with the product is useless and actually makes things worse by preventing evaporation</li>
            <li> I seem to have been saying this a lot lately, but this was priced well and it works well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, who always complained about his electric shavers (yet wouldn&#x27;t use a razor blade.)</li>
            <li> Big Disappointment of quality of replacement blades.</li>
            <li> If you have sensistive skin give this razor a try for at least a month and then reap the benefits.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t  believe some people write negative reviews on this product, they probably have beards made of  copper wire.  </li>
            <li> Charge lasts about a week of shaving at least once per day.</li>
            <li> My husband had never liked using an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> If you just have some stuble, this shaver sucks.</li>
            <li> it sucks.</li>
            <li> Then I thought, maybe  shaver technology has improved since then (duh).  </li>
            <li> Also cleaning instructions are confusing.</li>
            <li> I tried it out for over 4 weeks, shaving at least 3-4 times/week.</li>
            <li> at least four or five times.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so he needed a razor that would cut through a thick beard and</li>
            <li> If I would have to rank it out of all the types of shaves I listed, it would be #3, with straight blade coming in at #1 and safety razor at #2.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on how it compares for thick hair.</li>
            <li> One thing to note is that I do not have a thick beard at all</li>
            <li> I guess the shaving cream was to thick to get close to the skin.</li>
            <li> and my hair isn&#x27;t that thick.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a thick beard</li>
            <li> i dont have a thick beard at all and shave about twice a week.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend uses it for both his face and his head and he has fairly thick hair.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m forced to shave once every 4-5 days.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this for any men with thick wiry beards.</li>
            <li> Slow to finish it well on ones face.</li>
            <li> I do not think I have a particularly thick beard</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a thick beard, nor do I grow one, but it is way faster than putting cream and using a blade.  </li>
            <li> This machine is not for tough beards that grow in different directions in whirlwind patterns or for beards that are dry and curly (like mine :(...)</li>
            <li> I bought this razor because I get very bad razor bumps using several different razors.</li>
            <li> my other shavers have been uncomfortable and buzzed loudly like a bunch of  angry hornets which after using felt as though it was angry hornets stinging me.</li>
            <li> I searched for shavers reviews before I jumped into buying, completely sick of a razor and completely overwhelmed by the variety of shavers.</li>
            <li> Not VERY happy</li>
            <li> No more!</li>
            <li> Just use a little water and some hand soap, it&#x27;s done in three minutes, no more expensive cleaning docks and the cleaner that goes with them.</li>
            <li> What does it mean?</li>
            <li> Accidental cuts with the blade are a thing of the past!</li>
            <li> That would mean immediate throw out and using another.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who went on blood thinners, so no more razors!</li>
            <li> Every one of those other shavers I owned would randomly irritate my neck and leave patches of stubble.  </li>
            <li> All of my other shavers were like a skin torture device to some degree or another on seemingly random days.  </li>
            <li> I mean something.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the worst shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned over the past 36 years, especially compared to the Braun shavers I owned before Gillette bought them out, jacked up prices and added Chinese parts.  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s that, no hairs left around the sink for the girlfriend to get mad about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Razors always remove a layer of skin so using them a lot leaves your skin feeling raw and worse</li>
            <li> I have a thick, tough beard and the Panasonic breezes through in very few passes.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not too bad of usage, except when you pay a small fortune for them, they should last longer and that isn&#x27;t just changing the screen or the cutters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> About every few years I will try an electric, but I always end up disappointed and back on the blade.  </li>
            <li> still have to clean up my neck with the razor, but nothing too terrible.</li>
            <li> The norelco had battery failure and the remington had a cleaning system that also charged the unit.</li>
            <li> The older Panasonics used a base with a cableless charging connection to the shaver.</li>
            <li> Panasonic and Remington have always served me well and replacements have never been because of failure of the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair grows in very strange directions on my face so shaving was always uncomfortable, and it was even worse with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> am a military member and I suffer the curse of the 9am shadow (i wake up at 4am)&lt;br /&gt;this thing made my morning routine less painful.</li>
            <li> Sounds like a giant metallic &amp; very angry wasp trying to land on your chin.</li>
            <li> I thought the 3-blade system wouldn&#x27;t be much different than the 4-blade, but I was very wrong.</li>
            <li> And not having my face turn into a bloody mess is a big plus.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m not impressed, it doesn&#x27;t work for me and thought it may be comparable, it&#x27;s not worth the money since it doesn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Wet shave is worthless, no self cleaning base, takes several passes to get the right shave</li>
            <li> I have used it a month and have saved appx 15% of the purchase price by not having to pay ridiculous money for Mach 3 blades.  </li>
            <li> Lately, I&#x27;ve been experiencing very raw skin after shaves with my safety razor and was tired of the 10 minutes I had to spend setting up and shaving every morning</li>
            <li> I left him with such a horrible shave.</li>
            <li> otherwise my face would look ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> This is a serious drawback.</li>
            <li> I know because I had a Norelco shaver  3 or 4 years ago and by the time I realized I could have paid a lot less online for the OVERPRICED replacements, my model was discontinued and the price was expensive no matter where I went.</li>
            <li> seriously.</li>
            <li> It worked for awhile but the mesh grill got holes in it after a year and having to pay $30 for the snap on head replacement is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> In less than a year, the display on the replacement also began to fail, so I could no longer determine the state of charge.</li>
            <li> Smoother shave than the less expensive model I had been using.  </li>
            <li> Terrible shaver, it misses a lot of hairs and you have to go over the same spot numerous times.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic is less expensive, and provides the closest shave of any electric ever tried before, with ZERO (yes ZERO) irritation.</li>
            <li> **serious*</li>
            <li> and I seriously couldn&#x27;t expect anymore from a razor, electric or not.</li>
            <li> I will be returning this within 30 days and looking for a Black Friday deal for a Arc IV since the 4th blade adds quite a bit in price (questionable value for 4 blades).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will be returning this within 30 days and looking for a Black Friday deal for a Arc IV since the 4th blade adds quite a bit in price (questionable value for 4 blades).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much less expensive than 5 blade model.</li>
            <li> After getting sick and tired of buying razor blades and all the things associated with having sensitive skin I decided to give this a try.  </li>
            <li> I have a very thick beard and have always had a hard time getting a close shave.</li>
            <li> I usually get a new razor every year (in the past I had terrible issues with losing cords or charge stands).</li>
            <li> I took one star off due to it not coming with any travel case, instead it comes with a useless thin cloth pouch.</li>
            <li> For years i&#x27;ve had that burn and its a little weird not feeling that.</li>
            <li> LITTLE BE TO EXPENSIVE</li>
            <li> but I need a time to adapt this shaver, and a little expensive.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that you cant charge it while you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is it makes a lot of noise when my father uses it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shave on the weekend, on Monday the shave is so bad I have to go back over it with my razor -</li>
            <li> I only get about 5 shaves before it needs a charge, which still isn&#x27;t bad in my book.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not good.  </li>
            <li> I feel I was sold a product in which the battery was not good, for whatever reason.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not good at all.</li>
            <li> I dont like shaving one bit and the cost of razor blades is silly, so I went electric quite a few years ago.</li>
            <li> When it comes to shaving though, its not nearly as good as the Remington that I used to have.</li>
            <li> So, now I&#x27;m stuck with a product that is essentially a useless waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always understood it&#x27;s really not good for the skin to shave up</li>
            <li> Also not good shave as phillips equipment.</li>
            <li> Still not a good as a razor blade, but beats using a blade and shaving cream every day.</li>
            <li> Shaves well over the face but not good over the neck area and bellow the chin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;some... no good condition..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good for manscaping (tried it)</li>
            <li> But the time to shave everyday, the burning feeling and the expensive blades made me think about trying one of these.</li>
            <li> used the lock sliding button to lock and unlock the head, no difference.&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, this is not a good shaver.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, I hate shaving with an old school razor -</li>
            <li> It all depends on your expectations--and your whiskers, what quality--tuf, thin, thick, sparse</li>
            <li> lather- shaving with plain water is difficult and spotty.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> I had been turned off by non-rotary razors due to bad experiences in the past.</li>
            <li> The shave was mediocre and required a lot of time and a circular motion that was no easy with a beard.  </li>
            <li> This was somewhat of a disappointment for my husband due to lack of effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> However, one infuriating feature of the Norelco was that the battery was soldered in, and due to a disability, I have difficulty soldering.</li>
            <li> I received a new Braun shaver this past Christmas and was very disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> For the money this shaver is hard to beat !  </li>
            <li> I could hardly believe it!</li>
            <li> But no matter how hard I try, I can&#x27;t get the Panasonic to leave any burns!</li>
            <li> thinking a through cleaning would help.now the shave was worse than ever bad enough to buy another electric razor.i&#x27;m retired and have used electric razors since 16 yrs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too expensive up front, considering the future expense of screens and cutting heads.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t like to shave some of the hair at the base of my neck or around my Adams apple</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t been too unhappy with that little failure.</li>
            <li> My first shave was terrible.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed, especially if you have used others.</li>
            <li> but battery was getting weak, &amp;</li>
            <li> The first time i used this shaver it was terrible.</li>
            <li> duh!  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this shaver&#x27;s ability to actually give me a shave.  </li>
            <li> I understand I purchased a used razor from Amazon&#x27;s Warehouse Deals, but I would expect the item to have been at least cleaned if it was in fact used by someone else!</li>
            <li> but the battery is getting weak</li>
            <li> If your charge runs out, you can&#x27;t just attach the cord &amp; keep shaving, which is dumb.</li>
            <li> now that I reflect I think I was pretty terrible with a disposable.</li>
            <li> My husband is very hard to please and doesn&#x27;t like anything I buy for him.  </li>
            <li> Charges quicker than my BrAun &amp; Remington that I have now retired , cut closer than a blade with less irritation &amp; the speed at which the cutting blades travel makes the job quicker.</li>
            <li> My former shaver was very difficult to use under these conditions, and there were times I wouldn&#x27;t even bother because I knew it would be too difficult to move around on my skin, which would cause irritation.  </li>
            <li> I think this was a slight disappointment for me.</li>
            <li> I usually wake up late and I also hate to shave with a razor everyday</li>
            <li> - Neck area is tough to get right/smooth  -</li>
            <li> He is so tough to buy for.   </li>
            <li> I have pitted and bumpy skin from years of acne, so I have tough skin to manuever and get a close shave without getting nicked.  </li>
            <li> I have an extremely tough beard and never had an electric razor that gave me a close shave until I got this one.</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard and this blazes through it.  </li>
            <li> Wow...give the Panasonic engineers credit on this one guys, and I have a fairly tough beard</li>
            <li> hairs are tough to get as there are no slots accomadating them.</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard</li>
            <li> If you have a tough beard don&#x27;t buy one.</li>
            <li> I do not have a \\&quot;tough beard\\&quot; and this thing takes awhile to shave.  </li>
            <li> Cuts very slowly so takes longer to shave.  </li>
            <li> my father purchased this razor a few weeks ago and LOVES it!!!  </li>
            <li> A little disappointment.</li>
            <li> I had a little concern going from a &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; cutting head to a curved &amp;#34;arc&amp;#34; one.  </li>
            <li> (obviously they think their customers are stupid, and will buy a replacement instead of going two weeks without a shave).</li>
            <li> Shaving in the shower was poor anyway.</li>
            <li> bought this shaver to replace an ES8109S that got dropped and broken.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also bought a shave secret shaving oil and edge shaving gel shaving cream.</li>
            <li> does not look ergonomic at all and feels even worse...</li>
            <li> I have been using electric shavers for 60 years, but I have never experienced one like this.  </li>
            <li> After shaving with a blade for 35 years, I got tired of the ingrown hairs and razor irritation.  </li>
            <li> Hair falls out when cutting so it is messy too.  </li>
            <li> As the days went by, the razor performed progressively worse.</li>
            <li> It leaves no whisker behind in no time at all.</li>
            <li> It really annoyed me that the battery is not user-replaceable.</li>
            <li> I did not want to buy the liquid cleaning base which would need a constant refilling expense since I could just rinse this one off.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for approximately 3 weeks now.</li>
            <li> buddy used my razor in secret after staying over.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, I thought 4 heads sounded fairly unnecessary.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, I thought 4 heads sounded fairly unnecessary.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this shaver because of the negative reviews...particularly the recurring problems of water seepage and battery issues, and the seemingly difficult dealings with Panasonic customer service.  </li>
            <li> The loudness is so irritating that I decided to take one star away.</li>
            <li> I still like my 2-blade for my thin mustache</li>
            <li> LCD display is poorly engineered.  </li>
            <li> The item has been in use for approximately 3/4 weeks.</li>
            <li> At some point; however, water must have seeped behind the screen despite not showing any visible sign of damage.</li>
            <li> There is no water or vapor behind the screen this time.</li>
            <li> I know that the smell originates from my face, but in all my years of shaving with electric razors , I have never experienced anything like this.</li>
            <li> poor design</li>
            <li> leaves hairs behind, even when going over them 10</li>
            <li> Not a great solution using two electric shavers.</li>
            <li> This razor is deficient in hair clipping capture.</li>
            <li> Market them as quality and STAND BEHIND them</li>
            <li> and I noticed that the hair trimmer is broken.</li>
            <li> Shaves close without irritating your skin like razors.</li>
            <li> It provides a non irritating close shave after your skin gets use to it.</li>
            <li> The shave is much worse.</li>
            <li> again I have become tired of using a razor and shaving cream.</li>
            <li> What I am NOT happy about is that water has leaked into the LED display in just two months of use.</li>
            <li> Secondly, there is no induction charge base.</li>
            <li> I REALLY miss that charger base!</li>
            <li> His eyesight is poor.  </li>
            <li> alas, it didn&#x27;t work to his satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I used the razor for 7 days to try to &amp;#34;acclimate&amp;#34; to the razor, but my skin has been broken out like I have never had before.</li>
            <li> They have always been a poor substitute for a blade</li>
            <li> and/or irritating to my skin.  </li>
            <li> Tired of underarms burning and itching.</li>
            <li> Not a fan, cut&#x27;s poorly</li>
            <li> The charge lasts approximately one to two week.  </li>
            <li> And if my Panasonic ES8103S  were to be stolen or broken by a mislaid hammer blow</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I cannot get a hold of the seller so its game on&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Thisis worse thatn the one I had over 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> Poor material?</li>
            <li> I have moles on my head that a straight blade opens up and they bleed horrible.  </li>
            <li> Not a great combo.</li>
            <li> I was tired of cheaper, lower RPM electric razors pulling on my skin when shaving.</li>
            <li> I have used this razor for approximately three months.</li>
            <li> , the screen fell out, with thin plastic ends, etc.</li>
            <li> you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is poor.  </li>
            <li> It is absolutely the worst electric shaver I have ever owned!</li>
            <li> When I bought this one, I figured that I had a month break-in time where my face is broken into the punishment of the razor.  </li>
            <li> For this reason, the cleaning add-ons are completely unnecessary.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;this one and had worse results.  </li>
            <li> Having to replace the outer foil frequently is frustrating.</li>
            <li> The razor gives a close shave without irritating the skin.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer nestled between the two blades has significantly decreased the amount of time I spend shaving.</li>
            <li> Having never used an electric razor I was tired of spending my money on blades, shave cream and bandages</li>
            <li> and I was never really happy with it.</li>
            <li> So, I think that is false advertising to make one believe a shaver will work without a battery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been recently using single blades because I&#x27;ve been getting terrible raw and painful shaves.</li>
            <li> Replacement blades are very expensive, typically half the cost of the shaver.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other shavers before that just tug at the chin/neck hair and irritate badly.</li>
            <li> So after recharging, you must unplug the charger, and then you might as well put the charger away, due to its ugly and inelegant non-coiled cord.</li>
            <li> Trimmer is small but even worse quite awkward; however, when used it works quite well   </li>
            <li> Trimmer is WAY too small and is at an awkward angle.</li>
            <li> The cutting area is too small</li>
            <li> , you will ABSOLUTELY HATE the long hair pop-up trimmer on this Panasonic ES8103S.  </li>
            <li> I was sick and tired of spending so much money on shaving and the stupid cleaning solution</li>
            <li> I tried the new one and it is horrible.</li>
            <li> I hate when somebody loosely applies a title like &amp;#34;diva&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;phenom&amp;#34; to any product.</li>
            <li> little noisy but not too bad.</li>
            <li> So if you have a tough beard like mine, I would not recommend this, stick to shaving with mach 3 or fusion or whatever expensive cartridge blade of your choice.</li>
            <li> The trimmer has some issues cutting off the thick hair</li>
            <li> Unfortunately within the year of using it the display malfunctioned again, and worse, the shaver just decided to stop working.  </li>
            <li> Also, all of the women&#x27;s models had a charging base (cradle) which is not very practical to pack when you travel.</li>
            <li> This shaver is absolutely terrible nearly shave my face off.</li>
            <li> Leaves behind a lot of hair, and the trimmer is basically useless.  </li>
            <li> I use it sporadically when I don&#x27;t feel like wet shaving or when I am going out and do not want to risk a bloody face.</li>
            <li> i hated the exspensive cleaning solution and big charging station.</li>
            <li> old.this by far was the worst electric razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li> All in all, disappointing, and am seriously contemplating a return of this one.</li>
            <li> However, I am a little disappointed with the battery duration.  </li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed in the shaver..</li>
            <li> I switched from a Braun of 4 years after my base unit would no longer lock down for cleaning or charging.  </li>
            <li> Beware that this is very delicate!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> cleaning is a little annoying</li>
            <li> /&gt;- sideburn trimmer not attached and also a little annoying to put on and off</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still not that expensive and trust me...</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong buying this shaver.</li>
            <li> Left a nasty wound !</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the shaver.</li>
            <li> Moisture gets in and some of the segments fail intermittently</li>
            <li> For some reasons this razor is unable to catch all hair on the neck, no matter which direction I rock this.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this razor.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s wrong with this razor</li>
            <li> It appears to me that Panasonic quality is lacking for something like this to go wrong so soon.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;d tossed out the shipping box and return instructions</li>
            <li> Somewhat dangerous and definitely frustrating.    </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> Tried to buy replacement part for what was broken, and Customer service told me I&#x27;d have to pay $75 to send it in and have it looked at!</li>
            <li> Expensive shaver and expensive blades.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver after my Braun 54xx failed to hold a charge, and the power switch almost didn&#x27;t work anymore.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a Braun series 330 for my failed Panasonic ES8077.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it now for just a week, but I can&#x27;t see anything wrong with it.  </li>
            <li> I got bored with that type of shave</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now, since you don&#x27;t know what my Remington sounded like, making that comparison is rather silly.</li>
            <li> and it is unlikely</li>
            <li> and it is unlikely</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it comes on sporadically.</li>
            <li> I would hope no one would be that careless.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really go wrong here guys, pop up trimmer, wet/dry feature to use in shower, battery life indicator.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the gimmicks of the cleaning systems and the expensive cartridge refill systems that shaving manufactures try to sell</li>
            <li> One cannot go wrong buying this shaver.</li>
            <li> Panasonic sent this unit to me as a replacement for a failed 7103.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Cons : Increased shaving time (from negotiating the difficult areas)</li>
            <li> and it can knick real badly if careless.</li>
            <li> I get a bump every now and then but could be I am doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> Also, it is a bit difficult to get to some neck areas</li>
            <li> It is just so weird.     </li>
            <li> The neck area is where the shaver has some difficultly.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend that anyone invest $90 to $120 in the ES8103S or ES8243A when the displays fail within months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Boy, was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> Replacement blades are expensive (but way cheaper than a multiblade</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my trusted Remington has bit the dust and cannot be replaced.</li>
            <li> Sounds like an angry mosquito, but you get used to it.  </li>
            <li> and I guess will be my replacement brand when it fails.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor in May 2011 and it stopped working because the lithium battery already failed.  </li>
            <li> Not happy at all to lose out on $70!</li>
            <li> Save money on expensive razors but doen&#x27;t get as close as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> The blades were expensive, but once a year</li>
            <li> I have never been sorry.  </li>
            <li> but the blades are expensive, so I tried this newer version.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s still not perfect.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately it missed my head hair all over the place.</li>
            <li> Sadly I did not keep the warranty paperwork...</li>
            <li> My husband found this both uncomfortable (scrapes and burns) and ineffective after having used a rotary shaver.  </li>
            <li> Replacing them so often makes Panasonic an expensive option.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not perfect (what is?).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, he cannot use it because the blade pulls his hair.  </li>
            <li> Runs out very quickly, not very happy with it.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my father who is blind.</li>
            <li> I do not use the complicated cleaning apparatus but instead pour boiling water over blades and head after separating them.</li>
            <li> But panasonice proved it all wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it does not do so.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> You want go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> It is unfortunately a bit louder than my Norelcos...</li>
            <li> Totally flawed in every respect.</li>
            <li> I had never owned an electric up to that point, so I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> I picked the 3 blade razor because I have a beard and figured the 4 blade model would be too difficult to maneuver around my beard.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if I was doing something wrong or what?</li>
            <li> And they&#x27;re expensive.</li>
            <li> Not perfect, yet.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t strike me as complicated to operate.  </li>
            <li> The liquid crystal display failed after about 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> However, it became difficult to purchase blades for the shaver I had.</li>
            <li> wrong.  </li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t too sad over the lose.</li>
            <li> I wanted to avoid having a battery that will fail no matter</li>
            <li> ARE TOO EXPENSIVE IN CHINA.ON AMAZON CHINA,RQ1150 WILL COST OVER 200 US$.I</li>
            <li> This is the worst shaver ever I want my money back does not cut at all....</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I am part bear</li>
            <li> And I last was using Remington King of Shaves 5 blade razors, which I think were the worst disposable razors I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Well I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but hopeful.  </li>
            <li> The shave is terrible especially for shaving the hairs under the jaw line and on the neck.</li>
            <li> In fact, it is difficult</li>
            <li> but my disabilities/age began to make it difficult to stand erect at the sink for the time it took.</li>
            <li> Cleaning is a snap-just rinse under a sink.&lt;br /&gt;Downsides; the beard/moustache trim feature is all but useless in its location.  </li>
            <li> It was an expensive lesson in electric razors.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I have wrong expectations or was just doing it wrong</li>
            <li> I have tried electrics for head shaving before and was not impressed.  </li>
            <li> Worst case, I can go back to manual, after a year.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect either</li>
            <li> Eletric shavers are never perfect.</li>
            <li> The ONLY drawback to this unit is the horrific high-pitched SCREAM of the motor!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not at all sorry that I did.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong...</li>
            <li> I find it difficult to shave.  </li>
            <li> At 1 year and 2 weeks the display failed.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> Give &#x27;em credit it made it past the warranty period. :(</li>
            <li> Before you buy any shaver, check out the price/availability of replacement blades/foils, because for some shavers, these parts are way too expensive.</li>
            <li> This razor does not \\&quot;glide\\&quot; over ones face, difficult to maneuever around your neck, and the trim feature is at a difficult angle.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I am really sad about it.</li>
            <li> I was thinking about upgrading to a 4-blade Panasonic, but the blades and foil for those models can get expensive.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a lower model Norelco and I am no impressed.</li>
            <li> up trimmer lever is placed in the worst possible spot and often pops up.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get away from expensive razors, but this was not just a satisfactory shave.</li>
            <li> and it seems unable to do anything buy make my face sore and tender.</li>
            <li> Without the foil the shaver is useless.</li>
            <li> If/when it fails, I will try to buy it or another Panasonic shaver.  </li>
            <li> was really skeptical about using it.  </li>
            <li> So, its not perfect, but it get the job done 90% of the way.</li>
            <li> so I bought this item and was not impressed.</li>
            <li> noticed all around my chin getting lousy shave so took 3 times longer working the shaver in that area and</li>
            <li> shaving taking 3 times longer and still getting a lousy shave.after like 6 wks.</li>
            <li> This is the only design of electric razor I have found that does not leave me with horrible razor burn.</li>
            <li> Difficult to shave some spots</li>
            <li> Rather difficult in shaving under the chin area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m skeptical of using shaving cream to shave with electric.  </li>
            <li> Not excellent.  </li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t anything wrong with it, electric just doesn&#x27;t seem to do as well as a blade.</li>
            <li> If you want a razor close shave then use a razor... don&#x27;t be silly.</li>
            <li> Very hard on face and the chin area is very difficult to get to work.</li>
            <li> The battery is very poor.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> It does a very poor job shaving my neck.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s very frustrating given the price.</li>
            <li> But, I&#x27;m disappointed by it&#x27;s wimpy and delicate body.</li>
            <li> cuz is sucks :(</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin and unfortunately cannot shave with a blade without breaking out into horrible, bloody, bumpy razor rash.</li>
            <li> But, I never got the closest shave with the Panasonics until I began wet shaving with them (Afta and Lectric Shave work, but the smell is absolutely horrible).</li>
            <li> so i wanted to try an electric shaver that wasnt crazy expensive</li>
            <li> Seriously, this Panasonic is worthless.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this shaver has a very difficult time cutting through my boyfriend&#x27;s beard.</li>
            <li> I wanted an electric razor to rid myself of razor blades and shaving cream, so it is disappointing that I am still using shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I tried one of the 4 blade self cleaning ones and it was the biggest disappointment ever</li>
            <li> I can lather up or use a pre-electric lotion without concern of cutting myself.</li>
            <li> However, the CONS are that it is lighter because it is all plastic, even the head surrounding the cutting blocks.  </li>
            <li> But the worst part is that this shave is built like such crap, if this falls there is no need to pick it up.</li>
            <li> lack of a close shave was also a disappointment.</li>
            <li> The battery is a lithium ion type which is not affected by the cold, a problem the cheaper razors that I&#x27;ve used have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid it will shatter into pieces if I ever dropped it on the floor.</li>
            <li> I had to use my Braun to finish the job because this horrible razor was just destroying my face.</li>
            <li> Seems crazy</li>
            <li> well i was immediately unhappy with the results.  </li>
            <li> He goes through electric razors like crazy</li>
            <li> The reason I needed to switch to an electric shaver is because of a neurologic condition which has made using a blade razor a dangerous adventure resulting in a lot of nicks and cuts to the face.  </li>
            <li> w/out cutting your skin.  </li>
            <li> , I purchased a 3-blade ES8092 that turned out to be a disappointment in cutting performance.</li>
            <li> This is just what I was afraid of.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to try it</li>
            <li> we both are unhappy with the fact that it will not run with the cord inserted in the razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve replaced the foil and cutting blades once each.</li>
            <li> You can hear it cutting the hairs, so when you stop hearing the trimming it is done.  </li>
            <li> All in all, it beats cutting my face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always afraid when I pack it when going on a trip</li>
            <li> And the trimmer attachment is at a bit of an awkward angle, but it is the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric razor.</li>
            <li> This razor was disappointing.  </li>
            <li> When cutting your beard in the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; mode you can&#x27;t tell the difference between a razor blade and</li>
            <li> Finally, cutting your beard when your skin is hydrated and therefore swollen</li>
            <li> (Perhaps I&#x27;m just cutting hairs??)  </li>
            <li> Now instead of cutting my face it becomes irritated causing my neck to break out.</li>
            <li> Kept cutting me.</li>
            <li> My Norelco is quieter, however, that is because of it having ROTARY cutting blades.</li>
            <li> enjoys the shaver because of the shave close to the skin without cutting him or pulling.</li>
            <li> So disappointing, now I don&#x27;t know what to buy</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t unhappy with the Remington, I just couldn&#x27;t get replacement blades/</li>
            <li> Braun.&lt;br /&gt;The pop-up trimmer is a bit inconvenient to use since it tends to block my view of what I am trimming.</li>
            <li> As A guy who suffers from razor bumps</li>
            <li> has 3 cutting blades as opposed to 4 on my LA63s.</li>
            <li> but now I don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting up my face.  </li>
            <li> but what a disappointment.</li>
            <li> But after the blades kept coming thru the screen (it&#x27;s dangerous)</li>
            <li> Now that he suffers from dementia I needed to know that I could help him.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> dont use it &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; because im afraid i might break it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have an especially thick beard, and I don&#x27;t get 5 O&#x27;clock shadow; but I do need to shave once a day.    </li>
            <li> If you are skeptical give it a shot, and you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> I have never gone wrong with Panasonic!</li>
            <li> WRONG!  </li>
            <li> Wrong!</li>
            <li> Buy it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> If my ES8103S&#x27;s LCD screen fails within 12 months like my ES8243A, I&#x27;m going to be a very unhappy camper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quite unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> That was an unpleasant surprise</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about electric razors for years.  </li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to and isn&#x27;t very expensive.  </li>
            <li> I was very wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric razors for at least 15 years and for the price, this has got to be one of the worst I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I have a disability that makes sitting at the sink for any extended period very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It is impossible to determine the charge remaining from the display.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those guys with a permanent \\&quot;trash stache\\&quot; that&#x27;s impossible to get rid of with an electric razor, but this one got the job done.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems to be impossible.</li>
            <li> The display stopped working after awhile, and it was impossible to tell if it was charged or not because of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was a bad investment.</li>
            <li> quality is bad, -noisy, -battery can be used maximum 4 shaves.</li>
            <li> although I used to use a manual blade because the irritation wasn&#x27;t as bad.  </li>
            <li> BAD POINTS:</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
            <li> I know electric shavers don&#x27;t give the closest shaves and by no means was it bad</li>
            <li> I get about 5 shaves before I have to recharge the 8103S because the performance is so bad.  </li>
            <li> The bad: takes forever.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Replacement foils and blade cartridges are not too bad in price (around $30 or less).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m bad with time, so</li>
            <li> BAD TRIMMER?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This meant to me, that you had to get used to a bad shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was worried that he might cut himself bad with a bladed razor, so I got him this.  </li>
            <li> doesnt do a bad job</li>
            <li> have not used an electric razor for some time and although I am not getting bad irritation, I have gotten shaving bumps.  </li>
            <li> it has a bad quality.</li>
            <li> Too bad that excitement didn&#x27;t transfer to the model I selected.</li>
            <li> all of which is a bad combination for any razor shaving.</li>
            <li> but nothing too bad.</li>
            <li> Maybe it had bad blades in it or something</li>
            <li> 9/10/15 - Well after using this shaver for some time now, the one bad thing about this shaver is it throws whiskers all over the place.  </li>
            <li> Beside that it is not that bad.</li>
            <li> Too bad.  </li>
            <li> I would be shocked if someone doesn&#x27;t like this shaver....</li>
            <li> and it was just pulling hair out of my face which was extremely painful.</li>
            <li> It is painful and it does not cut well.</li>
            <li> I started using the razor and found that I was experiencing painful razor bumps and in-grown hair problems.</li>
            <li> ONCE i switched it i was shocked by its noisy.dispointed</li>
            <li> and I got so frustrated I threw it at at my bathroom wall.</li>
            <li> I bought this after I got frustrated with the rotating heads on my Remington continuing to pop out.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I was sick of buying shavers for my Gillette.</li>
            <li> Thsi thing went form mediocre to horrible- now takes 6-7 passes to work and still doesn&#x27;t get everything.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed and probably won&#x27;t buy another Panasonic shaver again.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Quite disappointed with the quality and feel of the unit.</li>
            <li> the trimmer failed on this product and i have had the worst time trying to rma this thing.</li>
            <li> If the display still worked, I&#x27;d just buy replacement batteries, but, at this point, what&#x27;s the point ?!? :-(</li>
            <li> Generally disappointed.</li>
            <li> But I got totally disappointed after struggling to shave with it for a month!&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> but, have always been disappointed until now.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed that this model did not come with an induction charger &amp; a docking station.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Was quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t ever feel the need to write reviews if I am disappointed or not.</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed in its performance.  </li>
            <li> I paid $60 and have not been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> They have always disappointed me until now.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never been so disappointed in a brand name</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed by this product that I would never even consider an electric shaver by Panasonic ever again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are in the market for an electric shaver, give Panasonic a try , you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> Kudos to Panasonic for standing behind their product and their warranty!!!</li>
            <li> I took a 3 day weekend, The shaver was useless!!</li>
            <li> Sorry!!</li>
            <li> It hurts when you&#x27;re dropping $40 a pop for two stupid plastic containers of water and alcohol.</li>
            <li> I hate seeing cords around the sink.</li>
            <li> and it sounded like an annoying mosquito.</li>
            <li> This shaver is worthless.</li>
            <li> but I have found the Panasonic annoyingly loud.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I have found the Panasonic annoyingly loud.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would rank the Panasonic as comparable out of the box.</li>
            <li> and I did not need that fancy self cleaning crap</li>
            <li> I hate to shave and this electric shaver solve a part of my problem.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate shaving every morning anymore.  </li>
            <li> Also the trimmer is kinda worthless to me.</li>
            <li> I just hate using those.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Usually after a couple years the battery starts to crap out but not this one.</li>
            <li> If you go on a trip, you have to pack the bulky base, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No induction charger base.    </li>
            <li> The cost of ownership is why I skipped models that use an alcohol cartridge for cleaning the foil and cutter in the base.</li>
            <li> I recommend purchasing the ES8109S which includes the drop in charging base.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving</li>
            <li> I hate the ones where its not attached and you have to pop it on and off</li>
            <li> Instead, the razor prefers to pull and rip your hairs on your face out, leaving you bloody.</li>
            <li> Face is a bloody mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The aging razors provide my base for comparison.  </li>
            <li> cleaning system&amp;#34; with that base thing that you plug the shaver into.  </li>
            <li> These shavers all have a built-in &amp;#34;cleaning mode&amp;#34; and we don&#x27;t ever use the base cleaning system or whatever.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i hate it.&lt;br /&gt;hate</li>
            <li> This means that eventually, this thing will be worthless when the battery won&#x27;t hold a charge.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously, I hate to spend time on shaving and cleaning the equipment</li>
            <li> I hate shaving with razor blades and lather, so I thought this would be helpful.  </li>
            <li> I never like to shave and hate all things that I have used until this unit.  </li>
            <li> I hate shaving.</li>
            <li> mission impossible!</li>
            <li> (Do you want a deal that bad?!?)</li>
            <li> The ugly: me!</li>
            <li> am seeing people who rate this product badly get very nasty responses so in advance of youre nasty responses</li>
            <li> I always hated the pulling and tugging with the rotary razors.</li>
            <li> I hated using it as it would tear up my skin and take forever to shave.</li>
            <li> Hated to throw away the Remington just for that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always hated the dry/rough feel of electric shaves, so I dreaded the thought of using an electric razor.</li>
            <li> i was going by CR review about the shaver because i had very bad experience with electric shavers.</li>
            <li> feel very bad because this is a torture</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed !</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>

            <li> I am very disappointed in this shaver.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> this model very disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We are very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> However, I am very disappointed with the shaver outer foil.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> VERY DANGEROUS!  </li>
            <li> Awful will be donating to charity.</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst electric shavers that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I got a Norelco rotary as a gift, and found that it pulled terribly.  </li>
            <li> This razor is horrible.</li>
            <li> Worst purchase ever!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a razor in 20 years because I would always get bumps on my neck that looked horrible.</li>
            <li> -Terrible design</li>
            <li> The trimmer is terrible (it could just be my hair).</li>
            <li> Was a horrible razor.</li>
            <li> worst costumer support ever, never buying another Panasonic product again.</li>
            <li> i hate this razor!</li>
            <li> It shaves horrible.</li>
            <li> I do not believe you will be disappointed with this product!!</li>
            <li> My husband thought it was awful.  </li>
            <li> It now takes me longer to shave and the result is horrible.  </li>
            <li> This razor is horrible.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will say this though, the shaver starts to emit an astoundingly terrible stench if you use it for any length of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> worst shave ever.</li>
            <li> I consider it a miracle when I don&#x27;t cut myself or get a nasty razor burn even when using cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Awful experience.</li>
            <li> I hate this shaver!  </li>
            <li> It takes FOREVER to shave with it and the trimmer is just terrible.  </li>
            <li> And the worst part is you can&#x27;t even use it while it&#x27;s charging.  </li>
            <li> Terrible shaver and foil.  </li>
            <li> Pathetic.</li>
            <li> clippers on this, however, are completely awful.  </li>
            <li> Horrible customer service by them and Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that this is the worst razor in existence.</li>
            <li> This is possibly worst shaver I have ever had.</li>
            <li> DISGUSTING!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I find it very annoying that I can&#x27;t use the shaver while it&#x27;s charging</li>

            <li> Best Eledtric razor on the marked for my money</li>
            <li> Two years in, and I&#x27;m quite happy with this razor. The vibrating foil does a better job than Norelco&#x27;s spinning blade heads - probably faster blade speed. Also, the recessed on/off button is great. With my old norelco, I had an issue with it getting switched on by accident in my luggage. That&#x27;s never happened with this razor.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t expect how loud it is. Other than that, it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> This shaver works just fine. Really came in handy on our driving trip.</li>
            <li> Great wet/dry razor. This is my second one.</li>
            <li> very good product. it is the most powerfull shaver I have ever used. your skin doesn&#x27;t get hured.it is very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Sent to my son in the hospital.  He is handicaped in many ways &amp; is on blood thinning medicine &amp; they wouldn&#x27;t shave him unless he had a electric r portable razor. We both read about this one &amp; both got very excited.  It turned out to be THE BEST EVER!!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this shaver, I was hoping to shave my head and face at the same time in the shower. Maybe I asked too much. My 10 year old Norelco shaver still has better battery life than this unit after 1 year of use. This shaver never holds a charge for more than 2-3 shaves anymore. Of course you cannot shave with it while it is charging. So now it dies mid shave while getting ready for work. The pretty lcd display stopped functioning after 6 months of use. Panasonic says they will repair it, but I must send them the razor for a month. Luckily I have my trusty old Norelco or I would be growing a beard with no razor. Speaking of my old Norelco, it still gives me a better shave and shaves while charging. Shaving in the shower was poor anyway. I wish I could get my money back on this unit.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly. This is my 4th Panasonic Shaver. Took away one star due to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Its LCD readout misses few bars after 2 years&lt;br /&gt;2) It has annoying clean it icon even if the unit is clean&lt;br /&gt;3) Expensive replacement blades (though mine is working for 3rd year without changing and with daily shaving)</li>
            <li> I wanted a great shave in between using my razor on the weekends and this really fits the bill. Gets closer then my razor (G Fusion) ever did without the harsh burn after. Take a few times to get use to, but really made me sold after I saw how long my shave lasts now without the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this shaver! I bought it to replace a Braun that broke after about 2 years. Braun used to be a fine shaver company with quality support - I think they&#x27;ve fallen down a bit (IMHO). This was an Amazon deal-of-the-day special, so I feel particularly satisfied with the then very low price and the remaining very high quality of this shaver. To me, it shaves closer and smoother than the model Braun that I had. It charges quickly, holds the charge well, and cleans easily. Based on the fact that this model is sort of an entry-level model for the Panasonic line, I can only imagine how well the higher end models perform. I highly recommend this product. This shaver has made me a Panasonic-believer when it comes to shavers!</li>
            <li> My husband loves it......he has not tried using it as a wet shaver but so far he loves it for&lt;br /&gt;a quick clean up!</li>
            <li> I received this shaver about a month ago as a gift and have been using it every day ever since. All my life I&#x27;ve been shaving with a Gillette Mach 3. I&#x27;m lucky I received this gift because I was getting tired of the razor. The box documents carefully state that you should give your beard \\&quot;some time to adjust to the change\\&quot;, so I did. The first shaves were comfortable but not too close. As the days passed, they got better and my beard wasn&#x27;t growing back sharp, like it did with the gillette. I was hyped as well by the idea of \\&quot;dry shaving\\&quot; and \\&quot;no more foam\\&quot;. However, the shaver seems to work better on my face with some water. If you are considering switching from a razor to this, then this is what you have want to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advantages over shaving with the Mach 3:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Very, very close shave, just as good as with the razor.&lt;br /&gt;-No water or foam required (Although I always wet my beard at least twice for comfort)&lt;br /&gt;-Not having to clean the blade all the time - only once at the end&lt;br /&gt;-Beard grows back smooth, not sharp&lt;br /&gt;-Chances of facial cuts decreased by at least 90% (I cut myself only once and that was pushing the shaver too hard into my face. Excessive pressure won&#x27;t necessarily yield a better shave)&lt;br /&gt;-Blades are supposed to last 2 years, and the outer foil 1 year. Better than throwing dull blades every week or two.&lt;br /&gt;-Shave comfortably in any direction (Moving a razor sideways usually meant 2 days of cleaning blood from my face. Not anymore)&lt;br /&gt;-No irritation on my skin whatsoever. Razor shaves usually left me with a bare, red look on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;-Yes, you can shave in the shower, which happens to be a great pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the downsides:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The machine is a little noisy. No big deal, just close the door.&lt;br /&gt;-Achieving the same close shave as with a razor takes more passes than it would with a razor. Although that makes the machine shave seem slower, remember that you will recover time by not creaming up your face and only cleaning once.&lt;br /&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t have a lock feature, which worries me that it accidentally activates during a flight, the TSA will go paranoid on me. But it hasn&#x27;t happened.&lt;br /&gt;-The pop-up trimmer is very useful for neck &amp; other body hair. But does not seem spectacular for face hair. No pain whatsoever with this, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go ahead and try it. It&#x27;s useful and fun.</li>
            <li> I received it, charged it, and shaved with it.  Could not believe how close it shaved on the first time.  I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in a few years and was pleasantly surprised how well it worked.  I will update once I have used it for a little longer.  I recommend a buy.</li>
            <li> Working fine after 3 years, however, the digital display has stop working so you don&#x27;t know if it is charge or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes: Close wet/dry shave; not too noisy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes: Digital display stop working within a year;</li>
            <li> it hurts a LOT MORE with this shaver when you put your after shave on.  shaver is offered as deal with a blade . later found out that it actually requires foil before blade!</li>
            <li> Owned and shaved routinely over a year&lt;br /&gt;The Shaver Works Fine But Routinely leaves irritation. Thought this would be limited to dry shaving and tried wet shaving (shaving cream and / or in the shower) nope, even more irritation. The Customer service is basically non existent: the attached beard trimmer (which worked more for trimming longer hairs before shaving than actually making lines) broke off several &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; around 6 months in and filed a warranty claim to panasonic through their website as it left my face with some long scratches and received no response. Two months later did this again and made sure i got a confirmation on the panasonic website and still no response. For what it&#x27;s worth, the actual shaving head and overall shave is close and actually closer on my face than i can get with a mach 3 , and leaves less irritation than my old norelco but leaves more irritation than my old braun series 1 (which i replaced with this panasonic as it was on sale here on amazon for $55 at the time). For the price I paid I have no qualms now if I had to pay the list price of $150 I would get a Braun Series 7</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT IN EVERY RESPECT!  SELLER A+++</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very disappointing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before buying this i used Gillette Fusion. Now i need twice time to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full charged battery, shaves only 4 times!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have Gillette Fusion, don&#x27;t buy it, it&#x27;s waste of money!</li>
            <li> This is the best electric shaver that I ever have used! Shaves closely with no shaver burn and is easily cleanable.</li>
            <li> I think the shaver looks great and does work well.  The instructions say to use it with shaving cream for a month and then you can do it without the shave cream, however, I have never been able to get to that point.  I wanted an electric razor to rid myself of razor blades and shaving cream, so it is disappointing that I am still using shaving cream.</li>
            <li> This razor is good. It holds a charge well and gives a reasonable shave. There are two limitations. First, the head is so large that shaving above a mustache is more challenging. Second, the trimmer is placed behind the large head and limits visibility.</li>
            <li> so far ok.  need to go over areas of face more than once but still ok.  fits the hand very well.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor.  The product comes with a money back guarantee if not satisfied.  The brochure sez it will take about a month to get used to an electric.  More than a month later I still don&#x27;t like how it feels or shaves.  Does not shave like a blade - never will.  That being said I still use it to \\&quot;knock down\\&quot; a two or three days growth when I&#x27;m too lazy to shave properly.  I would never have bought it knowing what I know now.</li>
            <li> Years ago I had a Norelco which barely produced an acceptable shave. Never tried an electric-wet shave, always dry.  Went to blades and used them for nearly 20yrs. Needed an electric for vacations, so bought a Remington foil. It was a very close shave, but often left me with razor burn, so for years, I used it occasionally.  This year I decided to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;  Read all the reviews and zeroed in on the Braun... the BMW, with the price to match.&lt;br /&gt;  I bought the Series 3, used it for a few days and returned it. The old Remington still shaved closer.&lt;br /&gt;  Bought the Series 5 Braun ... and the Series 7... bells and whistles tied to a cleaning solution money pit.  Still, the old&lt;br /&gt;  Remington was a closer shave.  Returned these too.&lt;br /&gt;  Decided to give Panasonic a try... liked their stereos etc., but was doubtful as to how they would do with razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ES8103S shaves as close as my old Remington, closer than the Braun - any series - and leaves no razor burn.  It is easy to clean. Forget the water, just pull off the foil head, blow it out, tap it  a couple of times and you are good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I packed-up my razor blades and keep this by my desk... shave in the morning as I check email, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, BTW, don&#x27;t believe that hogwash about having to use an electric 30 days or more....</li>
            <li> It works but not as great as everyone made it seem. Price is ok for product. I would not really recommend this product, maybe to someone who wants a starter or a travel razor. I say, invest in your face and get a more pricey one. I know price isnt always indicative of quality but just do your research and get a razor a level above this one. The extra 20 bucks will be worth it.</li>
            <li> Works great wet or dry.  I have a heavy beard and this shaver provides a close enough shave without skin irritation.</li>
            <li> This shaver provides me with the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric shaver, it glides nicely along my face and neck.  I like the fact that it can be used wet/dry.  The battery charge seems to last a long time, and it seems to be easy to clean. So functionally, no complaints.  I paid around $60, so the price was right for me also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only two minor complaints about this charger are:&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s nosier than other shavers I have used -- it&#x27;s a loud high pitch type noise.&lt;br /&gt;2. There is no base for the shaver to set in, and so the charger is a separate charging device (much like a cell phone charger) which plugs into the bottom of the shaver, so the net is, another charger to keep track of.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best electric shavers I&#x27;ve ever had.  I can get a good, close shave without a lot of effort.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for about two weeks now. I had been using a previous Panasonic foil shaver with two blades and the first thing I noticed about this shaver is how much closer it cuts! I get a smoother shave in less time than it took my previous razor to cut. The only drawbacks one might discover is the louder buzz this shaver emits while working and the tendency to heat up considerably after about two minutes of cutting (which is actually beneficial on some chillier mornings). I love the display, and the comfortable design of the unit. I have not used it for wet shaving yet, but do look forward to taking advantage of that feature too! Would purchase again!!</li>
            <li> My husband said it felt like it was yanking his hairs out for the first two months.</li>
            <li> Good Machine.  Works well and is easily cleaned.  Some people might find this model a bit noisy, but I don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li> While this razor has capabilities that I do not use, such a being able to shave a wet face,&lt;br /&gt;I am most disappointed that it does not give a very close shave. If I was still working, and&lt;br /&gt;not in my 80&#x27;s where a close shave is not important, I would buy another shaver.</li>
            <li> I tried one of the 4 blade self cleaning ones and it was the biggest disappointment ever so I ordered this and it has been a night and day difference better.  I have sensitive skin and this shaver gives a very close shave without irritation.  Bought it for the ability to get it wet(use sensitive skin shaving cream) which is a nice option but it also does a great job dry.  Charge % display is nice.  Flip up trimmer is a little flimsy feeling but does a good job tackling the longer hairs and doesn&#x27;t get jammed up like my old one.  All in all I am a fan of this shaver.</li>
            <li> I use this razor to shave every day.  It works well for the purpose.  It seems that the blade design has changed from a previous Panasonic razor that I had.  I am not sure that my shave lasts as long.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re poor like me, you&#x27;ve probably purchased many cheap electric shavers that were $20-$30 or less. You probably won&#x27;t find that magical electric shaver that you&#x27;re looking for. If you do, please let me know!! Until then, get these. It&#x27;s still not that expensive and trust me... these are way better than those that are like $30 or less. You don&#x27;t get what you pay for all the time but I&#x27;d like to think that it&#x27;s true with this one.</li>
            <li> I like this shaver I had the other brands .this shaver gives me a good shave,so im happy and the price was right.</li>
            <li> The price is suit the purchase, but this one is made in China not Made in Japan. It is a little disappoint me.</li>
            <li> My husband chose this razor for several of the features, the quick recharge time,the built-in trimmer and that it is dual voltage. In the short time that he has been using it,the results are great.</li>
            <li> This is my second one so their life expectancy may only be a few years.  Unlike some of the others who have reviewed this shaver, the battery lasts about 2 weeks.  It gives a close shave but is a bit noisy.  It&#x27;s not possible to shave with it plugged in, but it charges fast if you forget to charge it. My last model still works, but the noise level increased dramatically and the LED screen stopped functioning.  I&#x27;ve owned several brands and rate this the best for both shaving and ease of cleaning.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver; I&#x27;ve been using mach3 razors for the past 10 years or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This electric shaver is super convenient to use, and gives a shave almost as close as the mach3.  It also doesn&#x27;t give the razor burn that the mach3 does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying a few more as Christmas presents for my family.</li>
            <li> This shaver doesn&#x27;t meet my expectations. It leaves hair spots on my face after several minutes of shaving. I am also experiencing razor bumps after shaving. Let me also point out that I&#x27;m African American, so other races might not have the same issues that I have. But if you are African American, don&#x27;t expect a clean shave.</li>
            <li> This razor works great - I get a clean, comfortable shave every time - and it doesn&#x27;t grow back with sharp ends like I get with a blade.  Wet shaving has also made my skin much softer, which seems to prevent the shaving bumps and ingrown hairs that I would get when using an electric shaver on dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this shaver to replace an ES8109S that got dropped and broken.  That model is the same as this, but comes with a cleaning unit.  I thought the cleaning unit was a good idea until I got it and realized that it was a waste of time and money, especially once I discovered wet shaving in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read reviews that talk about the display quitting or behaving strangely - I experienced that with the 8109 as well, until I started storing it vertically in the shower, out of range of the spray.  I think water eventually gets in it if it doesn&#x27;t drain properly.  If that does happen, the display comes back once it finally dries out.  I haven&#x27;t seen that behavior with the 8103 in the month I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> Having never used an electric razor before, I was a little apprehensive about giving this a go.  I have used it for about a month now, having started using it with Shave Cream (as suggested by the Manufacturer).  Shaving this way was a breeze. This week I stopped putting shave cream on and used it au-natural.  I found that it too was easy and I have not had any irritation of my face thus far.  The skin on my face is very tender and can get irritated very easily.  I give it a 5 star rating because I can zip through a shave in a relatively short time and can touch up my facial hair in the evening, before going out.  In addition lets factor in the cost of razor blades, that I no longer have to buy.  THIS IS WIN - WIN SITUATION.  Oh, btw, I have a goatee and the pop up trimmer does the trick to get close to do the trimming.  The delivery was right on, as expected as well as the packaging.  The price that I paid was a little better than WallyWorld.  Love you Amazon!!!!</li>
            <li> Definitely does not shave as good as a razor blade.</li>
            <li> This razor has a Strong trimmer. I think it works better when it is dry. In general it is good for the money</li>
            <li> I bought this for husband for Father&#x27;s Day this year as his old Panasonic was pretty much toast. Really it does a fine job! I&#x27;m impressed at how close it shaves and with minimal irritation. He has extremely sensitive skin and just can&#x27;t do a strait razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure the Panasonic Arc 4 is an amazing product but is the extra blade worth $50? Amazon even had a $15 off coupon for the Arc 3 and that makes this an even better value!&lt;br /&gt;The fancy Braun with its self cleaning station was on his wish list but I think the wet dry shave option is so much better and I don&#x27;t have worry about ordering the cleaning cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far he seems very happy with it and the replacement foil/blade cost is not excessive.  If you want a nice shaver and don&#x27;t want to spend a fortune this for you!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used that can be compared to shaving with a blade. It charges quickly and I can about a week of use before needing to charge again. This will definitely go with me when I travel. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is really great. It shaves much closer than his old one. I love that it is cordless since our apartment bathroom is so small. I hate seeing cords around the sink. This shaver is a bit louder, but you get used to it. The only negative is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to catch the hair so my husband will shave before he dresses. You&#x27;ll definitely see some hair shavings fall if your guy is wearing a white shirt. That is the only negative so far. We&#x27;ve had it for about 1 month now.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a surprise for my husband, and he is so happy now.  He says that it shaves so close and effortlessly, that he can not imagine how he ever lived without it.  And I must say that his face is now cuddly soft, even hours after shaving.  Happy hubby and happier wife.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Great razor, charge lasts a long time, close shave, easy to clean, can get wet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Wet shave is worthless, no self cleaning base, takes several passes to get the right shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;Great value for the money.</li>
            <li> liked my old Braun better.&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic okay but requires going back over my face several times.&lt;br /&gt;the battery seems to run down fast.&lt;br /&gt;the good news, it&#x27;s quiet!</li>
            <li> Still get used to this automatic shaver. Not taking off all the hair in specific hairs below the chin/in the neck. On the face, it is ok.</li>
            <li> Excellent!&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion I find it FAR better than a Norelco rotary shaver I tried at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic is faster, cuts whiskers closer, and is not painful (as the rotary shaver was to my skin).</li>
            <li> I got this because I started to shave my head...I use it with shaving soap and for the most part it works well enough for me...I have to go over some spots a few times to be smooth but a tiny bit of stubble does not bother me...My face it works fine on...A couple of passes and its smooth...A little hand soap and water on the screen and turn it on and rinse...Take the screen off and rinse again and I&#x27;m done...30 seconds to clean...Battery gives me about 5 or 6 shaves of head and face and I recharge...Charges fast too...Good buy for the $$$</li>
            <li> I have a graveyard of electric razors, some expensive some cheap but, this razor, so far, is by far the best little razor I have ever purchased. The power is there w/o all the noise. From the first time I used it I got a better shave than I have had in years. Even after buying all the new blades and foils for my remington MS2 300, it still didn&#x27;t give me a decent shave. At last I had to leave the plug in because there wasn&#x27;t enough reserve power to even get a bad shave without leaving it plugged in. I haven&#x27;t used the wet shave option yet but I am looking forward to it because the shave I get with just pre shave is great, so close and even gets the stubs I sometimes miss. I hope this shaver lasts a good long time, at least until something better comes along, which I doubt. I have had Brauns and others but all left something to be desired. Doesn&#x27;t seem to matter how much you spend, you just have to keep looking for the right combination and for the moment anyway, I think I have found it. Good little razor...by far...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Nothing special or super-duper. It would be better if it had a stand to put it in!</li>
            <li> After owning the razor for 5 months, the LCD display has disappeared. It is impossible to determine the charge remaining from the display. The razor itself continues to work fine so I just recharge it once a week. The ONLY option to get it repaired is to send it a Texas repair center. So if you buy this razor be sure to keep your old razor because you may be without a razor for an extended period of time. I wish that Panasonic had repair centers in major cities so that you could possible get it repaired quicker and avoid the expense of sending it out of state. My old Panasonic razors simply had bars that indicated the charge remaining. While they were not as descriptive, they lasted the length of the razor.</li>
            <li> I have used Braun shavers ever since my first shave and they always did an adequate job, though not stellar enough that I when it came time for a replacement I couldn&#x27;t be swayed by the high reviews Panasonic shavers were getting all over the web.    The Panasonic, it turns out, is a quantum leap better. The difference with my last Braun feels like, for lack of a better metaphor, the difference between a scalpel and a scythe. The Panasonic goes about its job with surgical precision and efficiency; the high-pitch whine it produces is not super-loud, and not unpleasant in a high-tech kind of way. The ergonomics are good. The fact that you can clean it under running water is nice. The trimmer works great but is a bit on the narrow side, and when deployed it sticks out and away from the shaver&#x27;s body at an angle that takes a bit getting used to.    My two minor gripes are: (a) the battery life isn&#x27;t exactly phenomenal (I&#x27;m getting about 10 shaves on a charge v. 14 per users&#x27; manual), and (b) the spiffing 0% - 100% battery indicator is just for show; it moves in 10% increments just like a 10-segment LED.    Despite the manual&#x27;s hedging about needing up to a month to get used to the new shaver, I got a great shave from day one. Also, this shaver makes short work of a 3-day growth; it takes no longer to eradicate than a 24-hr shave.    All in all, a great shaver. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very similar to my 8109, which I&#x27;ve used for years.  Great shaver for general trimming.</li>
            <li> I did much research on electric razors considering they are verrrryyy hard to shop for and decided to get this one with my price limit. My bf seems to like it, says you don&#x27;t have to go back and forth constantly to get the job done, doesn&#x27;t pinch your skin, and can use it wet or dry. The only bad thing is that you cant charge it while you&#x27;re using it. Also, it is loud... which I didn&#x27;t care about but I guess that&#x27;s one thing people look for..? I would def. recommend.</li>
            <li> I had a Norelco shaver with three round heads. It was uncomfortable to use as it pulled the hair rather than cut it cleanly. This product is just the opposite--it cuts facial hair cleanly and without pain.  It seems to hold a charge a fairly long time.  I took a two week trip and never had to charge it during the trip.  This was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t figure this would shave as close as a blade, even though some of the reviews said it did.  it does shave pretty close when i use it in the shower.  i just find shaving in the shower a hassle, and i don&#x27;t want to spend anymore time in the shower than i have to.  i did expect using an electric to save me time shaving.  that hasn&#x27;t been the case either.  i actually spend more shaving now.  the only advantage this has is the mess.  and if i just want to get a quick go-over without getting close, it&#x27;s good for that.</li>
            <li> First time elctric shave user, great product, long life battery</li>
            <li> Great shaver. A comment someone else made put it in perfect perspective, I thought; it referred to the Panasonic shaver as the &#x27;Lexus&#x27; of shavers. Great value for me...</li>
            <li> I have been using a rotary razor and Mach 3 for years now.  And by far, after the first time I used this razor (about 3-4 hours after I received it from Amazon and let it charge) it was the best shave I have ever had in my life.  I had the three day extra long stubble and this shaver cut right thru it all (dry shave). I also have sensitive skin and usually after shaving (electric and Mach 3) I get razor bumps and I have to wait a day in between shaves, but with this I am able to shave every day (even in the morning and at night before going out).  I also have tried this with shaving cream while in the shower, and was I surprised once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Amazon cut down the price&lt;br /&gt;-feels like I used a Mach 3 razor, skin is smooth&lt;br /&gt;-says you only have to do one pass over, it takes 2-3 on some sections on my neck where the hair grows at differ angels, but that&#x27;s better than my old razor&lt;br /&gt;-no razor burn/in grown hairs&lt;br /&gt;-dry shave is just as good as a wet shave&lt;br /&gt;-wet shave in the shower is even better&lt;br /&gt;-Battery seems to last long enough (haven&#x27;t counted yet, but seems to last the week)&lt;br /&gt;-The pivoting head is a nice feature to contour to face/neck&lt;br /&gt;-You can also lock the pivoting head&lt;br /&gt;-Fits good in my hand and is easily maintained&lt;br /&gt;-LED readout for battery life&lt;br /&gt;-Built-in ultrasonic self-cleaning feature, seems like a good idea, have to wait and see with time and if it really keeps the blades fresh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;-the motor does hum a bit loud, but as long as hair is being shaved it seems to dull the hum&lt;br /&gt;-the pop out trimmer - it is a small in comparison to the shaving head, it is tricky to find the right angle so i can see myself in the mirror to trim my sideburns as the shaving head covers it.&lt;br /&gt;-other electric razors have a spot where shaved hair is collected, with this they just fall, not a deal breaker for me as I prefer to shave in the shower, or shave with shaving cream&lt;br /&gt;-I do notice that the foil gets warm towards the end of the shave, it doesn&#x27;t burn me, but I notice an increase in temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, to me the pros outweighed the cons.  And before buying I read the reviews and have found for the most part, that I am in line with others views.&lt;br /&gt;Love this razor and would recommended it to others looking.otice an increase in temperature.      Overall, to me the pros outweighed the cons.  And before buying I read the reviews and have found for the most part, that I am in line with others views.    Love this razor and would recommended it to others looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using razors for 15 years and decided to give this a try.  I read the reviews and most were positive so that helped me decided to buy this model.  It took me several days to get used to it.  The first shave wasn&#x27;t good but that&#x27;s because I was new to electric shaver and didn&#x27;t get used to the handling.  The 2nd shave was better than the first and by the 3rd time I knew what I was doing.  Overall I think it&#x27;s pretty good.    Pros:    close shave  skin feel smooth  Easy to clean  Good battery life    I don&#x27;t know how long the blade will last.  I hope it will since I shave everyday.  The shaver is good just don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth the money if it only last 1 month or 2.</li>
            <li> Better than a $200 Braun. I loved Braun, but they are excessively over priced. This shaver is so smooth and quite. Before committing to a new shaver, look at the price of the replacement foil. All shavers literally eat through the foils. Some shaver models require really expensive replacement parts that last only 3 - 6 months. Often this quickly exceeds the cost of the actual shaver. For example you can get a $110 Panasonic 4 blade shaver that goes through $50 foils every few months.</li>
            <li> I have tried various shavers over the years but always ended up back with a razor blade.  This shaver definitely changed that!  Very close shave, easy to use either wet or dry!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> For a decade or more I stuck with one of the classic block-shaped Remington shavers. It worked great and I kept it going with new batteries and old parts, but the screens were becoming very hard to find. If I had to change, I wanted a shaver that was easy to use every day, worked well for tough, thick whiskers, charged quickly and had a pop-up trimmer.    Based on reviews here, I took the risk of buying this shaver, and it turned out great! I really enjoy using this shaver. It&#x27;s easy to clean, shaves clean and close (takes a few passes though), charges quickly and works well on my neck. The pop-up trimmer is small, but it does the job.    I can only hope that this shaver will last me through a decade of shaves like my old Remington, because I&#x27;d love to keep it for a very long time.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic shaver. It replaces an earlier Panasonic model that was also terrific. Extremely close shave, easy to use and clean.    I would recommend this over the Panasonic shavers that have a self-cleaning module. My previous shaver had a self-cleaning system and I found it to be noisy and the cleaning process took quite a long time.    With this model, you simply add some liquid soap to the top of the foil, add some water, turn the shaver on and let it run for under a minute. It cleans the shaving head perfectly well. Then leave it out in the air to dry.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m saying an ELECTRIC RAZOR of all things is overrated, but I&#x27;m really boggled by the positive reviews of this thing. Here&#x27;s my take:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;1) VERY close face shave if you use shaving cream - your face will most likely be baby smooth. I&#x27;m one of those guys with a permanent \\&quot;trash stache\\&quot; that&#x27;s impossible to get rid of with an electric razor, but this one got the job done.&lt;br /&gt;2) Great Battery life - lasts forever&lt;br /&gt;3) Quick charging time - goes from 0% to 100% in about an hour for me.&lt;br /&gt;4) really waterproof - use it in the shower with no fear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sounds good so far - so why do I say it&#x27;s overrated?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;1) Absolutely useless dry - It just plain doesn&#x27;t work for me. My 10 year old Norelco did a better job while dry. 2) It also doesn&#x27;t work well without lather- shaving with plain water is difficult and spotty.&lt;br /&gt;3) Can&#x27;t do my neck very well- even with shaving cream it leaves tons of stubble on my neck area. Again, a standard dry razor did better.&lt;br /&gt;4) You HAVE to clean it constantly. So I&#x27;ve established this thing is useless dry. But if you use it wet, water gets trapped in the foil/guard and by the time you get home from work - the thing smells like an old towel. So basically you have to pop the lid off/clean the blades/soap the foil/rinse it before and after every use. I don&#x27;t know about you but that&#x27;s really the opposite of \\&quot;convenient\\&quot; for me.&lt;br /&gt;5) TONS of irritation - maybe my skin is just weird, but since I switched to this razor in June, I&#x27;ve never had so many zits, nicks and cuts. I always shave fresh out of the shower, and clean the heck out of the razor, not sure why I&#x27;m so irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other people seem to love this razor, and I don&#x27;t doubt it&#x27;s great for them, but I just can&#x27;t recommend it. If you have your heart set on this razor, the price makes it not that big a gamble. Others, beware.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it.  Says it fits contours of face better than old more expensive razor.  Charges fast and holds charge well.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this shaver for a few months.  I would keep it in the shower.  After a few months, the display went bad, and after just a year, it died completely.  I am sure that it died because of its exposure to water, but since it is advertised as being good to use in the shower, it did not live up to expectations.  Otherwise, it gave a really great shave.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace an older Norelco and I&#x27;ve only used it dry. Most of us are only going to use an electric shaver dry. If I wanted to mess with a wet shave, I would just use a blade.     Compared to the Norelco, it shaves noticeably closer, with less irritation, but not quite as close as with a blade. Compared to the Norelco, it&#x27;s also pretty loud and feels hot on my skin. Battery life is about the same. Cleaning is a little complex, since you use liquid soap as well as water, but it&#x27;s not a hardship.    Overall, I like this razor a lot, particularly for the price.    I purchased from Amazon, which had the best price I found, and it came quickly.</li>
            <li> 1. shaves almost as close as Gillete Fusion.  2. best for the price.  3. comfortable  4. works 110-220 volt both.  5. easy to clean</li>
            <li> I bought this at a great price for my husband.  It charges very quickly.  He says it is the best electric razor he has ever used.  We would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have had the Panasonic ES8103S shaver for about a month now. I wanted to give it some time before posting a review.      My shaving history, is that I am retiring a Remington dual foil I&#x27;ve had for about 6 years, a Pair of Braun foil shavers before that, and started out about 20 years ago with a Norelco rotary.    I don&#x27;t have an especially thick beard, and I don&#x27;t get 5 O&#x27;clock shadow; but I do need to shave once a day.    The first thing I noticed with this shaver, is how quiet the Panasonic is versus the Remington. My Remington was very loud, and the Panasonic has a much lower noise level; The Panasonic has a high pitched buzz to it, but it&#x27;s still about 1/2 as loud as the Remington, and took some getting used to.    The next big difference was the amount of vibration difference. The Remington had alot more vibration vs the solid Panasonic. The Panasonic doesn&#x27;t shake in my hand at all.    It did not take any getting used to holding this shaver vs the Remington.     At first, because of how quiet the Panasonic was, I was debating if it was really even working - since I was used to the buzz saw Remington.  However, right out of the gate, it did give me a much closer shave. Even having been using an electric shaver for 20+ years, it still took about 3 full weeks for my face to get fully used to the new shaver. Especially the area over my top lip for some reason. The first week I used it, I had only minor irritation, nothing severe.    This shaver does not cut any faster than the Remington, and it still takes about 5 minutes for a complete shave. It still take 2-3 passes to do the neck and chin area. But as I said before, it is a much closer shave than the Remington, and it is an electric, not a blade so I am used to that extra work.    I have not used it wet or in the shower. So I have no opinion on that. I typically shave the first thing out of the shower, with no gel.    On 1 full charge, I get about 7 shaves, and it only takes 1 hour to completely charge.    After a month, I am extremely pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li> Gives me the smoothest shave of all the electric shavers I have owned.  It could have come with a design where it has a stand while charging it, but it is no big deal the product results make up for that lack. I strongly recommend it.  Feb 12, 2012 - Close to an year since purchased, work great. Even at 10% charge it works like it is at 100%, without a wimper.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about electric razors for years.  I had a cheap Norelco a many years ago and hated it.  I am in the military and purchased a battery operated electric travel shaver a few years ago for the field.  I thought it would be a great alternative to walking several hundred meters to use cold water or just shaving dry with a razor.  I was wrong.  The travel electric left me raw with ingrown hairs.  Cold water or a dry razor shave was better than that.  I am about to deploy and since the latrine is several hundred meters away (again), I considered the electric option again.  I read all the reviews and decided to give this Panasonic a try.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I have used it in the shower with a light shave cream, at the sink with a light cream, dry with Williams&#x27; Lectric Shave and dry with nothing when time is short.  Obviously the wet options are best, but It does a fine job dry, too.  I now can shave right in my hootch with no water or anything.  It will really save me a bunch of time and waiting for a free sink and no chance of hot water.  I will also save money too.  I have used it a month and have saved appx 15% of the purchase price by not having to pay ridiculous money for Mach 3 blades.  I won&#x27;t go back to a blade.</li>
            <li> Used this for 3months now and I am quite happy with it. Easy to clean and does provide a close shave. I switched from Braun system to this and must say Panasonic is better than Braun these days! Price is fair and Braun is now a bit over priced.    I never used those cleaning system, so can&#x27;t comment on it. Its easy enough to clean, so no need to spend extra $ for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having problems with my right hand. I&#x27;ve searched high and low and read all of the reviews that I could find. I&#x27;ve also bought a shave secret shaving oil and edge shaving gel shaving cream. I charged the razor and washed my face and left it wet. Used five drops of the oil and the cream and shaved my face. It took some work the first time due to not being used to a electric razor and my face being used to a blade.&lt;br /&gt; The second shave two days later went much faster and the shave was indeed much better and smoother. The shave was also much faster. I did rinse the razor about half-way through the shave to prevent clogging. After the shave I rinsed in the same manner and left the razor in a semi-disassembled manner to let air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is my first razor and I&#x27;m very happy at this early stage with it!! Thanks</li>
            <li> Great shaver, super close and really, one pass...never had that in a norelco or a remington or a wahl...a braun yes but a 5 or 7 series and way more $$$$ than the pana..</li>
            <li> You still have to put in the time.  Waterproof features are convenient.</li>
            <li> Nice and quiet.  Like the other reviewers have stated you need to go over your beard multiple times to get a somewhat close shave.  Great for travel when you don&#x27;t want to carry blades and foams.  Charges fast and lasts a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> Hope this would replace my older 4 blade panasonic but I should have gone with an Arc 4. This does the job but not as quickly or as easily as my older razor. So, I alternate between them hoping to extend the life of the older device.</li>
            <li> I started shaving with an electric razor at age 15, and at 41, I&#x27;ve not used a blade in 25 years.  Over the years, I tried several different styles and brands of shavers, but I kept coming back to old faithful, my beloved Remington MicroScreen 3.  To date, still the closest shaving electric razor I&#x27;ve owned.  It&#x27;s main drawback was that it tended to go through a couple of sets of blades a year, as I shave daily, and have a fairly coarse beard.  It&#x27;s day finally came to an end when it became too difficult to find replacement blades recently.    I did a lot of research to see what was getting top reviews in the $75-$150 range.  I&#x27;ve been burned before by cheap shavers, and know you get what you pay for, but then there comes a point when you have to remind yourself it&#x27;s a shaver, not a Mercedes.      I settled on Panasonic, and got a good deal on newegg for the ES8103S.  It&#x27;s well built, has some nice features, and doesn&#x27;t do a bad job shaving.  I find I can&#x27;t seem to get quite as close of a shave with it, but I believe that is because the shaver screen is a bit more robust than the Remington.  I&#x27;ve been using this for 6 months now, and the head shows no signs of wearing out yet.  I know I&#x27;d be on my second set of the year with the Remington, so I feel good about this.    My son&#x27;s both have MicroScreen 3&#x27;s yet, but one of them recently suffered a fatal fall, so we decided to buy 2 more of these Panasonic&#x27;s to centralize on a single shaver blade to have to buy.    I rated this shaver as a 4 based strictly on comparison with how close it shaves compared to the Remington.  However, on robustness, comfort, good ergonomics overall, I&#x27;d be apt to give it a 5.  If I could go 4.5 stars, I would have, but I just couldn&#x27;t go 5, due to the fact that I think the old Remington did a closer shave, and after all, that&#x27;s what a shaver is for, right?    Bottom line here...I think the what you get for your money makes this a good value, and as noted, I&#x27;m buying 2 more.  Oh yea, Amazon now shows this for $1 cheaper than Newegg, so I&#x27;ll get these from Amazon this time.  Hope this was helpful to someone out there!    I almost forgot...be sure to give this shaver a fair shake...the instructions say to give it 2 weeks for your face to get used to the unit, and they are pretty accurate.</li>
            <li> Best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever tried. I bought it on the recommendation of a friend, and I love it.</li>
            <li> bought this because of the high reviews and was sorely disappointed... it is a shaver but it does not shave... does not look ergonomic at all and feels even worse... very (VERY) loud, I had to go over the same areas again and again and even then the shave was not clean... it took me a good 15 minutes and a full 60% of battery life each time I tried to shave (the unit got very hot while I was doing this). I am highly suspicious of the Amazon rankings for this one and suspect manipulation... I am now back to my 8 year-old norelco that i have never ever even cleaned or replaced a head on (just the occasional rinsing under water) - it no longer provides a great shave either and the battery is dying but it is still way better than this new Panasonic piece of junk. Don&#x27;t buy it! I returned mine</li>
            <li> I have been using electric shavers for 60 years, but I have never experienced one like this.  The extreme speed of the motor and the quick, close shave are totally unlike any shaver that I have used before.  The only criticism I have is that this shaver does not do a good job on the upper lip.  It takes several passes to completely shave this area.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco  Electric Shavers for many years for a quick or weekend shave none of them have even&lt;br /&gt;come close to a blade shave This one does I really cant hardly believe it I am quite surprised and thrilled too&lt;br /&gt;this is one to buy for a close shave with a Electric shaver !!</li>
            <li> After shaving with a blade for 35 years, I got tired of the ingrown hairs and razor irritation.  Shaving was something I dreaded to the point where I got fired from a job because I wouldn&#x27;t shave everyday (as if guys who work in lumber yards need to be clean shaven!) I scanned Amazon.con reading review after review and settled on my ES8103 Wet/Dry shaver based on the reviews and reasonable cost.  I intentionally didn&#x27;t shave for a few days to see what the shaver could do when up against a tough,course beard like mine.  What it did was glide over my whiskers and gave me a shave closer then a single blade razor but just short of a double blade.  The pop up trimmer works great,maintainability is very easy with clean up a matter of running the unit under water.  I haven&#x27;t tried it on my face wet,that will be tomorrows test.  If you want an electric shaver,this is the one you&#x27;ll want.  BTW, shaving with a razor took me 20-25 minutes due to the coarseness,thickness and curly whiskers.  I can shave now in less then 10 minutes!</li>
            <li> My husband loved his new shaver.  He said it was the best one yet.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, I really like this razor. I have read other reviews about it. It&#x27;s amazing how I can read so many different opinions on it from the reviews.  I don&#x27;t mind how loud it is. I have other razors just as loud. it takes a few days for your face to get used to it.  I bought it because I wanted a good razor that would do a quick, good job.  and it does just that.  it cuts great. you have to stretch your skin like the directions tell you. it is very easy to clean.  I either run water thru the cap after I take it off the razor, or just blow air thru the foil. and I do the same on the blades.  I noticed the foil gets warm after one side of the face is done.  that might be a consideration for many people. but I think these types of razors get warm on the foil after a few runs across the face. This warming of the foil doesn&#x27;t bother me.  but I know other people would probably say it gets hot.  it cuts very close to the skin, and I like that.  its very easy to charge and charges quickly. I used it down to 50%, and it had no bog down on the razor.  I don&#x27;t use it in the shower. I only use it dry.  I shave every day, sometimes twice.  the pop up trimmer if excellent.  it cuts.  I thought it would be weak in power and not cut good.  but it is all I use on my mustache.  the only thing I don&#x27;t like about the trimmer is the razor blocks the site of the area you are trimming with the trimmer. the head of the razor is in the site line.  but I work around this and just lower my face so I can see the trimmer. this part of using the trimmer is a little tricky, but it is for the sideburns, and that you will have no problem doing with the trimmer.  I like this razor a lot and I am glad I bought it.  I hope this helps point out some points of the razor that should be considered when buying a razor.  thank you amazon for your excellent service.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver period. Stays charged for a week or longer. I don&#x27;t use shaving cream, just dry, and does a fantastic job the first pass. I had a Panasonic shaver for many years and I&#x27;m sure this one will last the same, great quality.</li>
            <li> Bought this razor some months ago. It does cut much closer than my old panasonic. I also like the fact that it can be cleaned with water. It seems to do about 8-10 shaves on a full charge, so I normally don&#x27;t have to take the charger on trips.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product! When I received it and used it the first time I was fairly happy with it (I had just shaved 2 days prior, though). If i let it go for 3 days and tried shaving with this razor I sometimes pulled which is not very comfortable. It also required many passes on the same area to remove all of the hair. I ended up returning it after giving it 3 good weeks of use and I hope to find a better product to replace it. The good things about this product are that it&#x27;s quiet, light, it charges very quickly (an hour or less), and has a battery percentage monitor on it. It&#x27;s also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping that this shaver would perform a little better. It is only an OK shave in my opinion far from great, and far from even a decent disposable razor. (Yes I have used it over 30 days as well now)  It doesn&#x27;t really shave that close, and misses hairs on each pass, sometimes entirely and then once they get longer it has a VERY hard time getting them. Edge trim is pretty basic as well and doesn&#x27;t do that great a job. As with most electrics has a real problem getting under your jaw line.  Overall would say it isn&#x27;t much better than my Panasonic cheaper razor, only slightly. May break down adn try the Braun one in the similar price range.  Also even with cleaning as recommended sometimes this thing has a little bit of a funky smell.  Not bad, but certainly not great.  2-4-12- Update- Thsi thing went form mediocre to horrible- now takes 6-7 passes to work and still doesn&#x27;t get everything.  Awful will be donating to charity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various shavers for years and when my old Braun needed a new foil and cutter I figured I&#x27;d try something new. After spending inordinate amount of time researching shavers, I purchased this one. I turned around and returned it the next day. Admittedly, I never used it on my skin. But I charged it and then turned it on and it sounded like an annoying mosquito. More importantly, it doesn&#x27;t shave when plugged in, which means you always have to time the charge correctly. I need a shaver that I can use while plugged in, and don&#x27;t want a shaver that if the battery is low I need to charge it quickly and wait around while it does so. I can&#x27;t fathom why Panasonic would make such a shaver. So I decided to spent more and get a the Braun Series 7 720s.</li>
            <li> after two months of use, I&#x27;m quite satisfied. takes a few days to get used to after years of razors. shave is not as close, but have not gotten a razor cut or any in-grown hairs since i started using this. holds the charge well. have not had an instance where the razor died when in use because there&#x27;s a power meter that the power meter informs you how much juice is left. am thrilled to not have to buy razor refills and shaving cream. altogether way more pluses than minuses. highly recommend.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001DNE3KQ Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Rechargeable Linear Pivot Action Shaving System, Silver]]so-far-so-good.  I have been using the shaver for about a month, about 4-5 times per week and still on the first charge. I have a light beard and use a pre-electric shave; just soap when in the shower - I do not like a dry shave- for a close shave (my wife is happy with the closeness of the shave...). I agree with other comments about the body not as substantail as my earlier Panosonic (late 80&#x27;s!); however, today&#x27;s materials tend to be stronger and lighter, so my hopes remain high this ES8103S will last at least 10 years!</li>
            <li> Best razor I ever used. Like the readout for percent charged.  Easy to wash under the faucet. Very close shave. Especially like the curved head design, easy to get under the chin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for several years and am generally happy with it.  Shaves nice and close and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin.  Since it is a Wet/Dry unit, you can&#x27;t use it while its plugged in (risk of electrocution) so you have to make sure to charge it regularly.  The charge lasts 5 or 6 uses and the battery is still going strong after all this time.  I&#x27;ve replaced the blades three times but they really should be replaced every 6 to 9 months.  Much better with new blades and they stay sharp for a reasonable time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I&#x27;ve had is the gizmo that should lock the head from moving (floating) broke early on but I haven&#x27;t been too unhappy with that little failure.</li>
            <li> A great shaver.  The last one I purchased lasted eight years and still works.  Never replaced cutters or screen.  The new one works very well and battery charge lasts ten plus days.</li>
            <li> The shaver provides a clean shave.  Love it&#x27;s cleaning action. Easy to charge and I&#x27;ve had the charge last for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> i tried the Braun ultrasonic after having great luck with my ultrasonic toothbrush, but I was very disappointed. I should have returned it but instead I left it at my office for when I forget to shave or I&#x27;m running late. But this shaver is the least irritating, the closest shaving, and the most effective I&#x27;ve ever used. My only complaint is that I don&#x27;t like the popup trimmer angle, and that it emits a tiny high pitched whine when charging that you can hear if your hearing is good. Even with those gripes, I would buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the second Panasonic Linear shaver I&#x27;ve owned.  I bought this one after my Model 8168 wet/dry shaver finally gave out after 6+ years of pretty intense use - I felt like I got my money&#x27;s worth out of that beast.  Bottom line is, my last Panasonic worked really well, and this one works just as well - no better, no worse.  I have a tough beard and very sensitive skin, so blades don&#x27;t work, and most dry-only electric shavers just tear my skin up.  I use the shaver with a light shaving cream after a shower, and rinse the foil in cold water while shaving.  It shaves as close as anything else I&#x27;ve tried, including blades.  I chose the 8103 because I didn&#x27;t need the massive 4-foil heads of some of the other wet/dry models.  It&#x27;s also a great price for a Panasonic, which is the only brand of shaver I&#x27;ll buy.  Please keep making wet/dry shavers, Panasonic!  My only concern is that, while my last one was made in Japan, this one is made in China, and has the lighter (read: less substantial) feel that I for one expected given that piece of information.  While less that thrilled with that nugget, only time will tell whether that affects its longevity.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great website with most of them being reliable sources.</li>
            <li> This is my second Panasonic Wet/Dry Shaver. The first one lasted several years before breaking. A former co-worker recommended it, and I was very happy to discover it. I like how I can use it dry if I&#x27;m in a hurry, or can take more time and use water and shaving creme to get a closer shave when I have time. It&#x27;s easy to clean with liquid hand soap, so the optional cleaning machine is not a necessity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many electric razors.  Last was Norelco with the 3 rotating heads (about a 5-year old product).  The razor was very good; what I liked best was the minutes-to-go could be easily seen so you knew how much \\&quot;life\\&quot; was left before re-charging.  When re-charging, if you left the razor unconnected after it was re-charged, it reduced the battery&#x27;s  life.  Battery&#x27;s are costly to replace.    This Panasonic razor (#ES8301s) cuts closer and has a head which adjusts to the curvature and contours of your face.  It is a \\&quot;softer\\&quot; feel on the face.  It is everything I would like in a razor.  The negatives is the countdown on the battery&#x27;s life is in 10% segments, i.e., 100%, 90%, 80%,and so on until it seems to automatically shut down.  That&#x27;s not good.  Better to have each percent shown or each minute shown that is left because it gives the user greater control over when to re-charge in my judgment.  Unlike the Norelco, if you lose power in your battery, you can&#x27;t plug in this model Panasonic electric razor.  The plug in is only for re-charging.  With the Norelco even if the battery is not sufficient to run the razor, you can plug it in with the re-charging cord and it will totally function.  You must shut down the razor for it to re-store the battery&#x27;s life. This model of Panasonic does not work off the electric cord, only the battery, which is why I gave it 4 stars.  Another big plus for the Panasonic is when fully-recharged, the charging stops so the battery isn&#x27;t harmed versus the Norelco.  That&#x27;s a big plus for Panasonic.  Lastly, I&#x27;ve had the Panasonic for less than six months when it suddently began shutting down involuntarily at 50% battery life left.  I feel I was sold a product in which the battery was not good, for whatever reason.  The instructions accompanying the Panasonic razor said there was a two-year warranty.  I called them and they told me to ship it back to them.  I am about to do that having gone back to Amazon to get the invoice to show my proofof purchase and had the razor for less than 6 months.    Since I would be without a razor while the battery was being replaced, I bought a current Norelco product (# 8240XL) and it seems to be as good as the Panasonic or even better flowing over my face and getting a close cut.  The extreme negative is it doesn&#x27;t count down the time left before re-charging; it shows only a \\&quot;low battery\\&quot;.  That&#x27;s not good at all. Knowing the time left before needing to re-charge in minutes or percent of battery life remaining is important to me.</li>
            <li> The product was advertised as provided a close, comfortable shave and that&#x27;s what it does. I was actually very surprised at how quiet it was compared to the one it replaced. I have tried it both wet and dry and works equally well. I&#x27;ve only used it for 2 weeks but so far it is a thumbs up item in my book.</li>
            <li> I had a Panasonic electric microscreen razor that I had been using for about 7 years.  It still cut fine, but the batter could only hold a charge for 1 shaving, so I figured it was time to get a new one and see what new technology has to offer.  I decided to stick with Panasonic as I&#x27;ve been very happy with the brand&#x27;s performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to get the 3 blade shaver since this was the type of razor I had before.  This ES8103S is a great razor.  I really like having the display that shows how much batter power is left...no guessing involved.  I have found that I can get 6-7 shave cycles on a single charge.  As far as the shaving, I can&#x27;t say I really see much of an improvement over my 7 year old razor.  It still takes me 4-5 minutes to shave each morning, but when I&#x27;m done it leaves my face smooth and stubble free.  My neck hairs are still the hardest to shave and they take the majority of time for each morning shave.  Once I move to my face the razor is very fast, one pass usually gets the job done.  This razor is much lighter in my hand than my old one.  Probably because they use more plastic parts to save on cost, but still it is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor cleans up easy with liquid hand soap and water and has a nice sonic cleaning mode to really power clean the heads.  The swivel ability of the shaving head also is a nice improvement from my old razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I can&#x27;t complain.  The razor performs on par with my old razor and since I&#x27;ve been using an electric microscreen razor for many years my face is used to it and I get a very close and comfortable shave with no irritation.  The battery lasts a long time, the razor has a nice contour that fits in my hand well, and the display feature with the batter power is great.  I would highly recommend this razor, especially if you&#x27;ve been shaving with an electric razor already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  It&#x27;s now October.  I&#x27;ve been using this razor for about 10 months now, and I must say I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.  The razor still gives a very close, very fast and comfortable shave.  It&#x27;s so lightweight in my hands.  Easy to navigate around my face.  The batter is still holding a solid charge (uses about 10% per shave, so I can easily get 8 days worth of shaving on a single charge).  And it recharges from 20% to full in less than 2 hours.  I would still highly recommend this razor.with this purchase.  The razor still gives a very close, very fast and comfortable shave.  It&#x27;s so lightweight in my hands.

            <li> This item shaves no better than either of the two low-end shavers I currently own, one of which is an old, crappy Remington with a Nickel Cadmium battery. I usually shave dry, but I did try it on one occasion in the shower with shaving cream with unimpressive results.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product. It gives a nice shave and best of all it doesn&#x27;t hurt even after having skipped a day or two and the hairs are longer. I tried it in the shower but didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in closeness so I will most likely stick to the dry shave. Cleanup in water however is great and easy to do. I like the power meter so I know when a recharge is needed. The flip up trimer is small but seems to do a fine job.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good but it still does not cut as well as I thought it would. I was hoping for something that would work better on really tough beards. I find that it leaves a lot of the beard untouched. All in all it is okay but could be better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used mid range Norelcos my whole life, keeping them through at least one battery upgrade (6-8 years or so). The battery on my current Norelco (8845xl) isn&#x27;t holding a charge any more and the current crop of mid range ($75 or less) Norelcos don&#x27;t get very good reviews, plus I wanted something with a lithium battery instead of nicad. So instead of paying another $40 or so for a new battery and blades for the old Norelco, I tried this panasonic es 8103s. After a month I&#x27;m really liking it.  Pros:  Shaves closer than the Norelcos ever did.  No irritation at all. Occasionally with the Norelco I would get redness on my neck area.  Cleans easier than the Norelco. Can hold both under water, but on the Panasonic there are less spaces for the hairs to get stuck in.  Can use wet and with cream (it does seem to shave better that way but I&#x27;m happy with the results using it dry)  Lighter than the Norelco and easier to hold.  Easy to use pop out trimmer same as Norelco.  Replacement blades/screen are cheaper than Norelco replacements.  Nice use left display and tells when to clean it.  Cons:  The only real complaint I have is that this doesn&#x27;t suck in the cut hairs as well as the Norelco did so there will be cut hairs in the sink or on my shirt. Not much of a problem except the first time I used it to trim the hairs on the back of my neck, the cuttings got into the collar of my shirt and I spent the day with an itchy neck and redness due to that. Now that I know I won&#x27;t trim my neck hairs before showering.  Louder than the norelco but not annoying.  The vibrations in the hand are pretty strong compared to not feeling much with the norelco.  If not using it wet, it can get a little warm near the end of the shave.  Can&#x27;t use it while plugged in. With the nicad batteries in my norelcos I could continue to use them plugged in for a very long time (over a year) after the batteries stopped holding a charge before they would finally give out. I would expect the lithium battery in this to last years and years without having any problems like the nicads, but it is a concern as once the battery dies, it&#x27;s dead as you can&#x27;t use it plugged in.  I&#x27;m not concerned, but the foil screen is very thin and would damage easily if you banged this without it&#x27;s plastic cover. I suspect that is an issue with all foil shavers.  And no it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade, but it&#x27;s pretty close.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work that good for the price you pay for it!</li>
            <li> This is the second Panasonic shaver purchase for my husband. It was purchased as a replacement to his similar (Arc4) shaver which failed just before the 2 year warranty expired. He needed something while waiting for the warranty, expecting the warranty to take several weeks to resolve. Normally I would not purchase a product again that has proven to be unreliable - failing during the warranty period is not a good indicator of the product design. However, he really liked the quality of the shave and wanted to stick with the Panasonic. Because he viewed the shaver as essentially &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34; item, with an expected useful life of two years, the decision was made to go with the 20% less expensive Arc3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Arc3 shaver lasted 25 months of 5 day / week use. Not covered under warranty anymore. Bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing the shave to Arc4... Arc3 is noticeably rougher. It tugs a bit more at the skin. Definitely a difference. And in my husband&#x27;s opinion, not really worth the savings compared to Arc4. So, minus 1 star for the lower quality shave,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minus 1 more star because of overall product reliability. The product is obviously engineered to last +/- 24 months. Based on my experience, and the reviews of others, you can count on the product lasting 2 years. But you may get lucky and have it covered under warranty if it fails before that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy to report Panasonic was very easy to deal with on the Arc4 warranty. We shipped the shaver to Panasonic with the proper paperwork enclosed. About 10 days later a brand new replacement shaver showed up on the doorstep. This happened quite a bit faster than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, he is going to break the (now two year old) replacement Arc4 out of the box. It has been sitting in the cabinet for 2 years as a standby. He guesses it will last about two more years.</li>
            <li> Have used electric razors for years.  Didn&#x27;t really need one, but was not real happy with my razors.  I have used this only three time since it arrived.  Impressions: so light that you might think you only got a shell with nothing inside; half the noise of all prior razors;  I don&#x27;t always shave every day and my beard lays down causing me to either use the trimmer or shave extra long with lots of irritation.  No such problem with this razors.  I hope it works well for years to come.</li>
            <li> my bosses son loves it</li>
            <li> Surprisingly close shave for an electric razor. Holds a charge forever. Comfortable and easy to use. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll do this in bullet points to make it easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The shave I get from this shaver is great.  One of the best I&#x27;ve gotten with an electric.&lt;br /&gt;- I have sensitive skin, and with previous electrics, I couldn&#x27;t shave within 24 hours of a previous shave due to razor burn/sensitivity.  For some reason, with this shaver, that&#x27;s not an issue at all.  Worth the money right there!&lt;br /&gt;- Battery monitor is great!  Always good knowing if your shaver is about to die.&lt;br /&gt;- The wet/dry convenience is a plus.  I don&#x27;t shave in the shower at all, but it makes it easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;- Ergonomically pleasing.&lt;br /&gt;- Swivel head is a benefit for some, but I prefer it in the locked position.&lt;br /&gt;- The battery isn&#x27;t that great.  I get about 5 to 6 shaves out of it before needing a charge.  Their numbers are based off a 2-3 minute shave, but I don&#x27;t know any guy who can get a good shave with an electric in 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;- With that said, the shaves with this shaver are shorter than my previous.  Definitely less passes to get it close.&lt;br /&gt;- Hair pulls do happen, mainly due to the design of the 3rd center blade.  Nothing regular, but once in a while you&#x27;ll get one.&lt;br /&gt;- The razor does get hot, which does not feel nice in more sensitive spots (upper lip, under ear).&lt;br /&gt;- The plug is quite large, so not exactly travel friendly.&lt;br /&gt;- The razor is loud, with a high pitched squeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am quite please with the purchase.  One of the better foil shavers out there!</li>
            <li> really like the wet/dry option. I have sensitive skin but this is great shaver with closeness for a clean shave. thanks so much!!</li>
            <li> I love this razor!  It works as well as the $200 Braun with cleaning station that I had been using for 4+ years until it died.  Holds a charge well and is easy to clean- I agree with others that state that the cleaning stations are just not worth the money because you always have to buy the solution.  This razor is much more quiet than the Braun and gives a close shave without irritation.</li>
            <li> I feel it necessary to write a review of the Panasonic ES8103S shaver because I heavily based my purchase on such reviews.  I have had the shaver now for about one month with about twelve shaves completed.  Never having owned an electric razor before, I heeded the advice of many others plus the manufacturer to give my skin at least three weeks to adjust due to the different type of shaving.  The shaver does great on my face and jaw line but the neck is a completely different story.  My neck was left extremely irritated around the collar line (where my beard ends) each time I have used the shaver.  I have tried every method that I have read about to include: using &#x27;Lectric Shave, Shave Secret, wet shave in shower (with and without shaving cream), dry shave, before shower, after shower, in the evening, in the morning, and even during the middle of the day and each time produced the same result; a very close shave on face and jaw line but an extremely irritated neck line.  As far as the shaver itself, it&#x27;s a very good shaver, good quality, although the trimmer on the back of the unit is worthless.  Overall, I was pleased with its performance although it does take at least twice as long to shave with an electric versus a blade and it didn&#x27;t perform well on the neck.  If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, you may not have a problem but if you do, beware.  I&#x27;ll be switching back to a manual.</li>
            <li> This shaver works well, but there is one major flaw - While charging you can NOT use the shaver. If you forget to charge one night and don&#x27;t have much time in the morning to wait for it to charge, this could be a big issue. I took away 1 1/2 stars for that. The other 1/2 star is because it seems like my older electric shaver cut just a little closer. It&#x27;s still a very good shave, but it&#x27;s just a slightly longer cut. If not for the recharging thing, I would give it 4 stars because the shave is still good.</li>
            <li> This razor is gives the closest and smoothest shave I have ever had. Hope it stays sharp and lasts a long time. I recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Goods you received you are very happy&lt;br /&gt;,, You are the best of the seller</li>
            <li> Out of the box I was very pleased.  The shaver seemed very well built with a nice weight to it.  It charged quickly and shows you how much percentage battery is remaining.  It made quick work of my beard which I tend to let go 3 to 4 days.  I get about 20 shaves per charge.  I had a Norelco before which gave a closer shave but really tore up my face. The Panasonic is very easy on my face and never irritates my skin but shaving dry doesn&#x27;t give the closest shave I ever had.  But if you shave wet with shaving cream or soap you get a much closer shave.  Overall I am very pleased seems like a very good shaver.</li>
            <li> So far so good. The only thing I dont like is the beard trimmer is hard to use because the main heads block the view in the mirror.</li>
            <li> The battery on my old Panasonic expired after many years of great service, so I decided to buy another rather than a new battery.  As before, this product is a great design, well made, and comfortable to use, while delivering a superb close shave.  Easy to clean, and I like the new feature telling me how much charge I have left in the battery.  Five stars Panasonic!</li>
            <li> This is a solid shaver that provides a close shave.  Likes: size, feel, flexible head, charge indicator, and close shave.  Less than optimal:  sound, charger cord, and travel case.  I gave this a 5 star rating despite the fact that there are some things that could be improved.  Thus, I would happily buy it again; however, in a perfect world I would change the following:&lt;br /&gt;- Sound - the sound is like a cross between an amplified mosquito (80%) and an electric grass shear (20%).  It&#x27;s also a little louder than my other electric razors.  Nevertheless, it didn&#x27;t bother me that much initially, and I got used to it within a couple of weeks to the point where it doesn&#x27;t bother me anymore.  Ideally, I would make the sound quieter.&lt;br /&gt;- Charger cord - I prefer the old style cords that are curled, can stretch, and simply plug in to the wall without a converter.  I don&#x27;t travel abroad that much, and when I do, I bring a converter, so being able to plug into a wall outlet directly in essentially any country isn&#x27;t that valuable of a feature to me.  I would prefer a smaller plug in cord when traveling.  This is particularly true because a fully charged battery lasts me about 2+ weeks with everyday use that likely exceeds my time for any/most travels abroad.  That said, this is probably the best of bunch in terms of shavers that can plug into any electrical supply.  The charger/converter section measures about 2 cm wide x 6 cm long x 6.5 cm deep, which seems smaller than most.  Even with the converter as is, I would prefer a curled cord versus the straight cord.&lt;br /&gt;- Travel case - this seems much smaller and flimsy compared to travel cases of the past.  It&#x27;s is made of cloth.  Currently, I am using a flexible (yet stronger / more durable) travel case from a previous razor to hold this razor, and this razor&#x27;s travel case to hold the power cord.  This travel case isn&#x27;t designed to hold both.&lt;br /&gt;One other design features that I would change is that the charger indicator goesdown fairly evenly until 10%.  At 10%, the indicator seems to last twice, possibly more, as long as at any other level. This seems typical of most consumer gauges these days including car gas gauges; however, I would prefer one that meauures consistently at all levels.&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, I am very happy with this razor.</li>
            <li> I found this gem on[...]. On my face I use an Murker double edge razor. But because of the sensitivity  on my head I had to choose another option.  I&#x27;ve tried other electric razors, all of which fall short of my expectations.  Then after much research I found the Panasonic ES8103S. Delivery was quick, and was everything I hoped for in a shaver for my head.  The hair on my head is coarse, so one concern was battery life. One full charge will last me about a week of every day shaving. It tells you how much life it has lteft, so no unexpected shut downs. You can choose between wet or dry shaving.  I favor wet, using Proraso shave  cream ,with brush. The Panasonic cuts easily through tough stubble. It leaves my head baby  smooth. No nicks,bumps,scratchs, or any blemishes whatsoever! What my trusted DE  razor couldn&#x27;t do for my head,the Panasonic does beautifully. If you&#x27;re having problems achieving that perfect bald head, then this gem is the way to go.  I&#x27;ve yet to try it on my face, but with the high quality shave I get on my head I would have no doubt facial shaving would be equally superb! You can&#x27;t go wrong buying this shaver. Try it and you too will love the results.</li>
            <li> this $81 shaver was my 3rd panasonic. the $30, $50, and $80 versions shave the same to me, just differing in options. this $81 version&#x27;s power indicator broke on me after almost 3 years. i just bought the $50 version again, since it has a more reliable old school lcd display instead.  the $30 version doesn&#x27;t have a power indicator, different foil design, perhaps weaker motor, longer charging time and no travel pouch. the replacement foil and blades cost around $35.</li>
            <li> Like many men I HATE shaving.  I have been on a quest for a better shaver for many years.  Cannot use a blade due to irritation and ingrown hairs.  I have tried several Brauns (dry shaving) and have always been disappointed at the short blade life and high cost.  Panasonic wet shavers have been better, but with this current model ES 8103 I am absolutely amazed at how comfortable a wet shave (with lather) is.  Many of you may think, \\&quot;Why should I go to the trouble of using lather when I bought an electric shaver?\\&quot;.  I can give two good reasons: 1) Your shave will be so smooth that you may be able to get by shaving every other day as I have, and 2) The blades last much longer because of the lubrication the lather provides.  I am at 4 months now and cannot even notice any dulling, whereas most dry Braun shavers dropped off after one month and were useless in 6.  Replacement blades are very expensive, typically half the cost of the shaver.  The only thing that does not hold up to Panasonic&#x27;s claims is the battery life on a charge - it is 3 to 4 shaves for me compared to the 12 or more promised, but I do not really care about this - it is quick and easy to recharge.  A great product that has improved my quality of life!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Lets keep this short and simpe:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Wet/Dry, motor, floating or locking head, the foil appears more rugged than other foil shavers, decent for the price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Not as close of a shave as the Remington MS3000 I used for many years, battery life seems to drain quick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found I get a closer shave using in the shower with simple soap as a lubricant.</li>
            <li> Pulled my hair below the chin area. Left a nasty wound !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve using a few different Norelco rotary razors over the years. I decided to try this Panasonic foil shaver, In part because of the reviews-(also $[...] off $[...] instant rebate, got free spare blades). My Norelco needed blades again, I&#x27;m not knocking Norelco, the razor still works (probably 4-5 years old) I decided to try something else. This razor is quick and can be used wet or dry. Works well around the neck area where my rotery would have problems. The Panasonic definitely outperforms my rotery, although it&#x27;s an older model. I agree with most of the other reviewers, this razor works quite well.</li>
            <li> The first shaver I&#x27;ve ever had which I am allowed to get wet.  At first, you feel kind of worried water will destroy it but after many &#x27;trials,&#x27; it becomes second-nature.  Panasonic does not try to force you into a lot of expensive cleaning cartridges, filled with rubbing alcohol as far as my nose can tell, like the Braun people do.  The Braun cartridges, stretched out, will last about 2 months but still they cost me about $15 or so per cartridge.  Those days are OVER!  Panasonic instructs you to simply drop some liquid soap (I use handsoap) onto the foil, then run the razor to lather it up.  Next, pull off the foil-cover housing and rinse it all out.  It comes out clean and you can just let everything air-dry.  One complaint, which prevents my rating this at 5-stars, is the side-trimmer.  The trimmer in the Braun did work much better.  I used it for everything, neck-grooming, beard maintenance, moustache fixing, you name it.  The Panasonic does not seem to have a sharp enough blade on their trimmer.  So for those things I switch back to the Braun.  I guess you have to go with whatever works best for you.  I have had this one a few weeks now and I have done two recharges on it; hoping the battery will last even longer once it can &#x27;stretch its legs&#x27; a bit. Good, clean shave.  11/2013 update:  for what it&#x27;s worth, this continues to be a solid product.  Very pleased with it.  4/2016 update:  after years of virtually daily use, I think this needs a new foil block.  Other than that, it works like new.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I have been a Braun user for nearly 16 years and I must say that Braun makes a great shaver and it travels well and is sturdy.  However, I have always had a problem with fine facial hair and getting a close shave with the Braun.  When my most recent Braun died I looked around and this Panasonic kept coming up with high reviews.  While I like a corded/cordless model I decided that this cordless would work out well (I do a lot of world travel and preferred to have a cord when power was undependable).  I have NO REGRETS in purchasing this model.  The shave is smooth, quick and close (even with fine chin hair).  Besides the high pitched sound of the nano tech motor (it sounds like a mosquito on steroids) the razor out performs anything I have ever owned (I have been a Norelco, Remington, and Braun owner).  This razor works quickly, is nicely shaped, fits my hand very well, gives a good readout on the battery level, and recharges fast, even for a quick shave.  The ability to lock or float the head is an added nice feature for different parts of the chin and face and is very easy to clean.    Highest recommendations to Panasonic for great new shaver!</li>
            <li> Works good even if I skip a day or two. Battery last for 2 weeks without charging.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge for about 20 normal close, smooth shaves. I fully charged on January 11th and today February first, I shaved and still have 10% left as per the LCD. This is my second Wet and Dry from Panasonic. First Panasonic was bought in 1980. Then, I had a Remington and a Philips/Norelco. They all died by the battery. This razor is by far the best, with a great shave and value at this time. I highly recommend this Panasonic razor.</li>
            <li> I have had several different shavers over the years from rotary to foil. I was never able to find one that can adequately shave my neck. I swore off electric for years until I bought this one on a whim. This razor shaves great. It shaves my neck better than any other razor and shaves just as close as my Mach 3. The battery life on it is really good so I don&#x27;t have to constantly charge it and it cleans easy under the faucet. All in all very happy with it and the wife likes it because I&#x27;m willing to shave more often.</li>
            <li> This one is the same as the Norelco rotor that I had before this one.  The Norelco had issues with the neck and didn&#x27;t do a good job in that area.  This one is the same.  I thought going from rotor to foil would help but it is the same.  I will still use thise one for a while as I like the fact that it is a wet shaver that I can use with a shaving cream.  But, after 2 years, I&#x27;m going back to the traditional approach of no electrical shavers.    So, in short, it really depends on the structure of face and neck region.  Nothing wrong with the shaver.</li>
            <li> Did not shave good AT ALL!!!!</li>
            <li> Great shaver, this is the second one I have owned of this model.  The first one I bought six years ago.  I only bought this new one because of the sale price, and I figure the batteries in the original may be getting close to the end. The shave is great wet or dry.  The thing to remember is that after about three years you should replace the blades.  Will make it shave like new again.</li>
            <li> Yep, the Panasonic Nano shaver is the best I&#x27;ve ever used, and by a fairly wide margin.    I&#x27;m 58, have a medium beard, and average face. I&#x27;ve used most everything over the years, including a number of Remingtons, 2 Brauns, Gillette razors (blades), and, most recently, 3 different Norelcos.    They all had their pluses and minuses, but only the Panasonic has it all.  Quick, comfortable, and for me, close as a blade.  [I know, staunch blade users will dispute that last comment; however, my wife of 37 years agrees - take it up with her.]    I&#x27;ve used it dry, wet, and with shaving cream - in my case, I much prefer using cream to shave.  I&#x27;ve read where people  ask why bother using cream? Well, for the same reasons you use cream with a blade: comfort and closeness.     [If you wonder what it&#x27;s like to use a Panasonic wet/dry shaver with cream, a gent posted a YouTube video, and the guy nails it.]     My only regret is that I waited this long to try it. I always thought it must be a gimmick, but for me, it works great - highly recommended.    Bob G.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my husband for Christmas.  I did a lot of research because I didn&#x27;t want to buy anything that was junk and not work on his beard.  He works in construction and outside and he only has time to shave about every 3 days so he needed a razor that would cut through a thick beard and this one does it!  It has a mustache side burn trimmer that pops out and you can use it wet or dry which he prefers dry.  I bought this when it was on sale for under $100 and I could not have bought a better razor for him.</li>
            <li> I finally talked my husband into trying an electric.  He has very sensitive skin and is very particular about the closeness of his shave.  I have to say, he loves this razor!  Shaving in the shower, he&#x27;s able to shave almost as close as a razor, but his skin has NO irritation.  It take a bit longer as he has to shave the same area multiple times, but what a difference!  He&#x27;ll never go back to regular razors again.  This thing rocks!</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every shaving method that you can name(straight blade, double edge safety razor , fusion 5 ....) and I would have to say that this shaver really dose hit the mark. I would not compare it to a straight blade (the king of all shaves , but takes a good amount of skill, time, and upkeep), but I would say with 100% confidence that it beat my fusion blade by a small margin.  If I would have to rank it out of all the types of shaves I listed, it would be #3, with straight blade coming in at #1 and safety razor at #2.  I think that is insanely amazing for an electric razor , Panasonic has done a great job with this little wonder.  My face still feels fairly smooth after a good 8 hours.  I would say I fall in line with medium facial hair and I am not sure how it would perform if you were the beast man? It even did a good job around the neck (2-3 passes). The only con I see is the battery life; which does a good 9 shaves and will probably go down to about 6 after a year of usage.  That is not such a big deal to me though since it has a quick 5 min charge for a single shave and takes only an hour to get a full charge.  I honestly can recommend this shaver and Panasonic has won me over as they kept their word with what was advertised. Happy shaving!!</li>
            <li> + close shave    + less irritation    + easy cleaning    + wet/dry operation    - surprisingly loud    - takes several passes for best result    - requires some skin pushing/pulling for best angles    - in the end, still takes same amount of shaving time</li>
            <li> Very smooth razor for the price</li>
            <li> I bought it at &#x27;today&#x27;s deal&#x27; and like it. It&#x27;s slim and powerful! And reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I recently bought Panasonic ES8103S and very pleased with the closeness and comfort. Wet shave is much nicer than the dry shaving I have been using for years. My first electric shaver was a Philips 3 head rotary model, switched to Braun 3525, Braun 3-2-1, Braun 7525, and Braun 8575. Panasonic ES8103S is not the top of of the line shaver, but it performs better than anything I have tried so far. I am sure I&#x27;ll move on to a newer Panasonic model in the near future.</li>
            <li> It does not cut that well and takes about as long to get all the spots that have weird shape as a standard razor.  Hair falls out when cutting so it is messy too.  The sideburn trimmer stopped working after 40 days, 10 days past the return date for Amazon.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using Panasonic wet/dry shavers for over 10 years.  This is the best one I&#x27;ve purchased yet, in my opinion.  My last one had the cleaning device included-- I wouldn&#x27;t ever buy one of those again--a waste of money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I used to shave with a straight razor, but after I had a few strokes my hand was not so steady. After charging the Panasonic up I had my first shave and let me say to any one thinking about purchasing an electric shaver. The Panasonic ES8103S Arc3 has given me the closest shave since I shaved with the straight razor. I strong recommend this razor to any one thinking about purchasing an electric razor. I had 2 other kinds of electric razor&#x27;s &amp; they did not shave my beard well. Also I searched for the best price and found it on Amozon. The Panasonic comes with a 2 year warranty so save the $7.50 on the extra protection &amp; do not get it. That&#x27;s my view on it.</li>
            <li> I have always used the Braun series shavers, the last one was their top-of-the-line self cleaning system. After about 5 or 6 years that broke and I have tried several other types. I just bought this brand and I am very pleased with it. It shaves closer than the Braun, I use less time in shaving, and it&#x27;s easy to clean. I&#x27;ve always had a few stragglers that get missed and grow long, this shaver doesn&#x27;t do that - it never misses a hair. It claims a &#x27;one-pass&#x27; shave, which is a small exaggeration, but not by much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks, and so far, so good.  Most importantly, the blades are very sharp, and as a result I haven&#x27;t yet had an incidence of ingrown hair, something that my old razor was doing a lot.  It functions well wet or dry.  Sometimes I have to go over an area many times, but only once or twice if I stretch the skin (hard to do without a mirror in the shower).  The charge lasts more than a week; I didn&#x27;t bother to bring the charger on my 1 week business trip to Europe.  The charge indicator is nice.  Update Jan 2012:  It is still my favorite razor.  It still charges quickly and lasts for many shaves.  It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve had that lasted this long with regular use in the shower.  The only thing is that the display is dim and difficult to read.  Moisture gets in and some of the segments fail intermittently (so far they&#x27;ve always come back eventually).</li>
            <li> Very good shaver for the money.  It may not have the most blades or other bells and whistles, but I can get a very close shave with it.  My previous shaver was the ES8109 model, which I have had for 5 or 6 years and continues to work well. (The ES8109 is exactly the same shaver as the ES8103, but includes the automatic cleaner, which stopped functioning several years ago).  Rather than buy another set of replacement blades and a screen for over $30, I decided to buy a new shaver altogether for about $65.</li>
            <li> I waited a long time to buy an electric razor again while continuing to use a blade razor. I finally purchased the Panasonic and am very pleased. I really like the wet or dry feature. I have very sensitive skin and often cut myself with the blade razor. With the Panasonic I have no problems. I can lather up or use a pre-electric lotion without concern of cutting myself. In addition the razor charges in very short time.</li>
            <li> Its quite smooth. My previous machine used to pull my hair and it was quite uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;this is quite good . totally recommend it</li>
            <li> unlike my previous panasonic electric shaver this one seems to hold a charge.  i was lucky to get three shaves from old(8 mths) panasonic.  this one so far is good.  also this gives a nice close shave with no burn.  thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I have tried Norelco, Braun and Panasonic.  I had an old Panasonic that I upgraded to a Braun 8595.  From day one I found that the Braun didn&#x27;t give as close a shave as the Panasonic.  However, the battery charge lasted forever and I liked the self cleaning station.  Over time, the 8595 broke down a couple of times and I had to go back to the old Panasonic.  I was amazed at how close a shave I got in comparison.  Recently, the foil broke on the Braun 8595 and I decided to purchase this Panasonic ES8103S.  From the first shave, I was instantly WOWed.  I love this shaver and will never use another brand again.  It shaves almost as close as a Mach 3 razor in much less time and without the irritation.  It charges fast, is easy to clean and very lightweight, making it an exellent choice for home or traveling.  I would be shocked if someone doesn&#x27;t like this shaver....</li>
            <li> Close shave nearly all over. Have to do a few more over the neck area but it is amazingly easy on the skin. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I have used panasonic razors before, this one is the best. The ability to use it wet is its strongest asset.</li>
            <li> I have shaved with gillette blades for over 15 years now, and suffered most of it. After two days of shaving, used to leave my skin burning. With this panasonic razor, shaving is no pain at all. Even when shaving every day of the week. I shave wet with Panasonic ES8103S, with a thin layer of shave gel and lots of water. It gives a very close shave, more when shaving against the grain. The only place where I still use blades for touch up is bottom edge of my neck. For some reasons this razor is unable to catch all hair on the neck, no matter which direction I rock this.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver I have ever owned that actually works as it claims.  I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst electric shavers that I have tried.  It feels like its pulling each hair out individually!  Back to Norelco for me.</li>
            <li> Recently purchased The Panasonic ES8103S Shaver from Amazon.  I received it two days ahead of the projected delivery date.  Great service!  This shaver is fantastic.  Some 12-15 years ago I used a single head foil induction charging Panasonic which I loved but the charging mechanism failed so I replaced it with a double head corded Remington ($15 at Target).  This was sort of an interim replacement until I could make up my mind whether or not I would go back to blades.  What a clunker ! Later I replaced it with a Braun single head foil shaver ($35 at Walmart).  This shaver was not all that bad - but not all that good, either.  It was not easy on the face like the Panasonic. Instead of gliding over the face, you could feel the roughness as it shaved the whiskers. By late in the day, a touch up shave would be required if you were going out.  Not the case with the ES8103S. Shave close in the morning - no pulling, no burn and no touch up necessary later on in the day.  At $79, this shaver I am convinced is the best buy out there.  The pop-up trimmer works very well on sideburns and does not nick the skin like the Braun.  Cleaning this shaver is quite easy.  Remove the head, blow out the whiskers and you&#x27;re through. The digital screen in addition to indicating remaining battery life (6-7 confortable shaves per charge) also tells you when to wash the unit with handsoap and water which is quite easy.  In summary, I am very happy with my purchase and highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a tough beard and sensitive skin so this is perfect for me.  Had this since before Christmas, no issues so far.</li>
            <li> I am 63 and my skin is a lot more tender and subject to cuts than when I was younger.  I have been using electric razors off and on for about forty years - Primarily Norelco but also Remington, Braun and Toshiba.  During those forty years I did not notice any significant change in the quality of the shave or the pulling, picking and burning that came from shaving certain facial sections over and over again.  Panasonic takes electric shavers to a level that is comparable to a blade (which still gives the closest shave) without the mess and pain.  I was not sure it was working until I felt the smoothness of the shave.  Shaving is much quicker because there are few do overs and it does not irritate sensitive skin.  A remarkable and greatly needed advance in electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update November 15, 2011&lt;br /&gt;I replaced the blades and foil after 2 years.  There was some improvement in performance but overall, a disappointment.  Now it&#x27;s just an average shaver.  I don&#x27;t know how long an electric razor is supposed to last at peak performance but 2 years was my experience.  No regrets.</li>
            <li> This is for the ES8103S model   [[ASIN:B001DNE3KQ Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Rechargeable Linear Pivot Action Shaving System, Silver]]    I&#x27;ve used Norelco and Braun products for over the past 15 years and this is the best shaver ever.  Not as close as my Mach-3 or Fusion blades but faster.     PROs:    - Fast, took less than 3min to shave my whole face   - No pain on my neck, unlike all other razors I&#x27;ve owned   - Dry/Wet shaver.  I haven&#x27;t tried it wet yet but I like the option.     CONs:   - A little hard to shave at my upper-lip to nose area but nothing worse that other electrics   - Won&#x27;t run off the charger cord   - No charger stand like my last Braun and Norelco had but I&#x27;m glad to give it up for a better shave    Notes:   - These comments are from my initial shave, I&#x27;ll try to remember to update later when I&#x27;ve had more experience.  The documentation, like every other razor, says it may cause irritation for the first few weeks or so but not for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this model to replace my old Panasonic Linear which had finally come to the end of it&#x27;s life, to which I thought I would be getting one equal to what I was used to. I wanted a shaver that was wet/dry capable and would provide a comfortable and close as shave as possible to a hand razor. Little did I know that this new Panasonic was far superior in how it cuts for a truly razor close shave with total comfort. The digital readout on the handle is a plus as well in telling you how much battery life is available in addition to indicating when it should be cleaned. Clean up is so simple and easy by just putting a drop of liquid soap on the shaver head, turn on, let it foam, shut off and rinse. Thats it and it looks and smells fresh as new. I could not be happier with this product and highly recommend it :).</li>
            <li> I have shaved with an electric razor for decades using Norelco shavers.  This ES8103S gives me the best shave I have ever gotten with a electric.  It give a fast and close shave every time.  I have used it wet and dry and get a good shave either way.  While running, it makes a funny buzzing noise with different tone when it is cutting. Therefore you can tell when it has finished with an area.  That is usually only one or two passes.  A charge lasts for ten or more shaves and it recharges quickly.  The charge indicator is great for knowing when a charge will be needed.  My only complaint is the position of the trimmer.  It is on the back of the razor. If it were closer to the end of the razor it would be easier to trim areas such as the hairs in the ears and nose.</li>
            <li> I saw this shaver on a steep discount and I decided to try electric for a first time in my life (35yrs old).    My beard is strong, and it would scratch my skin when shaving with razor, so I had to take 3-4 days breaks between shaves. With Panasonic that doesn&#x27;t happen.    PROS:  - I shave every day with very little irritation, if any.  - No ingrown hair.  - Easy and inexpensive to clean (had to do it once in 7+ days)  - Fairly silent (but loud compared to razor :)).    SEMI-CONS:  - Takes more time to shave vs. razor (couple minutes more, no big deal)  - Neck area is tough to get right/smooth  - One charge is enough for 4-5 shaves (far from 10-13 they advertise), but it&#x27;s not a big deal, since battery charges in under 1h (I don&#x27;t know if the fast charge is going to kill battery faster).    A definite buy, but not for $140+</li>
            <li> I purchased this particular shaver after researching the best shavers for African American men. It was becoming expensive to replace the blades for my &amp;#34;Gillette Turbo II&amp;#34; razor. Especially at $17 a pop for just 4 blades per pack! Even at Walmart! The price for the Panasonic was not bad for the quality at all. Shipping as always was lightning fast from Amazon! It shaves close and is excellent when using shaving gel. Doesn&#x27;t always get as close as the Gillette so I did not give it a 5th star. But, I am NOT complaining. It more than meets my needs and recharges pretty quickly as well. I notice I shave more often because this is one very nice shaver!</li>
            <li> I had this now 1 month.  I was going to replace \\&quot;shaver head set\\&quot; of my Norellco shaver.  It was almost $40 and battery would be still the old one.   So I changed my mind to bet on this Panasonic.  It shaves better than Norellco and most of all I can clean the shaver with regular liqid soap and water(no need expensive cleaning solution).  I am totally satisfied with the purchase so far.  I will try to update later.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my Panasonic ES8067, which lasted at least 9 years.  Loved the old razor, and had been able to buy replacement cutting heads to keep it fresh, but this year the battery finally stopped holding a charge.  My only complaints about the old razor were the noise, and that I did have to make multiple passes around the neck / Adams&#x27; apple to get a close shave.  The new shaver&#x27;s PROS are that it is lighter and quieter.        However, the CONS are that it is lighter because it is all plastic, even the head surrounding the cutting blocks.  This gives it a much cheaper, flimsier feel than the old razor.  My old one survived a couple of knocks off the counter over the years -- -- unlikely the new razor will fare as well.  Second, while quieter, it seems to be because the motor is a lot less powerful.  The cutting blocks don&#x27;t seem to oscillate as quickly, and the motor actually slows down as I get to the denser section of my chin.  I&#x27;m just shaving the day&#x27;s stubble off - not a full beard or anything, but the new razor struggles and I can feel the hairs pulling before they get cut off.  Quite unpleasant.  Plus, I&#x27;m now having to make multiple passes on all planes of my face just to get a reasonably close shave.        Finally, though the manual says you&#x27;ll get \\&quot;about 14 shaves\\&quot; to a full charge, I was already down to 60% after the first 3 shaves.  Again, that is probably because of having to make multiple passes.      All in all, disappointing, and am seriously contemplating a return of this one.</li>
            <li> This is my second Panasonic shaver.  The first still charges and runs after a few years of use but the blades are dull and it didn&#x27;t have the trimmer so I replaced it with a cheap razor but it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge.  This one&#x27;s going strong after nearly a year and I only have to charge it every few weeks with light use.  Got it on sale but I&#x27;d probably replace it at full price if I had to.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas this year. He&#x27;s a soldier, so he has to shave EVERY single day, and he was always saying he wanted an electric razor. It&#x27;s not the top of the line, and it&#x27;s not an el cheapo. Considering he is using it every single day, it&#x27;s holding up just great! He said the razor might be getting a little dull, cause it takes a little longer to shave than it did when he first started using it, but he still loves it. I know he&#x27;s planning on taking it with him on his next deployment to make his life a little easier. It charges SUPER fast, and is very very very easy to clean. It&#x27;s a GREAT gift for your husbands, ladies. Definitely worth the price :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shaved electric since 1962.  Shick, Sunbeam, 3 Norelcos, 3 Remingtons, 2 previous Panasonics.  The Panasonics were the best for speed, comfort, closeness.  So when my last Panasonic wore out (needed head parts, cost more than it was worth) I spent 3 hours reading reviews on their current line before buying ES8103S.  I also looked at &#x27;value&#x27; lines like Remington, but reviews sounded like what I would have said about my old ones.  I never found the Norelcos really satisfactory; slow, irritating, not close, but they&#x27;re quiet.    ES8103S is quiet.  It just buzzes slightly.  The linear motor is fast and efficient and there are virtually no mechanicals to wear out.  The battery is lithium-ion so it won&#x27;t have the premature aging of the previous nickel-cadmiums.  The design is little different from my previous Panasonics, same head dimensions.  The motor is slightly faster.    An LCD display shows how much charge is left.  An average shave takes 10% of capacity, so ES8103S can shave for aprx a week between charges.  There is not a cleaner/charger stand for ES8103S.  That&#x27;s what brings it down into value pricing, especially with Amazon discounts.  Charge time is ~1 hour.    Panasonics can be used wet or dry, but I have not used them wet so can&#x27;t comment on that.  Other than it&#x27;s not advisable to leave them in a wet environment after use.  The speed, comfort, closeness used dry are the best of all the shavers I&#x27;ve used.      ES8103S is the best shaver I&#x27;ve owned, WITHOUT being the most expensive.  If you&#x27;d like a little more bell/whistle factor, get ES8243A, essentially the same thing gussied up, but costs roughly twice and according to one review the renewal parts (screens and cutters) cost much more than the ~$25 for ES8103S.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best electric razor I have ever used. I have very sensitive skin that gets razor burn and cuts very easily when using normal fusion razors. I also shave my head every few days and the first time I tried this shaver I was blown away at how close it gets with only a few passes. No nicks, no razor burn, just super smooth. I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to normal razors. Only drawback I see is its a bit loud but who cares it works great.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver, everything as the ad said. Easy to use, easy to charge, quite and good shave.</li>
            <li> This was a bad investment. I was originally going for a Norelco Rotary, but most reviews warned that the foil could fall off from the blades and you could get cut or that the razor itself was made of cheap material.    Anyway based on the panasonic reviews I decided to try this razor. I have sensitive skin and this had the best reviews from those who said they didn&#x27;t get any bumps and they have sensitive skin.  The first day I did a dry shave. It is not a 1 pass razor, I was left with a couple patches of hair. The manual requires you give at least 30 days for your face to get accustomed to the razor. As the days went by, the razor performed progressively worse. I changed the blades to make sure I did not get an old blade with the razor.    Now it is well past 30 days. I bought this last december. Whether wet or dry the razor does not shave my beard on the first pass, the second pass, third pass, I really have to dig the razor into my face to get the hair off, I have tried shaving cream, shaving gel, shaving oil and nothing helps. After, I am left with severe razor bumps.    I have since gone back to my mach 3 razor. 1 pass and I am finished. The panasonic is now gathering dust in a corner.</li>
            <li> I have been a Braun user for more than a decade, when it was recommended to me as exceptionally good for sensitive skin. And it was. The latest Braun I have been using is the 7570, and I have been using it for at least seven years. But it is aging. The battery lasts for about 1/3 of what it used to, and the shave does not feel as close or as smooth as it did originally. I have changed the blades and screen on avg. about every 1.5 years. So I have been looking to replace it. I don&#x27;t want to buy one that comes with the stand and cleaning built into the stand. Braun is quite expensive; none of what I see of Braun today seems to suggest that it will be similar to what I have. Also the reviews for the current Brauns are not that good. So when I saw the Panasonic ES8103S Pro for close to $50 I got interested. I read the reviews and it seemed like the shave was good and smooth, and what was most important for me is how good it seemed to be with sensitive skin.  I purchased the Panasonic ES8103S and I have been using it for 2 weeks. Here are my thoughts:   The shave is smoother and less irritating than any electric shaver I have used, including the Braun. It is also much lighter than the Braun. However, everything else about this shaver is not so good. I will enumerate:    The trimmer is narrow and does not perform as well as the shaver.  The battery is very poor. After four shaves I had 40% left.  The shaver is loud.   Does not have a safety switch to prevent the on/off from going on, so that when it is in your suitcase or carry on you can expect it to off, alerting TSA, worrying passengers, and draining your battery.  The LCD that shows the amount of charge available only shows when the shaver is turned on.   I would endure all these annoyances for a better, smoother shave. But the worst part is that this shave is built like such crap, if this falls there is no need to pick it up. It&#x27;s some cheapo plastic. What a contrast to the Braun.  I had seen others mention this in their reviews but I didn&#x27;t realize to what extent. Now I have a dilemma. I like the shave but not the quality of the machine. I would pay more for the same shaver that was built better. But the next in line of the Panasonic  (ES8243A and ES-LA63-S) use 4 blades which I would prefer to stay away from, plus I don&#x27;t know why to expect that they are built any better. The shaver box says that there is a 30 days money back; I think I will try that.  If anyone has a suggestion please leave comment.</li>
            <li> This is a remarkable hand held whisker mower!! Once out of the box, it was charged and ready to run in under an hour. The motor is very quiet but this is truly a men&#x27;s razor!! It leaves no whisker behind in no time at all. Wet or Dry, this is a terrific electric razor!</li>
            <li> But, I don&#x27;t know it is really good or not yet,,  by their description,, I should use it about a month to know it.  Oh God;;    Anyway,, It&#x27;s working good.</li>
            <li> I gave the Panasonic ES8103S shaver as a Christmas present to my husband.  It provides a smooth, close shave and does not irritate his skin.  The cut he gets from this shaver is about the same as the disposable razors he once used.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am totally pleased with my razor.  First off, it arrived 22 hours after I ordered it 5 days before Christmas!!  It shaves me well and causes no discomfort. Also, the handle is easy to grip. After each shave, I like to clean the razor, and it&#x27;s a dream to do if you use soft-foam soap and follow the directions for cleaning that come with the unit.  I&#x27;ve had many razors over the years, but this one is by far the best. It even tells you the level of charge as soon as you turn it on!! You can&#x27;t go wrong with this razor.</li>
            <li> First electrical shaver that works on me!</li>
            <li> This is my first wet/dry shaver.  While it works fine as a dry shaver, I am appreciating the ability to shave with a wet soapy face. I feel like the shave is closer, and I appreciate the smooth, non-irritating shaving experience.  My previous shavers have been from Norelco and Braun.</li>
            <li> I got this shaver in December of 2009 and wanted to throughourly test it before writing a review.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my thoughts;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br /&gt;shaver has a solid build&lt;br /&gt;charge time seems quick for a fast recharge&lt;br /&gt;overall feel is comfortable to handle&lt;br /&gt;shaving in the shower is convenient and reliable&lt;br /&gt;LCD display is great for reminding you to clean and recharge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;product is made in china(was concerned about build but not anymore-- great craftsmanship!! Update as of 6/15/13&lt;br /&gt;motor seems kinda loud when shaving&lt;br /&gt;battery life seems a bit weak after one shave&lt;br /&gt;should be able to shave while charging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: My last \\&quot;FOIL\\&quot; type shaver seemed less loud and was able to charge and shave but i couldn&#x27;t use it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall i like the product but could be quieter and hold a charge longer. Almost forgot the most important part, function... the shaver gives a clean shave (5-8mins)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given it the thirty days they say it takes for your face to adjust. I can rub the thing back and forth over the same spot 10 times from all directions and I still have stuble. Not sure what is wrong with my face, but it doesn&#x27;t cut short, medium or long hair. Apparently I just can&#x27;t use an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I had this same model previously and used for about 3 years until the battery gave out on it. It is a very good razor.</li>
            <li> Razor works very well.  I only have used it as an electric razor on a dry face.  Have used it for a month now and it gives a close shave.  Lasts for 8-10 shaves per charge which is better than other shavers I have had in the past (Panasonics and Brauns).  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> What a great product.  Light weight, shaves VERY close, clean-up is easy (a squirt of soft soap and water, rinse, run it on \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; mode, DONE!)  I was a long-term Braun user, but am glad I switched to the Panasonic. My last Braun lasted well over 10 years and felt much heavier/solid than the Panasonic.  Question now is if the Panasonic will hold up as long. Only time will tell, but seeing as I&#x27;ve had wonderful experiences with other Panasonic/Technics products over the years (TV&#x27;s, stereos, etc), I&#x27;m pretty confident the company put the same quality work into their shavers.      Five stars. BUY IT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for over 25years. I&#x27;ve tried every brand and type. I don&#x27;t expect a \\&quot;blade shave\\&quot; when I use one  but it&#x27;s quicker. When my old shaver broke I read the user comments here on Amazon and I ordered the Panasonic ES8103S. I&#x27;ve been using it for some 2 weeks now and I am greatly impressed. It provides the best electric shaver shave I&#x27;ve ever had and I&#x27;m left with no razor burn. It&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s quick. It&#x27;s closer to a blade shave than I&#x27;ve ever had. And the shaver itself is a quality piece of equipment. I&#x27;m impressed. I can recommend it without reservation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Panasonic for about 3 weeks.  This is the first foil shaver I&#x27;ve tried, having used nothing but rotary types before.  I was pleasantly surprised at how close the shave was and how little pressure is required.  I really like the waterproof design--makes clean-up a snap.  Battery life could be improved, but at least it lets you know when you&#x27;re getting low on battery thru the battery indicator.  I wholeheartedly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> Pros:  - easy to clean  - battery lasts 2 weeks  - nice battery status indicator  - the shave is as good as other razors I&#x27;ve used  - pretty good price    Cons:  - the power supply is a little noisy while charging -- it&#x27;s such a minor issue but it&#x27;s the only thing I could think of that&#x27;s wrong with this razor</li>
            <li> This is the third Panasonic shaver in 15 years.  They are just excellent.  But over time, like me, they get a little slower, a little nosier, and have to be replaced.  Superior product with replacement blades and head when needed.</li>
            <li> This item was purchased for a nineties-something man who knows shaving.  He uses the shaver everyday and just loves it.  We haven&#x27;t heard any complaints from his wife either!</li>
            <li> When I first got this razor, I thought it was decent quality.  This was the first electric razor I&#x27;ve ever had and it did an decently smooth shave. However, I had to go over the same spot numerous times in order for it to be smooth and it was hard to get the hairs on the neck.  Up until this point I was content with my purchase, however, that all changed. The shaver stopped working after less than a dozen shaves!  All I did was use it in the shower and now there&#x27;s water inside the display.  The reason I say I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever buy a Panasonic again is because this is the third Panasonic product I&#x27;ve had issues with.  Back when I was in HS I bought a Panasonic Deck for my car, after about 6 mo&#x27;s the digital display stopped working.  About 2 years ago I bought a Home entertainment surround sound system and after a couple months the dvd player started acting up.  So far I&#x27;m unimpressed with the quality of Panasonic products.</li>
            <li> It is very quite compared to the traditional electric and you get a close shave. It is also very sharp and I feel that this can mow down any beard. I would have you consider stepping up to the next step for a few bucks to get one extra shaving foil. I took one star off due to it not coming with any travel case, instead it comes with a useless thin cloth pouch.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver specifically for head shaving in the shower and I&#x27;m very pleased with it for that application. For those times when I want to head shave without using a Mach 3 blade, I really like this razor. The wet shaving with regular shaving creme is easy on the skin and close enough. Battery life is quite good although it does self-discharge at about 10%/week although this might improve as the battery is used more. The wet/dry feature is fabulous and I wouldn&#x27;t buy a shaver that couldn&#x27;t be used in the shower, it&#x27;s just too convenient. I did try a wet face shave but found this shaver, like all other electrics I have tried, just can&#x27;t compare to a blade. But for head shaving the skin is tighter and the curves are less so the shave is outstanding if hair is no more than 3 days long to begin. If the shave proves reliable I&#x27;ll be very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best you can buy, but of all the electric shavers I&#x27;ve ever owned and used (Braun, Norelco, Remington), this is the one to get. I have VERY sensitive skin and unfortunately cannot shave with a blade without breaking out into horrible, bloody, bumpy razor rash. I tried avery type of foam, gel and soap on the market. Boars hair brushes. Traditional safety razors, hi-tech multi blade guillotines. The results were always the same, and no matter how many days I allowed for my skin to become accustomed. Even on my wedding day, a professional barber left rash, and that man was a master.  I tried a Norelco rotary-style shaver first, which left a lot of stubble and pulled the whiskers. I ended up using it for a while anyway because I just didn&#x27;t know any better.   After a few years I traded up for a Braun, which was my first foil shaver. It did a much better job on my tough facial hair, but left razor burn on my neck, to the point I could only shave every other day at most. I tried several kinds of pre-shave balms, oils and creams to help. Limited success there.  Finally, I stepped up to the Panasonic. It&#x27;s a wet/dry shaver, so I started off using it in the shower with a shaving foam. Perfect. I eventually found that I could shave totally dry with little to no irritation and get almost as close a shave. Slap on some moisturizer and you&#x27;re good to go.  I&#x27;ve had this particular one for about three years now, after dropping my original in the shower and breaking it. It&#x27;s actually pretty tough, aside from that one incident. The screen has held up perfectly (the Braun screen would lose bits here and there, causing the shaver block to grab and chop little bits of skin). So has the battery. I still only need to charge it once a week. The digital battery-life meter has been a lifesaver, too. It&#x27;s easy to clean (I don&#x27;t have the cleaning base) with just a little hand soap.  The ONLY gripes I have... you can&#x27;t use it while it&#x27;s plugged in and charging. That said,this thing charges up extremely quickly. I can easily get a usable charge, from totally dead, in the amount of time it takes me to shower. The trimmer is also pretty useless. It requires an esoteric level of technique for anything more arduous than a couple of stray hairs. Instead I just bought a cheapo trimmer that comes with several attachments for different jobs.   Highly recommended. I can only pray Panasonic continues making shavers of this quality! Customer for life.</li>
            <li> I received this razor today and just had my first shave. The high ratings led me to purchase this, more expensive razor over, say, the $30 ones I normally buy. Because of this price difference and rave reviews, I expected something special -- or at least something better than a $30 electric razor.    I am extremely disappointed with this product. My first shave was terrible. Not only did it not get anywhere near all my facial hair (which was short, hadn&#x27;t shaved in 2 days prior), but it cut me up more than any razor I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m absolutely baffled. All the reviews promised a painless, smooth shave that is about as close as it gets for an electric razor. I found that today, I am glad I didn&#x27;t throw out my $30 one, because in the end, it was the one that didn&#x27;t act like a dysfunctional lawnmower.     I plan on returning the product if possible. $80 is far too much to pay for this product.</li>
            <li> I had to upgrade from a 4 year old Norelco since the replacement blades cost more than the razor was worth. So I researched for a few weeks and decided on this Panasonic.  I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and it has done a great job on my thick stubble. It charges very fast and is easy to clean.      The only drawback is if I let my beard grow for over 3 or 4 days it is very hard to trim it down with the beard trimmer to cut with the regular foil blades. So I do need to shave more often but it gets a much closer shave than my previous electric.    Works great wet or dry.</li>
            <li> bought this on 12/21/2009 and replaced the blades/foil just once. I shave 5 times a week, at least. This system still works as new.</li>
            <li> I had a remington rotary and a norelco rotary before that. The norelco had battery failure and the remington had a cleaning system that also charged the unit. I liked the cleaning system but a short time after buying the razor the stores stopped selling the cleaning solution. I mixed my own cleaning solution for some time until I saw this razor that you clean by throwing some liquid soap on it and rinsing it off. Sold. Not only is the maintenance effortless it gives a fantastic shave with no drag. The rotary razors did not do good in the areas under the nose. This one gets in close and fits nice in the hand. The rotary felt more like a power tool in your hand.  All in all I would say that I am pleased with this product and if the longevity is good I will buy another when the time comes.</li>
            <li> Bought razor to replace an older Remington.  Shaves MUCH closer and faster than previous razor and seems to hold a charge pretty well.  Pop-up trimmer works well, also, which is rarely the case for the pop-up trimmers.  Works well with shaving around a full beard and mustache.  Not big and clunky like a number of the other \\&quot;full-featured\\&quot; electric razors on the market.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  This is a nice shaver.  I now own two, one for the home and one for the car.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001DNE3KQ Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Rechargeable Linear Pivot Action Shaving System, Silver]] Best shaver I have ever used. I have had many different brands of shavers over the years and none can compare with this shaver. After a shave my face feels like I used a blade razer. I would recomment this shaver to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric shavers for over 30 years now and have tried many of them. Never tried this type of head before but after some good reviews and the discounted price I thought I would give it a try. Now I can see why its discounted. It takes MUCH longer to get the same shave as with a rotary head. The manual says to use with an up and down motion and to pull the skin tight. With a rotary this is not required as you can move the razor in any direction to achieve quicker results. The razor is a bit noisy and cumbersome to hold compared to the shape of most rotary razor bodies. Norelco razors are much easier and timely to clean by just holding the open head under running water. To clean this razor the manual shows several steps you should take to clean including the use of a hand soap and running the razor with the sonic speed. Also you CANNOT use this razor while charging or plugged in. They do not tell you that in the description! Think twice before replacing your old rotary type for this one.</li>
            <li> The shaver is great, light and charges quickly. It would have been nice if it came with a cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> After using disposable razors for the past fifteen years, I decided to return to an electric.  I&#x27;d had enough of the scraped-raw feeling and the little droplets of blood.  The reviews pointed to the Panasonic ES8103S as a good bet, so I gave it a try -- and  I&#x27;m glad I did.  It provides a very smooth, very comfortable shave.  I can barely feel it gliding over my skin.  I&#x27;ve charged it only once, and after using it a half dozen times, the charge indicator shows 90%.   I should mention, however, that I have a very light beard, both in color and in density, and therefore don&#x27;t need a particularly close shave. I don&#x27;t know how well this shaver would perform when challenged with a heavier beard.  But if your beard is light, as is mine, this model seems perfect.</li>
            <li> and power light stopped working completely. I have only had this shaver for 5 months. It appears to me that Panasonic quality is lacking for something like this to go wrong so soon. I cannot tell how much power on the charge is remaining and I cannot tell when the shaver is fully charged making this shaver kind of useless. I always had Braun shavers and this will was my first and will be my last Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Panasonic razor for approx. 6 weeks, my previous razor was a Braun, I used it about 15 years and got very good close shaves. The Braun is definitely the better razor but the $195.00 price was the reason I decided to try the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic does not get all the wiskers and I&#x27;m always tweezering inbedded whiskers, I seldom had that problem with the Braun. I&#x27;m 78 years old and figured I didn&#x27;t need a razor that lasted 15 years.so I bought the Panasonic. So now my choice is shave and tweezer with the Panasonic or go back to the Braun and list it as a valueable item in my estate. So my review is &amp;#34;go for the Braun and pay the price for a better shave.</li>
            <li> This shaver is worthless. It was bought to replace a 4Blade ES-RF31which needed new blades and screen. From day one the new shaver (Panasonic ES8 103S) failed to provide a reasonably close or comfortable shave. After 4 weeks of regular use there was no improvement in these basic performance categories. Unfortunately, I&#x27;d tossed out the shipping box and return instructions and it&#x27;s now outside the 30 day return window. So it will be kept for &#x27;emergency&#x27; use only, (whatever that means).&lt;br /&gt;Tuffbeard</li>
            <li> I checked reviews a lot before buying this. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m writing one, too. I&#x27;ve had all major brands in the past. My Norelco was so-so, my Braun was better, my Remington was a joke. I think rotary types will never be as good as straight heads, as a technical matter. I was sold on the linear motor for this - I knew speed of the blade matters. I can say that even more surely now. It is a critical reason why this is the best. Yes, the blades are very sharp, and well designed. Love the battery power sensor, and wash/charge reminders. By the way, for a 4 minute shave, you&#x27;ll get around 10-11 good shaves. I&#x27;m amazed at how long this runs for such a high speed motor. It also doesn&#x27;t slow down progressively as the battery runs lower. I&#x27;ve used this for 6 months, and if I lost this one, I&#x27;d buy another just like it. I got mine for about $65.  Not sure what could improve this. Get it.</li>
            <li> The shaver is great. It just want work with the cord plugged up.</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for about a month, and I use it dry.  So far, I&#x27;ve been very impressed with the close shave that it provides.  I had a Braun prior to this and was happy with it as well, but after years of use, it was time to retire it.  I got a Norelco rotary as a gift, and found that it pulled terribly.  For the money, I think it would be hard to beat this Panasonic shaver.  I would have liked to see a nicer travel case instead of the cheap cloth bag, but as for the shaver itsef, I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.  I don&#x27;t see a reason to spend more money, and I would recommend this Panasonic shaver to a friend.</li>
            <li> After using various Phillips/Norelco rotary shavers for most of my adult life, I finally got tired of replacing a perfectly good shaver because the battery died. It really annoyed me that the battery is not user-replaceable. In fact, they make it such a hassle to send \\&quot;back to the factory\\&quot; for a 5 minute, $50 replacement fee, that takes two weeks even if I drop it off at the service center itself (obviously they think their customers are stupid, and will buy a replacement instead of going two weeks without a shave). I have purchased replacement batteries on Amazon and replaced them myself, but these cheap China replacement batteries don&#x27;t last very long and are easily dislodged with regular use.    So, on a leap-of-faith and excellent Amazon Reviews, I purchased a Panasonic ES8103S from Amazon and couldn&#x27;t be happier. It provides a close, clean shave, at least for my normal beard. I use it in dry mode, but you can use it wet if you prefer. I particularly like the easy cleaning process - a few drops of liquid soap on the screen and blades , running at a higher-than-normal, cleaning vibration mode, cleans the screen and blades within a couple minutes - much easier and more effective than manually cleaning Norelco shavers.     In short. I love this shaver, and will NOT go back to Phillips/Norelco.....ever!</li>
            <li> I guess I should start by describing the kind of facial hair that I have.  I tend to grow facial hair slowly and it&#x27;s the wiry, stiff, Asian kind of facial hair.  I bought this Panasonic shaver because it&#x27;s difficult for me to shave until the hair grows to a certain length.  The reviews were saying that it gives a pretty close shave and I was hoping that an electric razor would be a lot faster and easier with fewer nicks.  After using this shaver for several weeks, I&#x27;m finding that it doesn&#x27;t work well for me at all.  In order to get a close shave, I have to press pretty hard, and in doing so, I&#x27;ve managed to make myself bleed on several occasions!  Instead of nicks though, they&#x27;re more like tiny scrapes.  Pressing harder also leaves me with pretty bad razor burn.  The Panasonic also has the incredible ability to miss single hairs and leave very uneven, patchy shaves that I can&#x27;t really fix because the hairs are too short.  I&#x27;ve had to go back with my Mach 3 several times to get patches that this razor can&#x27;t seem to cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, this razor doesn&#x27;t work well for me.  If you have a similar type of facial hair, you might have problems with it too.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best electric razor I ever owned.  It gives a great shave and it is extremley easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about 6 months and I&#x27;ve been very pleased.  It&#x27;s fairly quiet and has a nice balance.  I&#x27;ve never used it in the shower so I can&#x27;t speak to that.  I holds a charge for a LONG time.  The cleaning process is easy to perform.  I&#x27;m happy with the shave.  I should note it&#x27;s not a miracle worker.  I have one area that no shaver has been able to cut close and this is no different.  That&#x27;s the one difference between the electric and a manual blade.  The blade is small enough to get into that area, but the electric is more convenient (especially when traveling).  I would recommend this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE Apr 25, 2014 -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve now used this same shaver for 3 1/2 years.  It still shaves as well as when it was new.  The most remarkable thing is the battery still holds enough juice to go more than a week between charges - easily.  I clean it when it says it&#x27;s time to clean and I charge it when it says it needs a charge.  Simple as that.  Love my Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor from last 1year and it works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Smooth clean shave and charge holds for couple of weeks. I have tried 3-4 different brands earlier but this specific model is awesome.</li>
            <li> It is not as good as it advertised. The shave is not as clean as others and is rough to use.</li>
            <li> As rechargable electric razors go, this is the best one I have used in the past 5 years.  I bought an inexpensive Remington MS2 390 several years ago.  It is only adequate and very loud.  Two years ago I bought a Braun for around $80 but it does not shave very close and the charge does not last very long.  So I decided to give this Panasonic ES 810S a try and it does shave closer and lasts for 5-7 shaves.  It is comfortable to use and is advertised to use with water and shaving cream. I did that once and it was a close shave.  However, I prefer to use it dry with a pre-shave lotion.  I did not want to buy the liquid cleaning base which would need a constant refilling expense since I could just rinse this one off.  It appears to be the same razor as the next one up which has the liquid base unit.  For me, nothing shaves as close as a blade with shaving cream but an electric razor doesn&#x27;t leave my face with all kinds of nicks.  So far I am very pleased with the Panasonic ES 8103.  Amazon&#x27;s delivery was very prompt also.  Guy     April, 2011</li>
            <li> This model is a best buy in my book.  The initial charge took ~1 hour.  The initial shave took much less time, but the results were just as impressive.  I have a fairly heavy beard but the Panasonic doesn&#x27;t miss a beat or a hair.  It holds a charge for over a week of shaves and cleans easy under running water.  I have not used it in the wet yet, so no comment on that area.  The trimmer seems better than most that I have used on shavers as well as it cuts even and doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;chew\\&quot; through like a lot of shaver trimmers.</li>
            <li> This is an okay razor, but not as good as I&#x27;d hoped.  It says it gets 14 shaves to a full charge-don&#x27;t believe it!  My husband has done very well to get 3 or 4 before it poops out.  Had he not been hospitalized for two weeks after we got it and then bed-ridden, I would have returned it and gotten a Norelco.  I&#x27;d read the reviews, which looked pretty good, but I&#x27;m disappointed.  I shave him frequently myself and although it does an ok job, it certainly isn&#x27;t as good as it sounds.  I do like the ease of cleaning it, and the ability to use it wet or dry, but I think other than the ease of using an electric razor on him in bed, I believe I&#x27;d prefer using a disposable razor for closeness and comfor.</li>
            <li> Close shave, especially when used with shaving gel.  This is the second Panasonic shaver I&#x27;ve purchased (first was several years ago -- they last a long time) and this brand beats others I&#x27;ve tried by a large margin.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Panasonic ES8103S one month ago and I like it.  I have only used it in the \\&quot;dry\\&quot; mode.  The oscillation frequency of the linear drive is significantly faster than that of the Remington MS3 3700 I used previously.  This allows the razor to make more cuts per unit time for better coverage.  In my estimation the tilt head may be an asset, but I&#x27;m not certain it&#x27;s a necessity.  If desired, the head can be locked to omit the tilt function.  The Panasonic advertisement indicates it&#x27;s a \\&quot;one pass\\&quot; shave.  That may be true for some beards, but mine requires more than one pass.  If I redesigned the razor, I would consider having three, full width blades and screens for greater coverage and fewer required passes.  The charge indicator and alerts for cleaning and recharging are nice features.  All in all, it&#x27;s a very good and well constructed razor.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor about a month ago.  It had gotten good reviews and was on sale so I thought I would give it a try.  I have a pretty thick beard especially around the chin area.  Although it takes multiple passes this razor cuts pretty good.  I&#x27;m happy with the product except that the display appears to have gotten some moisture in it and stopped working (no longer shows charge percentage).  I just sent it back to panasonic for an exchange.  Hopefully this isn&#x27;t a recurring problem with this model.</li>
            <li> This shaver gives a great shave, no question.  Its why I gave it 3 stars.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now. I have owned several Panasonic wet/dry shavers and I would not buy another brand. The issues I have with this model are:     1. Its not much better than my previous model which does not have \\&quot;nano\\&quot; technology.   2. After cleaning the blades and replacing the foil, the foil many times does not \\&quot;catch\\&quot; and will fall off the next time I shave.  Somewhat dangerous and definitely frustrating.    3. The little itty bitty trimmer sucks.    4. After less than a year the battery goes dead at about 30% capacity.    5. Took it with me to the Virgin Islands. The battery capacity LED stopped working, then showed up, then disappeared again for good (I think).    I like the Panasonic and will buy another but I hope the build quality improves with the newer models.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8103S is a fantastic electric shaver. I bought this to replace an older Panasonic shaver, which mysteriously died on a trip to Europe. This model shaves even better than the last, and I am very satisfied with it. I have only used it dry, however I suspect that a wet shave will be just as good, maybe better. Since I previously used a foil shaver, there was no \\&quot;adjustment period\\&quot;; it did not irritate my skin and it gives a great shave every time. No pulling, no nicking, no bleeding. The sonic cleaning mode seems to do a good job of keeping the blades clean, is easy to use, and does not take up space like some of those self cleaning models. When using it, I can tell that the blades are giving off some heat, as it is warm on my face. The only weakness in this shaver is it&#x27;s performance on the neck, probably due to the shaver&#x27;s inability to pivot front to back (it only pivots side to side, and up/down if you apply pressure). However, with a few passes and a little extra pressure, it still gets the job done. Overall, this is the best electric shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Purchased to replace a Braun.  I like this Panasonic much better.  Shaves close and recharges quickly.  Also, it is quieter than the Braun.  I recommend it as a very good shaver.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8103S Wet/Dry RechargeableElectric Shaver is a pretty good electric shaver. It does not shave as closely as a blade shaver, but it does not put slices on your face either.  I find that it takes a little more time to shave in the shower than the Fusion blade number, but it is much safer.  It is easy to clean, charges quickly and lets you know when to recharge it by the lighted percentage numbers on the handle.  It seems well made. It does not come with a charging stand. I do not need the cleaning bath that some of these models come with.  All in all, it is a good compromise betwween a blade and an electric shaver.  It came promptly after the first attempt to deliver it came to naught because some nit-wit would not deliver it to the apartment house where I live in Anchorage, Alaska. I never did figure that one out.    RMT</li>
            <li> I had grown a beard for many years and had only used a blade the times that I had shaved.  In the last couple of years, I have started shaving my head and my face.  Recently, I have had to go on a blood thinner and have been worried about cutting myself. I did extensive searching on the internet for electric razors, liked the reviews of this product and bought it.  I have not been disappointed.  It is great, giving me a really close shave and no cuts.  I have been using it dry on both my face and head and would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Best bang for your buck when it comes to electric razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using various non-electric razors for the past 45 years or so and would be happy to continue to do so IF the razor manufacturers would stop the \\&quot;number of blade wars\\&quot; and get the price for replacement blades back to a level that makes sense.  My current blade razor is a Gillette Mach 3 and new blades for it have continued to increase in price to the point where I am not willing to purchase them.  I also expect, if history is a guide, that Gillette will discontinue that razor and blades and so force its customers to move up in price to whatever the next version of their razor happens to be with a concurrent increase in price for blades.  I started shopping for a replacement and decided on the Panasonic ES8103S after reading many reviews and have been relatively happy with it.  While it has a pivot system for myself I have found that it works better if I lock it in place.  My beard is mixed between very light and very heavy and the Panasonic does fairly well in all areas.  Getting it as close as I would like under the jaw line is a challenge but it can be done.  I have not tried it in the \\&quot;dry\\&quot; style yet but find that it works well with a minimum of shaving cream.  It does not shave as closely as a bladed razor but it is pretty good.  If you are tired of paying, what seems to me to be an endlessly increasing cost, for razor blades you should give this a try.  The Amazon price was the best I found and at the time I purchased the Panasonic there was a $10 rebate being offered so the final price was pretty reasonable.</li>
            <li> Yes, I would recommend this product.    I considered going back to electric shaver after years of using a razor blade.   I wanted to do away with always buying razors and shaving cream. I used the pro glide, which works VERY well, but  the blades are too much money. They have proced the replacement blades too high.      Electric shavers have improved a lot from last time I purchased a Remmington/Norleco. My number one complaint why I went back to razors: Cleaning the unit. What a pain!     Likes:  Easy to clean - this is one the number one reason why I purchased this unit.   Easy to handle  Keeps a very long charge  Blades are very sharp  Can use with or without shaving cream. I do not use in the shower.  LCD read out    Dislikes:  No so far</li>
            <li> does well for what I needed it for.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to and isn&#x27;t very expensive.  The charge level indicator helps too.  The buzzing sound is a little annoying though.</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a rotary shaver, but read some very marginal reviews of them, including Norelco&#x27;s latest product.  So I decided to give this a try, mainly because of the wet-dry feature.  It has not disappointed me at all.  First, the electronics are outstanding on two counts:  1) it fully charges in less than an hour, and 2) it continues to run at full speed even as the battery discharges--the motor has the same output at 10% battery reserve that it does at 90% battery reserve.  This is in stark contrast to my old Remington, which slowed down as the battery discharged, making shaving more and more uncomfortable each day.  Second, the shave is exceptionally comfortable.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the design of the foil and blades, or if it&#x27;s simply that the motor continues to run at full speed, but it&#x27;s comfortable enough that I end up with a very close shave because I don&#x27;t mind going over an area until it&#x27;s cut.  And third, I love the cleaning feature.  Shaving in the shower doesn&#x27;t necessarily give me a closer shave, but it sure does keep the shaver clean, so I can shave after I&#x27;m dressed and I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting \\&quot;beard dust\\&quot; all over my shirt.  This is a great product--a very good shave at a very reasonable price.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this razor! Great buy</li>
            <li> I have been through a number of electric shavers, and read these reviews carefully before pulling the trigger. After a couple of weeks of using the Panasonic ES8103S, I figured I should chime in here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realized this shaver was different when I first turned it ON. It generates a noticeably higher pitched sound than any electric shaver I&#x27;ve used. This is likely due to the high-speed, 13,000 RPM motor. True to many of the other reviews here, the quality of the shave is excellent, and really does rival the closeness of a blade. Something else worth mentioning: I find I it takes much less time to complete my shave these days - again, this is likely due to the high-speed motor. The rapidity of the shave is especially noticeable after a couple days of growth. My old shaver would take three or four passes to \\&quot;gitterdone.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; construction mentioned by a few reviewers, this shaver is indeed light-weight. I guess time will tell whether it holds up. However, I will say that my last shaver - an 9 month-old Braun that cost me $30 more than this Panasonic model - felt more solid, but literally fell apart in my hands after very little, light-duty use. So much for the \\&quot;solid feel.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, since this shaver is brand new, I can only base my opinion about construction quality on previous experience with Panasonic models. The first one I purchased (probably five years ago) lasted for nearly two years and only broke because I dropped it. I SHOULD have purchased another Panasonic, but I needed a replacement quickly and could not find anything locally. My local grocery store carries a ton of Braun models. Against my better judgment I purchased several, each time going up in price after the previous one stopped working. None of them lasted much more than a year. One of these was a travel shaver purchased for my trips to the athletic club. The foil tore after a few months. I tried to purchase a replacement foil, only to discover Braun had discontinued the shaver and all related spare parts. Nice. It is now safe to say that I have purchased my LAST Braun shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of travel shavers, I also own a Panasonic ES3833 wet/dry, battery-operated travel shaver. It was only $18, and included a nice, hard-shell carrying case. One big bonus: spare parts are available! I have been using it at the gym for about 6 months and have been VERY impressed. My positive experience with this shaver was the driving force behind my decision to purchase another Panasonic model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only disappointment with this purchase is that the shaver comes with a soft cloth travel bag, rather than a hard case. So, if you are traveling, make sure you pack the shaver away safely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I think the ES8103S is a great buy. So far, I am pleased with the performance of this shaver and, based upon my experience with other Panasonic models, I am not concerned at all about the light-weight construction.ll related spare parts.

            <li> UPDATE 1/9/2017&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the razor for nearly 6 years now and the battery is kaput.  I can get one, maybe two shaves and then it needs to be charged.  It looks like replacement batteries are available for less than $20 but you&#x27;ll need to be handy with a soldering iron.  I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the trouble considering that it&#x27;s a really noisy shaver and it makes quite a mess, dumping whiskers all over the counter and my shirt.  I also don&#x27;t like that it can&#x27;t be used while it&#x27;s plugged into the wall.&lt;br /&gt;------------------------&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Panasonic ES8103S and the Norelco 1150x at the same time and this review is a comparison of these 2 shavers side-by-side.  I used both shavers for 3 weeks, shaving one side of my face with the Panasonic and the other side of my face with the Norelco.  I didn&#x27;t switch sides during the test to allow time to adapt to each shaver.  Both of these shavers rated nearly the same amongst other Amazon reviewers and were the top-2 rated shavers under $100.  I evaluated both shavers on a number of criteria:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Shaving Performance:  I found that both shavers did a relatively good job overall.  However, the Panasonic performed slightly better on the flat cheek areas whereas the Norelco did slightly better on the curved areas around the jaw bone and neck.  I found that the shavers required different shaving techniques.  The Panasonic, being a foil shaver, required an up-and-down or side-to-side motion whereas the Norelco, being a rotary shaver, required a circular motion.  No matter how I shaved with the Norelco I could not get quite as close as the Panasonic.  After some time I did find a technique with the Panasonic that allowed me to shave my neck and jaw bone area as close as the Norelco.  I tried shaving both wet &amp; dry and found no difference. I almost always shave dry and I found the Norelco didn&#x27;t move as smoothly across the skin as the Panasonic.  Overall, I give the edge to Panasonic for a better overall shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Return Guarantee:  The Panasonic has a 30-day return policy, the Norelco is 45 days.  I actually purchased the shavers from Target and they offer a 90-day return policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Warranty:  The Panasonic has a 1 yr warranty, Norelco is 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Cutter Replacement:  both shavers recommend replacing the cutters at specific intervals.  Panasonic recommends replacing the foil every year ($24) and the blade every 2 years ($17).  Norelco has only one replaceable part which they recommend you replace every year ($39).  If you look at the cost over 3 years, the Panasonic would cost $65 whereas the Norelco would cost $117 which exceeds the original cost of the shaver ($100).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Charging:  The Panasonic has an A/C adapter that can be plugged directly into the shaver and the shaver can be used with the cord attached.  The Norelco can only be charged in the included charging cradle.  If the battery in the Norelco goes dead you&#x27;ll need to recharge it before you can use it.  Also, the Panasonic has a digital LCD battery gauge whereas the Norelco simply uses LEDs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Cleaning:  Both shavers can be rinsed under water for simple cleaning.  I found the Norelco shaving head somewhat difficult to remove whereas the Panasonic foil was very easy to remove/replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Price:  Both shavers sell for under $100.  Best price I found on the Panasonic was $80 @ Target.  I saw the Norelco for $90 @ WalMart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Other:  The Panasonic has a built-in trimmer, the Norelco requires that you remove the shaving head and pop on the trimmer head.  The Panasonic includes a carrying case, the Norelco does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, the Panasonic rated higher than the Norelco in all areas with the exception of the warranty.  My only real complaint with the Panasonic would be the noise.  It is much louder than the Norelco but not so much so that I would return it.  Based on my experience, I will be returning the Norelco and keepingthe Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/21/13: Follow-Up&lt;br /&gt;------------------&lt;br /&gt;Hard to believe I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for over 2 years already.  I&#x27;ve found some issues with the shaver that I wanted to append to my original review:&lt;br /&gt;  -- The battery life indicator is difficult to see unless you&#x27;re in a dark room and there is no audible alarm that indicates that the battery is getting low.  The battery will go dead without warning and, since the shaver can&#x27;t be used when the cord is attached, you&#x27;re stuck waiting for the charge to complete until you can continue shaving.&lt;br /&gt;  -- I commented on the noise in my original review.  Maybe this is an issue with all foil shavers but I have found the Panasonic annoyingly loud.&lt;br /&gt;  -- Again, maybe an issue with all foil shavers, but I have found that instead of catching the shaved off whiskers they are ending up all over the counter and my shirt.  I don&#x27;t recall this being as much of an issue when the shaver was new.  I haven&#x27;t yet replaced the foil or the blade so perhaps that&#x27;s the problem.&lt;br /&gt;  -- The battery seems to be losing some steam.  I&#x27;m only able to get about 3 full shaves out of the unit before it needs to be recharged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/12/13: Follow-Up&lt;br /&gt;------------------&lt;br /&gt;I just replaced both the foil and the blades and it really made a difference.  I&#x27;m getting a closer shave and I didn&#x27;t see a bunch of shavings on my shirt when I was done.the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/21/13: Follow-Up&lt;br /&gt;------------------&lt;br /&gt;Hard to believe I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for over 2 years already.

            <li> Simply put, this razor is the best I have owned. Most of the reviews will say the same thing, and there&#x27;s nothing more I can say that hasn&#x27;t been said.  I will say that even consumer reports lists this razor as one of the best and for the price, it simply can&#x27;t be beat.  I have tried it, like the others, and I am sold.  I only shave about 2-3 times a week and so after growth of a few days it cut my hair above satisfaction.  There&#x27;s still a few places on my face where I have to make a few passes but those are for the more thick whiskers.  All in all, it will take less time and clean up is a breeze.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been used this for 3 weeks and very happy with the product. If it can have less noise, that will be even better.  Shave clean, easy to clean. 2 hours to fully charged and can be used for 10 days (for me). For this price, nothing I&#x27;d complain about it.</li>
            <li> I have a Braun 6520 that needed new batteries so as an interim shaver I purchased the Panasonic ES8103S from Amazon.  When both shavers were operable I wanted to know which provided a closer shave.  To do this I first shaved with one of the shavers then immediately followed this with a second shave with the other one.  If the first shaver gave a better shave then I would not hear hair being cut with the second shaver.  The next day I reversed the order of the shavers.  In easy-to-shave areas there was no clipping sound during the second shave in both orders; so neither shaver had a closer cut in these areas.  However, in both orders I heard hairs being cut but in different difficult-to-shave places on my face.  The Braun did better in tight concave areas and the Panasonic better in tight convex areas.  From this I conclude that both shavers shave better in certain situations and this was due to the shape of the cutting head as applied to a certain shape on my face.  The amount of hair clipping during the second shave was the same in both orders; so there is no discernible advantage of one over the other.  Both provided an equally smooth shave with the same level of tugging and skin irritation which was very little.  The higher vibration rate of the Panasonic did not seem to make any difference relative to the Braun 6520 vibration rate.  All of these tests were on a dry face not wet.  I did try testing the Panasonic wet and the Braun dry.  I reran the tests but the results were the same as my previous all-dry tests.  There was no advantage shaving wet with the Panasonic.  In my opinion both provide equivalent shaves.  I rated this product 4 stars rather than 5 since I am still seeking a perfect shave with no difficult to cut area issues and no skin irritation; nether shaver provides this.</li>
            <li> I have coarse, wiry facial hair. This razor does not get everything, even with multiple passes from different directions. Often times, just after shaving, I will notice hairs that have not been trimmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lack of a close shave was also a disappointment. With this razor, I have to shave morning and evening to avoid having an unshaved appearance at the end of the day. With a safety razor, I could go a full day plus.</li>
            <li> Great shave.  I always wanted a wet/dry shaver and just got this.  I have been experimenting with different shave conditions and it has done very well.  Even a two day old beard did not cause any problems and I have a pretty tough beard.</li>
            <li> Just received my new shaver.  It is an updated version of an older model which I had for many years.  The new shaver gives an amazingly close shave!  It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to charge, easy to clean.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a quick shave, and this thing&#x27;s pretty quick, though it cuts so close that I manage to cut myself almost every day. Other than that and the fact that getting it completely clean is a little tough, it&#x27;s a great electric razor.</li>
            <li> i was going by CR review about the shaver because i had very bad experience with electric shavers. This shaver is probably the best i have seen and used.   Very close shave and no burning feeling at all.  I will recommend highly of this shaver.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver I have ever owed. Shaves just as well in the shower. Great buy for a great price.</li>
            <li> I own an older Panasonic which I have been using for 5 years and when it was time to replace it I looked around and saw this.  Read all the reviews and although I wasn&#x27;t convinced about the very close shave other reviewers were writing about, I ordered it anyway since I like Panasonic shavers and needed an new one.  The first time I tried it I was amazed at how close the shave is, almost as close as when using a razor.  I enjoy using this great product every day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for 2 weeks and it&#x27;s much better than the last one I had(that was great). So I really like it, shaves smooth and close.</li>
            <li> it is a excellent product the best shaver on Amazon at the best price. recommended one hundred percent, really good</li>
            <li> For the price, this is an awesome electric shaver.  Using it dry it works well. . . using it wet is even better.  I have had it for 3 years, and have yet to replace anything on it (no foils, no blades, nothing).  My only complaint is that it can not be used corded, as it only turns on when not plugged in.  If not for that it would be a 5 star shaver for me.  If mine days today, I will order the same one immediately. . . well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Having used electrical shavers my whole life I have to say this is the best one I&#x27;ve owned.  I was previously using the Panasonic ES7037 and found it to be a slow but workable razor.  The ES7037 is a different breed altogether.  The motor is much faster.  It is so fast I can hear the whiskers being clipped.  It shaves much closer, although it still takes multiple passes to make a perfect shave.  This is the first review I have made on a purchase but I felt obligated to share the fact that this is a 1st class razor.</li>
            <li> Bought this product several months ago. I was looking for a good razor with plenty of power and this one performs pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Easy to clean, very quick to charge (and so far it holds the charge pretty well)&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Takes some getting used to, not exactly contoured to a face, unit takes up lots of room in a dopp kit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit- Razor had a decent long life (&gt;2 yrs) and took replacement blades just fine, but it stopped working one day. I attempted to fix the thing, unsuccessfully. Tried to buy replacement part for what was broken, and Customer service told me I&#x27;d have to pay $75 to send it in and have it looked at! I mean Heck-- for that price I&#x27;d probably just be better off buying a new one with fresh blades!&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll stick to manual razors for now.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I have used electric shavers for over 25 years. I did a lot of research before ordering this shaver. I really like the close shave I get with this shaver. It gave me the closest shave I have had. As close to a blade as you can get. And it is fast. But after just 2 and 1/2 months of use, the foil has a hole in it. I called Panasonic and they do not cover the foil and blade at all. They are consumer consumable items and so are not covered. That is all, no recourse. I take care of my shavers but this is the shortest that the foil lasted. My foils and blades last well into 2 years and more. This shavers blades are so thin, they don&#x27;t last as long. Expensive shaver and expensive blades. I would expect the foil to last at least 6 months to 1 year. Very poor quality. And you guessed it. The krap is made in China, not Japan. It says it right on the box. Would not recommend buying this shaver unless you expect to pay $30 for a foil or $50 for foil and blades every few months.</li>
            <li> I have had several other electric razors none of which I found very satisfactory.  I was surprised and very pleased with the performance of this one.  It was quieter than the others and much faster and best of all gave a very good close shave.  Not sure that I&#x27;m going to get the number of shaves per charge that they said  but it does charge quickly.  I&#x27;ve cleaned it  once but did not wait until the little indicator said to do so.  It did a pretty good job, probably a bit of a learning curve on my part.  Overall I have been very pleased and recommended it to my son-in-law.</li>
            <li> I  used to cut myself a lot with razers when shaving, this is really nice!! Great shave!! And no cuts! I wouldn&#x27;t want to go back to the old way for anything, except maybe permanent hair removal!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband based on all the positive reviews. . . so far so good.  He thinks it works better than Norelco which was the shaver he had previous to this before it broke on him.  My husband indicated that there is no pulling of the skin which helps for a more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver after my Braun 54xx failed to hold a charge, and the power switch almost didn&#x27;t work anymore.  Having read several reviews and finding it at Amazon for the best price, I must say this is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  It shaves fast, clean, and holds a charge much longer than my old Braun, plus it only takes about an hour to fully charge.  Its ergonomics are excellent and it fits in hand quite nicely.  The slide switch on the side of the razor allows you to let the head pivot for flexing around your face, or it locks the head in a fixed position.  I find the unlocked position gives me the best shaves, and the wide head gives you a lot of beard real estate to mow down with one pass.  Using my old Braun was like holding a small brick and was very uncomfortable to use, even though it gave a good shave.  Noise levels are on par with my old shaver and should be fine for all but the most sensitive ears.  It can also be used in the shower, though I prefer shaving after, so I can&#x27;t comment on its wet performance.    The trimmer is excellent as well, and is easy to use.  Replacement blades are a very inexpensive $17 considering they only have to be changed every two years.  The foil is more expensive at $22, which Panasonic suggests you change every 12 months. But you can save some money and get the combo pack for $28 which includes one set of blades and one foil.  After six months of use, my Panasonic is still shaving like I just took it out of the box, so I would definitely rate this a strong 5 stars.  There are a couple of things to be aware of however.  First, don&#x27;t believe the number of uses the shaver literature suggests unless all you grow is peach fuzz for a beard.  I get a full seven shaves though, and there is no noticeable change in the rpms, even down to 20% charge.  And be aware that Panasonic does not make replacement cords, so if you lose yours packing for a trip you will have to buy a new shaver.</li>
            <li> I received a new Braun shaver this past Christmas and was very disappointed with it. I have enjoyed Braun shavers for a very long time and thought this one would be no different. I was very wrong. My son received this Panasonic shaver at the same time so I decided to try it and was very impressed. It provides everything that the Braun shaver didn&#x27;t. A fast close shave, easy to clean, and stays charged long enough to get about 7 or 8 shaves before recharging.</li>
            <li> It was the first time for me to purchase a Wet/Dry shaving system. Before I have been a loyal customer to Philips equipment. The shaving experience is not as sensational as described in the ads, I would rate it average. Timewise to get a good shave it takes longer than with Philips equipment also when used dry only. Precision is also average, not comparable with a true wet shave. I would not buy Panasonice again, I might rather stay loyal with Philips.</li>
            <li> I really tried to give this shaver a chance, but I found that it did NOT give a close shave with only two days in between shaving. Even after one day, I would still have to go back and forth on the same spot to get an even relatively close shave and by then I got razor burn.</li>
            <li> I have owned a Braun in the past and after it was stolen from my vehicle I thought all electrics just required many passes to get a so-so shave.  Panasonic&#x27;s rule !  Fast close and easy to use.  Not going to say it does as well as a blade but in 1/3 the time a very acceptable shave with very little multiple pass action.  I have a medium coarse beard and shave every 3-4 days (lazy/self employed).  Highly reccomend this unit and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This shaver enables me to trim my mustache close, smooth &amp; quick which wasn&#x27;t possible with my previous Norelco. Also, &amp; again,unlike the Norelco, I can get a smooth, very close shave in the neck area with no irritation at all. It&#x27;s well made &amp; easy to use. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail a day after I ordered from Amazon. I have used Braun, Remington, and Norelco electrics. I switched to an old fashioned safety razor last year after my very expensive Braun ($140) died after one year of use (it would no longer charge or turn on). I was sick and tired of spending so much money on shaving and the stupid cleaning solution really breaks you after a while, it&#x27;s cost prohibitive. Lately, I&#x27;ve been experiencing very raw skin after shaves with my safety razor and was tired of the 10 minutes I had to spend setting up and shaving every morning so I decided to give an electric a try again. Well, I&#x27;m glad I did and I&#x27;m really glad I chose this one. The shave is fantastic. My first shave with it after a year with a safety razor is just as close after going over my skin a few times. It took no where near as long as a safety razor shave. No soap, no cleaning, no lather/re-lather/re-lather to get all of the angels covered, no mess, and no raw skin.    In comparison to my previous electrics, this one is the best I&#x27;ve had. It shaves a little closer, feels better in my hand, and moves easier over my face. I really like it and I think it&#x27;s a bonus that it&#x27;s so easy to clean without the stupid self-cleaning station. I will never buy one of those again. It hurts when you&#x27;re dropping $40 a pop for two stupid plastic containers of water and alcohol. Never again. This one cleans fine without that stuff.    I highly recommend this razor. I may just stick with panasonic from now on if this thing lasts over a year. We&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> It seems hard now days to find a good electric shaver that gives a reasonably close shave and doesn&#x27;t cost a small fortune or have a shaver head and blades that go dull after a month or two of use. I have used Braun shavers for 25+ years, but their less expensive shavers are now crap and even the expensive ones don&#x27;t usually get good reviews. So, a year ago I tried a Panasonic model ES7103 (which had received largely favorable reviews). At first, I was mildly pleased by the shave, but the blades faded quickly over the following months and it became a grinding chore to do my morning shave. After more research and the reading of umpteen reviews on several different shaver brands, I decided to give Panasonic another chance and ordered the model ES8103. You wouldn&#x27;t think one higher digit would make that much difference, but it this case it makes all the difference in the world! The ES8103 is a joy to shave with and is easily the best electric shaver I have ever owned. It slices through my stubble with ease and gives a smooth, comfortable shave every time. This is one example where paying more gets you your money&#x27;s worth! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I like that I can use shaving cream with this razor - it gives me a close shave (not as close as a blade razor) without giving me razor burn. It&#x27;s not top of the line, but it&#x27;s good enough to where I&#x27;ve bought two of these - I broke the first one by dropping a couple stories when I was moving.    If you want an electric razor under $100, this is one to consider.</li>
            <li> This is really a great razor for the price. It gives me a close shave without the cuts and nicks I had with a regular blade razor. Saves my skin, especially the neck area.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver and I&#x27;m very pleased.  Gives me a fairly close shave with no irritation. I have psoriasis and my reason for trying electric was to reduce the skin scraping caused by shaving.  So far, so good after several weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Payed for budget shipping and it arrived in 2 days. Shaver is great - seems better than the last Panasonic shaver I had that lasted 4 years. Close shave and it charges fast. Can clean it easily with liquid hand soap.</li>
            <li> This razor just really gets the job done..... wet use or dry use.  Recently bought the most expensive Braun, you guys know which one and it died in 6 months.  Was using backup razor until I got this one.  Better than the Braun hands down..... no comparison!!</li>
            <li> Shaves cleanly and closely with no irriration,  Easily cleaned by running hot tap water on cutter head. Have had no reason to replace any parts, but construction implies that it will be easily done.  Should be a long-lasting investment.</li>
            <li> It is an okay razor for the money.  I have been using it for approximately 3 weeks now. I only use it in the dry mode.  A fairly close shave with a trimmer that is okay.  It charges quickly, lasts about 6 or 7 shaves, and is easy to clean.  Not as good as my previous Remington but that razor jumped its price to $300.00.  So this is a good deal for the money.</li>
            <li> My previous foil shaver was a Braun. I would rank the Panasonic as comparable out of the box. I find that the best shaves are obtained with shaving cream after a hot shower: what a pleasure! Would recommend to others, especially those interested in a wet shave.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice reliable razor for primarily shower use.  Works well; cuts well and cleans easy.  I would buy another one in a minute.</li>
            <li> After my Panasonic was lost (to put it nicely) from my travel bag, I decided to get a Braun shaver.  I have had one in the past and was a good product.   Although it was OK, the new Panasonic was a far superior shave with more comfort, less time and easy to clean.  Are you undecided about an electric shaver ? Go with this one!</li>
            <li> After reading lots of reviews I decided to pick this up.    If you&#x27;ve been clicking around Amazon looking for a razor... stop.. this is the one you want.    Great price and really the closest shave I&#x27;ve gotten from an electric ever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used good Braun, Remington, and Norelco shavers. I have a difficult to shave beard, so I have to shave with an electric, then shave with a regular razor. No more! I shaved dry with this at first and was pleased. It gave me a great shave, the best I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric, and no razor burn. I then started shaving wet with a little shaving cream. Wow! So close! I&#x27;m amazed that this is even possible. I threw my Remington and Norelco away (Braun was already gone). I&#x27;m hooked on Panasonic now and when I have to replace this, I&#x27;ll be sure to stick with them. Thank you for making such a terrific product. I&#x27;m as happy as can be.</li>
            <li> More than surprised and a Panasonic concert. Great is all I can say. I have not had an electric shaver in more than 20 years. I have thrown my old razors away. I will never use them again. The Panasonic Pro-Curve is remarkably gentle on my heavy beard and advancing age skin conditions. 100% satisfaction, buy this one.</li>
            <li> This razor is awesome. It does a great job wet or dry and it tells you when it needs to be charged and/or cleaned. To clean it, just place it under running water for 30 seconds. Then remove the cover and the foil and let it dry. The battery is a lithium ion type which is not affected by the cold, a problem the cheaper razors that I&#x27;ve used have. Panasonic recommends that the razor be recharged at a comfortable room temperature but my bathroom is freezing in the morning. I recharge it in a warmer room of the house but it has been consistantly following through in my freezing bathroom. My shave is complete in 3-4 minutes and it&#x27;s got a stray hair cutter in-between the two stubble foils to get those long ones your other razor leaves under the base of your jawbone. It&#x27;s closer to a blade than a rotary razor but without the burning/irritation of a blade with no ingrown hairs.   I&#x27;ve never been happier.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver for my husband and he loves it. He has commented how easy it is to use, it does not tug the hair (he has thick facial hair), and it gives him a very close shave like a regular razor blade without irritating his sensitive skin. He really likes that it can be used in the shower (so do I, less hair in my sink)and that it recharges quickly. Hopefully it continues to preform at this high level for a long time. If the other reviews are right, we have nothing to worry about.</li>
            <li> I used to have an electric shaver and abandon it a few years ago. I was told by my brother and decided to try it. It worked great and saving time in the morning!!!</li>
            <li> This is the first Panasonic shaver I have owned, I was always a Remington user.  It cuts differently than the Remington but once I got use to it I have had no problems.  I think it is quieter than many I have used.  I would have probably given it 5 stars but unlike Remington it can&#x27;t be used with the cord attached if the battery goes dead.</li>
            <li> After trying just about every major brand of shaver I bought this Panasonic and was amazed to find how well it performed.  Used wet with shaving cream it gives me as close a shave as with a hand razor but with no nicks or cuts. I recommend it without reservation. Some have called it too noisy but it&#x27;s no more noisy than my last Braun shaver and gives far better results  at half the price</li>
            <li> I wish there were a perfect electric razor, but I don&#x27;t think there is. This is the best of the four electric razors that I have owned over the years, and the first with this type of head. While I don&#x27;t think I would ever pay near list price for it, at the recent Amazon deal, it was a bargain.  PROS:  Good shave (subject to limitations below)  Quality construction - heavy, solid feel  Almost a work of art - fine instrument  Holds a long charge  Charges quickly  Wet-compatible  Comfortable to use  CONS:  None, really, but don&#x27;t believe any claims about \\&quot;one pass shaving\\&quot;. My whiskers come in a bit faster and stiffer than average, but nothing drastic, and it takes multiple passes to do the job. I still spend a good 5 minutes shaving, about the same as the circular triple-head units I have used before, but this one shaves a bit closer.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver in more than 15 years.  The first one I had 15 years ago was very unpleasant.  But time and technology have come a long way.  This shaver is easy to use and to clean.  Just be sure to read the instructions for cleaning.    Pros:  -Close shave  -No irritation   -Charges Quickly  -Used less than 10 percent of a charge to shave.  -Feels solid and well made  Cons:  - No base/hanger, so charges sitting on the counter.  - Not sure if over charging will hurt anything.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality razor. Wet dry and charges so quickly! I&#x27;m impressed, my husband has nothing  negative to say about this - it was a great gift!!</li>
            <li> It was a gift and it seems to be working well so far! No shortcomings yet but I will try to provide updates...</li>
            <li> I have used (prefer) electrics for many years, both rotary and foil. Bought this one to replace a Remington which worked well but went through a set of blade-foils every 2 months ($30-$35).  Have had this one 4 months and the foils seem fine (manual shows 1yr on foil 2yr on blades). I mostly shave dry, works well for me. Charges fast, 5 - 6 shaves per charge. Probably the best shaver I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> Maybe electric shavers are not for me. I have always used razor blades.  I knew this wasn&#x27;t going to be the same thing. However, this is pointless. It takes about four times longer to get a shave that I would not feel comfortable leaving the house. Maybe it is my skin/hair growth but why would I spend 20 minutes with this thing, ending up with a half-assed shave, when I could get a perfect shave with a Gillette and shaving cream in 5 minutes. This does not even work on body hair, at all.</li>
            <li> Returned didn&#x27;t work very well, my husband was disappointed..</li>
            <li> First of all, I can only compare the Panasonic ES8103S to the crappy Walmart Remingtons I kept buying out of pure laziness.  My first Remington was a gift from my grandfather when I had peach-fuzz, but lasted about 20 years all total.  So that&#x27;s how I got started on Remington, who somewhere along the line decided to start making money by making their razors fail much more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Panasonic choice was made over the last year from reading reviews, but more so probably because of their heavy presence on Amazon.  [Also, Walmart stopped selling Remingtons.]  I didn&#x27;t know how to pick a brand, so after seeing one in a &#x27;Today&#x27;s Deals&#x27; offer last year just started reading reviews about them as my latest Remington began to fail [batteries] this last six months.  It had finally gotten to where my Remi battery caused me to shave once before I shower, then put it back on charge and finish after breakfast...but even that was cutting it close [no pun intended].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Obviously, probably not a real challenge, but the Panasonic I definitely like better than the Remingtons I&#x27;ve been using.  The cheap Remis were hurting my face, but the Panasonic is real smooth and makes a soothing &#x27;angry mosquito&#x27; sound.  Like any electric shaver I&#x27;v owned, it still takes a few passes...but I definitely think the Panasonic is giving me a closer shave much quicker and definitely MUCH more comfortably.  Looks like my daily shaving uses about 10% each day of the battery, so I assume about a week+ per charge.  I&#x27;ve only had mine about a month, so can&#x27;t comment on longevity.  I don&#x27;t plan to use it in the shower [wet] and likely won&#x27;t do any more than &#x27;brush&#x27; it out to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Glad I finally pulled the trigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*********&lt;br /&gt;Edit 3/14/2012 - Still love my shaver.  Remington sucks.  I actually grow SO many fewer beards now, because I don&#x27;t dread shaving.&lt;br /&gt;*********&lt;br /&gt;10/27/2012 - Still working well.  I hardly ever clean it, just shave.  Still cuts welland holds a charge for many days.  It has not made me better looking or more successful.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have mountain-man beard thickness, I&#x27;d consider my stubble average. This shaver works with short stubble, but if I wait a day or 2 (over the weekend, for example), the shaver doesn&#x27;t shave very well, and it tends to snag on beard hairs around my neck (which aint pleasant). The wet/dry feature is really great, and it&#x27;s easy to charge and clean. The features are nice, but the shaver itself could be a bit better. It&#x27;s not a top-of-the-line $300 shaver, so I understand if it&#x27;s got some flaws, but I was expecting a little more.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8103S is a great balance of useful features vs price.  This shaver gets the job done efficiently for me every day.  The % charge display is convenient for understanding when charging is needed (better than just a warning light).  Battery life is 4-5 shaves (depending on how much time you spend getting the last little bit) with little fade in battery life over time.  I recommend the shavers where the cutter head vibrates at high frequency because it makes for quicker shaving.  I bought this as a replacement for the exact same model that was stolen out of my luggage, so I have used it for about 2 years now.  Previously I owned a good Braun and a cheap Remington.  I recommend you spend the extra money to get a good shaver, but no need to get a ton of fancy features.  Daily head washers are just more stuff to fiddle with and supplies to buy.  If you need a shaver, the this Panasonic ES8103S is a good one.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor after years of being disappointed with various high priced norelco models. I had finally settled on a Remington electric razor that I have been using for nearly 10 years. My Remington did an admirable job but just can&#x27;t compare to today&#x27;s technology so I decided to get something new. After reading the reviews, I went for this model.    This Panasonic is amazing and although it&#x27;s a foil razor, it performs just fine on my neck where the foils of yesteryear failed. I love that you can see how much charge is left. I also love that it can be used wet/dry and cleaned with water. Best of all, the shave is very smooth. The closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric razor and I&#x27;ve tried many over the last 25 years.    My skin is very sensitive so I can&#x27;t use blades. I have used this razor several times and because it shaves so well I am only going over each area once and not experiencing any irritation. Hoping to get 10 years out of this razor like the one I had before. I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my son. He loves it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and what a waste. I left him with such a horrible shave. I looked a all the electric shavers that amazon had to offer and I went with this one for his birthday. Poor guy&#x27;s face was all irratated and red. I would not recommend this product for anyone. With or with out sensitive skin. My husband does not have sensitive skin and it did this to him.</li>
            <li> Did not like it. Easy to cut skin if you push a bit too hard.</li>
            <li> Last November, I had a brain cramp.  I purchased a Braun series 330 for my failed Panasonic ES8077.  That mistake cost me almost 60.00.  I finally decided to bite the bullet and purchase a new razor. I knew I had to go back to the Panasonic razor that had lasted me for so many years of service.  I fell for a sale at the local Macy&#x27;s but would not be fooled again.  I purchased this razor from Amazon and am finally again pleased with the shaves I am getting.  Even bone dry this thing is amazing.  Use it right after or in the shower you will be amazed.  If between showers you use an Electric Pre-Shave like Williams Electra shave, you will notice a shave as absolutely as close to a blade.  My face feels as smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind.  Thanks Panasonic!</li>
            <li> Befor purchasing panasonic ES8103S I had philips electro shaver old model. this panasonic model don&#x27;t have any advantages compared to my old philips shaver .  Main cons : -requiring more time for shaving , -shave quality is bad, -noisy, -battery can be used maximum 4 shaves.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this model ES8103s to be better than my old ES8066 model which was rugged, good quality, and long lasting (10 years). But, I&#x27;m disappointed by it&#x27;s wimpy and delicate body. I&#x27;m afraid it will shatter into pieces if I ever dropped it on the floor. My old model ES8066 was made in Japan. This one is made in China. And, I can see and feel the difference in quality of material and workmanship. As for the shaving, there is no difference. They all shave good in the beginning. We&#x27;ll see how it shaves after 5 years. Is it worth the money? Too early to tell.    After 5 months: It was quiet in the beginning. But after 5 months of usage it has become louder.</li>
            <li> Pleased with all my purchases</li>
            <li> I have always owned a NORELCO shaver and it was pretty good, however the PANASONIC blowes it out of the \\&quot;water\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s almost as good as asafty razor. I would highly recomend it.</li>
            <li> Been using for three months and it works very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 3 or 4 electric shavers over the years, but I would toss them after a couple of months because they just couldn&#x27;t compare to a blade.  Until now.  Hands down this is the best electric razor I have ever used.  I&#x27;ve had it now for just a week, but I can&#x27;t see anything wrong with it.  Sure, there are features that some people might like to have modified this way or that, but that is no reason to give less stars.  The bottom line is, does it shave well without causing damage to your skin, and does it do everything else it&#x27;s advertised to do?    Two thumbs up and 5 stars from this new convert.</li>
            <li> Product was just as described..very nice. Works great..nice shave..close and smoothe.!&lt;br /&gt;Would highly reccomend this product to all who want a nice middle price shaver.! Very&lt;br /&gt;satisfied.!</li>
            <li> I HAVED SHAVED WITH AN electric for 30 plus years.  I have gone through several razors with varying results as one might imagine.  Each new razor was a Norelco, some spendy and some not.  The results seemed nearly the same no matter how much I paid for each one.  I was in need of changing heads and my brother recommended this razor and I am glad that he did and that I took his advice.  This little jewel has given me the most comfortable and closest shave that I have had in decades.  I am using the Taylor of Bond Street Sandalwood shave cream and a badger brush to apply.  All I can say is WOW!  BBS!  The entire system is worthy of praise!  I have also recommended this system to a friend who also is loving the results.  I am impressed and wondering how I did not know about this razor sooner.&lt;br /&gt;I have also used this electric dry and I am very pleased with those results as well.  MY other razor has been retired permanently.</li>
            <li> I still got razor burn on my face from this product when using it on dry skin. While using this item with shaving cream I received much better results.</li>
            <li> it is amazing product, the first electric shave that gives the same result as regular shaving blades, except no irritation or bleeding</li>
            <li> Trims everything but the neck area well.  It is as good as any bargain basement Norelco shaver.  That&#x27;s about as nice as a compliment as I can give it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stand up to claims in the description.&lt;br /&gt;It irritates skin. I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Good razor which gives a very close shave. I thought the handle was a bit small but the head is large and cuts a close shave. A very good value for the money. Arrived as promised.</li>
            <li> This is perhaps the fourth Panasonic shaver I&#x27;ve owned and they keep getting better.  This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve owned.  Because of the speed of the blades, the moveable head, and the option of wet /dry shaving, it does an amazing job.  My only complaint is that it is a little noisy.     I&#x27;ve owned four Panasonic shavers because it has made more sense a number of times to buy a new shaver instead of buying replacement parts - one of my only complaints about Panasonic - the price of replacement foils and blades.</li>
            <li> I have been using a NORELCO 8894XL for 5 years. The first time I used the PANASONIC ES8103S it gave a much better shave. I used shaving cream. It cost have the price of the norelco.</li>
            <li> Gift for my dad who loves this.</li>
            <li> This shaver is much better than the Norelco it replaced.  I am getting a closer shave with less irritation in the lower neck area.  In fact, I&#x27;m getting a closer shave than I was able to get with a razor.  The shaver head design is similar to the Braun I was looking at, but at half the price.  This model doesn&#x27;t have the automatic cleaning system, but that was a plus to me, because I didn&#x27;t want to keep paying for cleaning solution and have to go through the whole cleaning ritual.  With this shaver, I just take the top off and shake out the hairs, and now and then I run it under the faucet. I find that shaving dry rather than wet gives the closest shave and requires less cleaning of the head.  Overall, this is exactly the type of shaving experience I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Braun foil shaver for years and have replaced the foil and blade about 4 times.  Unfortunately, the battery on the old razor wasn&#x27;t holding much of a charge so I thought it was time for a new razor.  This one is Awesome!!  Not only is it way lighter (Li-Ion battery), but it is so much easier to clean since you just rinse in water when it tells you to.  Very big improvement in razor technology and I haven&#x27;t even tried it as a wet shave yet!  There are cheaper models by Panasonic, but their blade motor is slower rpm than this model.  The $69 spent on this one was well worth it.</li>
            <li> this is a great shaver.</li>
            <li> I have only used this shaver a few times but it gets a super close shave. I have had about 4 shavers and this is the best one so far.</li>
            <li> Well, I used all types of razors and found that for me the best shave was Gillett Fushion. I got bored with that type of shave so I saw this Panasonic as a Gold Box Deal and giving it a shot.  So far i&#x27;m satisfied with the product. Although under the chin takes some effort to get it close and clean, overall its fast and neat.</li>
            <li> excellent product, will use again..super fast shipping</li>
            <li> I bought this razor looking for a replacement for my old Braun. The Braun is ok but I&#x27;m looking for something better. This razor had great reviews and I don&#x27;t understand how. This razor is horrible. It doesn&#x27;t shave your face, so much as it plucks it. My face started bleeding at one point. From an electric. When it wasn&#x27;t getting stuck, and painfully tearing out my facial hair, it wasn&#x27;t doing much else. They advertise single pass. Don&#x27;t tell my mustache that. Over and over and over and over. No less than 10 passes to get a smooth mustache area. The trimmer isn&#x27;t any better. It felt like my hairs were just destroying the blades. My old Braun has a similar style trimmer, and when new, it was far superior to this razor&#x27;s. And my braun, which is in desperate need of a new primary blade, still does a far better job than this razor. I had to use my Braun to finish the job because this horrible razor was just destroying my face. I suspect this is what it feels like to shave with \\&quot;a rusty butter knife\\&quot;. I don&#x27;t know how this thing has gotten so many great reviews. But I would never try another one of these. I hope amazon will let me return it used, because there&#x27;s no way it&#x27;s touching my face again, and otherwise I&#x27;ll just be out the $65.</li>
            <li> I love Panasonic Wet/Dry Shavers and have been using them for many many years. My second one, a model ES8043 died after 5 years of faithful use.  I am a bit peeved how Panasonic shavers do not last as long as, for example, Braun shavers but I love the Panasonic shave quality and the versatility of their Wet/Dry shavers. So I bought the Panasonic ES8103 on sale.    The shave is awesome. The technology is much more advanced than the previous model. I gave a rave review when I bought the ES8043 but this one is so much better. It provides an amazing, close shave, with hardly a need to go over the same area twice. We/Dry performance is excellent.  My nine year old son says my face is as smooth as his. And that is no small feat.      However, the shaver itself seems cheaper from a material perspective. There is much more cheap plastic and it is much lighter. So my guess this one will give me great shaves over and over again - but last about 5 years as well...</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best shave ever gotten from an electric razor.  Stroking down on the face after a shave was as close a shave as a blade would give.  Stroking up and a little stubble was felt, but all in all I was amazed.</li>
            <li> Panasonic makes the best wet/dry razors in the business; the ES8103S is the best of the best.</li>
            <li> Having owned several electric razors in the past I was very skeptical of this product, however it has exceeded my expectations.  I get a close shave every time and the battery maintains a consistent charge.  The percent remaining feature on the display for the battery is very helpful to determine whether or not I am going to run out of juice.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve purchased for my dad.  He likes them, so at age 85 I try to make him happy.</li>
            <li> I have owned several panasonic shavers over the years and find this one to be the best.It gives a very close shave and is easy to clean without a cleaning dock.The display for the battery is a great idea. Previously I didn&#x27;t know how long the shaver would last between charging.</li>
            <li> I have always used Remington brand electric shavers and loved them - close good, but dry shaves. When my last old Remington finally died, on the recommendation of my son-in-law plus the idea of a wet shave, I bought this unit. At 77 years old, I do not have a difficlut beard but no matter how I lathered, or how many passes I made, I could not get anyway near the close shave of my good-&#x27;ole Remingtons plus the ES8103 irritated my face. So, I bought the Twin Screen Remington F4 that stated the blades could be washed in water and I use it for wet, lathered shaves - aah! great, smooth, irritation-free shaves again and best of all the Remington was one-quarter the price of the Panasonic. You can now find my ES8103 on eBay at a VERY reasonable price.</li>
            <li> but  Norelco and save money. it works better &amp; I am sorry I went and got this Panasonic (it sucks)</li>
            <li> It took as long or longer to shave with this razor as with a blade razor, and still required using soap or shaving gel to get a somewhat close shave. When you factor in the initial cost plus the cost of replacing the blades yearly and the foil once every two years, it cost more than a blade razor, and didn&#x27;t shave nearly as well. I returned this item.</li>
            <li> Works good and the battery actually last a good long time.</li>
            <li> needed to replace my old Braun shaver which was totally worn out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a new series 3 Braun as a gift which I probably would have bought myself, since I was satisfied with my old Braun. After several weeks of use I found that the razor head consistently gave a \\&quot;razor burn feeling\\&quot;, did not cut flat laying wiskers well, seemed to lack power, and did not shave as well as my well worn out old braun. Consumer reports rated the series 7 with their highest rating but had no refference to the series 3. I decided that I needed a better razor that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some research, I decided to buy the panasonic ES8103S and try it out. The quality difference between the products was absolutely incredable. The Panasonic has more power, charges faster, shaves closer &amp; cleaner, a more comfortable head, cuts flat laying wiskers, and has a % digital battery charge indicator. I also did not get the \\&quot;razor burn feeling\\&quot; with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this shaver will wet cut, I have not tried this feature, though it  sounds interesting enough to try soon, so I cannot comment in this feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic is so superior in quality, features, and performance to the Braun series 3, that the braun should not even be considdered for purchase.</li>
            <li> Pros: I have had this shaver for a few weeks. From the first day it gave a close shave. I like the littel icon reminding to clean it, the wet feature so I can clean under running water, the swivel head and the compact charger. I get about 20 shaves per charge. The price was good. I saw no reason to purchase a shaver for more than a hundred dollars.  I previously had a Panasonic that lasted many years. The battery was starting to not hold a charge as long and so I replaced it. I expect to get at least 5 years from this new shaver&#x27;s battery. I replace screens every year and cutters every other year.  Cons: The trimmer is a little narrow. I would have preferred a full size trimmer. It doesn&#x27;t get some of the long and fine hairs on my neck, but the trimmer does get them without burn.</li>
            <li> I used Norelco shavers for years, but took the leap to Panasonic this past Christmas.  This shaver has a different feel than Norelco (foil-based) although I am beginning to think it does a better job (closer shave).  This product was on-sale for about $50 so it&#x27;s a bargain compared to some of the other shavers on the market.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this purchase. The shaver gives a very good, close shave. It is comfortable to hold, and the head pivots to contour your face. It charges very quickly, and has a small digital window on the front telling you how much charge is left. being waterproof it also cleans easily and well.</li>
            <li> Bought it in December for my husband to replace an old panasonic shaver that he had used for more than 10 years. This new one didn&#x27;t even last more than 2 months. The battery just died. His old one was made in Japan and the material was real metal. Unlike the new Cheap@$$ quality made by Panasonic Eletric Works Wanbao (Made in China). Now we are trying to figure out how to even return or repair this. He&#x27;s now just stick with Costco with their amazing return policy.</li>
            <li> My hubby just LOVES this shaver!  It works well and cuts as close as a straight razor.  Plus it&#x27;s really easy to take apart to clean.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother.  Go buy some blades.</li>
            <li> My husband has used the three blade rotary style razor for 20 years and was not getting the smooth results with the typical brands, and it took a lot of time to shave.  Switching to the horizontal blades has taken some time to get used to but he seems happier with the shave and it is a quieter unit.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting such a great shave from an electric razor. I will never go back to anything else now.</li>
            <li> I have used a succession of Remington electric shavers for years.  The last couple however, have not wanted to hold a charge after a few months.  I then went looking for different one.  Consumer reports, rating sites, Amazon, etc.  I finally decided on this one, partially because it was on sale.  It works great, and I really like that it clearly displays the amount of charge remaining.  I do think it requires a more frequent charge, as it seems to use about 10% of its power when I use it.  Of course, being retired, I don&#x27;t shave every day.  Therefore when I do use it, it gets a real workout.  My wife likes it because it is a lot less noisy that my old ones.  Just a pleasant hum.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this! AND no rash! Thank you.</li>
            <li> Update #5 05/06/2017 - Guess what folks, this shaver is still going strong after 6 years. I don&#x27;t think there is another shaver on the planet that has worked so well for me. It holds a charge like new, shaves like new and I&#x27;ll update you guys in another couple of years. You cannot go wrong with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update #4 11/10/2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is still going strong after 2 1/2 years of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update #3 3/18/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My buddy used my razor in secret after staying over. I was asleep at the time and he took my razor into the bathroom while he was getting ready for work. He stays over frequently and I told him he could try it out, but I didn&#x27;t know he did until he told me later in the day. He loves this razor so much that I bought him one as a gift. He loves it. I wouldn&#x27;t give my razor to my best friend, but I did buy him one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update #2 3/1/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 8 months I am married to this shaver. We got engaged a couple months ago after a 6 month relationship. We&#x27;ve traveled all around and it goes to work with me and waits in the car till I get off. I&#x27;ve introduced it to my co-workers when it needed a charge but it&#x27;s home with me now charging and is going to meet a friend of mine this weekend. I told a buddy about it and he wants to meet my shaver too, since he hates using a blade. I told my buddy he could use my razor, but that if he liked it, he&#x27;d have to date his own. I don&#x27;t usually share, but my buddy is a good friend. At 20% charge, it takes less than an hour to get full speed. The comfort is great and I wouldn&#x27;t cheat on this razor, because it is faithful to me. I know my buddy will like it and he doesn&#x27;t know it now, but once he shaves with it and feels like I do, I&#x27;m going to buy him one just like it as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typical razors; you know the blade things, are like a nagging wife or a boyfriend that cost you a fortune. My razor isn&#x27;t like that; we get along great. My buddy will love me for letting me share, not that I won&#x27;t expect at least something in return... Maybe I&#x27;ll have him shave me with my own razor. That would be hot.........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Now using this shaver for 6 months, I feel qualified to tell you guys that I still love this shaver. I can tell ya, if it fails for any reason, I&#x27;ll be looking for the exact same model. For some reason, it seems to hold a charge better then when I first bought it. Feels great in the hand and still does a great job. I&#x27;ve been blowing it with compressed air once in a while, still have not gotten it wet and I depend on it. You can just blow the whiskers out without compressed air and it has been a trooper. By far, the best shaver I have ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this shaver! I have used electric or battery razors/shavers now for 20 years. Started with Braun, then Norelco, Remington and now this Panasonic. Of them all, I like this one the best. It&#x27;s got a great feel to it since it is rubberized on the back and sides and feels very comfortable. It&#x27;s light, but heavy enough to feel like a quality shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let&#x27;s get to it. It does a great job and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d get a better shave from a blade. I have fairly firm facial hair, but relatively smooth skin. This baby shaves me completely to where I can&#x27;t feel any hair on my face at all. Now I&#x27;ve read that the blades get the mesh warm due to friction and I did notice that the first time, but I&#x27;m not that sensitive and haven&#x27;t noticed it since. I shave in the car so I&#x27;m preoccupied with traffic anyway (and no, it does not distract me to shave because I don&#x27;t need a mirror and don&#x27;t take my eyes off the road).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also read that it is loud. Well, that&#x27;s a relative term and how could a shaver work without causing friction and making a noise? It sounds similar to an insect as the hum you hear is a couple notes above what my 3-head Remington sounded like. It&#x27;s nothing to complain about. It is a little bit louder, but so what? Now, since you don&#x27;t know what my Remington sounded like, making that comparison is rather silly. It is the highest pitch shaver I have ever used, but I get a great shave so I really don&#x27;t care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LED display is kinda neat, but as you&#x27;ve read it only measures in increments of 10. That doesn&#x27;t bother me in the least, since none of my old shavers had numbers on them, only bars. So looking at it that way, it&#x27;s like having 10 bars. Much more than my previous shavers had. It charges fairly fast, but when you plug it in at night, who cares? Use time is probably average. On Mondays, it takes me about 6 minutes to shave. That uses 20% of the charge. I easily make it through the week after that without a charge. Someone said it would last for two weeks, but I highly doubt that. I&#x27;d say 3-4 minutes will take 10% out of it. I might shave longer than some dudes, but I want a very smooth shave. When it stops grinding, I know I&#x27;m clean and good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the head design because it swivels sideways and the individual shave heads are springy. So it follows the contour of your face, jaw and Adam&#x27;s apple. It&#x27;s quite comfortable. I had considered the 4-head design costing a bit more, but I thought that was overkill and too bulky for my taste. I stopped shaving with a traditional razor decades ago and those with 5 blades now days are in my opinion ridiculous, not to mention cost a fortune (oh wait, I did just mention it). This puppy would pay for itself in no time compared to blades. Anyhow, I thought 4 heads sounded fairly unnecessary. While I wouldn&#x27;t know how those perform, I can&#x27;t imagine them being any better than this one. I also didn&#x27;t want some bulky cleaning tray getting in my way that comes with some units. I only used the trimmer side once for this review and it seems to work fine. I don&#x27;t have a public job and I&#x27;m more of a board shorts and tee shirt type guy so I don&#x27;t get that detailed and the shaver does a good job on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it dry and it is unlikely I will ever get it wet, even to clean it. I don&#x27;t want water spots on it and my gut tells me that it wouldn&#x27;t last as long simply being made of some metal parts. It&#x27;s just not necessary for me to shave in the shower and I don&#x27;t want to take the extra time to do so. I shave in the car in the interest of time. To clean it, I just pop the top off and give it a good blow on either side. Stop making fun of me now. I have a small brush that I think came with it, or might have been from my last shaver, I don&#x27;t really remember. A toothbrush would work too, but might dull the razors over time. Like I said, blowing it does a great job, works for me anyhow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this to be much more affordable than my last 3-head rotary Remington. It sells at a well known box store for about $110, but I paid exactly half of that online (plus shipping). I did a notable amount of research on both price and reviews before I selected it and from where I bought it. If there&#x27;s a deal on something, I&#x27;m going to sniff it out. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about his shaver and believe me if there was something, I&#x27;d tell you. I like everything about it.h shaver I have ever used, but I get a great shave so I really don&#x27;t care.

            <li> This rechargeable razor works very well. It not only does a great job shaving but the rechrageable battery holds a charge for a rather long time. Seems like I get at least a dozen shaves from a single charge. The pop out side burns feature is an added plus.</li>
            <li> I needed an electric razor that would leave my face smooth and not irritate my skin. This one fits the bill. My only regret is that i did not spring for the 4 or 5 blade version. The motor is very fast and the foils get very close to the skin, leaving me with a smooth shave in a relatively short amount of time. (I usually spend about 5 minutes in the morning for a shave.)I primarily use this razor for dry shaving (although it works well with shaving foam or gel), and it has been great so far. The battery has performed exactly as advertised- and the razor runs strong at full speed until it dies; there is no \\&quot;petering-out\\&quot; period wherein the motor slows to a pinching crawl before stopping. The trimmer is well placed to handle sideburns and works nicely for shaping beards if that&#x27;s what you want. The cord on the charger is long enough to be convenient, but not be all over the counter. All in all, I am pleased with this razor and would recommend it to anyone looking for a next-step or two-up from an entry level electric razor. I am considering purchasing the 4 or 5 blade model for daily use and using this one for a luxurious travel/backup razor.</li>
            <li> I have used electric razors for almost 20 years, and believe me I have tried a lot of different razors.  I received the Panasonic ES81035 wet/dry shaver.  I charged it to 100 and received the closest shave that I have seen in years.  It works great and is so easy to clean.  This should have a 10 rating.</li>
            <li> I bought this after doing hours of research on what the best mid level electric razor was. I did not want to spend over $100 and I did not need that fancy self cleaning crap that just costs more money every time to refill. I usually wake up late and I also hate to shave with a razor everyday so I bought this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get 10-12 shaves on a charge and it takes less than 30 minutes to fully recharge. It gives me the closest shave I have ever had with an electric razor!!! It gives me a completely smooth shave the same as my Fusion 5 blade razor but without the irritation! I do sometimes have some stray hairs on my neck that it doesn&#x27;t get but I hit those with a dry razor real quick and I&#x27;m good. This is a great product and cleans easily, is compact for travel, can be used wet or dry, and a cheap alternative to the $100+ electric razors.</li>
            <li> Works great in shower</li>
            <li> This was the best electric shaver I have ever had. It cuts very close even on my thick hair. I some times shower before I shave and this cuts thru the damp hair really well. It has a nice battery, When it is charged to %100 it can go weeks without a charge.</li>
            <li> Bought for my boyfriend for xmas and he can&#x27;t really use it because it cuts his face, especially under the chin.  He is using a razor again and I am out 80 bucks.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric shavers for over 40 years and this one is the best. I have only used it shaving dry. I don&#x27;t think I am going to use it wet because of the additional steps of applying shaving cream and the messy clean up defeats the purpose of electric shavers. It&#x27;s a nice feature to have and let&#x27;s you clean the shaver under running water without fear of damaging the shaver. The motor is very fast, quiet and produces minimal vibration. The first week of shaves have been close. To achieve the closest shave requires that each area must be gone over several times in different directions. This has been true with other electric shavers I have used. It takes two to three weeks of use to become accustomed to the new shaver which may reduce the number of passes required to get a really close shave. The battery charge indicator is accurate and it even has an icon to tell when to clean the shaver. Unfortunately, it comes on sporadically. Cleaning is very easy using a little liquid hand soap and a rinse under the faucet. The shaver charges the batteries up fully in about an hour and can be charged for one shave in five minutes. The shaver can&#x27;t be used while connected to the AC house current to prevent electric shock while shaving wet or in the shower. I would hope no one would be that careless. Overall this shaver works great and appears to be well made.</li>
            <li> It produces so much noise when I use it. Bothering me!!!</li>
            <li> i have had this model for over a year now and would say that this razor does a good job and the battery holds up reasonably well. to get a reasonably close shave, shaving can take longer than desired, but it will get the job done.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric razors for 10+ years now and this is the closest shave I&#x27;ve had with an electric.  After using this razor, my face hasn&#x27;t felt so smooth in years (seriously).  Granted, this is also the first electric ive ever spent more than $60 on too.&lt;br /&gt;The reviews here are pretty accurate overall in terms of the quality of the shave you get.  you will definitely need to go over the same spot a few times if you want a super close shave (true with all electrics), but the irritation is minimal to non-existent, even with very sensitive skin like I have.  However, this razor seems to have a hard time on the neck area, which is probably attributed to its linear blade design.  In contrast, my rotary razor does the neck area much faster, but its not as clean in comparison to this razor - so its a bit of a toss up here in that regard.  I may still use my rotary just for the neck if i need a quick-and-dirty shave.  I tried both a wet(with shaving gel) and dry shave and I noticed very little difference, if anything, but the dry was slightly better for me.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I doubt that electric razors will ever get better than this in terms of closeness of shave.  The quality of the product is questionable, but only time will tell.  In the end, I just wanted a close, good electric shaver that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and that&#x27;s what I got at a reasonable price.  I was prepared to spend $150+ on the more fancy electrics, but this one had the best overall reviews, and for once, they were right.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several razors for my husband over the years.  He says this one is the very best he has ever owned!&lt;br /&gt;The ease of cleaning is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Had the more expensive ones, this one cuts as well.  Get about 10 shaves on a charge...light beard!</li>
            <li> Good razor.  It took my face almost a month to get used to it but now it cuts smooth.  Side burns trimmer works well too</li>
            <li> This Panasonic shaver is a solid piece of equipment backed by a 30 day money back guarantee if you&#x27;re not satisfied.  It&#x27;s cool looking and shaves pretty good.  The battery life lasts pretty long even though there&#x27;s only 1 lithium battery inside of it, but i guess that&#x27;s all it needs for days.  Only think i wish they included was a charging stand but i understand then i wouldn&#x27;t be as cheap of a price.     Can&#x27;t really go wrong here guys, pop up trimmer, wet/dry feature to use in shower, battery life indicator. Of course they don&#x27;t build them like they use to, but then again it&#x27;s also MUCH cheaper than the older panasonic ES model i had before the battery finally gave out. i say buy buy buy.</li>
            <li> I have owned a number of shavers over the last 20 years and this is by far the best one to date. As a dryer shaver its great, but where it really stands out from the rest is when you use it for a wet lather shave.  You get a great close shave with no razor burn or nicks. When you think of shavers, Panasonic isn&#x27;t the first name that pops into mind, but before you make your next shaver buy, I would recommend that you give them a close look.</li>
            <li> Cuts close and smooth. Its fairly quite. I would purchase it again but would like to try a 4-blade. $blades must be way better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this Panasonic electric razor a few weeks now. It replaced a Braun. This shaver is fantastic. It does fine dry, but shaving with it using shaving cream makes for a very comfortable and close shave. Best I&#x27;ve ever had. Easy clean up too. Great product. Buy one, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several brands and types of electric shavers.  This is the best one I&#x27;ve owned to date.  It&#x27;s not too expensive up front, considering the future expense of screens and cutting heads.  I&#x27;ve been wet shaving with a razor for several years, but like having an electric around.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks, in the shower, and prefer it over a razor.  I still use a shaving lotion, otherwise it drags on my skin.  The results are about as good and close as with a razor.  Granted I don&#x27;t have thick facial hair.  My only real complaints are the pop up trimmer is a bit awkward for trimming side burns and the charger has a really long straight cord.  I would like a pop out trimmer that isn&#x27;t partially obscured by the shaver&#x27;s head.  I&#x27;m also used to a coiled cord, which takes up less space in a bag and doesn&#x27;t require a twist tie to keep it tidy.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome shaver. I love how it forms to the contour of your face while cutting.&lt;br /&gt;The shave is very quick.  I can get a complete shave in about 3-1/2 to 4 min.&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic certainly has the \\&quot;cutting edge\\&quot; with this fine shaver.</li>
            <li> my father likes it. nice item for man</li>
            <li> I wanted to switch to an electric shaver from my straight-blade because it was becoming too time-consuming and annoying to buy blades all the time.  I also had a lot of problems with getting cut frequently because of a less-than-great water softener.  Overall I&#x27;m pleased with it.  It&#x27;s quick and accurate and you can use it with or without water, even in the shower if you want.  I love that you can simply pop off the top and run some water over it to clean it, or if you want to get a better clean, just drop some soap in it too.  The one downside I find is that it&#x27;s a little noisier than other shavers I&#x27;ve seen.  Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this one.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this electric razor, he has to shave twice a day with a regular 3 blade razor if we are going out after his work, but with this electric razor it&#x27;s as good if not a bit closer.  My son(age 29)was here when I gave this razor to my husband and he was so jelouse!  Thank you &amp; I will recommend it to my friends!</li>
            <li> I had a Panasonic shaver 10+ years ago and loved it. The wireless induction coil charger died when the power   glitched one day. I since had two Brauns and they were OK. After 8+ years I said time for a new new and found   this at a local store and love it. Very comfortable and a nice clean shave. I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know  if the blade will chew holes thru the foil head.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of in-depth reviews already, so I&#x27;ll make mine short and quick.  This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Before then, I used my Braun and Remington (both of which had the MSRP of well over $100) for most of the past decade.  But ever since having switched to this Panasonic shaver, I was astounded by how good it was.  It eclipsed my Braun and Remington in every way, in terms of shaving and usage; I like the looks of the Braun a bit more.  The wet/dry capability is awesome as well.  In conclusion, best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had and used.</li>
            <li> Due to the economy I didn&#x27;t feel I could afford to replace my Braun with another $250 electric razor.  This one was rated best buy from Consumers Report.  I am happy I bought this one for $70.  I was concerned about cleaning because I like Brauns cleaning station, however this washes easily under the faucet.  I just wish it had a case option because it could be damaged in a  hanging bag; however my last Braun broke in my travel bag inside a solid case anyway.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my husband as a gift. I chose it due to the high reviews from other customers. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the purchase. My husband LOVES it! He says it&#x27;s easy and painless to use and goes right through his tough beard. I am thrilled with it too! I haven&#x27;t felt my husband&#x27;s this soft in years, I&#x27;ve missed being able to get close to him without getting beard burn. Now he&#x27;s baby faced again and I LOVE IT! Would definitely recommend this product to a friend!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a Christmas present for my fella. I gave it to him early and he loves it! He said that it didn&#x27;t pull on his facial hair and he was up saving with it at 12 midnight. So glad I bought this razor!</li>
            <li> Received item very fast - easy instructions - husband has used only once so far - but seems to enjoy it:)</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this product. It does not give a close shave (dry or wet). The shave has always been patchy and I have had to follow it up with a twin razor every single time.</li>
            <li> Far and away the best shaver I ever owned and I have owned many. Sorry I waited so long. After one shave it is worth the price. Bought an es8243 even has the model # printed on the shaver. Shaves in 1/4 the time that it takes with other models. Soft, smooth, clean shave even on neck and adams apple. Hooray Panasonic Nanotec!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for about 20 years, mostly the wet/dry type when they came out &amp; mostly Panasonics.    The ES8103S is the best of those I&#x27;ve used to date.  Aside from doing what the ads say, it is very quiet, easy to handle and provides a very good shave - a welcome way to start the day.    It&#x27;s not yet as close a shave as with a conventional razor - maybe the next one...</li>
            <li> I absolutely agree with most of the positive reviews, but want to make a few remarks.    1. I have used it only dry as any other electric shaver.  2. I had used Norelco Phillips for a long time, but this one delivered a very close, smooth shave from the very first time.  3. The quality of the shaving is very close to a blade and maybe even higher considering no nicks, cuts, irritation, etc. I shave once in three days.  4. It&#x27;s absolutely great for shaving the head and equal to a blade even without shaving cream.  5. Cleaning is very convenient; much easier than Norelco. After shaving a clean dry face there is no need to even activate the cleaning mode. Removing the foil holder and rinsing it and the inner blades separately under the running water is usually sufficient.  6. The high pinch noise is noticeable, especially comparing with Norelco. Not a problem for the one who shaves, but doing it at night time might be problematic. It only takes a few minutes though.  7. The battery should last for about 40 min according to the passport. And this is true for the new one, but the battery loses charge while being idle at the rate 10-20% per week. My five year old Norelco doesn&#x27;t lose any charge for at least a month.  8. It does get quite warm after 2-3 min, which may be uncomfortable for sensitive skin, especially if one is pressing hard, which is, actually, not helpful.  9. It gives better results when it is moved several times over the same spot if required applying very light pressure, which agrees with the passport recommendations.  10. Stretching the skin helps, and the handle should be kept perpendicular to the skin surface.  11. I keep it in a plastic glass along with my toothbrush, which is actually more convenient than a stand.  12. Carrying case would be useful.     Overall it&#x27;s a very good product, very comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best shaver I&#x27;ve used.  As long as you do not push too hard, you get zero irritation.&lt;br /&gt;I found a bit of Argon oil as an aftershave leaves your face smooth as silk.</li>
            <li> Greatrechargeable electric shaver. Initially the shave was not very close but, after my beard was conditioned , the shave was as smooth as a babies bottom.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t provide you with comparisons to all the other brands on the market like many reviewers here, but I have a real hard time finding any fault with this shaver. For me, it shaves closer than a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin so I never go against the grain with a blade as that always results in razor burn &amp; irritation. No such problem with the Panasonic, so the shave I get is smoother and closer. I still use a blade for my sideburns because I find it almost impossible to get a clean line using the electric but that&#x27;s the only criticism I can think of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the price I got it I&#x27;m thrilled with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Good shaver for the $$</li>
            <li> Very very close shave and quickly as well.</li>
            <li> Reviewed this product with Amazon and Consumer Report&#x27;s Ratings before purchasing for my husband.  It has performed  as anticipated and lived up to all the laudatory comments. My husband is very pleased...</li>
            <li> I had several electric razors and this is the best one ever, I do wish it had a charging stand, though.</li>
            <li> best one I have ever owned&lt;br /&gt;would recommend it</li>
            <li> It works great. I can shave on the go or use shave cream either way it works very well. I have used several electric razors over the years and this one is up there. Nothing but good stuff so far</li>
            <li> I was used to shave manually and somehow got curious (again) about electric shaving. After reading (too) many reviews I ordered the Panasonic ES8103S.   What a fabulous razor, a dream! Almost as close as my 50-blade-or-more Gillette and so much easier. I use the lemon pre-shave oil from \\&quot;The Art of Shaving\\&quot; and cannot be more positive. This razor is so easy to use, recharges in no time and I certainly don&#x27;t find it noisy. A remarkable razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this every day since I got it a month ago, so whatever it&#x27;s going to do, I&#x27;m fully aware of. The rest of the stuff I bought is still wrapped up in the shipping box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a Braun 340, and the blade/foil assembly is working on 6 or 7 years now, so I was kind of stupid for using it for that length of time. I came here to order a new assembly, then saw that I could buy a completely new shaver for the cost of 1.5 new foil assemblies! At least for that Braun. Plus, the trimmer broke on my Braun, and I use that thing quite often. Blah blah blah- I know. Anyway, I have a heavy beard. I shave, then three hours later it looks like I&#x27;ve been all day without one. We all know the pores of a shaving foil are different diameters, and the thickness of the foil itself varies. Wahl made a shaver that came with three or four foils of varying thickness that would accommodate different skin types and beard types - I may still have that thing too, somewhere. hang on- let me go look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rats. That thing&#x27;s gone. But I did find a Remington MS 5100. Trimmer broke on that one, too. The Remington, Panasonic and Braun all have different foils, different feels, different performance. I realize now that the only review you can really trust on shavers is from a dude who has the same beard as you, and the same skin sensitivity. If I get out of the rack and go shave with this Panasonic, it just won&#x27;t do the job. My beard actually slows the blades down. So what I&#x27;ve been doing is using the jacked-up Braun to take care of the lion&#x27;s share, then using the Panasonic to finish. And the Panasonic has a fantastic trimmer. Here&#x27;s hoping it keeps working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I&#x27;ve learned since 2005: if shaving with a razor tears your face up, go electric. If you go electric and find that your face still gets beat on, shave in shorter sessions. See, heat is what kills my face.  So I don&#x27;t press the thing against my face so hard. The razor doesn&#x27;t exactly need to be mooshed up against you hard anyway, and that pressure generates heat. Shaving long enough also generates heat. So I was not only shaving for longer than Joe Blow does, but I was also pressing too hard. That caused breakouts, and I&#x27;m 45! I&#x27;m way too old for breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well if I can&#x27;t shave fast enough to ensure that I&#x27;m doing it with a cold foil, then I shave until I feel the thing getting warm, then put it down and brush my teeth or get my clothes out, whatever. When I come back, the foil&#x27;s cooled off and I continue. Heat problem solved. The battery life on this thing is displayed in 10% increments. You won&#x27;t see 87%. You get 10, 20, 30, etc, which is fine. It&#x27;s just too easy to plug in and recharge to fret about something like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waterproofing means it&#x27;s easy to clean. I still wince when I intentionally put water on an electric shaver, but you remove the foil, put some liquid soap on the blades, put the foil back on with a little water and run it. Foam spooges up through the foil, then you rinse it off. I use canned air to dry the thing completely- we have too many minerals in our water for me to trust that it will dry without leaving deposits on my blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upshot: any shaver purchase will be hit or miss. You can trust performance and reliability in reviews, but how it works on your face, your skin, your beard varies.</li>
            <li> The shaver is awesome. It has a comfortable \\&quot;floating head\\&quot; that will adjust to the pressure you use to apply it against your skin and it will also tilt to the contour of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the idea that you can wash this item under running water with soap. I don&#x27;t like the gimmicks of the cleaning systems and the expensive cartridge refill systems that shaving manufactures try to sell you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only (slight) negative I would say is the trimmer on the back shorter than your tradition \\&quot;flat-head\\&quot; shavers. The motor on this is also rather loud and you&#x27;ll notice it if you&#x27;re trimming near/around your ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great product that works very well.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with its good quality.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have to be honest. I&#x27;ve been a Braun user for years and this is the first non-Braun razor I buy. The shaving head is impressively comfortable, not aggressive on the skin, very useful for shaving difficult parts like under the chin or below the jaw. So.. very good SHAVING.&lt;br /&gt;The TRIMMING however does not perform as well.. I don&#x27;t shave on a daily basis, maybe once every 4 days. So I have that 1/4 inch hair growing. The trimmer has some issues cutting off the thick hair so it needs quite come passes before getting the job done. The other issue is that sometime it pulls the hair (like when I cut the goatee).&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, very good choice of electric razor if you use it often. If you shave once in a while.. better check something else! ;)</li>
            <li> To start with, I don&#x27;t like electric shavers. I have tried them several times in the past - from a Remington foil type my dad got me when I was 16 to a Norelco rotary in my 30&#x27;s and a Braun Series 3 several years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never liked any of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They didn&#x27;t give me a close shave and they irritated my skin.  If I am going to spend the time shaving, then I want it to be a close shave and I don&#x27;t want to have to keep cortisone cream handy for shaving irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While searching for a related project, I stumbled upon a link to the Panasonic ES-8103 and decided it was maybe time to try again.  I ordered it from Amazon and got it last week.  Now this is based on shaving with it 5 times with it, but I have really enjoyed it and do recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a wet/dry shaver, which contributes to the comfort.  I have shaved with it using Williams &#x27;Lectric Shave, Gillete Gel-Foam, and Godja Shave Soap.  With the Gel-Foam and Shave Soap, I get a blade-close (I am not exaggerating) shave with little or no irritation (a little around the neck).  The jury is still out on the Williams &#x27;Lectric Shave.  It can be used in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An example of the comfort:  After shaving with my 5 blade Gillette, I will splash on some Paroso after-shave.  It stings.  After shaving with the Panasonic, I splash on the Paroso and it doesn&#x27;t sting. Yet, to my fingertips at least, it&#x27;s a close and smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got a 13,000 RPM motor, so it really hums along.  When I use the Shave Soap, the motor and blades create enough aggitation that it will actually foam the soap, making the shave even more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not expensive - about $70, or half-off list (at least on Amazon).  Considering the cost of the Gillette 5 Blade cartridges, the Panasonic looks like an even better value.</li>
            <li> Audible (I&#x27;m told) in the far reaches of the house. Sounds like a giant metallic &amp; very angry wasp trying to land on your chin. And it nicks. And the battery life is about 3 shaves. Other than that I&#x27;ve no complaints.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend. He has really sensitive skin and is super finicky about everything. He is so tough to buy for.   He absolutely LOVES this shaver. He previously had one of the self cleaning Braun shavers (lost in a move- doh!) and he has said that it is better than that one. It is less irritating and much easier to maintain. Who would have thought that a shaver you have manually clean is easier to maintain than one of those self cleaners?!?  Best part - this was a lightening deal during the holidays and I got it for a steal.   The finicky boyfriend highly recommends this shaver. Which is a rare moment in time :)</li>
            <li> Very good shaver - probably the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  I travel every week, and it seems like most higher end shavers come with a cleaning/charging docks that are impossible to travel with (Ask TSA!) I need a good shaver that just plugs into the wall, and this is it.  I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic shavers for a long time now with good results - only thing I don&#x27;t like is the cost of replacement blades and foils (typically up to 50$ for both, depending on where you shop)  But - that seems normal these days with most higher end shavers - this one give a good clean shave, and is comparatively quiet; for about $80, seems a no brainer. Compare with Norelco and Braun - I like the shave of Panasonic better.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd Panasonic razor. The 1st lasted over 10 years.  This one is much better, gives a closer shave, is quieter, &amp; cleans up easily. Have used it both wet &amp; dry, either way, great shave.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver!  Gives a clean save and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> easy to clean. comfortable, close shave. can shave dry or with shaving cream. light, durable, and the cost is affordable.</li>
            <li> shaves well. it&#x27;s a great reliable razor. although i&#x27;ve tried a higher end phillips and have had the same results. maybe over time my experience will be better</li>
            <li> this is a birthday gift for my husband. after I bought it, he haven&#x27;t started to use immediately . after 3 days. he first time use it.  and he love it . keep tell me how easy to use...how good feels.  and thank me bought it for him. :)</li>
            <li> very smooth shaving, has two net blades and trim, light weight, rubberized handle grip, battery charge indicator 0 - 100, also little sign appears on the screen when it needs to clean, the shaver head moves up and down slightly and left and right to avoid extra force on the skin. it absolutely does not irritates my skin, even under chin. great purchase! I will re - review it after a couple of years, will see ...</li>
            <li> I had great expectations for this shaver after reading reviews.  HOWEVER, it is, hands down, the noisiest shaver I have ever heard.  So noisy, I am concerned that it will permanently damage my hearing, so I have stopped using it.  Panasonic, how could you build something like this!?!  I don&#x27;t know why a consumer protection agency has not forced a recall or issued a warning.  If you value your hearing, I recommend you don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving my head now for about a year. Razors always remove a layer of skin so using them a lot leaves your skin feeling raw and worse yet if you have been in the sun. For the most part you just won&#x27;t do it everyday because of that. This shaver works well on my head with a really close shave without that feeling on your scalp. In fact it is so gentle that mid day or evening if we are going out I can do a touch up on my scalp. This gets so close as to feel baby skin soft with NO shadow at all when I am done. Even though you can use this in the shower I do not because the hot water runs low by the time I shower and shave plus dry shaving my scalp seems to be easier. I would have rated it five stars but the stubble on my face takes considerably more effort. Stubble on your scalp is smaller and more even. Because this has never took a bite out of me I feel that the foil is really fine and stubble on your face is larger than that on your head. I am coming up on 5 months with mine and needed a replacement blade set for it which I feel is resonable considering that I shave about 5 times the area as a normal shave of your face might have. This is nothing like the electric I had a few years back and I would buy it again in a heartbeat! If you shave your head, you will love it. If you shave just your face, you might not have as much enthusiasm.</li>
            <li> The main part of the shaver head doesn&#x27;t shave, but the trimmer does. Doesn&#x27;t work well at all. Worst purchase ever!&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this.</li>
            <li> This was a great find on Amazon!  The Panasonic shaver charged quickly, cuts smoothly and quietly and the price was 20% less than Target!  The product came quicker than they quoted and was neatly packaged!  Thank Yuo!</li>
            <li> This shaver is a great value. Very smooth and close shave in one or two passes. Does well with longer whiskers if you haven&#x27;t shaved in a day or two. Really appreciated the ability to use for water cleaning which is quick and easy. Beats my old Braun hands down. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Excellent razor with a very attractive price.</li>
            <li> I have bought 2 of it. Works great.&lt;br /&gt;1 for me 1 for father in law.</li>
            <li> Having tried numerous electric shavers over the years I can say that I finally found one that does not irritate my neck.  This shaver gives a close clean shave with no irritation at all.  I&#x27;m dry shaving with it and would imagine a wet shave would be even easier.  Cleaning it is a breeze, rinse it off under running water and blow it dry and it&#x27;s good to go.  I wish I would have tried it long ago and saved my money on all those \\&quot;rotary\\&quot; shavers.</li>
            <li> Very nicely designed electric razor at an attractive price (when I bought).  Gives a very comfortable shave, though not nearly as close as a Braun shaver of older but similar design.  Also be aware that this model will NOT allow shaving while it Charges.  If you stop off at home for a shave and quick change before an appointment or occasion and the battery is drained, you will need a backup razor or have to show up unshaven... a bummer!  This unit also seems to lose charge on batteries much faster (without use) than other brands and models, so be prepared to go out unshaven more often with this razor than with many others.</li>
            <li> When my old Panasonic needed new blades and foil, I decided to shop for a new shaver. The motor after so many years of cutting my \\&quot;wire beard\\&quot; sounded like it was laboring. I thought I was tired of wet shaving and bought a top of the line Braun - it&#x27;s for baby beards! Also, the Braun will not move over your skin if it is oily or micro-moist from a warm bathroom, even with shaving powder. It was returned. This ES8103S [[ASIN:B001DNE3KQ Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Rechargeable Linear Pivot Action Shaving System, Silver] shaver cuts my tough beard like it was fuzz, saving much time and my face! I don&#x27;t have to push it hard against my face to get a close shave and it gets all the hard to shave face and neck areas.</li>
            <li> I had never used a foil shaver before, so I decided to give this a try. If I didn&#x27;t like it, I could just send it back within the allowed time. Luckily, I haven&#x27;t had to worry about that! This shaver is pretty awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of things that I love about the shaver. First, if you shave with it regularly (every other day at least), shaving is extremely fast, clean, and painless. I&#x27;ve used other shavers before that just tug at the chin/neck hair and irritate badly. This does none of that. The foils are very slim and sharp, so there&#x27;s no irritation, but at the same time you could blindly hit and drag this thing across your face and never cut yourself. Like I said, quick and easy. The head of the shaver can pivot and turn to follow the contours of your face (or whatever), but you can also lock it in place, which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is pretty impressive. I typically use about 10% battery per shave, so it will definitely last a week before needing a charge. Speaking of battery life, the display showing battery percentage (with light) is fantastic. No more shaver dying mid shave before work and showing up looking like a bum (unless you are a bum by profession, in which case you would like that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this deserves a small section of its own, this shaver is really great for guys that get a lot of ingrown hairs. I used to get a lot on my neck when using a three blade razor (or something like it) and even other electric shavers. I ended up settling for a shaver with a guard on it, so I could never get a close shave. With this shaver, I can have a close shave, and no ingrown hairs, so it&#x27;s really the gold standard for me in terms of shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other pros I&#x27;ve noticed: The shaver is pretty quiet and not quite as jarring/heavily vibrating as some of the others I&#x27;ve used. Although I always dry shave, it&#x27;s nice that you can use it in the shower and clean it easily without worrying about water damage/rust. The trimmer on the back is convenient to have for detailing or just getting those stray long hairs. It&#x27;s overall a really high quality product that I plan on keeping and using for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two minor cons: You can&#x27;t use the shaver while it&#x27;s charging, and it is shipped with an empty battery, so you have to wait a bit for first use. That means that you have to plan ahead and charge it before you need to shave (which makes the battery percent display all the more convenient). The other thing is that the battery level is only displayed in tens of percents (ie 100%, 90%, 80%, etc). That doesn&#x27;t really matter, it&#x27;s just a little weird that it&#x27;s not very accurate. Again, these cons are super minor, and really don&#x27;t impact my overall feelings about the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10 would recommend to a friend. Would shave a baby if necessary.</li>
            <li> replacement for aging Panasonic shaver--such a good shaver got another one. Great shave, nice feel. Charge running a full week--easy to clean--very high revolution motor. Good price and so far very happy with results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic Wet/Dry razors since 1992.  My biggest complaint about any and all Panasonic razors is they work fine for about a year, then they quit working or start really having lots of problems.  I replaced my last one with the ES8103S (my previous one was the same model).  After a few months, the LCD screen went out.  Then one day it just quit working/charging.  That just seems to be the case with all Panasonic razors.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research.  This razor was said to be the best for shaving your head. It does do a better job than my last but I think its just above average. Wet shaving is not good the wiskers gum up the blades.  But all in all it does a good job not great.</li>
            <li> A much smoother shaver compared to my old shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Very ergonomic&lt;br /&gt;Holds the charge for almost a month (manual says 2 weeks)&lt;br /&gt;Only minor downside is the cover comes off a little too easily.</li>
            <li> I regret getting this. It is no better than the 20 dollar shaver I had before. The blade is very dull and it does not shave smoothly on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the money. In my opinion, either buy a higher level model or just a low end model which works as good as this one.</li>
            <li> I am truly amazed. It works like a charm. Before purchasing this I used the Braun series 7. I never really got a good shave and needed to manually clean up my neck with a handheld razor. But with the Panasonic it is drastically different. I get a clean shave all over my face. I use it as a wet shave with Zirh shaving gel and rinse the electric razor with hot water every now and then so it glides more freely. Clean up is very simple just soap and water. I like not being dependent on additional products to keep the razor clean. Very satisfied with this item.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Norelco rotary shaver for years.  It gave me an \\&quot;OK\\&quot; shave.  When the battery finally went south, I started looking on Amazon for a new one.  After reading the reviews, I settled for this one.     After the very first shave my wife immediately noticed how smooth I felt.  I kept rubbing my face all day long in dis-belief.  My face was baby-bottom smooth!   This thing produces the closest shave I have ever felt.  Mind you, I am not a blade man nor do I have irritation problems, but this thing is wonderful.  It shaves the around the neck area perfectly and clean-up is a breeze.  If you want the closest shave possible from an electric shaver... GET THIS!  Your wife / girlfriend won&#x27;t be able to stop rubbing your face!</li>
            <li> I have a horribly rough beard.  I go through shields, so my strategy is to buy the lower end panasonics more frequently, as opposed to buying the top end and then spending money on replacement shields.  So I purchased about 6 of these over the last 5-8 years (can&#x27;t remember how long).  Three still in service.  One in the car, one older one for initial cut, one new one for final pass.  Seems crazy I know...but have been unsuccessful finding electric razor that cuts close any better than this.</li>
            <li> I had an old Braun foil shaver that finally wore out, and the replacement parts were half the cost of a new 3-head rotary shaver from another brand.  The rotary was OK, comfortable, but not as close and so slow.      That was a couple of years ago.  I was going to replace the rotary with another Braun of some type, but they are kind of expensive, and this Panasonic had good reviews.      After a month or so, I can say it&#x27;s faster and closer than the rotary (which I now keep at work, just in case), and almost as comfortable.  Like my old Braun.  I guess that&#x27;s the trade off.      Battery life is good, a couple weeks.  The battery &#x27;countdown&#x27; on the display is nice, not just a warning that you&#x27;ve run out.  Also it tells you when you should clean it.  Cleaning is easier, too.  I haven&#x27;t tried the wet option yet. Maybe in the summmer.    The case is just a cloth bag.  I worry about packing it and having something press against the button and put it in turbo mode.  That should attract the attention of the TSA!    If it holds up, then I will be very satisfied with this shaver, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this shaver and am impressed with how nice the shave is. I have owned many different electric shavers over the years and this is the best one! The closeness of the shave is nice and the unit feels solid. I did not get the cleaning system, that part seems kind of gimmicky to me. The unit charges up fast and is considerably lighter and quieter than my 3 year old Panasonic shaver. I think the blades and motor speed make the biggest difference in a shaver, not so much the pivot action even though this model has an intricate pivot mechanism. Overall seems like a great unit.</li>
            <li> I just picked this up a couple of weeks ago to replace a Norelco shaver with the three round blade configuration. I have to say that I prefer the three round blade style better than this flat blade style. It just seems like with the flat blade it is easier to get your whole face quickly. I may just need to get used to this style of shaver.  My one other comment is that this unit is very loud. It is at least twice as loud as the Norelco it replaced.</li>
            <li> I had an old Braun that finally just died and was in need of a new electric razor.  The Braun never gave me a satisfying shave but it was good enough for when I needed to look semi-presentable in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the Panasonic for the first time this morning I am very impressed.  It&#x27;s fast, extremely comfortable, and plowed through my very tough beard painlessly (both figuratively and literally).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is easy (you can use water on it) and you won&#x27;t end up with stubble pouring out of the unit while you&#x27;re using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Superb product.</li>
            <li> The best electric shaver I have ever used. I have only used it dry shaving but it is great.  I have tried the new braun and norelco and the Panasonic is by far the best.</li>
            <li> It was finally time to replace my 10-year old Norelco razor with rotating heads, and I decided to try a foil razor for the first time since I&#x27;ve had my \\&quot;grown-man\\&quot; beard (my first electric was a foil, but I merely had peach fuzz).  I tried the Braun series razor that my friend has, and it worked great, but I just couldn&#x27;t see spending $200.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this razor worked great on my face, it did nothing for my neck.  I&#x27;ve got thick, course Italian hair, and it grows in different directions on my neck.  I went over my neck several times, trying all different angles, pressure and directions, but just wouldn&#x27;t take care of the neck hair.  I decided to try it for about 5 days, just to see if it just took getting used to, but it still did nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that the razor was light, but sturdy, and ran quietly.  Everything else about it was great, it just couldn&#x27;t clean my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could separately review the return process, because I would have given that 5 stars.  I didn&#x27;t like it, I followed the online instructions for return, and within about a week or so, I had my money back.  You can&#x27;t ask for better service.</li>
            <li> Really liking this shaver. I had a Braun I loved for years and this shaves closer, I was pleasantly surprised. Great product and a great price.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic Wet/Dry shaver does very well. It&#x27;s a good design and removes most of my facial hair comfortably.  When accompanied by a blade makes my shave especially close.  It was my experience that regardless if the shaver is Panasonic or Braun it doesn&#x27;t really matter that much.  There are obvious design differences but both shavers perform almost equally given comparable model types.  A blade is almost always needed to remove the facial hair that the shaver couldn&#x27;t quite get.  Using a combination of an electric shaver and a blade gets my shave much closer and definitely more comfortable than just using a blade alone regardless if the blade is a top of the line Gillette, which probably the best blade design available.</li>
            <li> I cannot see how anyone with any skin type could ever be disapointed with this shaver!     Unlike most electric shavers that ask you to shave with theirs for a few weeks to get use to the shave(most likely so that you will forget how much better your old shaver was than theirs);from the very first shave this shaver had me sold.    I shaved with it dry for a few days without any skin products and thought I couldn&#x27;t be happier. And then I shaved with it in the shower, just using bar soap. My wife said that my face was as smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind (except that the crack was going the wrong way.)    Spend some time shopping around on the internet for your best deal on the shaver. I bought mine on Amazon for almost half off.</li>
            <li> 12/13/2015 Six 1/2 year update: After more than six years of daily use, this razor still works and looks almost like new with the original foil and blades. It took a little time to get used to this new lighter model. I have learned that each razor has its own characteristics. Once I learned how to shave with this model, I started getting some very close comfortable shaves. I am now quite pleased with it. For this reason, I have deleted my old review and replacing it with this new review. I am changing my rating from 3 stars to 5. One cannot go wrong buying this shaver. Especially, since I see that the price has dropped considerably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Light weight and quiet.&lt;br /&gt;* Ergonomic design is very comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;* Nice close shave (especially for an electric shaver.)&lt;br /&gt;* Built-in ultrasonic self-cleaning feature (this an EXCELLENT feature). I love it! No fancy cleaning gadgets or solutions are ever required.&lt;br /&gt;* Digital battery life remaining display (many shavers don&#x27;t even have this feature anymore). So, enjoy this feature while it is still available.&lt;br /&gt;* Cuts the long hairs as very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons (only for me):&lt;br /&gt;* No charging stand (but cord is better for a traveler).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 69 years old. I have never had to replace the blades or foil on any of my electric razors. TIP:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Keep your shaver blades and foil clean. Don&#x27;t ever let your razor get filled with days/weeks worth of whiskers, foam, lotions, etc. With this Panasonic shaver, cleaning is very fast and efficient. The built-in ultrasonic cleaning is truly fantastic. This shaver will actually remind you to clean it before each recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Let the shaver glide over your face. Pressing down too hard taxes the motor and will wear out the foil faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The blades will stay very sharp if (after a cleaning) you remove the blades and soak them in rubbing alcohol overnight (90%+ alcohol). I soak the blades once each month. My grandfather gave me this tip a long time ago. I don&#x27;t know why it works, but I have never had to replace my electric shaver blades and still got shaves as if the blades were new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin but do not have a heavy beard. So, I cannot speak to how this shaver would work for someone with coarse thick whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: As of December 13, 2015, this shaver is still working perfectly for me with the original blades and screen (see above). I still get 8-9 shaves out of a single charge. It&#x27;s still a pretty amazing razor. If this razor ever broke down, I would immediately buy another.ace my electric shaver blades and still got shaves as if the blades were new.  I have sensitive skin but do not have a heavy beard.

            <li> This is an excellent shaver.  I have owned many electric shavers over the years.  This is the best by far.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Good shaver. Hard to get close shave.</li>
            <li> This is my first wet/dry shaver. Love it so far.  Provides a quick, close and comfortable shave.  Easy to use &amp; clean.  I would recommend this item to anyone.</li>
            <li> I like the display on the unit.  The shaver handles power well. I am able to get over 10 shaves per charge on it.  With the linear speed, I am surprised that it takes me a bit longer to shave than the old Panasonic this one replaces.  The shave is close like a razor.  I do not like the flip up trimmer as much as the previous unit, but it works.    Nate</li>
            <li> i have been using this shaver for a year. Overall, i am happy with it. It does miss a few hair here and there but i guess thats due to the nature of my beared. it shaves close enough and works well with shaving gels. Easy to clear and the charge on it is really good. Each shave uses around 7% of the charge, which is not bad at all. it takes less than an hour to charge it fully.</li>
            <li> Works well enough, gives me a razor smooth shave and is very easy to clean. Battery drained by 20% from 100% on the 1st use so it is a bit power hungry which isn&#x27;t really a problem.</li>
            <li> Bought this model because it was ranked as the third best Pansonic shaver you could buy.  I&#x27;ve had some bad and good experiences with other Panasonic shavers.  First off this shaver is very friendly to the face.  You won&#x27;t get razor burn if you shave properly.  It&#x27;s not overwhelming like the Panasonic four head blade shaver, essentially this is a trimmed down version of the best shaver Panasonic sells.  No electric will provide the closeness of a blade, so in that sense be realistic when you buy one of these.  This razor will give you around a 98% blade closeness.  A braun will give you around a 96% closeness, a norelco you&#x27;re looking at around 93%.  Your face will be smooth after using this razor.  The best part is that it won&#x27;t beat up your neck and give a very smooth and close shave.  It lacks a little around the cheeks, but other than that it is well worth the value.  The only downside is that the power cord is a bit hard to take out from the shaver.</li>
            <li> Really a nice razor, quite too. The only issue is the on/off button, I keep hitting it when shaving, not a deal breaker but would have been nice if located somewhere else.</li>
            <li> Really, really, really like this shaver: great on my legs! This is the closest shave, next to a safety razor, I&#x27;ve experienced. I took it a little easy with the first shave (dry) and applied more pressure today and had very smooth results. The unit charged very quickly and appears it will work for four shaves before requiring a charge.&lt;br /&gt;I would not use this for underarms, but I&#x27;m satisfied using a safety razor for this area.</li>
            <li> this will not shave as close as hand razor but will pass when you need to go too work you can shaved in the car</li>
            <li> I origianlly purchased this razor for my son but of course I had to try it.  I was very impressed by the shave I got from it.  The razor cuts close with 1 or 2 passes which reduces irritation and heat from friction.  A more comfortable shave than my 15 year old Braun.  As others have mentioned, it makes a high pitched buzzing sound when turned on, I didn&#x27;t find it any more annoying that any other razors noise.  I love the ability to wash it under the faucet and not worry about water damage.  I normally shave with a blade and still prefer that method.  I like this for a quick once over when needed or when I don&#x27;t feel like getting all lathered up.</li>
            <li> Previous shaver did not do a great job (always had patches that were a more rough than others).  The Panasonic does a great job all the way around and shaves almost as close as an old school razor (without the razor burn).  Overall a pretty good deal for its price.</li>
            <li> still don&#x27;t get a smooth shave aND I NEVER REC&#x27;D THE LECTRIC SHAVE</li>
            <li> This shaver is ok but slow. Yes, it strokes at 13000 rpm but you have to go over your face too many times to get a close shave. I replaced a Remington triple header, MS3-2000 that I had used to several years because the battery was wearing down to the point where I had to recharge it every other day plus it seemed to be getting so noisey. Like a growling tiger in my ear. The Remington actually still shaves closer and faster than the Panasonic. So, if I had to do this over I would get another Remington triple header.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.  Smoothest shave ever.  Have used other brands but my last a Panasonic) finally gave up the ghost and I wanted to replace it with a like model.</li>
            <li> This shaver is well made. and it cut bear deep inside, which is a good point. what&#x27;s more, it can rinse clean the hair debris under running water after the shave.&lt;br /&gt;Its battery drains very quickly. each shave may cost 10% of the battery.&lt;br /&gt;It makes a lot of noise when shaving and I think it&#x27;s less efficient than Philips&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I realize it&#x27;s new, so as time wears down the blades I&#x27;m sure the performance will suffer, but it&#x27;s the best/closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten with an electric razor (including some I paid double what this one was selling for!). I got it based on Comsumer Report&#x27;s review that is was one of the highest rated ones under $100 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one star I witheld was for the noise. This is NOT a quiet razor, believe me. If you live/sleep with a companion, and your bathroom is anywhere near your bedroom, door-closed or no-door-closed you are waking them up with this shaver. It sounds like someone&#x27;s starting a lawnmower.</li>
            <li> This is the second shaver I tried after LV-61. Here is my assessment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving quality: Not comfortable -1&lt;br /&gt;Neck shaving quality: It was better compared to LV-61 +1&lt;br /&gt;Material quality: Feels cheap made in China material -1&lt;br /&gt;Ease of use: Not easy, I have pain in my hand after each shaving -1&lt;br /&gt;Battery life: Good so far +1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: The shaver is OK for the price but I would try different model to get a lot better experience.</li>
            <li> good price and best goods</li>
            <li> nice to use in the shower</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this shaver because of the negative reviews...particularly the recurring problems of water seepage and battery issues, and the seemingly difficult dealings with Panasonic customer service.  Nonetheless, I had to purchase a panasonic because I have an allergic reaction to Nickel, and they are the only manufacturer&#x27;s of nickel-free foil type shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus far, the shaver works fairly well. It shaves my moustache and my chin fairly cleanly and on the first pass. The neck area around the adam&#x27;s apple required a few passes, but all around was pretty close and clean.  It is odd, however, that the shaver head moves from left to right instead of front to back (like my old Braun) which requires some getting used to. I like the LCD that allows me to see battery remaining, however, it is only so useful in the sense that it displays in 20% increments. Haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower yet, so no insights there. The trimmer works fairly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few downsides. The shaver seems to get quite hot after a prolonged usage, which can be uncomfortable for some. Also, the shaver is incredibly LOUD. I was shaving in the bathroom and it could be heard all the way in the living room of my house. Some reviews had mentioned this, but even I did not believe it could be so loud. The loudness is so irritating that I decided to take one star away. Otherwise this is an almost perfect shaver for me. I will say that if Braun manufactured a nickel-free shaver, I would have stayed with Braun. But as a replacement to Braun this has worked well so far...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got very sensitive skin, and wanted to get away from using normal bladed razors because of what it was doing to my skin. This razor has a fantastic cut. When wet shaving, it&#x27;s close enough to a blade shave that I can&#x27;t tell the difference. Dry shaving is still good, but not as close. My hair is very fine, so I I can&#x27;t comment on how it compares for thick hair. Although it&#x27;s a great product, my skin is just too sensitive. After using it for a 2 months or so now, shaving daily, I needed to find something else. I&#x27;ve gone to using an epilator now, which seems to effect my skin less. It&#x27;s by far the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used though, and I highly suggest it.</li>
            <li> On the first shave I really thought I wasn&#x27;t going to like this unit, but the manual says stick with it to allow your face to adjust to it. It sounded like BS but really is true. After a week it was doing a wonderful job and I really like it. I especially like that it tells you how much battery charge is left. That comes in really handy. Overall a very good shaver!!</li>
            <li> Panasonic ES81103S Man&#x27;s 3-Blade shaver is a very good product. Very close shave, charge lasts for 8-10 shavings, easy to wash/clean. Recommended.</li>
            <li> My Remington shaver finally bit the dust so I was looking for something a little smaller and lighter.  Lots to choose from, but quite frankly all the reviews on Amazon written about different models really helped me decide.  The Panasonic ES8103S is light but very powerful.  The battery lasts a long time between charges.  The adjustable head flex, the ability to get shaver wet when either shaving or cleaning it is a big plus.  It fits in your hand nicely and makes a clean, close shave without having to go over and over the same spot.  Lots of nice features, and I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This razor is ok. It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as I&#x27;d like. It does have some neat features though. It tells you when it needs charged and cleaned.</li>
            <li> Exceptional.  Close shave. Quiet.  Better then the previous models I had.  I get about four to five good shaves, all in the shower.</li>
            <li> My old Panasonic died after 5+ years of service so I bought this as an inexpensive replacement.  The motor does not seem as strong and the body seems a little cheaper, but for a third the price of the old unit I didn&#x27;t expect perfection.  It shaves nicely and I have no complaints thus far.</li>
            <li> I have never been a fan of eletric shavers but I decided to try this product to shave my head. It does not shave as close as razor, but it works better than I expected. The Panasonic ES8103S has not cut or burned me once. I can&#x27;t say the same about razor shaving.</li>
            <li> Been using Remmington shavers my whole life &amp; in the last few years they just do not stand up anymore. .The plastic head holding snaps just wear out &amp; I had to tape them together to use the foil shaver.The Panasonic is the way to go. Am VERY satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> In addition to being quite loud, this shaver does not do a very good job of shaving - even after many passes.  Perhaps I have coarse whiskers, but it doesn&#x27;t even come close to shaving as well as the old lower-end Braun that this unit was intended to replace.  Unless you&#x27;re OK with needing 10 minutes to shave (and having to clean up afterwards with a safety razor), don&#x27;t waste your money on this model.  For this kind of money, you should at least get a decent shave within a reasonable amount of time!</li>
            <li> I have had Remington shavers my whole adult life. My last one was noisy, didn&#x27;t shave very well and when the screen started to go, I went looking on Amazon for a new shaver. I saw the reviews on this one and since I have owned a lot of Panasonic products over the years, I decided to try it. My shaver came a day earlier than expected (woo hoo Amazon Prime !). I plugged the charger into it last night and it was charged to 100% in less than 90 minutes. I love the battery meter. My first shave this morning was awesome. With my old Remingtons, I still had to go over my face with a disposable to get the difficult close to the skin hairs they missed, especially my neck. For the first time ever, I didn&#x27;t have to do that. This shaver is incredible. I had NO close in stubble left. It&#x27;s quiet, strong and gave me my first truely perfect shave from an electric. Use the soft mode which gives you a little Norelco swivel effect. 5 stars to Panasonic for this product !</li>
            <li> Great shave, battery level display is very handy. 1-hour charge time is a plus!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shaver I&#x27;ve obtain to reduce the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow lol it really gives u a smooth shave I don&#x27;t know about other shavers but I know that this one does the job.. It recharges so quickly and really goes deep with no irritation.. I&#x27;m pleased</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> it came fast and it my take more time to shave to get good results but its smooth. the pain of shaving every day i solved with using this once or twice a week</li>
            <li> best shaver yet. I am still in the assessing programme but so far am most impressed. will advise in due course</li>
            <li> It charges quickly, great price, bought it twice, one for me and one for my dad. Works great for people without a lot of facial hair, decent buy.</li>
            <li> After paying $48.00 a package for blades, for forever, I bought this for my husband on an Amazon deal of the day. He loves it and will not go back to blades. His face did not break out and it is so much faster. It is really easy to clean an works especially well in the shower. The blades and outer foil are supposed to last a year, but are fairly inexpensive to replace even if they don&#x27;t. We are very happy</li>
            <li> i bought this based on the ratings and caught it during a good price.  well i was immediately unhappy with the results.  i have to shave everyday and found this to not be a close enough shave and feeling like i needed a shave before the end of the work day.  decided to stick to manual razors.</li>
            <li> I bought this blade for my husband.&lt;br /&gt;My husband loved the shaver. Razor shaves well and does not cause skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Best feature of this shaver is the close, pain-free, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I received the panasonic es8103 shaver in the expected time. When I tried to shave my face which had only one day&#x27;s  of growth, I felt pulling on my hairs. I passed the shaver lightly hoping that would make a difference, but the hairs were continued to pull. I don&#x27;t know if all 3 blades shavers are like that. I have a panasonic 2 blade shaver that shaves without pulling hairs. I don&#x27;t think that I had to get used to that type of 3 blade shaver. Perhaps this particular model is rough on the face. So for now, I&#x27;ll stick to the 2 blade model which I find comfortable, and gives a resonable shave.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant on this razor after seeing some of the negative reviews: I am one of those &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; types who never gets a close neck shave and breaks out after shaving with electric.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this razor delivered. First time, out of the box, closest shave I ever had. No issues with the charger, no issues with the digital display, nothing.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is that it isn&#x27;t as easy to clean as advertised (and certainly not self-cleaning, especially if you try wet shaving with it).&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I use it for my entire head (scalp and all) and can get 5-7 shaves on one charge and one cleaning, which is great, in my book, just charge up and clean on weekends.</li>
            <li> After using a three-head shaver for over 30 years, finally got the blade shave feeling from Panasonic!! Easy wash too!!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband, and he loves it! Great Razor. I definitely would recommend this product to anyone who is interested.</li>
            <li> This was somewhat of a disappointment for my husband due to lack of effectiveness.  However, if one uses a regular nonelectric razor after using this one for the worse of the stubble it will suffice.</li>
            <li> This shaver was delivered quickly and was worth even a longer wait.  It is light, does a fine job with its pivot action system, and holds a charge for a very long time.  I would recommend it highly.  I consulted Consumer Reports and it was one of their best buy items.  A good purchase!</li>
            <li> Although I believe a superior Panasonic model was listed at a similar price on Overstock ( it wasn&#x27;t when I checked before this purchase ) , this model seems fine. It will rattel sometimes, but it is in a whole different league than my old shaver. Seems to work best dry, and needs charging every few days, but I&#x27;m quite pleased with this device.</li>
            <li> I am a recent owner of this razor and have only used it dry but I wanted to share my first thoughts.  This product is one of a very few items that actualy do what it says it will in many years. I have a very heave beard so of course I have to go over a couple spots more than once but that goes for a standard non-electric razor also. The sound is much lower than my older Bruan...more like a couple of loud bees. It does not irritate in the least as other always have.  As far as wet shaving and life of this product we shall see but I am 100% happy with it as is.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is one sweet razor.  The battery lasts a long time, and it is even easy on the ears too.  Some electric razor really are noisy, but this on hums so fast, it sounds like a bee buzzing or an electric tooth brush instead of like a barbers clippers like most razors sound.</li>
            <li> Great shaver, does not get as close as I would like.</li>
            <li> I have not tried it with a wet shave and cannot determine if any of the pre-shave lotions do any good or if they just smell.  Completely dry it gives a decent shave which is very uniform over the entire face, but it takes several passes to get a reasonably close shave.  I use it on weekends when I do not need the clean shave of a razor and am happy with it.</li>
            <li> I originally bought the ES-LT41-K Arc3 and the display started to malfunction so within the year&#x27;s warranty I mailed it back to Panasonic and got an &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; to this ES8103S Arc3.  Unfortunately within the year of using it the display malfunctioned again, and worse, the shaver just decided to stop working.  If I ever get another Panasonic wet/dry shaver, I&#x27;m pretty sure I won&#x27;t use it near water again.  It&#x27;s only about 1.5 years since I&#x27;ve been using it, and while it worked, it worked ok.  Disappointed and probably won&#x27;t buy another Panasonic shaver again.</li>
            <li> This electric shaver is exactly what I was looking for: 1) economical, 2)efficient, 3) easy to clean &amp; maintain, 4) easy storage (there is no holder for the shaver).</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this shaver! It works better on shorter hair, not so well on 3+ day hair.</li>
            <li> This electric shaver works great.  The charge is quick @ ~1hr for a full charge.  I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 because after reading the reviews I had expected the shaver to do a better job with short facial hair; but it takes a bit of effort to do so.  Still its better than the Braun and Norelco shavers I had previously.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver after some years of using a Remington Titanium shaver and decided to give it a shot to Panasonic. I was pleasently surprised by the great level of shaving and the machinery sound so much quiter than my previous one. It is not totally silent but much quiter than other brands.   The cleaning process is simpler and faster than on others however I feel that the battery doesn&#x27;t last as on the Remington.  I have read other reviews and my conclusion is that the quality of the shave depends on your beard thickness. My beard is regular and I&#x27;m pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li> I have used manual razors for many years and I finally decided to try an electric model.  I did a lot of research and decided that I didn&#x27;t want to pay more than $100.  I decided on this Panasonic shaver due to the good reviews [...]  The shaver seems well built and I like that it adjusts to follow the contours of your face.  On the first shave it took a few extra minutes to find the best postions to hold it, but it gave a very clean and comfortable shave.  Not as close as a manual razor, but very close still (some people may not notice a difference).  The convenience of shaving wet or dry is nice and it seems easy enough to clean.    My recommendation is to buy!  You cannot get a better shaver for the money.  [...]</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver; I love it. This shaver is a great value with a top of a line quality.  Mj</li>
            <li> I am 73 and have used a Norelco shaver since being a freshman in college.  I was very well pleased with this Panasonic shaver right from the start.  It was much faster and my face is smooth as a baby&#x27;s.  I shave dry.  I was a little concerned about cleaning it and getting it wet but that works well also.</li>
            <li> Panasonic sent this unit to me as a replacement for a failed 7103. This is the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten with an electric razor! It is noisier than the 7103, but the blade system is superior. My only concern is that this too has a plug-in charger, so I wonder about its longevity.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews before I purchased this item. I would say there were a few that made me rethink about buying, but I bought it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Wet/Dry&lt;br /&gt;Foil(Rotary heads seem to tear me up)&lt;br /&gt;Price&lt;br /&gt;Ease of use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Yea, it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a razor&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit heavy&lt;br /&gt;Takes longer to shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;It works great. I have used it every day since it arrived. I have charged it to 100% once. I have shaved about 4 days now, and I still have 50% left on the battery. It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the closeness of a razor, but at $14-15.00 for 4 razors, I&#x27;ll live with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just think about that every time I shave. Yea, it cost $70, but it will pay for itself in just over 2 months of replacing my other razor heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the replacement heads for manual razors are a BIG scam. I think when this one wears out I will go to a straight razor. I&#x27;m not going to give the BIG razor companies any more of my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is a good shaver, but like many other reviewers have noted, the shaver&#x27;s display failed after about 8 months. Make sure you hold onto your receipt, there&#x27;s a good chance you may need it. I contacted Panasonic and returned it about a week ago since it was still under warranty. I received my replacement shaver today and to my surprise Panasonic sent a brand new ES8243A! This is actually a better shaver than the one I returned. Kudos to Panasonic for standing behind their product and their warranty!!!</li>
            <li> The product was really convenient to use and gives awesome experience. The product was worth its price and recommendable. I love it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave as close as other electric razors I have had, but I have absolutely no skin irritation, which I have gotten from every other razor I have used. If you have sensitive skin I recommend trying this razor</li>
            <li> Impressions 5 days in, daily: works great, beyond expectations.&lt;br /&gt;My background:&lt;br /&gt;- Male, 40 y.o.&lt;br /&gt;- Sensitive skin and thick, strong beard.&lt;br /&gt;- Due to irritations, for the last year and a half or so I have been using only trimmer, no close shave. Permanent designer stubble.&lt;br /&gt;- Before that, I have used Gilette Mach 3 blades and my neck would end up red for at least 4-5 hours and irritated even longer.&lt;br /&gt;- I have used Braun electric shavers in my 20&#x27;s, also with some irritation and in-grown hairs on the neck pretty much all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I started using this shaver on dry skin, no prep whatsoever, before showering. And the result is:&lt;br /&gt;- Nice, close shave.&lt;br /&gt;- Zero irritation!&lt;br /&gt;- Zero in-grown hair (so far, only 5 days, daily shave).&lt;br /&gt;- After the shower, I only apply my regular moisturiser, no aftershave needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the situation changes with time, I will update this review, but so far, works really great.</li>
            <li> I realized something about shavers when I got this one. A lot of what determines how good shave is, is... the SPEED of the vibration of the cutters. And this one buzzes a LOT faster than my last Braun. I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s better in any other way, but this is all the difference I need!! -- It holds a good long charge, too, and is easy to wield. I&#x27;m really happy with this one.</li>
            <li> Shaves very close and FAST !!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this razor. I&#x27;m 55 and have used a Braun or Norelco for the last 30 years. This shaver effortlessly gives me an incredibly close shave whether I use it wet OR dry. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> After my Norelco quit I began researching for a new shaver. I narrowed my search down between the Braun and Panasonic brands. After choosing one from each in a specific price range I read as many reviews that I could find. The Panasonic model had several more positive reviews than the Braun in the same price range. I have now owned this shaver for one month and am delighted with it. It shaves very close and like so many guys my neck area gets irritated easily. This razor does not give me that irritation. The ergonomic design is very comfortable to hold and the foil head follows the contours of my face every bit as good as the triple floating head design I previously used. Cleaning of the foil head and cutters is a breeze as this wet/dry design makes that possible. Charging only takes one hour if the battery is completely down and I get 10 shaves before I have to recharge. The only thing I would like to see with this model would be a recharging stand. In conclusion this shaver: cuts close without irritation...excellent egronomic design.....easy to clean....charges quickly. I am very satisified with the Panasaonic ES8103S.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Braun user for 15 years... and expected to buy another one. but the reviews and price of this panasonic were just too good, so I took the plunge.  No regrets!  it as good or better as my braun 5-series shaver it replaced. There is a smoother cut, and less clippings. Just hope it lasts as long as the braun did.</li>
            <li> Since I have owned Braun razors for many years, I was a little surprised they doubled the price after being sold to P&amp;G.  So, I shopped for another brand and this popped up in my search.  I need a trimmer, check, and a comfortable shave, check.  This Panasonic has a excellent COMFORTABLE face following shave.  It cleans up with just a water rinse and really cuts close.  Nice feature is to have the battery scale on the front in full view.  Since this razor had a seal of approval from Consumer Digest and we own other Panasonic brands, it was a slam dunk!  ONE OTHER THING - It fits comfortably in your hand and is reasonably light in weight.</li>
            <li> My husband had been using disposable razors for years and I was trying to find him an automatic one for a while. This product was recommended by a friend as a great starter. So far, my husband loves the fact that it could be used wet or dry. He hasn&#x27;t picked up a disposable razor since.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver replacing my Braun.  I have used Braun for years and was a devote user until my last Braun shaver (3 years old) started pulling hard on my whiskers.  This would happen only after a weekend of not shaving.  Had never happened to me on any other Braun.  Thought I would try this Panasonic and WOW it is outstanding.  Plus price here on Amazon is top notch.  I highly recommend this Panasonic Shaver.</li>
            <li> I love this razor. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it and it recharges in less than an hour. I&#x27;ve had it over a year and a half, and it still works like it&#x27;s new.</li>
            <li> First electric shaver for me. Used it daily while in the military and 2-3 times a week now that I&#x27;m out. over three years old and going strong! (replaced the blades and foil last year)</li>
            <li> The shave is ok but not close so I use a straight razor afterwards. So far the word is still out on performance.</li>
            <li> Love it  give a close clean shave</li>
            <li> Buy it. Very close shave to a razor. Don&#x27;t know how it fairs on a full grown beard, but for everyday shaving it is excellent.</li>
            <li> Have bought many different electric razors in the past 20 years and would always go back to a straight razor because of the quality of the shaves. Until now...This razor is as close to a straight razor I have felt. I have only used it in the shower with shaving gel though, so I can&#x27;t say anything about dry shave quality for this razor. but the wet shave is AWESOME. All the 5 Star reviews for this razor are correct. Look no further if you want a \\&quot;straight razor\\&quot; shave with an electric.</li>
            <li> To date I have owned 3 Panasonic wet/dry shavers.  I have only been satisfied with the ES8077S, which unfortunately broke due to rough handling of my travel bag by airport personnel.  I replaced it with another Panasonic wet/dry which I bough overseas, but don&#x27;t remember the model.  Although it worked using different voltages, it wouldn&#x27;t keep charge for longer than one shave after only a couple of months.  My latest, the ES8103 (the product currently reviewed), does not fare much better.  After only a few months the display has stopped working, so I have been having to guess when it needs recharging.  And guess what, it now (within way less than a year&#x27;s time) it holds charges way and way shorter. Oh, and in case you&#x27;re wondering; I do treat stuff gently and with respect.  I&#x27;m disappointed in having to buy one of these every year, if they even last that long...  May 29 update: Just lowered my rating from two stars to one star.  The battery on this shaver has lasted me less than a year, since I now need to charge it after every use.  So my bottom line on this product is: great technology, horribly cheap materials.  In my book that equals to a bad deal and not a good way to spend $80.-  Would appreciate learning of better alternatives, if they still exist in an era where almost everything is plastic from China.  UPDATE: Early June I ordered a replacement hoping to fare better this time.  Unfortunately no such luck, it is late July and the indispensable LCD display has already given up.  Such a disappointment.  Now considering my options because having to guess when the shaver needs recharging is not a lasting solution.  Anyone out there know of any wet/dry shavers that will actually last...?  FURTHER UPDATE (3/15): I have been extremely pleased for several months now with the Braun wet/dry 5040s.  When I get around to it I will post a review on it elsewhere.  Note that the Braun 5 Series is made in Germany, and has lifetime warranty.  Anyone else who is tired of cheap plastic &amp;#34;make believe&amp;#34; products from China (no disrespect for this great country or its people), I highly recommend the Braun series 5. It is the REAL DEAL folks!  There is not even any comparison between it and the Panasonic shavers.  It is like comparing a Rolls with a rickshaw, or a Porsche with a pedicab!</li>
            <li> Somebody new what they were doing when they designed this shaver. It has everything I was looking for in a shaver, Clean, Close, FAST &amp; no \\&quot; neck burn. \\&quot; The secret is the high motor speed. This is my first Panasonic shaver and as long as they build them with high RPM motors it won&#x27;t be my last.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this product since the price was not given until I added it to my shopping cart.  But I saw it was rated among the highestof all the electric razors, so I thought I should give it a try.  I was amazed at the quality of the shave I was able to get, and even n more amazed that I got virtually no razor burn.  My beard is really tough, and with other razors I had to go over it several times, and then always wait a day or two before shaving again because my face was so raw.  But with this razor I have not had that issue.  And Price Pros was a great vendor to work with; responsive, with quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty rough beard and have dreaded shaving for years. Any time I would use a razor, even very good razors, I would always develop razor burn. The few times that I shave each year with a blade, I would pay for it.  This Panasonic shaver is great. Gives a close enough shave without the razor burn. I keep a closely trimmed, lined out beard, and this razor actually lets me keep a sharp and clean trim line. I have noticed that the more frequently I use it, the closer the shave and the cleaner the cut.  I have NO razor burn at all.  Love this razor, would recommended it to anyone, especially guys who get razor burn.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with the product thus far with one exception, the screen is too small and does not give me a close shave unless I go over the same area numerous times.  (With my old rotary blade razors I would get a clean shave with only one or two passes.)  All other features are very good however, the head design does not lend itself for a quick clean shave.</li>
            <li> After 15 years of shaving with a regular razor (Gillette sensor excel, Mach 3 , fusion), I finally made a switch to the electric shaver. To give you my background, I am the kind of guy who has to shave everyday. I have pretty sensitive skin prone to razor rash, irritation and burn. Well not anymore. This Panasonic has been great on my skin. No feeling of hypersensitivity after shaving, no irritation and most importantly, no nicks and cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving takes a little longer compared to a regular razor. Some parts of the face can get a little tricky specially the neck area, below the sideburns and under the lip leading to the increased shave time. Other than that, it is a close shave with none of the regular razor side effects. I have primarily used it in the dry mode and a couple of times after wetting my face with tap water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean and charges very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is relatively cheap and is a good choice for someone wanting to make a jump from regular razor to electric. Either way there is a 30 day money back guarantee if you are not happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros : Good Quality of Shave. Inexpensive. Easy to Clean. Fast Charging. Wet and Dry&lt;br /&gt;Cons : Increased shaving time (from negotiating the difficult areas)</li>
            <li> Ok I have read all the good,the bad and the ugly comments concerning this shaver and I am here to tell you that it is a great razor and yes it shaves as close as a blade razor but you will have to make more than one swipe to get the job done  and it will take you about the same time as it takes to shave with a razor blade.I took the advice of another review and I take the blades of the shaver and soak them overnight in isopropyl alcohol and so far it has been 4 weeks and the product works really well.Yes I am a skeptic and I did a lot of research on this razor before buying it from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I dont like shaving one bit and the cost of razor blades is silly, so I went electric quite a few years ago. Ease of use was the primary reason and so I listened to some friends and bought the Norelco rotary type (2 0f them), from the very first I didnt think it did a good job so I complained to them about it to no avail.    Knowing that I needed a new set of blades, which BTW are pricey I started searching for another brand and type. I settled on the Pano 8103S for a Christmas (yeah thats right, Merry Christmas) gift from my wife. After using it now for 4 or so shaves I must say how stupid I was to wait this long in trying something different. It shaves me closer than a razor blade and pretty easy on the skin also. I&#x27;m not one thats easy to please but this gift was one of my best, even better than the tie with fishes on it lol. No kidding though, I LIKE THIS SHAVER!!  I wish it had a stand up charging unit like the more expensive models.  BV</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to give as a present. When he got it he had already shaved that morning but he tried it out and was amazed by how much closer the shave was. He has a heavy beard and this left his face baby smooth. My only complaint is that it took 20 days to arrive. If you&#x27;re not in a hurry to get this I would highly recomend purchaseing this shaver.</li>
            <li> This has a cord charger. I just plug in the cord to the shaver and the outlet and charge once or twice weekly. Much more powerful than my $30 Panasonic 2-blade. I still like my 2-blade for my thin mustache (I use the 2 head part, not just the trimmer on my mustache) and also for basic use. Anyway, this triple blade ES8103S tells you it has 100%, 90%, 80%, 70% charge left and so on. It works for my needs. I use the soft switch position. The trimmer works good, but I think the slide switch is a bit too small. This is also lightweight.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this Panasonic product for a couple of reasons. First, I wanted to see how it would fair against my old electric shavers from different manufacturers (Braun &amp; Remington). My second reason for purchasing this product was on the strength of the feedback that I had read on Amazon.     This is a good electric shaver, with a great battery life. When it comes to shaving though, its not nearly as good as the Remington that I used to have. Which is both good and bad. Bad in the sense that as I have thick hair I sometimes have to go over a patch of skin several times before I get a clean shaven look and feel. Good in the sense that as the blades aren&#x27;t super sharp its very kind on my skin (which is a bonus considering I have sensitive skin).    The manufacturer claims that you can have a wet shave with this razor - and indeed you can. You can also wash the head of the razor and get the accumulated stubble out of there. However, what they don&#x27;t tell you is that, if you do end up washing the razor or having a wet shave - and you let it air dry (that is to say that you don&#x27;t towel or paper tissue dry it immediately) you will be left with a musty smelling razor. This doesn&#x27;t inhibit the performance of the razor one bit but its more than a little annoying to have a brand new musty smelling razor - it doesn&#x27;t exactly make me look forward to shaving my face in the morning!    So all in all - if you choose to purchase this product - you can expect to buy a good performing razor that is easy on your skin but has a tendancy to smell musty if you don&#x27;t dry it properly.</li>
            <li> Previous Brauns and Remington&#x27;s just don&#x27;t compare to this shaver.  Its high speed motor cuts without any pulling or razor burn.  I usually get about six shaves before recharging which is less than projected but acceptable.  Cleaning is a breeze - the digital screen reminds you when to simply hold it under the faucet with some hand soap as well as showing the remaining charge.  For the money this shaver is hard to beat !  The price was good and delivery was ahead of schedule.  I recommend it highly as well as Amazon&#x27;s prompt service.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this razor.  It is quite and gives a very close shave without razor burn. Fast charging also.  Would recommend this Razor to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have used different electric razors through the years and this is the first that I have used that gave me a very close shave on 3 days growth in half the time of others.  Clean up is very easy, a drop of liquid soap and a little water on turbo clean and a quick rinse.  Can&#x27;t get much easier.  I switched from a Braun of 4 years after my base unit would no longer lock down for cleaning or charging.  I used tape to hold it down for 2 years.  I wish I would have switched a long time ago.    If you are debating on getting another razor, get this one.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I like the ease of this shaver ,cuts pretty close I guess,but will probably return back to my mach 3 . I&#x27;m only getting 4-5 shaves out of full charge. I used to shave every other day with reg razor now its everyday with electric</li>
            <li> This is a quality product.     I now use 3 shavers in turn for daily shaving:  a Braun Pulsonic 9595;  a Panasonic ES8103s; and   a Norelco Spectra 8825 XL.    The Panasonic works the best: close shaving, fast, and comfortable;   The Braun also works well, though the noise is a little too loud;   The Norelco gives close shaving, but would leave me with some razor burn most of the times after shaving.    I shave with Panasonic and Braun most the time, and occasionally with Norelco.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!! This electric shaver is way better than any razor blade I&#x27;ve ever used. It shaves really close, doesn&#x27;t hurt the skin, and does the job in half the time a razor blade requires. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> For some reason for the last 20 years I assumed you could not get a close shave from an electric razor.....      Well the Panasonic ES8103S completely changed my mind.    Shaves as close as a razor and shaving cream, with no mess or cuts.    If you are skeptical give it a shot, and you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very well thought out/designed product. Works great for shaving my head which was the main reason I bought it. Keeps a charge for a very long time and cleans up easily. Works good wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shaved w/an electric razor for about 15 years.  Up until the Panasonic, I&#x27;d only used Braun.  My first Braun lasted about 6 years.  Wow, quality stuff, right?  Well, not really because my next 2 Brauns (5735) only lasted about 2 yrs each.  With the Braun prices going up and the quality of the Braun razors apparently going south, I decided to switch brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a lot of reviews and settled on the ES8103S because of the percentage of 4-5 star reviews and the relatively low price.  I&#x27;ve had 2 of these razors over the past 2 yrs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  Really fast charging.  The on-screen LCD showed 100% charge in about an hour...pretty darn fast.  A single charge is good for ~7 or 8 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  The Panasonic shaves my face closer than Braun with less effort.  The Panasonic really seems to glide over my face and neck with virtually no pull.  It almost feels like it&#x27;s rolling over my face while the Braun always felt like I was dragging it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  The trimmer works far better than my Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  Because several reviewers said this razor was noisy, I was a bit worried...needlessly.  The Panasonic gives off a high-pitched hum - kinda like an electric mosquito - but is still more quiet than my Brauns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  Cleaning took less than a minute.  Just 2 drops of dish detergent and run it under the faucet.  I laugh when I think of the over-engineered cleaning/charging station used by the Braun...expensive, took up needless counterspace, and time consuming.  Panasonic has done it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LCD display is poorly engineered.  I had to send my first one back as defective since the display went out after 2 charges.  On my replacement razor, the display lasted about 4 mths.  My display has been &#x27;black&#x27; now for over a year.  The razor still works fine, but it is a pain to have to guess when to charge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  Even tho it&#x27;s a far better razor and less than half the price of the Braun, I can&#x27;t recommend a razor with defective electronics.  Too bad because it&#x27;s a really good shaver...just faulty.the Braun, I can&#x27;t recommend a razor with defective electronics.  Too bad because it&#x27;s a really good shaver...just faulty.</li>
            <li> I love this razor use it everyday. I cant beleive how long it last w/o charging, I like having the charge meter on the razor to tell you the amount of charge is left, It the smoothest shave from an electric razor I have ever had. I am 75 years old and have had about 50 electric rzors in my lifetime. Do yourself a favor and get one,They are reasonably priced.   smooth Larry       ps. ordered mine from amazon and had it in 3 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve own Braun shavers for years. When my Braun died decided to give Panasonic a try. I&#x27;m glad I did ,the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Buy this shaver you won&#x27;t be disapointed.</li>
            <li> I am 74 years old and this is the best shave I have ever had. I have been shaveing with a norelco shaver for 35 years and loved them but this shaver works for better. Does not burn my neck. I love it</li>
            <li> This shaver replaced another Panasonic electric shaver (ES8018) which I have used for about four years. Interestingly the difference in the quality of the actual shave is more incremental then one would imagine when comparing the two shavers. The neck area is still a challenge for both shavers, although the this shaver does give a somewhat closer shave. I still find myself quickly going over my neck area with my Fusion razor when I want to get a close clean shave on my neck. I do find that this shaver does do a much better job on my chin area. In total I still find using an electric shaver a trade off which is acceptable for every day use, but for special occassions or just when I want to get a really close shave a blade is far superior. Also, I find that for touching up areas around the mustach or sideburns a blade is required to get a clean looking close shave. The Fusion or Proglide shave is much superior but at the exhorbonant price per blade using a good quality razor such as this Panasonic (especially at the discounted price paid) is both an acceptable tradeoff and a is an acceptable shave for everyday use. Shaving is a personal experience and I realize that many individuals may get a great shave with an electric shaver and as such my specific issues are based upon a person with sensitive skin and a fairly heavy beard. The shaver itself does not cause any irritation to my skin while giving a good shave and I would recommend this shaver as long as a perspective user does not think he will be getting the ultimate shave. The battery charge lasts for 8 to 9 shaves and the recharge is quite fast.</li>
            <li> Wow...had an older electric razor that was top rated some years ago.  Had some problems with my chin breaking out using old electric razor as well as bladed razor.  This Panasonic is TERREFIC..and the price was at least 20% better than local retailers.  Should have purchased this years ago!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with my shaver; provides an excellent shave, very comfortable to hold while shaving.  I have tender skin and it has yet to nick me.  Recharge time is quite quick, useful to know if you forget to recharge, as you can not shave with it while it is being recharged.  Very easy to clean.  Excellent value for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor after much searching and I must say I&#x27;m very impressed. it has its flaws but they are nothing that would make me not recommend it to my friends. here&#x27;s my pros/cons list:  Pros:  Incredibly close shave, closer then a manual razor for me  Battery lasts a long time (1 month for me @3 times per week)  Easy to clean  Able to use in the water  Ability to lock the head     Cons:  Can miss small stubble and be hard to get it  Metallic smell even after a month of use and cleaning every time  Cleanup makes a mess, it sprays water everywhere    So on my pros list the shave is the closest I&#x27;ve ever gotten. I came from a Gillette fusion something or other and its not even a close second. I am Caucasian with Hispanic roots so I have some thicker stubble after this thing mows through it and leaves my face super soft. (the wife is impressed) The ability to lock the head is great for the chin and sides of the face. makes it work so much better.  I wouldn&#x27;t call this a con but it is a issue I had in the beginning. I am 22 and still have acne breakouts and it can knick real badly if careless. the first shave was pretty bloody, but once I got used to it, no more issues. just something in my situation might want to consider, a norelco might be more forgiving. The only other issue I&#x27;ve got could be a common issue but since this is my first electric razor ill mention it. my face smells like a wet nickel after shaving with water. It hasn&#x27;t improved much even after use.    all in all it&#x27;s a great razor and a great buy. :-)</li>
            <li> Bought it for my man, he never used electric shaver, so it is definitely something to get to use to. For the first few times it takes time, but shaves really smooth and no cuts and no irritation! He likes it, but still getting use to it!</li>
            <li> Basically, the ES8103S can deliver a close, clean shave. It charges fully in about 1 hour, providing 7-8 shaves, and the charge display (at 10% increments) is a nice feature to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the expectations from &#x27;nano-cut blades for added sharpness&#x27; and &#x27;13,000 RPMs&#x27;  fell short for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Shaving time:&lt;br /&gt;I hoped I was going to save on shaving time with this shaver but it takes just as long to get a good shave as it did with my previous Panasonic which ran at less than half the price  [[ASIN:B0001209OO Panasonic ES4026NC Pro Curve Rechargeable Double Blade Wet/Dry Men&#x27;s Shaver, Blue/Yellow]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Grip:&lt;br /&gt;The handle is too narrow, and that does not make for a comfortable grip even for average sized hands. A shorter beefier handle would have made it much more practical as well as let you set it standing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Noise Level:&lt;br /&gt;The high pitched sound - although not too loud - draws away from the shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other notes:&lt;br /&gt;The shaver cannot be used while plugged in, but being a Wet/Dry shaver that&#x27;s for safety sake of course.&lt;br /&gt;I only use it for dry shave. Have not tried the trimmer yet.</li>
            <li> Never had much luck with electric shavers, and this one didn&#x27;t raise the bar much.  This shaver does fairly well with cheeks and the neck, but struggles a little with the spaces in between.  It just can&#x27;t get every hair, especially if you don&#x27;t shave every day.  However,for the price it competes well with more expensive shavers.</li>
            <li> A little irritation at first then my face got used to the shave much faster than with my other razors.</li>
            <li> Great electric razor. I did a lot of searching for what would work for me (first time electric razor user) and with my thinner, lighter colored hair I needed the foil razor. This one works great, I still haven&#x27;t replaced the blades and its been a year now. I shave about 2-3 times max a week. Also the battery is good for about 8-10 shaves for me.</li>
            <li> I have never had good luck from an electric razor.  I bought this one specifically to shave my head after reading some reviews on the Panasonic razors.  WOW, I am so impressed.  I first tried it dry like any other electric razor I have used.  I had better results than all the others, but not quite as good as a standard razor; however, no razor burn which I normally have problems with regardless of the razor.  I then tried it with shaving cream to find the only difference between the results of this razor and a standard razor was the lack of razor burn. I am SOLD! I&#x27;m sure there might be some microscopic difference between the closeness of the shave, but I couldn&#x27;t tell.  Works well for shaving the head too.  Completely smooth.  (No, I&#x27;m not naturally balding. This means it would be a task for any razor, but with just a little bit of time it has great results.)  Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s third or fourth shaver, and by far his favorite. It gives a nice close shave without any irritation (he has sensitive skin). The trimmer blade opens out at a 90-degree angle, which is more practical for shaving necks and sideburns than other shavers he has owned, where the blade simply rose above the foils. The LED battery level display is a nice practical touch the prevents surprise dead batteries.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the difference this new razor makes.  I&#x27;ve had a great panasonic 3 blade razor for over 7 years now, and it&#x27;s been great.  However, rather than get new blades for it (which is all it really needed), I got a new razor.  Very impressed. My old Panasonic wet/dry lasted forever, and the battery still easily holds a charge for over a week.  But this new one cuts very close and comfortably and is better in every way.  It even cuts close dry.  Unbelievable.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Ergonomic design and a really close shave. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of different razors and this is the best by far.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well. Even when I go a few days without shaving and the forest starts it will get through it. I have sensitive skin and this has been doing very well for me. I get a bump every now and then but could be I am doing something wrong. I haven&#x27;t used a razor in 20 years because I would always get bumps on my neck that looked horrible. I tried this and it really works well. The battery life is excellent and the charge time is very short. I use this for a few minutes every morning and end up charging it every couple of weeks. There is a digital display that will tell you the amount of battery life that is left. I am around 4 months with this now and the blades still cut well after using it almost daily. The trimmer on the back works surprisingly well for an edge up or rouge hairs. This also has a cleaning mode to help keep the blades sharp longer. For the price I think this is an awesome shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of wet/dry electric shavers.  This one works pretty well.  I like the LCD battery indicator.  Battery seems to last reasonably long.  No complaints here.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he really likes it.  Great price too.</li>
            <li> Taken 2-3 shaves with this item.  The first was with the most facial hair and it did quite poorly. It took a long time to shave and some patches and locations just would never shave away.  The second and third shave I had only one days growth and it worked a bit better.  But in all cases I have to go over my entire face with a disposable after using this unit. Because things improved, I assume that things will continue to improve.  But if I always need to finish the job manually, I cannot justify keeping this shaver.  Note that this has always been the story with me when I buy electrics over the years. I was very hopeful that this would be the answer to my shaving needs, but I hardly think it is going to.</li>
            <li> Outstanding shaver -- I selected this shaver after careful research for a electric shaver for shaving the head and I use it on a daily to semi daily basis and I am extremely happy with the results. I clean it with a spray bottle of alcohol after each shave.         I did try it once both with a wet shave and with shaving cream and it felt weird to me probably because I never tried it before with any other shaver so I continue to use it as a dry shaver with excellent results every time.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this razor.  He shaves his whole head and face with it.  Very smooth, as if he used a blade.</li>
            <li> All these years, I believed in the marketing hype and used the rotary shavers from Norelco(including arcitec 1050) and lived with the conclusion that if I wanted a smooth silky shave, I will have to use a razor blade.    What was I thinking? I have always been a fan of Panasonic electronic items right from the days of the old tape recorders, VHS players, and it&#x27;s HDTV  and cordless phone sets. I should have put the trust in Panasonic and got their non-rotary shavers long time ago. Oh well, live and learn.    This razor is the best razor ever. It has the finesse of a Gillete Mach3 minus the cuts and bruises.  If you use it with the Nivea Gel, the skin is so soft and smooth, that my wife keeps gliding her hands over my cheeks over and over again.    Technically speaking, it has two sets of linear blades, and a set of trimmer between the two blades. This is such a beautiful system that I can now even shave my private parts without fearing any cuts and my wife loves it now!!    Thank you Panasonic.Thank you Nivea!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a really great shaver. I like using it in the shower with shaving cream and it leaves my face smooth as a babys bottom. I&#x27;ve normally used basic razors and $40 electric shavers, but this is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tortured myself with rotary razors (Philips, Norelco, and Remington) for over twenty five years. I&#x27;ve even tried a Braun foil shaver once- the screen failed after 8 months of use giving me a nice cut on the chin. I ordered the Panasonic because of the very favorable reviews and because I was tired of shaving for 20-25 minutes with my Philips rotary which was just over a year old. The new blades would have cost me nearly $40.00 to replace, so I figured what the heck? GLAD I DID! In anticipation of the new razor arriving, I skipped shaving for three days to give it a proper test against my old razor. It literally took me a minute and a half to shave! I could hardly believe it! Not only was it quick, the shave was much closer than I have ever experienced with ANY of my previous razors. Smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. The razor does require more than one pass, and as in other reviews, it is louder than a rotary. The sound is not bad though and is frankly not an issue at all. It needs to be charged in order to shave, but it charges very quickly. Based on my use so far, a charge should give me 7-10 shaves per charge. I would highly recommend this product to anyone wanting a good electric razor. I will never go back.</li>
            <li> Very Good and on time.</li>
            <li> exceeded expectations. very close shave</li>
            <li> No more skin irritation, works great so far been using 2 weeks. Almost as close as a razor without razor burn. I shave dry it may work even better wet.</li>
            <li> The item has been in use for approximately 3/4 weeks. It took some time to get used to using it vs. using a blade rezor. It has become a favorite task to shave. The product provides a close shave with ease of use. It is enjoyable and it appears to give facial skin a rejuvinated look.</li>
            <li> Works great I use it to shave my neck and no razor burn anymore good buy expensive disposable razors.</li>
            <li> Great shaver! This is my second Panasonic, and I love it. My first still works great, but needed a new blade and foil, and when I saw this one at such a great deal, I figured it was better to get a whole new one with a new battery for pretty much the same price. My other Panasonic is a higher end model that came with an automatic cleaning system as well, but I find this razor works just as well and I don&#x27;t miss the cleaning system. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> A great Electric Shaver</li>
            <li> My husband recieved this for Christmas and he says the shaver portion works well but the trimmer is very lightweight compared to his other shavers.</li>
            <li> I have been using Panasonic for many years, but this is so better improved than older models.&lt;br /&gt;very smooth, but not harsh for skin. I have very sensitive skin and Braun is too sharp for me.&lt;br /&gt;Wet &amp; dry is nice, moving head is nice although I don&#x27;t use that function.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and close shave</li>
            <li> Look, it will hurt at first. I was furious with this little shaver. How can it charge so quickly, last so long, look so cool but pull out my facial hair like tweezers?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month, my face was used to this shaver. It works great and I love it. Plus, long lasting battery. I highly recommend this electric shaver to anyone and everyone</li>
            <li> This is a phenomenal shaver.  I have had one for around 6 years and it still works like a charm, with the original blades.  The battery lasts around 10 days, even after all this time.  It doesn&#x27;t pull hairs.  Even after not shaving for several days, it will power through the hair.</li>
            <li> Shaves good, fast, easy to use, my husband likes it very much.  Would buy it again if I had to.  Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor I ever owned!</li>
            <li> It works well and performs as expected. It has done everything that I need and more.  Good choice for me.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with this product until I tried to shave with it. I don&#x27;t have particularly thick facial hair, but it takes half a dozen passes to come close to getting it all, and even then I can see some hairs it missed. These are especially on my upper lip, and perhaps are laying more flat? So I end up using a disposable blade if i actually want a good shave, kind of disappointing. I considered returning it, but it is useful for trimming the nose and ear hair, I guess, or a quick non-shower shave.</li>
            <li> I have recently owned a Phillips (Norelco) Arcitec.  Before that another Norelco, Braun, and years ago a Remington. None of these come close to the level of matching a blade for a close shave as the Panasonic ES8103S.  If you take the time to do it right, you will get a shave virtually as close as a blade in the dry mode. I haven&#x27;t even tried it yet in wet mode because the results have been so good. I have a medium heavy beard and it is great.  No problem with curved areas like the chin or neck contours.  Pop up trimmer is also very good. decent battery life, easy to clean. The only surprise was the high-pitched whine of the motor, but you get used to that.  However, at first, your sleeping partner may think that the alarm clock has gone off. 100% recommendation for this product, especially given the rather modest price.</li>
            <li> This review is for women who currently use or are considering using an electric shaver. I have sensitive skin and have been using an electric shaver on my legs for many years. I always shave in the shower using shaving cream. Until now, I have used assorted women&#x27;s wet/dry models from Remington, Conair, and Panasonic. None of them produced as close a shave as a razor but for me it was acceptable that I was trading the close shave for less damage to my skin. It was time to buy a new one again and I read in a consumer article that there&#x27;s no reason that a woman couldn&#x27;t use a men&#x27;s model foil shaver. After doing some research, I purchased the ES8103 from Panasonic. I have been using it now for about 6 weeks. In one word &amp;#34;Wow!&amp;#34;. Here&#x27;s why:  1. Most importantly is the quality of the shave. The shave feels as close as a razor without damaging my skin. Vastly superior to all of the women&#x27;s models that I have tried. I am amazed at how smooth the skin is after a shave. For women who are first transitioning to an electric shaver, remember that it will take a few weeks for your skin to adjust before you start getting close shaves.  2. There is a display (100%, 90%, 80%...) of how much charge is remaining. None of the women&#x27;s models have this. To make sure that I wouldn&#x27;t run out of power mid-shave, I was constantly charging the women&#x27;s models. When they weren&#x27;t holding their charge as well, there were times that the unit would stop mid-shave. I don&#x27;t see that happening with the ES8103.  3. The ES8103 charges to full capacity in 1 hour. I&#x27;d leave my other models plugged in overnight or longer. Also, all of the women&#x27;s models had a charging base (cradle) which is not very practical to pack when you travel. The ES8103 has a simple plug and cord (like for your cell phone).  4. While the ES8103 weighs a little more than the women&#x27;s models, it is actually much better balanced and therefore, I find it much easier to use. Even though I have small hands, there is enough tapering in the middle that it is very comfortable to hold.  I am delighted with this shaver. Used in the shower with shaving cream, it gives my legs the best shave ever. I will not go back to any of the women&#x27;s models.  Update 03/22/2017: I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s 5 yrs later and I&#x27;m still using the same shaver! None of the women&#x27;s models lasted anywhere near that (if I recall maybe 12-18 months). Yes, I periodically replace blades and foil; that&#x27;s to be expected. Battery still holds its charge well and I still get a good shave on my legs. Now that&#x27;s good value :)</li>
            <li> I gave up on electric shavers years ago when I couldn&#x27;t find one that did not irritate my neck regardless of how long I tried to let my skin \\&quot;adjust\\&quot;.  I recently found myself in a situation where I needed to shave at least twice a day.  Safety razors were a real pain and I decided to try electrics again.    After reading the reviews, I selected the Panasonic ES8103S.  It does not irritate my neck.  It didn&#x27;t irritate on the first day and it still hasn&#x27;t.  It doesn&#x27;t shave as well as a blade either.  There are places that it leaves stubbly regardless of what I try.  So, I pull out a safety razor and finish the job.  Luckily, I don&#x27;t need shaving cream for such minor touch up work.    In effect, this electric shaver has mostly replaced shaving cream, making the shaving task quicker.  Still, on those occasions that I need a close shave (date nights, schmoozing, ...) I use a razor and shaving cream.</li>
            <li> It took me three tries to find a decent replacement for my old Braun 2000 series shaver after it finally died.  Started off with a Remington and was not happy, it would take forever to produce only a halfway decent shave.    Next I tried a newer Braun.  It was better than the Remington, but similar problem in that it took a long time to shave and did not shave as close as my old Braun 2000.    Third time was the charm with the Panasonic.  Produces fast close shave and at reasonable noise levels.  I prefer using it dry, but it did ok the one time I used it in the shower.    The trimmer could be a little better but overall I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Released product very good. I just add the sizes of blades to suit the height of the cut, because the cuts are very close to the skin.   Not the sideboard, but Razor! It is excellent!</li>
            <li> Well where do I begin?  I bought this electric razor when it was priced around $78.  I saw the price recently dropped to $69.99 and I can see why.  This razor is an overpriced piece of plastic and I would not pay $20 for this thing.    Pros:  -Looks nice... that&#x27;s about it         -Impressively close shave for an electric razor BUT only if you&#x27;re willing to shave all your skin off with the hair    Cons: -Loud to the point the noise hurts your ears when you shave any part of your face or neck near your ears        -Constantly misses hairs no matter how many times you try to shave them so you need a tweezer to pull the hairs out        -Inconsistent and uneven shave        -Terrible design (If you have a tight or average jawline the head of the razor will be too big and make it nearly          impossible to shave hairs along the jawline even though the head flexes side to side)        -Deceiving charging meter fails to show individual percents (such as 1%,2%,3% and so on) so you only have levels of           100%,90%...20%,10% meaning once you get to 10% you have no idea when the shaver is going to die on you      I have struggled with sensitive skin with shaving ever since I began shaving.  I easily get razor bumps and acne when I shave too close or get any cuts from shaving.  In fact, the only acne I ever get comes from shaving because if I don&#x27;t shave it goes away.  I read online that the best thing for people with sensitive skin and acne is to shave with an electric razor so I decided to try this one after all the positive reviews.  The first time I used this shaver I was impressed.  I got a close shave and I didn&#x27;t see any cuts yet for some reason the center of my neck was extremely red.  I soon realized my neck was red because that entire region had been rubbed raw and my skin felt like a first degree burn the entire day.  So the next time I decided to not press so hard and go slower.  This time I found the shave completely uneven and my neck was still slightlyraw even using shaving cream.  Some spots would be smooth, others would have stubble, and others would just have hairs that looked uncut.  Keep in mind I didn&#x27;t change my shaving method at all while shaving, the razor just shaved some hairs so they were cut shorter than others as the razor passed.  Since they were not all cut the same length I had to go back over each region to get an even shave otherwise my face would look ridiculous.  As I tried to even out the shave I found that it took several passes (like 5 or 6)to finally make all the hairs even length and by then I had multiple cuts all over my face and neck.  One thing to note is that I do not have a thick beard at all and I usually can get by shaving once every two days or so and even though I tried this razor every day for a few weeks dry, with soap, and with shaving cream and no matter what I continually had the same problem and the hairs never \\&quot;adjusted\\&quot; to the razor as everyone claims they do.  As I continued to use this razor I found that the electric razor irritated my skin more than my 3 blade razors ever had and my acne only got worse rather than better.  Overall the problem with the razor is there are only two shaves: An extremely close shave that will leave you skin raw and cause more skin irritation than any regular razor or a uneven shave that looks like you just decided to randomly press the razor against several spots on your skin and then just stopped there.      In the end I simply returned this product and chose to go with the single bladed disposable razors and so far those have been the best for my sensitive skin and have eliminated nearly all my previous problems with razor bumps and acne.</li>
            <li> This review is for the Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Rechargeable Linear Pivot Action Shaving System,Silver.  Very close shave, but slow.  I must go over the same areas multiple times.  Cleaning is easy with liquid soap and rinsing under the faucet.  Battery is good enough for about 4 shaves. I have never tried shaving wet. Overall, a good value as long as you&#x27;re not in a hurry.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband when his last shaver finally died. It had great reviews, but I don&#x27;t understand why. It is very loud!! The worst part is that my husband now spends more time shaving than he did with his old shaver, and it never seems to get close enough. It looks like he has a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, even after he just spent 10 minutes shaving.</li>
            <li> My husband has very sensitive skin and refused to shave closely before receiving this razor. Now he is always as smooth as a baby with no razor burn or in grown hairs to bother him!</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband and he thought he wouldn&#x27;t like it at all -- but he actually loves it.  He goes through electric razors like crazy so I am please that this one is now a year and a half old and still going strong.</li>
            <li> I use this when I don&#x27;t have time to shave with my DE shaving kit (usually M-F). I love the fact that it&#x27;s waterproof so I can kill two birds with one stone (shower+shave), but it doesn&#x27;t do too well of a job on the hairs around the throat. I usually shave that area with a quick and dirty DE job just so I can get out of the door. Holds a charge very well (through to the next week usually) so I have no complaints there.</li>
            <li> Best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used, but it does have one flaw. It has a digital display near the on/off button for the battery strength. It went to 0% the last time I used it, so I plugged it in thinking I could use it plugged in to the electrical socket, WRONG! It had to recharge for 10 minutes before I could use it. They do this so when your battery starts to lose it you have to replace the battery (probably at half the cost of the razor). Typical throw away technology. My last razor I used 15 years, replaced the heads twice, but not the battery as I just plugged it into the wall.</li>
            <li> I used to hate shaving, this razor changed that after my first shave with it. It gave me as close a shave as my 4 blade razor does and with less skin irritation. Highly recommend this product, it may cost a bit more than your average shaver but it is not your average shaver.  Also, it is a bit difficult to get to some neck areas but I have had this problem with all electric shavers, regardless of design.</li>
            <li> Closest shave of any low to mid range razor that I have owned. Much better shave than the Philips Norelco.  Problems are it is very noisy, leaves hair on the outside of the razor, and the travel case is a cloth bag.  I still prefer it over the Norelco, but may need to spend more in the future on a Braun</li>
            <li> I have tried the different modes with dry shave and wet shave and I can not get a close shave with this product. Even more annoying is the beard trimmer, which is clearly of low quality construction. It not only does not trim very well, but because it comes off of the side of the shaver and does not extend past the shaver head, it is nearly impossible to see what you are trimming!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a Norelco rotary head shaver. Overall, I&#x27;m much happier with this. It shaves better than the last 2 shavers I&#x27;ve had. My only complaint is that when you shave with the Panasonic, the stubble goes everywhere and is not contained within the shaver head.  So if you&#x27;re in the bathroom and don&#x27;t mind getting stubble all over...it&#x27;s great. If you&#x27;re on the go and shaving in the car or something, you probably will want to buy something else.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased that I purchased this product. It works very easily and is extremely effective in giving me and excellent close shave. I have owned other Panasonic raizors in the past and have always been pleased with the results I have gotten.</li>
            <li> Very good product, it does what it ought to. But be aware, it is super noisy!!!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my new Panasonic ES8103 arc3 Electric Shaver wet or dry. Ray</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband and he loves it.  It has the wet/dry feature so he can use it in the shower.  He says it is easy to hold and use--shaves are close and comfortable.  I don&#x27;t think you could find a better shaver for the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had Norelcos and felt it was normal to use a Gillette every couple of days to get a close shave.  This shaves like a baby&#x27;s butt and I haven&#x27;s even tried it with a wet shave yet.  It&#x27;s easy to clean, easy to charge and I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
            <li> We bought this in preparation for a surgical procedure that prohibited my husband from using a razor blade. It works so well. The little pop-up blade on the back is ideal for small areas and a quick touch-up of the neck area between haircuts. It holds its charge well, too. A friend bought another product much more cheaply and complained that it worked poorly. In this case, we felt our money was well spent.</li>
            <li> I tried getting by with cheap shavers for a long time but they kept yanking out hairs and not giving me a close shave.  I often got infected follicles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver has been much different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not irritate my skin, pull hairs, or cut me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get a smooth comfortable shave every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver even tells me when it&#x27;s time to clean and it&#x27;s easy to remove the foil, clean and re-assemble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just hold it under running water and hold the button down for two seconds so it can go into its sonic cleaning mode.  After about five seconds it&#x27;s clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The convenience of the option to use this shaver wet or dry is nice when I want to shave in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flip out trimmer is nice for sideburns and for those long hairs on my toes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery lasts a long time and the digital percentage guage tells me exactly how much battery I have left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it gets down to ten percent it flashes to remind me it&#x27;s time to charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery charges up fully in under two hours!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this shaver is it comes with a proprietary charging cable and it says in the manual if you ever lose it the only way to get a replacement is to throw away your shaver and buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder how many shavers they sell just because of that...</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor based on Consumer Reports recommendations and Amazon user reviews.  I would say those sources are generally accurate, and I&#x27;ll add the following comments.  This razor does not shave as close as a blade, but neither does any other electric razor I&#x27;ve used.  Getting a reasonably close shave takes time and multiple passes over the same areas, unlike a blade where two passes (one \\&quot;with the grain\\&quot; and one \\&quot;against the grain\\&quot;) produces a truly close shave.  So in my opinion, there&#x27;s nothing special about the ES8103, but it&#x27;s basically a good razor and I like the battery level display which allows you to judge whether or not there&#x27;s a complete shave left in the battery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the shaver for three weeks and so far so good. Have used only as a dry shaver so far, but that&#x27;s my routine.  My last couple of razors have been Braun&#x27;s and this one so far has been better than both of them. I love the closeness of the shaves as well as the ease of cleaning the razor. Just use a little water and some hand soap, it&#x27;s done in three minutes, no more expensive cleaning docks and the cleaner that goes with them. This razor also has a fast re-charge time, it&#x27;s done in an hour. Lastly, the noise level of this razor is normal, it&#x27;s no louder than a Braun, Remington or Norelco..... I would definitely recommend this product if your looking for a new electric razor.</li>
            <li> This is a great price for this shaver, I received on time, and it is working just fine, I prefer to use it dry instead of wet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for about 13 years now. My last shaver was a Braun and it still works fine but I was ready for something new. I bought this Panasonic shaver and I swear I spend double the time shaving! I like to save time when I shave, especially if I&#x27;m running late. I have requested a refund for this item and will buy a new Braun shaver. I must say, the battery life is pretty good on this thing. I just wish it did a better job shaving.</li>
            <li> I have tried electric shavers in the past but have always gone back to a traditional razor, even after using the very expensive electrics. I decided to bite the bullet again and saw awesome reviews on this shaver. The price was something else I couldn&#x27;t pass up. All of the reviews were right! This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had and now I shave with it every day. I take it into the field with me when I do military training as well, and it stands up to everything! Just make sure you put the cover on the blade. It stays in my ruck sack and will keep enough charge for me to shave every day for about a week and a half without a charge. Just Awesome!!</li>
            <li> I just bought this shaver 4 weeks ago based on lots of reviews on this site and some new technology. But to my utmost surprise, no one has ever said anything about back and forth motion. Every razor in this world works both ways - back and forth motions. It is so much hyped about one pass shaving. But that is just not true. One pass leaves a lot of hair not cut. I am using Remington classic to cut the rest of the hair with backside motion.  I used to own Panasonic ES8066 and still own it. It still works so great and works both ways. ES8103 does not come even close to ES8066. I called Panasonic technical support for shavers and the lady picks up the phone who had no clue what I meant by back and forth motion. It is just so weird.     I would not recommend this to anyone. Nano technology is worse than the old technology. If I have to use two shavers to get a one day shave, it should go to the drawing board again and worked on it and tested extensively before releasing into the common market. Panasonic should make a big note of it. I would even like to hear the comments from Panasonic on this.    Rocky</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had remingtons because they were cheaper. I wasn&#x27;t dissapointed with them and they do the job but now that I&#x27;ve had this one for over a month I can tell you that its much better. I do feel that i get a closer shave but it does not irritate the skin at all. I always spray a little cologne before I leave to the office and there is no awful burn after shaving with this panasonic. For years i&#x27;ve had that burn and its a little weird not feeling that. I recommend you buy this shaver if you don&#x27;t want to spend more than $100. This gets you into panasonics best thechnology without the gizmos.</li>
            <li> So far I love this shaver.  I&#x27;m a former Braun user, and when their product went substandard, I went with this Panasonic shaver.  It is pretty much a &#x27;one pass&#x27; shaver.  It uses a lithium battery, so it&#x27;s display always shows how much of a charge you have in percentage.  Plus, it will let you know when it&#x27;s time to clean it.  Cleaning it is really easy and just requires a little liquid soap squirt onto the top of the shaver, a little water and then the push of a button.  20 seconds later you rinse it clean with another 20 second cycle.  40 seconds to clean a shaver is pretty darn good.     I and my family have used Braun electric shavers for the past 9 years. Up until now I felt that their shavers were one of the best. I replaced an old Braun shaver with this one (Braun Series 3 340 Men&#x27;s Shaver) in May of 2011 and paid a premium price for it. The first thing I noticed is that it didn&#x27;t have the same cutting power as the older one. Plus the design wasn&#x27;t as solid. After six months of use, a part inside shook loose and now it buzzes loudly and the whole unit shakes in my hand. So having called Braun about the warranty their &#x27;outsourced&#x27; customer service asked a lot of questions to see if the product had been misused in any way and then said I must ship it to their local repair affiliate at my expense. From this they will determine whether or not to repair or replace it. BTW - hang on to your receipts or you will not have a warranty.  We sent it in and are waiting for their response. In the meantime, since I have no idea when I&#x27;ll have a working razor again (as they offered no turn-around time), I purchased a highly rated &#x27;Panasonic ES 8103 S&#x27; which so far has been excellent. So much better quality and engineering than the Braun. Clean and mostly one pass shaving, easy to clean and maintain. A lot of thought when into the design of the Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this model razor. The first was stolen and I&#x27;ve missed it everyday until the new one arrived. It works really well for my light whisker type both wet and dry. I also like the ergonomic handle.</li>
            <li> This shaver provides a good clean shave.  I already ordered a back-up screen and cutter to have on hand when the time comes I need it.  The shaver is a little lightweight and parts are made of plastic - that&#x27;s why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5.</li>
            <li> does a decent job with the shave, over time the display gives out and it is hard to see what charge remains on the razor</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver with the hopes that it would prevent ingrown hairs that I usually get when I shave. After fully charging it, I gave it a try and was relatively satisfied with the results. Now granted this was my first experience with an electric shaver (I use the old school straight razor), but I thought it took a long time to get a clean shave. After about 15 to 20 minutes of working on my face (which had just a few days of growth), I was almost clean shaven. Almost because there were small patches of hair that refused to be cut down. So it may have been my overly high expectations or the limitations of the product, but I didn&#x27;t think it provided me with an adequate \\&quot;clean shave.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the next day after the shave, I had a severe case of ingrown hairs and it took a couple of days for the subsequent rash to dissipate. I ended up returning the product. Overall, I would recommend buying this product if you don&#x27;t have problems with ingrown hairs and don&#x27;t mind spending some time shaving (which is ironic because I thought the point of an electric shaver was to shave more quickly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, just to be fair, the product seemed well built and solid. I think its useful for some people, but definitely not for everyone. If you want to save your money, I recommend growing a beard, as I&#x27;m currently doing (keeps you warm in the winter, saves on shaving supplies, and makes you look wiser).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waited several months before writing this review, for my beard to fully acclimate to the shave provided by the Panasonic ES8103s Wet/Dry Electric Shaver.    I&#x27;m a mid 60s-year-old man who has used a blade razor for more than 40 years.  The reason I needed to switch to an electric shaver is because of a neurologic condition which has made using a blade razor a dangerous adventure resulting in a lot of nicks and cuts to the face.  After reading many reviews (thanks everyone!) I chose the Panasonic ES 8103s wet/dry shaver directly from Amazon for $79.  It arrived in a few days and was promptly put to use.   Even though it can be used either wet or dry, I find myself using it dry almost every morning.  It fits well in my hand and isn&#x27;t too heavy for the approximately 10 minutes it takes to shave, yet its solidly built and comes apart easily to clean.    As close as the Panasonic ES8103s shaves, neither it nor any other electric shaver will shave as close as a blade - especially some of the new, multi-blade razors.  After the beard adjusts - the shave with the Panasonic will be acceptable.  You may have to \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; if you&#x27;re heading out in the evening after originally shaving in the morning.  I&#x27;ve tried many different pre-shave lotions and found good old Williams Lectric Shave does best.  After shaving, the Panasonic comes apart easily for clean up in soapy water.   It may not equal the shave of a blade razor for closeness - but the Panasonic ERS8103s comes pretty close.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad after his old one (9 years old) quit working.  He is just thrilled with the results.  It gives him the shave that he wants and it charges in a hurry.  He is very happy with this razor.</li>
            <li> Have only used this for a week but it replaced a 8 year old Braun 5601 and man o man, what a performance difference! This thing is night a day difference in speed and close-ness. My old Braun had new razors and screen but was a dog in comparison how quick and close this shaves. I hope I feel this way for next 1-3-5 years with this shaver (of course with new razors from time to time).</li>
            <li> I really like my razor. It is quiet, does a great job cutting my beard. I am very satisfied with this  product.</li>
            <li> Finally a razor that works! I had tried Norelco and Braun and it would take a long time to get a clean shave. This Panasonic has a nice wide trimmer for longer hair, and the shaver makes for a smooth easy shave. I used to have trouble getting the hair on my neck, this razor makes short work of it. Happy with this purchase. May try another type/brand later, but not until this one stops working.</li>
            <li> The charger on this model buzzes when it&#x27;s plugged in. If you&#x27;re over 50 you might not hear it, but this is a deal breaker for me. It wasn&#x27;t a fluke either. Amazon replaced the first unit (with free return shipping), and the second one had the same problem. It&#x27;s too bad too, the shaver gives a nice close shave without any razorburn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electrics for over 40 years.  This shaver is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used by a long shot.  It shaves close and fast.  It is the only one I&#x27;ve owned that does a good job on neck hairs.  It can shave wet or dry.  I shave dry.  I just shaved 2 days growth in less than 3 minutes.  Before It would take at least twice that long.  Plus I&#x27;d have to clean anything it would miss with a disposable that I would just wet and use without any shaving cream.  I used to have to shave the same area over and over and over and...  I&#x27;ve had Norelco, Braun and Remington shavers.  This one replaces a Panasonic which was the best one up until now and lasted about 8 years.  Nano technology is supposed to be a super tough coating that allows the foil to be thinner and resist wearing out.  Time will tell.  The only minor drawback is the charger.  The old one had a stand that you dropped the shaver into. Very convenient.  The new one has a plug which is on the tight side.  I get about 8 - 10 shaves per charge.  It also has an ultra hi speed for cleaning the head.  Just hold the start button down longer and it goes into cleaning mode.  Put a little liquid soap on the surface and it cleans and lubricates.  You then take off the head, rinse and let it dry.</li>
            <li> Takes a few shaves for your skin to get used to it, then it cuts great.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver, especially for the price.  Very powerful compared to my old Panasonic.  Cleans easily and shaves great.  Is it as close as a blade? No, but its the best I have personally used.  If you want blade close, then use a blade.  This shaver was much less irratating to get used to than past shavers also.</li>
            <li> I replaced my old razor with this gem. The first use was a great surprise. I would describe it as \\&quot;quiet speed\\&quot;.  I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> My first one, and I&#x27;m near 75 years old!</li>
            <li> The shaver works good and I can get almost a week&#x27;s shaving before i need to recharge it. I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my husband to replace his 3head rotary shaver. He loves it. Said the rotary pulled his beard, this does not. Easier to use, nicer shave.</li>
            <li> Been buying the same model for over 15 years, have had 3 so far. No one has made a better wet and dry so far.</li>
            <li> Nice balance, close shave. Battery seems to last for 10-12 shaves and then recharges overnight. Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful, but not so perfect as imagined. it is much harder and will be pain after using it. A little disappointment.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my brother.  He loves it.  Very affordable and has many features.  Great buy, and great gift</li>
            <li> This is a first shaver for my teenage son. He really seems to like it and it is gentle on his acne prone skin. It even has a sideburn trimmer which he really likes. Good choice.</li>
            <li> Being my first experience with a wet razor I was unsure if I would like it. Well I must say now I love it!  Ya, I still have to scribble certain areas of my face to get  the closeness I desire, but, the comfort of the shave itself is much better and leaves my face feeling quite refreshed afterward. The shaver itself handles very well and does give a great shave!</li>
            <li> I was a blade man before I got this razor. Cleaning is simple. I tested it wet with shaving later, and it worked great.  However, I use it dry most of the time, because its less messy.</li>
            <li> Takes just a minor amount of getting used to but, once done, it works like a charm.  Nice close shave.  Very handy.  Easy to clean!  Best part is that it&#x27;s fully submersible so you can use it in the shower and it works great with shaving cream.  I would recommend this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a go around with all the electric razors. This one seems to work the best for me. The closest shave and the battery lasts the longest. The motor vibrates so fast there is no tugging or pulling on your skin. The end result is a fast clean smooth shave every time! I highly recommend this Panasonic razor!</li>
            <li> After going through the reviews ,i have bought this and after first use \\&quot;WOW ! ! !\\&quot; was the feeling.    1) A very Close shave  .  2) No mess after the shave.collects all the hair in itself.  2) Does&#x27;nt take time .Good if you are busy .  3) Razor feels good in your hand. Does&#x27;nt leave any vibration effect in your hand.  4) cleaning is a breeze.just hold it under the water .done.  5) Battery is Good. (I have done 3 shaves and still 60% left).</li>
            <li> Works as advertised in shower or out.  Shaves great with soap in shower or shave cream.  Rechargeable battery lasts several weeks before needing a charge.  I highly recommend this shaver especially at this price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of electric shavers, other than that they are a bit more convenient than normal ones. As far as electric shavers go, I don&#x27;t know that I find this one to be the best, but it is completely acceptable - for much less money than any of the better ones I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it, if you are looking for an electric shaver and care at least a bit about the money.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001DNE3KQ Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Rechargeable Linear Pivot Action Shaving System, Silver]]. I have used Remington (a few years back) then Braun (2). I like panasonic products so thought I&#x27;d try this razor. Don&#x27;t really need all the bells and whistles so this one is perfect. It gives me a smooth shave, is easy to handle (pretty light), confortable, and the battery percent left display is a great feature. All in all I really like this razor</li>
            <li> This is by far the best electric razor that I&#x27;ve ever had. It leaves my skin almost as a regular blade would do besides the fact that I can use it while my skin is still wet. I totally recommend it. Great product!</li>
            <li> After using a Norelco shaver for a number of years and thinking that it was the most comfortable shaver, I&#x27;m rather impressed at how well this Panasonic shaves. Looking at the price, I must admit I really didn&#x27;t expect much. But after reading some of the reviews on this product, I gave it a shot. And I&#x27;m glad I did. I used to get burns on some parts of my neck from the Norelco, and I thought it was just my sensitive skin. But no matter how hard I try, I can&#x27;t get the Panasonic to leave any burns! I absolutely love this shaver. It shaves close but is never uncomfortable on my face. This one is a keeper! I&#x27;ve thrown the Norelco into the trash can (minus the battery of course). Just a couple of notes: some reviewers mentioned the noise, and that was my concern at first, but it&#x27;s only as loud as a Norelco. Since the motor runs faster on this, the noise is a little more high pitched than other shavers and some may consider that annoying or loud. It doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. The battery lasts about a week for me, as compared to 1.5 to 2 weeks for the Norelco, but I really don&#x27;t care since this shaver is a class above anything I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> Best feature of this shaver is the close, pain-free, smooth shave. I would say 99% as smooth as razor, the difference is nominal - I can&#x27;t tell the difference visually. I have a thick, tough beard and the Panasonic breezes through in very few passes. I get even better results on shaving the mustache than I do with my razor. The neck area is where the shaver has some difficultly. I think this may be because I shave in the shower and the shaving cream has a tendency to wash off. After a second application of cream I can get as close. No razor burn, no in-grown hairs (I do get these with razors). It takes a few extra minutes to complete the shave compared to razor (maybe 7-8 min vs. 5-6 min). All in all I am pleased with the experience and do not plan to move back to razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** UPDATE ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still highly recommend this shaver for the quality of shave and positive experience with Panasonic. I have had issues with the battery and screen; however, given the benefits that I mentioned above, I am comfortable purchasing this shaver again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me take a step back. I have owned two ES8103S shavers over the past three years. My first shaver began to show problems with the screen after about six or seven months of daily use. Notably, the shaver had evidence of vapor on the inside of the screen. As I have mentioned before, I use it in the shower and it periodically falls. All things considered, the shaver has held up well despite the drops. At some point; however, water must have seeped behind the screen despite not showing any visible sign of damage. After several months, the screen went blank and the battery slowly stopped charging. It went from 5-6 shaves per charge to 4 to 3 to 2, then zero charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So next I called Panasonic (after it finally died) and explained that I received this shaver as a gift and it was purchased about 11 months ago. Since it had a one year warrantee, the Panasonic rep explained that if I could get a copy of the receipt I would be able to send it in for repair or replacement. I was able to send a copy of the Amazon email receipt (from the person that gave me the gift) and Panasonic sent me a pre-paid label to attach to any box to send the shaver in. I had to send the shaver and charger together. After about three weeks I received a brand new ES8103S in the mail. No other calls, email, or follow-up was necessary on my part. Despite the three weeks without a shaver, I thought this was fantastic customer service. Actually, having switched to razor for three weeks, I realized how much I loved the ES8103S and had started taking it for granted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have had the replacement razor for about two years now. I have been much more careful about not letting it drop and the screen has held up well - until a few weeks ago. The battery is still fine and the shave is as good as ever. But, I have no idea how much battery power is left. The screen lights up but does not display a legible value. There is no water or vapor behind the screen this time. It seems that the screen and/or battery have a couple of year lifespan. I find this lifespan acceptable as I am still saving compared to the cost of replacement razors. I have found that the ES8103S replacement cost is about the same as the cost of razors with a one year lifespan. My two ES8103S shavers have averaged about a year and a half lifespan (although my current razor is still usable). Therefore the ES8103S still enjoys a cost benefit to shaving with razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Update  2 ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another year goes by and the (2nd) razor is still going strong. The screen started to turn partially legible during the year (I&#x27;m not sure when) and I can read some of the numbers - it&#x27;s enough to know if it is close to needing a charge. I can not tell the difference between 50% and 60%, but I know when it gets to 20% (And this is usually time to recharge). The battery has also suffered a bit - it gives about 3-4 shaves per charge.With the extended life, I have to change my economics from above - the razors have averaged a 2 years plus lifespan; and, the economics are far in the favor of the Panasonic vs. (the ever rising) costs of Gillette-style blades.With the extended life, I have to change my economics from above - the razors have averaged a 2 years plus lifespan; and, the economics are far in the favor of the Panasonic vs. (the ever rising) costs of Gillette-style blades.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Works as advertised. Would and have recommended. Can use in or out of the shower. Cleans very easily..</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for a rotary electric that was OK, but not great (the battery on that one finally died). Based on some of the rave reviews for this shaver, I guess I was expecting it to walk on water. It does a very good job, but I do find that need to go over my face several times to get all spots, especially on my neck and under my chin. If you push too hard, it will irritate your skin, like any other electric. Of course, using it wet or with some shaving cream makes it less irritating. It&#x27;s a great razor to use when you don&#x27;t want to take a chance at cutting yourself with a blade, or when you just want a quick dry shave to clean up before going out, without the hassle of shaving cream, etc. I use it about half the time I shave, and I think my skin is a little happier than it was with my rotary. My Dad borrowed it when he visited, and he really thought it was great. It&#x27;s easy to hold, cleans up easily under running water, charges quickly, has good charge retention, and has a good strong cutter with a thin foil. I&#x27;d probably buy it again if given a second chance to buy an electric.</li>
            <li> I have a very tough beard and this is hands-down the best shaver I have ever used. Great price and great shave. I haven&#x27;t tried it with shaving cream, only dry, but I&#x27;ve been very happy and have used it for at least two years now.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver.  It takes about 3 minutes per shave and it is relatively close.  It is within 80-90% of a razor in terms of how close it gets.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the battery charge.  I have no list of cons for this razor as I don&#x27;t expect any electric razor to be as close as a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend any electric razor more expensive than this.  If there was an electric razor on the market that could get as close as a blade, I would consider upgrading.  Until that day happens, this one is great.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8103S shaver, which I purchased 6/11 from Amazon, functioned well for about 3-4 months.  Then the battery life between recharging started becoming noticeable shorter.  The last few weeks I only got 2-3 shaves before I have to recharge it. I am sending it back and (hopefully) will receive the partial refund.  Does anyone make a reliable anything?!</li>
            <li> the shaver works good i don&#x27;t find any use for the lock.  the battery seems to last forever in the time i have it only charged twice 1st and another.  I like the screen showing the % left.  the only disappointment is the trimer it  is too small and holds to hair.  But i have other units to trim with</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve still never found a shaver that does as well as a blade, but this shaver is pretty much the best I&#x27;ve used in a long time.  The battery level indicator is a really nice feature and takes the guesswork out of knowing when it&#x27;s time for a recharge.</li>
            <li> The razor&#x27;s battery died in less than 9 months.  Since the battery is not replacable, the razor had to be discarded.  I would never purchase another Panasonic razor again  [[ASIN:B001DNE3KQ Panasonic ES8103S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Silver]]</li>
            <li> Everything about product excellent incuding price.Only slight criticism is that the charging pack is USA spec and I had to go to specialist electrical supplier to get an adaptor.Feel that supplier should refer to this in info about product when purchasing.Also means.if using on Continent, that I have to have a British 3 point plug,the USA adaptor,+ Continental travel plug in order to charge-rather cumbersome to say the least.</li>
            <li> Bought this through Amazon &#x27;best buy,\\&quot; arrived quickly.  This little guy works well, as I said, it&#x27;s better, lighter and quieter than my other foil shaver.  Good ratings in CU especially at this price.  I&#x27;d buy another!</li>
            <li> my father purchased this razor a few weeks ago and LOVES it!!!  He is 88 years old and marvels at the close shave he gets from this... states&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;worth its weight in gold&amp;#34;!!</li>
            <li> not as good as my old norelco, trimer is in too low location.  would not reccommend.</li>
            <li> I ahve only had this razor a few days,  Still getting use to it,but it  seems to shavel well.  Only time will tell..</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to start using this shaver, which gives a really good shave.&lt;br /&gt;My extreme satisfaction continued until about one year later, when I first became aware of a foul odor in and around the head of the shaver, and it&#x27;s plastic housing. The odor rapidly escalated, to the point that it became almost nauseating. I soaked the head of the shaver in mouthwash, which helped a lot for about two weeks, but then the odor was back, full force. I know that the smell originates from my face, but in all my years of shaving with electric razors , I have never experienced anything like this. Ugh!!!</li>
            <li> I have used Braun for about 12-15 years.  My current one needed new blades and screen and the battery was going as was the motor.  I checked on a re-furbish and found it would be $50-60.  I went on-line to find a new one and saw the Panasonic.  After reading the reviews I decided on the ES8103.  Absolutely fantastic.  I may or may not get 14 shaves, but the 12 or 14 I do get are great.  I love it.</li>
            <li> This is an ok shaver.  I was expecting more for the money, but maybe I&#x27;ve been spoiled by Remington.  It doesn&#x27;t do well with hairs of mixed lengths.  The short ones it gets clean, but leaves the longer ones, meaning you have to go back over the same area several times.  I have to make 2 or 3 passes then a pass with the clippers then another 2 or 3 passes to really get a nice shave.  And the clippers pinch sometimes.  Other than the fact that the shave is not that great, there&#x27;s not really any other problems, but then again if the shave isn&#x27;t that great who cares about the rest?  If I&#x27;d known I would have just gotten another Remington.    UPDATE: The pop out trimmer has given me consistent problems, but in the last few weeks its gotten totally unusable.  It won&#x27;t even cut a hair I place inbetween the blades.  Panasonic just informed me that despite the unit still being under warranty they won&#x27;t service the pop out trimmer because its not covered under warranty.  So in other words this warranty isn&#x27;t worth the paper its printed on.  Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> Usually use it in shower. Have only bee using it a month or so  so takes getting used to up/ down rather then circular motion technique. Easy grip, easy recharge.</li>
            <li> I got tired of buying expensive blades and wanted a good electric razor. I last had a Norelco triple header razor probably 15 or twenty years ago. I have been pleasantly surprised with this razor. I got a good shave, via the dry method, on the first shave. I have had the unit for a week and a half now and the shaves keep on getting better with no irratation. I am now down to a 30% charge after 10 shaves, so the rechargable battery seems to last a long time and only takes an hour or less for a full charge. I have not used the wet shave method yet and can not comment on how that method works out. Cleaning is easy, you just open the unit up and run under water. Seems to be a good shaver with all the features at a very middle of the road price</li>
            <li> Does not shave well. Need to go over areas MULTIPLE times. Charge only lasts about 1hr of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much better out there for your money!</li>
            <li> I used Norelco all my life and decided to switch when I saw the coupon on this one. The shave is clean and quick, probably because it is new also. It is better than my Norelco. The only complain I have is the noise, it is louder than Norelco but still tolerable. Since it is faster to do the work, I can put up with it.</li>
            <li> The shaver arrived in excellent packaging. It replaced a Braun shaver I had some problems with. I thought I was getting a close shave with the Braun, but nothing so far other than a blade shaves as close as this Panasonic. The battery life is very good and the indicator lets me know when to recharge. Everything so far is pretty much perfect  and I only use it now. The Braun is in the garage sale stuff now.</li>
            <li> My sisters and I purchased the Panasonic ES8103S shaver as a Father&#x27;s Day gift for our dad.  He is extremely pleased with it and says it is the closest and best electric shave he has ever had.  It is light in weight, feels good in the hand, holds a charge well, and tells you how much charge you have left.  We selected this item based on prior reviews at this site, and now add our own \\&quot;5-star\\&quot; review based on our dad&#x27;s feedback.</li>
            <li> This shaver is great! I had problems with getting a close shave in the beginning, but once I realized that it was my oily face&#x27;s fault and not the razor, I was a happy camper. (Just a suggestion for those of you like me, take a damp and warm rag to your face to get the best results.) I love the screen that tells you the percentage of battery left. It helps me prepare for travel so I know whether I need to bring my charger with me or not. This is the easiest electric shaver to clean. Just wet the top a bit and put some liquid soap on it. The razor lathers itself up! Only reason why i didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I don&#x27;t care for the look of it. But that doesn&#x27;t affect how well it works so buy it!</li>
            <li> This product is made really well, but does not shave as close as a razor for my liking.  I have a tough (but not thick) beard, along with very sensitive skin.  This does not cut as close as advertised.  It has a very good cleaning mechanism without the need to buy extra cleansers though.  Give it a shot if you want a well-made waterproof electric razor.</li>
            <li> Motor and battery seem very good. Charges very quickly and lasts a good amount of time.  But the shaver acts more as a belt sander than a blade cutting hair.  You need to go over the same area over and over and my facial hair is by no means heavy.</li>
            <li> Very nice razor, I like it better than the Braun I used to have.  I only have one complaint, and it&#x27;s that you can&#x27;t use it while it&#x27;s plugged in.  So if it goes dead half-way through, you&#x27;re stuck until it charges a while.  I&#x27;m sure this is probably for safety, since it&#x27;s rated to use in the shower.  But I don&#x27;t do that anyway, so I wish I could use it plugged in.</li>
            <li> I chose this one because it was a great value for a high-end product.  I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  It charges super quick, and the charge lasts longer than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went from shaving with a regular blade to this electric shaver.  My fear with that was razor burn.  I found if you take your time and don&#x27;t press to hard on your face for the first week or so, that you can avoid it.  Just be patient and gradually work up to it.  The shaver also has a soft/hard setting which allows the shaver head to contour in and out.</li>
            <li> This shaver gives good close shaves if you shave every day and is very comfortable on my face.  It runs a long time on a single charge and recharges quickly. It does not work as well my inexpensive blade and shaving cream razor when I have several days of beard stubble.</li>
            <li> So far it is doing what I expected. It does provide a nice smooth shave and the battery life seems to hold a charge for a couple weeks when shaving once a day. I find it works better dry than in the shower. My only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t like to shave some of the hair at the base of my neck or around my Adams apple but that&#x27;s easily fixed by using the retractable trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is the second Panasonic razor I have owned and find the quality of the shave to be excellent. The only drawback with this model is the noise it makes, a little irritating. I would recommend this to friends for sure.</li>
            <li> My husband, after 40 years of marriage, said this is the best electric razor he has ever had.  I read the reviews before purchasing this because my husband is 74 years old and he wanted to know what other people had to say about their personal experience.  He said all the other electric razors were not working for him and they weren&#x27;t doing the job he had to constantly go over the same area.  When I purchased this one he must have complemented me 100 times about how happy he was with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent, if not the closest shave.  The battery charge indicator is great.  Battery life is good between charges.  It&#x27;s about the same closeness of shave produced by a Norelco.  If you want a really smooth shave, start with lather and a safety razor follwed by an electric like the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a traditional shavor with either the Gillette power fusion or something similar, but I was tired of shaving and sometimes cutting my mole (which is very handsome when not gushing blood) and continually going to the store for shaving supplies.  So, I wanted to try an electric again.  My past experiences with the circular rotating heads wasn&#x27;t great, as it didn&#x27;t provide a close shave and irritated my skin.  I read some reviews that pointed to this Panasonic.  And, I&#x27;ve been more than pleasantly surprised.  After a few weeks, I find I&#x27;m getting a close shave and no irritation.  I am very happy with this purchase, especially for the price!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good shaver, provide close shave, only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is you can&#x27;t use it while it&#x27;s charging. So if you forget to charge on weekend and Monday morning there is no charge left, you have to wait till it get some charge before you can use it. Not a biggie, but is annoyance.&lt;br /&gt;Also this will be big issue in a year or so when the battery can&#x27;t hold the charge, I used my last razor for more than 2 year after battery stop holding charge by just connecting to plug and use it.</li>
            <li> I have owned Panasonic electric razors since they came out on the market and have converted many other friends to them as well. I think my usage may go back twenty years...possibly more. At first they had fixed shaving heads and since Li batteries hadn&#x27;t been invented yet, NiCd batteries instead. Then they made a floating head, amped the RPM and increased charge time with Li batteries. I have very fair, sensitive skin as I am blond. I had tried other electric razors before, but they pulled and burned. They just didn&#x27;t give me a close shave until I stumbled upon Panasonic electrics. I use them wet while showering. I still use blade razors on occasion, but for those tight areas around the mouth, my Panasonic is my go to razor. No cuts; no burns; no bandages. Granted, since my experience is limited to just a few electric brands, there may be other electrics that work equally well...or gasp...even better, but for me I am completely satisfied and see no need to improve upon what I consider to be a great razor. Other than occasionally buying a new foil and blades, they seem to last forever. I often upgrade not because my razor stopped working, but because it&#x27;s time for a newer technology or bell/whistle.</li>
            <li> I came to the Panasonic ES8103S from the Braun 7000 Syncro series.  I had the Braun for over 10 years and loved it.  It saved me a ton of money on disposable razor blades and helped me get a good shave without irritating my neck, which traditional disposables roughed up to the point of embarrassment. Unfortunately, the charger cord would no longer make a consistent connection which kept me from being able to charge the shaver.  So I went looking for another Braun.  However similar Brauns to my 7000 Syncro are now quite expensive.  I paid $100 for the Syncro 10 years ago and had in mind to spend about the same amount.  I came across the Panasonic and while I&#x27;d always heard good things I&#x27;d never used one.  I&#x27;m glad I decided to give this thing a try.  It is superior to the Braun in almost every respect.  It shaves a lot closer, cleans much easier, charges faster and is, at about $80, a great value.  Moreover, it doesn&#x27;t make the mess my Braun used to.  It captures most of the hairs it cuts inside the shaving block.  The old Braun used to spread most of those all over my sink.  The one draw back to the Panasonic vs. the Braun is the Braun has a better long hair trimmer.  The Panasonic&#x27;s is good for light touch ups but the Braun&#x27;s could really do some heavy cutting.  As for the shave, I have a medium beard and a sensitive neck.  The Panasonic shaves much, much closer; almost disposable razor blade close.  It took my skin a couple of weeks of shaving to adjust.  Panasonic gives you 30 days to try it out and they also tell you to give it 30 days for your face to adjust.  Obviously, with that schedule you&#x27;d run out of time.  My suggestion is to give it a good 3 weeks of regular use and if you don&#x27;t like it send it back.  Me? I&#x27;m keeping mine and certainly recommend the product.  A couple of other things to keep in mind: the shaving block replacements for the Panasonic are approximately $25 to $30 and cheaper than many of the other shaving blocks.  That&#x27;s a reasonable pricesince you&#x27;ll probably want to switch out every 6 to 8 months.  The shaver is surprising lightweight but doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.  It is clearly well made.  I&#x27;ve only used it to shave in the shower one time and have not tried it with shaving creams, though I understand it can be used with them.  And while it is a wet/dry shaver from what I&#x27;ve found on the Internet it is not fully water proof; more like water resistant.  I&#x27;m happy to use it for dry shaving or for use on a wet beard and washing the shaving block off under the sink.</li>
            <li> Not as good as other shavers I have used in the past. It will remove some hair but it takes many, many passes over the same area to do even a partial removal. These many passes leave the skin all chafed and red. It requires a lot of time to remove just the fairly small amount that it accomplishes. It may work well on other types of beards but my beard is a challenge it can&#x27;t meet.</li>
            <li> This is actually the second one I bought. Almost as good and economical as DE shaving, but faster to use when you include setup and cleaning. Given how simple, yet powerful and useful it is (faster and more precise than a three-head rotary shaver for me.), I could not resist the super sale! The first one has served me well for over 4 years with one change of blades and foil and is still going strong, but I plan to stop changing em and use it only for travel. I hope the new one serves me well for years to come!</li>
            <li> In my many years I&#x27;ve used &#x27;em all.  Owned, wore &#x27;em out, and thought some were better than others, but this one has topped them all for comfortable and ease of use that leaves me with a close shave that feels like I&#x27;ve had a clean close shaved.  I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed, especially if you have used others.</li>
            <li> I have been using the previous Panasonic model almost 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;This model is smaller,  softer and lighter than old model.&lt;br /&gt;I like it :)</li>
            <li> Great shaver. One of the best Panasonic 3-blade shavers. This is my second ES8103S product. The first one had bad LED indicator after 1.5 years and was replaced by the manufacturer. Now I decided to by another one because it has very good battery and shaves close. I just bought another one for $59.00 instead of replacing the head set for $30.00 for the old shaver. Te battery holded a little less time after first year on my first shaver. but I keep buying this particular one because i like how it shaves. i tryied different shavers and this one is one of the best.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor late in 2010 and have used it regularly since.  I have fairly sensitive skin when shaving, using either an electric or manual blade...although I used to use a manual blade because the irritation wasn&#x27;t as bad.  This razor has caused very little irritation over the last year plus.  What irritation it has caused is my own fault, because I&#x27;m in need of a new blade/foil.  That being said I use this razor 2-3 times a week for nearly 1.5 years....and I&#x27;ve just recently been thinking of getting a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about this razor would be the underpowered trimmer.  My facial hair is fairly soft and not very thick, but it doesn&#x27;t take much to cause the trimmer to hang up.  Personally I wasn&#x27;t too concerned with the trimmer and rarely use it so I don&#x27;t find it big enough of a deal to ding the razor for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, just for reference, when I purchased this razor it was in the $90-$100 range and I&#x27;d gladly purchase it again any day.</li>
            <li> first shave was great but then they started going downhill.  it is no way as close as a blade no i would not buy another one</li>
            <li> I have bought this same shaver before for my husband. He asked for it again. So, I ordered it again from Amazon. Great price, great product!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic shaver at a fraction of the price of a Braun with more features.  Shaves better than a blade.</li>
            <li> This is my first go at an electric shaver. I switched because my current occupation requires a clean shave every day and a blade was irritating my skin.  This shaves nearly as close as a blade but with none of the irritation. It takes a bit longer to achieve a comparable shave, but it&#x27;s only another minute or two. It is easy to clean, not terribly loud, and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Hubby is very pleased with his gift from me which was recommended by our grandson.</li>
            <li> I got this shaver a couple of months ago hoping that I wouldn&#x27;t have to use razor blades any more, because latetly I been cutinng myself while shaving. So I got this shaver on a recomendation of a good friend. Why only the four stars? Because it get to hot for my confort, I started shaving with the wet option but in order to get a close shave then you have to spend more time going back and forth to get a desirable shave. I guess the shaving cream was to thick to get close to the skin. Now the good part, I found in a coutry wide drugstore a product tha it will let you get a close wet shave in half the time and leaves your skin without irritation or bumps, the name Cremo shaving cream, is not cheap but for me is a great product, it says that one tube will last for 90 days, that I don&#x27;t know. But it works good for me...</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to get a close shave, otherwise great  shaver to take on vacation. Stores easily in backpack.</li>
            <li> excellent shaver which shaves closer then any other razors on the marketing.&lt;br /&gt;Love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with a Br*** model for several years. This Panasonic is so smooth and quite compared to the other shaver. In fact, I would say the Br*** is like a diesel truck next to my ear compared to this model of shaver. Washing this model is also very easy too; a little soap on the blades, turn it on, and let it shake it all off under the running water. Nice n easy. WELL worth the money!</li>
            <li> Second unit owned. The trimmer accessory is awesome and the shaver is smooth and comfortable to use. Never a rash. The floating head makes shaving even easier.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a really good on the face. if you&#x27;re doing the neck and don&#x27;t hardly shave it. and you have to keep shaving because if it gets too long it won&#x27;t shave it</li>
            <li> Great price&lt;br /&gt;I use it every day. Stays charged for a week and re- charges in an hour.&lt;br /&gt;Feels smooth on my face and gives a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean. I can&#x27;t imagine the shavers costing four times as much can perform any better.&lt;br /&gt;Just a great buy.</li>
            <li> It gives me a close shave. Only have to charge it once a week so far. The little raised knobs where the thumb holds to shaver could be raised a little more</li>
            <li> Works great on the face, but has a lot of trouble on neck hairs, so I still need a regualr razor to finish the job. Charges fast and having the display battery life is nice.</li>
            <li> Hard to believe but this cuts as close as a blade w/out cutting your skin.  I had bought a head blade and my wife was upset with the amount of nicks on the back of my head.  She bought me this for my bday and what a wonderful product.  It charges up fully in such an amazingly short period of time.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Awesome. My father-in-law loves it. Now my husband wants it too. It is really good. panasonic is a good brand and this one just proves it.</li>
            <li> It is pleasantly smooth, retains it&#x27;s charge.  No &amp;#34;getting used to&amp;#34; period.&lt;br /&gt;The price was very reasonable, at least $100.00 Less than rotary types.</li>
            <li> It has been well over ten years since I used an electric shaver.  If I had known that they had improved them this much I would have switched back years ago.  Great, close shave.  I only get about half the shaves from a full charge as Panasonic claims I should, but that is worth it for the close shave.</li>
            <li> Got the razor, charged it up and used it the first morning I could. It got the whiskers on my neck the my older model were missing. It gives a comfortable shave and charges easily. Hopefully, I still be this happy in six months.</li>
            <li> I get a close shave, it&#x27;s quiet, and the battery indicator is a valuable addition. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I had been using an older Panasonic wet-dry shaver for many years. This replacement is at least its equal in all ways, except for the plug in charger. The older Panasonics used a base with a cableless charging connection to the shaver. This is somewhat less convenient, but the razor works very well, did not require a charge during a full week long trip, and is comfortable both in hand and on the face.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers for 45 years and found them very dependable. I read the fantastic reviews of the Panasonic es8103s and gave it a try. This is a very good shaver with many good features. However, I doesn&#x27;t get the hard to shave whiskers any better then my old Norelco did. In some hard to shave areas, I think the triple heads may be better. I am not down on this shaver mind you, but I feel some of the reviewers went a little overboard. The   GOOD POINTS: Cleaning the Panasonic could not be any easier. Prompts on display for charging and cleaning are nice. Nice shape, fits hand well. BAD POINTS: Nothing but a cheap cloth bag to store it in, needs hard case to protect it. Gets quite warm while in use.   To sum it up, if the Panasonic lasts 15 years like my last Norelco did, then I will join the glowing review club too.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. It gives a good shave. Going from a blade to this shaver did take some getting used to, but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> It does shave well and close, but it is not as quick as others here have stated. The trimmer is terrible (it could just be my hair). The device does heat up when using it dry, and it is not the smoothest run over the skin, but because it is a wet/dry shaver, I recommend using it with a little shaving cream and rinsing, works great.</li>
            <li> I am a person who hates the chore of shaving my face. And with a back problem, cannot stand in front of a mirror for too long. I have had Remington, Norelco and my last razor for the last 5 years was a Braun. This Panasonic is a heaven sent to me. The clean, quick performance makes shaving a breeze. It is so hi-tech and quality built. The speed of the cutting heads gives me a very close shave in minutes. It charges up quickly ( 1 hour). Then tells me how much charge is left. When it is time to clean the heads, it will tell me that too with a prompt on the led display. But the most amazing thing of all is cleaning. I always hated to take the time to clean my old razors. I turn on the turbo speed blades...put it under a faucet and presto! It is cleaned. Dont hesitate to but this razor. You will love it!</li>
            <li> the switch should be recessed so it cannot  be turned off EASILY.&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the features are good. It feels good when shaving, no dry skin or burn.</li>
            <li> Have not received any complaints from my husband as of yet. Got it as a gift.  He uses it frequently.  A Happy wife.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using rotary electric shavers for 20+ years. This foil shaver is much better than the budget rotary units I have been using from Remington and others. This gives a quick close shave. It charges remarkably fast as well.</li>
            <li> I recently chucked my old Braun shaver because it was hurting my skin.  I have sensitive skin, and remembered years ago really liking a Panasonic travel shaver I had.  I did some research and thought I&#x27;d try this model for my primary shaver.  It&#x27;s the most comfy shave I&#x27;ve ever had!  I guess because it vibrates so fast, I dunno.  It glides over my skin, it doesn&#x27;t nick or scratch like my Braun did.  It&#x27;s a breeze to wash up.  It&#x27;s not as close a shave as some others I&#x27;ve had - but I am still close shaven. :)  I&#x27;d forego the bleeding and burning for this shaver anytime.</li>
            <li> This shaver is well worth the money, and at sale prices it&#x27;s a steal. It cuts close, is wet/dry so you can use it in the shower, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still do get some minor razor burn from this, though I&#x27;m not attributing that to a shaver defect at all. I have extremely sensitive skin and I get razor burn with just about anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent buy.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas.  At first my husband wanted me to get him a more inexpensive electric razor like the one he had but I decided to knock it up a knotch and saw that Amazon had this shaver for an excellent price.  Needless to say that my husband LOVES this shaver and says that it cuts his shaving time almost more than half the time it took with his old razor. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I am 66 years old and have had several electric shavers. I got this one about three weeks ago and so far, I would say this is the best one ever. My past experience includes rotary and track shavers. This Panasonic is the smoothest, cleanest and fastest of all. It feels good in my hand and is easy to control.  I hope it continues to give this good a level of service to me.    The shipping from Amazon was fast and packaging was good.</li>
            <li> I have used at least 8-10 different shavers over that past 20 years.  This one by far is the best one I have ever used.  Panasonic uses stainless steel blades that are just sharper and last longer than Braun&#x27;s nickel blades.  You get a close and easy shave every time.</li>
            <li> This shaver is really nice.  I switched from an older remington model.  I have been apprehensive about getting a new shaver because I need one for sensitive skin.  This new shaver is excellent.  I do not get shaving bumps or redness.  One small drawback is that it leaves a few whiskers in the neck area but I just hit them with a razor, no big deal.  Overall it is great, try one for yourself.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband and after research price and quality this seemed like the best choice. And 6 months after using it I haven&#x27;t heard one complaint yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cuts close, good recharging, nice wet/dry use.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with the panasonic shaver.  I normally use it in the dry mode and it gives me a very close shave.  Its an excellent value for a quality shaver.</li>
            <li> This shaver gets the job done with multiple passes. I&#x27;ve got a heavy beard and if I attack three days growth then it&#x27;s going to take a while. That&#x27;s reality! With time you can get close to \\&quot;baby\\&quot; close. Two days growth can be handled fairly quickly. I use it in the shower with only water and it works fine. No regrets. For the price it&#x27;s a fine shaver.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric shaver I have owned! I use it dry and it gives me a very smooth shave, with no skin irritation. My face is almost &#x27;baby&#x27; smooth. It does require multiple passes and I do stretch my skin. That said, it still is a fast shave. It can require a bit of effort on the neck, but it gets the job done. The trimmer works well.    I used Brauns for many years. They were good, but the shave wasn&#x27;t as close. I figured that&#x27;s what you get with an electric shave. The Panasonic is a step up in technology and made a noticeable difference the first time.    It is easy to clean and looks new afterwards. The digital readout is a nice touch. The one caveat is the battery doesn&#x27;t hold that many charges. Because of how close it shaves, I can shave every second day. My beard is moderate, but noticeable. I have been using the shaver for three weeks now and get about six shaves per charge, which takes the readout down to about 10%. From there, it requires an hour or so to fully recharge.    I would recommend this shaver. It is quite good!</li>
            <li> In purchasing a ES8103S, I am returning from a Panasonic 4-blade head to a 3-blade head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why? Because the LCD screen on the $120 ES8243A broke within 12 months, and the the replacement foil/blade kit at $45 is excessively more expensive than the $28 kit for the $90 ES8103S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With poor design and/or build quality, I can&#x27;t afford to buy a $120 razor that dies in 2 years. I only got half my use out of the expensive $45 foil/blade kit (I replace every year to assure maximum performance). Last week, My ES8243 turned itself on and off two times after what turned out to be its last shave, as if to bid me farewell, and passed away (the on/off switch became unresponsive).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first Panasonic was a 3-blade ES8065 that still works flawlessly. With a new head and blades, it can still rival the latest Panasonics. It has 2 LED lights, charging status and recharge (low battery) alert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the ES8065 simply wouldn&#x27;t die but I \\&quot;assumed\\&quot; that Panasonic&#x27;s razor technology had moved forward after many years, I purchased a 3-blade ES8092 that turned out to be a disappointment in cutting performance. It has 6 LED lamps indicating the current battery level (100%, 80%, 60%, 40%, 20%, Recharge).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely troubled to read so many recent ES8103S reviews stating their LCD screen died sometime within 12 months, no different than my ES8243. Perhaps moisture is getting inside, or Panasonic&#x27;s LCD screens are simply CHEAP. I never had an LED indicator fail on my older Panasonic razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After stubbornly continuing to dry shave for many years with my Panasonics, I have for the last 5 years enjoyed better results by wet shaving (with Aveeno shave gel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My new 3-blade ES8103S shaves almost as well as the 4-blade ES8243A, but without the extra weight and bulk. I&#x27;m sure more is better (a 4th cutting blade), but it isn&#x27;t worth $30 more for the shaver and 17$ more for the rebuild kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But with either model, I expectthe LCD screen to last 5+ years. If my ES8103S&#x27;s LCD screen fails within 12 months like my ES8243A, I&#x27;m going to be a very unhappy camper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic also sells a model, the ES-LT41-K, with identical specs to the ES8103S (one difference, the ES-LT41-K&#x27;s on/off switch has a travel lock). This is an Asian market model number and style. I prefer the ES8103S&#x27;s US market styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I miss the vertical charging stands that all Panasonic razors used to come with!!!  Panasonic really lost points with me when they switched to the current charger and cord, a major step backwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ES8243A had a nice velvet-lined vinyl bag, while the ES8103S comes with a CHEAP cloth bag. My past ES8065 and ES8092 had nice velvet bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My great ES8065, mediocre ES8092 and problem-plagued ES8243A were made in Japan. My new ES8103S is made in China. I suspect most of the parts for the Japanese-assembled ES8243A, aside from the foil, blade and motor, were imported from China. And likewise the China-assembled ES8103S has China produced parts, aside from the foil, blade and motor imported from Japan. My point being, although my ES8243A was assembled in Japan, it was problematic and short-lived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After just over 2 months of use, the LED display is failing. Two of the LEDs are dead. This is just what I was afraid of. This alleged wet/dry razor is not adequately water proof. I never had this problem dry shaving with Panasonics. But, I never got the closest shave with the Panasonics until I began wet shaving with them (Afta and Lectric Shave work, but the smell is absolutely horrible). I can&#x27;t recommend that anyone invest $90 to $120 in the ES8103S or ES8243A when the displays fail within months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I e-mailed Panasonic about warranty repair, I explained I was on an overseas assignment and wouldn&#x27;t be back in the US for a couple of months. But instead of apologizing for their product&#x27;s shoddy quality/design, they advised me that my warranty was cancelled because I&#x27;d taken the razor out of the US. Apparently, Panasonic doesn&#x27;t approve of Americans working overseas, or at least doesn&#x27;t want Americans to shave while they are overseas. I am NOT a satisfied Panasonic customer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this a few months now.  It gives as good a shave as the Remington/Braun/Norelco razors I&#x27;ve tried.  Wish is ran while plugged in.  As others said, it&#x27;s also not real good at catching clippings.  The trimmer is small, but not a big deal.  It is very effective.  Electric razors in general just do not shave as close as a blade.  This one gets as close as the others, so I would focus on features and price.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic razor does a great job. You get a close shave and it adapts to the contours of your face. I  would recommend it. I hadn&#x27;t used an electric razor for years until I had a health problem that has required  the use of an electric razor. I was pleasantly surprised when I used this razor because it does as good a job  as the Fusion razor I had been using.</li>
            <li> I have been an electric shaver user for years.  My nine year old Braun was getting a little tired so I figured it was time to buy a new shaver.  I looked over the Braun reviews and the customer satisfaction for Brauns in my price range wasn&#x27;t so good so I decided to look around.  I found that the customer satisfaction with the Panasonic shaver was very high and it had all the essentials without a bunch of gimmicks you don&#x27;t need to get a good shave.  I&#x27;ve had my Panasonic for about a month and I am very satisfied with it.  The only reason I gave it four stars is not because of the shaver, but because the manufacturer promises more than the shaver can deliver.  It is not a one-swipe shaver; you have to attack your whiskers from at least three different angles to get a close shave.  You cannot shave in three minutes; it takes about the same time to shave with a Panasonic as it does with any good electric shaver ... about 10 minutes.  And you cannot get 15 shaves out of a 50 minute charge at 10 minutes per shave. That being said, Panasonic is a good all-around shaver.  Too bad the manufacturer isn&#x27;t more honest about the product.  They have nothing to be ashamed of.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good but slower than my almost 25 year old Braun single blade plug in razor. I&#x27;m still trying to find a better product and I have yet to. I guess the plug in AC motor on the old Braun is just better.</li>
            <li> This was the second one that I purchased, bought my first one back in 2011 which lasted me through college. Everything still worked great on it but it was time to replace the foil and blades. It was easier and cheaper to just be a brand new one! Great shaver!</li>
            <li> Good production the same as description.</li>
            <li> Good Shaver. Convenient and comfortable when use it.</li>
            <li> Very nice shaver. My son and my father have used it and say it works great! Holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> I used this item for a month. I have used Braun&#x27;s electrical shaver more than 5 yrs.&lt;br /&gt;It was good but the battery was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ES8103s is lighter and more smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been awhile since I had an electric shaver (Norelco) and have been using a razor for years. Read good reviews (consumer reports) on this one and decided to give it a try. The shaver does shave much closer than I expected. The problem I had was getting a clean shave all over without doing several passes over some contoured areas. I just assume using my old razor in the shower - one pass and I&#x27;m done. Quicker and easier. This shaves almost as close as a razor (big compliment) but is more work and takes a little too long for me.</li>
            <li> I have only used the dry cycle. The razor does not provide a close shave. I researched a number of electric razors and this would be very good. It was $100.</li>
            <li> This Electric shaver was bought for my son who has very sensitive skin &amp; cannot shave with a blade &amp; He just told me He absolutely loves this shaver, the best one he&#x27;s ever owned!! He said it&#x27;s like he used a blade!! He is very well pleased with his gift &amp; the Price at the time, one just could not beat it.  Delivery was fast-only issue I would have is their was no bubble wrap in the box to help secure the shaver from bouncing around as box was rightsized but needed some cushioning for the ride to my house. Excellent Product thus far!!</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s third electronic wet/dry rechargeable Razor and the first one to make it past a year of use.  He has rosacea and switched to the electric razors to help with the redness.  With this razor he can use it in the shower without the aid of any irritating cleanser and get a nice clean shave.  It gets close enough that he can shower at night and still look clean shaven by the next afternoon.</li>
            <li> Good shave -- good speed -- good product.  Like the fact that you can \\&quot;lock\\&quot; the swivel feature on or off.&lt;br /&gt;And you don&#x27;t have to press hard -- in fact they warn you not to -- just let the shaver do its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had to give up on Norelco.  Their \\&quot;new\\&quot; lithium-powered shavers run at about half the speed (or less) of my \\&quot;antique\\&quot; Norelco shaver that used AA-size rechargeable batteries.  The new Norelco specializes in yank-and-pull shaving, and takes 4-5 passes to catch all the bits.</li>
            <li> my husband loves that he can clean it by running it under the faucet!</li>
            <li> This a great shaver! It replaces an identical one purchased in 2011. I replaced the old one due to me dropping it and breaking the trimmer......it was due for new blades anyhow.</li>
            <li> I received this shaver and was pleased with it. Worked very well. After some time the display stopped showing information and 2 months later the unit went dead. It didn&#x27;t recharge or work at all. I sent it to the Panasonic Service Center in  Mcallen, Dallas to be fixed under the warranty. In about 10 days I received a new unit back, and guess what, it was the model ES8249, a much more sophisticated unit. Great service by Panasonic.  Since I was going to be without a good shaver for awhile, I bought the Philips Norelco 8240XL. Also a very good shaver.  After I got the Panasonic back I run a benchmark with the 2 shavers. I shaved half face with one and the other half with the other. One day with one and another day with the other. After some tests I can say that both units perform very well but I would say that the Philips has a small advantage because it is much less noisy than the Panasonic.  But I am impressed with Panasonic for exchanging a defective product by a better model.</li>
            <li> The products use every day</li>
            <li> Never thought I would recommend and electric razor over a blade.  My latest job requires me to shave often.  I figured I would give this one a try and return it if I thought it was not going to work.  I was expecting to return it.  Boy, was I wrong.  This thing shaves great.  It struggles a little bit on the neck area, but so does any electric razor.  Great purchase and I hope it continues to shave like this for years to come.</li>
            <li> This has been a great shaver!  I&#x27;ve always had good luck with Panasonic equipment, and the price/performance of this item has been no exception.  The only issue that I have with the shaver is the fact that it has to be unplugged whenever it is to be used.  Since this is a wet/dry service shaver, Panasonic chose to cut some cost by not including the option in &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; use applications.  I don&#x27;t fault that decision at all as the charge on this shaver far surpasses any other brand&#x27;s shavers that I&#x27;ve ever owned.  This Panasonic is in use daily for both my face and my bald head.  It cuts smooth and close...and it&#x27;s fast.  A great buy and a real bargain.</li>
            <li> I hate to shave and this electric shaver solve a part of my problem. It works very well on my cheeks but not that much on my neck. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just my neck hairs that are very resilient or if the shaver is not the greatest but I don&#x27;t care that much. I shave more often since the shaver do its job fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first electric shaver and I&#x27;m happy. Not VERY happy but it seems to do the job it&#x27;s suppose to do. It&#x27;s not as smooth as a Mach 3 but the girlfriend seems happy so.</li>
            <li> I have used foil shavers for 40 years. I usually own modest priced shavers. I have owned a Braun 3 series. This Panasonic shaves the best of all I have ever owned and highly recommend it. It is a little strange though, it does not want to glide over the upper lip, it seems  to not want to move, so I rotate it. Like all foil shavers, you have to go over the same area again and again, and finish up with aftershave and a razor to get the few spots you missed, but I am very happy with this and plan to get one for my son for Xmas.</li>
            <li> I have only used Norelco rotary razors in the past. My old Norelco was ready for replacement when it would not hold a rull recharge. Besides the battery going caputs, I was having to go over some areas over and over to get a few missed stray hairs. I had to go over some spots so many times that it caused skin irritation. My new Panasonic Arc 3 razor changed all that. The Panasonic gets all the hairs on the first pass and it shaves really close. I haven&#x27;t tried shaving wet with the Panasonic yet, but it will be nice to be able to shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> I have always been a razor user.  At 49 years old, I read the review of this unit on Consumer Reports and decided to give it a try.  It works very well.  I opened the box, charged it and shaved at my desk.  My face is smooth as can be and I am very happy.  I hope it works as well long term, I&#x27;ll report back in two weeks.  Ten days of using it everyday have only made me like it more.  It shaves well, leaving me with far less \\&quot;five o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot; than I had with a conventional razor.</li>
            <li> Nice and close shaves. The water restistant feature makes it very convenient for washing the shaver, and gets an even closer shave.</li>
            <li> This shaver works absolutely great. I always hated the pulling and tugging with the rotary razors. I have not had this happen once so far with this shaver.</li>
            <li> I have used electric shavers for a while now and I recently purchased the Panasonic ES8103S.  The shaver is identical to the ES8109, which has the drying dock.  The ES8109S is great, if you are willing to spend the extra $50 - $70 for the drying dock, but not a necessity.  I believe this shaver is far better than any other on the market due to its 30 degree blade and all other manufacturers use a 45 - 90 degree blade which requires multiple passes.   (I&#x27;m an internet shopping junkie; hence I do a lot of research on details about products).  It was definitely the right choice to get the ES8103S.</li>
            <li> After years of having a beard and the little hair from having a hippocratic bald head, I decided to shave it all off. An electric razor seemed to be faster and easier than my old Fusion blades. Well, on the top of the head anyway. So, I bought this Panasonic.    I wanted to keep shaving in the shower using my \\&quot;The Total Shaving Solution\\&quot; oil. [...]  Panasonic razors are recommended by them and they work great with the oil. It is smooth, fast, and no irritation at all. Of course, I didn&#x27;t have any irritation with my Fusion either.    It doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close as the Fusion blade, but close enough. It is remarkably close for most areas. I think it works even better on the upper lip. It&#x27;s not quite as good on the neck (front), but you have to rub to feel the difference because you can&#x27;t see it.    On the top of the head I can buzz over the bumpy scalp smoothly and easily without cutting anything. I do have to feel to find a few spots that are easy to miss. The head doesn&#x27;t curve to fit the scalp, but none of them do.    With the shaving oil in the shower, I get no build up of whiskers in the razor. I do rinse it out after easy shave, but have never seen anything there. It does remind me to do the soft-soap-cleaning about every 10 times, but it isn&#x27;t a problem with nothing in there.    I suppose my only complaint it that the battery only last for 4 shaves. OK, it is going over a lot of territory. It does charge remarkably fast though - about an hour.    I highly recommend this razor for top, back, sides, and front of any head. I highly recommend using it in the shower with The Total Shaving Solution oil too. They make a great combination.</li>
            <li> I am 61 years old. I have tried various electric shavers over the years and NEVER found a one to be really as good as shaving creme and a Gillette Razor. Well, I have now ! This new Panasonic that I just purchased from Amazon.com is FANTASTIC. I don&#x27;t use pre-shave either. I just take a bar of soap and lather my face slightly. All other shavers in my life made my face red and then after shave really burned. I get none of that with this razor. When razor blades from Sam&#x27;s Club went up to around $40, that was the last straw. This really pleases me. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have been a Panasonic user for nearly 10 years now and have been very impressed by the quality of the product, but more so by the quality of the shave.  I am even more pleased with this latest version, as the shave is the best I have yet experienced, the noise of the shaver is virtually non-existent (compared to all earlier versions), and the feel and quality of the product remain high.  However, I am a little disappointed with the battery duration.  I suppose this caution is a bit unrepresentative of most users, as I shave my entire head, not just my face.  To complicate my use approach, I have a full facial beard that I trim to a very fastidious level using the trimmer.  My complaint is that I only get two or three of these shaves from the battery of this new product.  That does not compare favorably to my previous version (5 years old), with which I got six to ten such shaves.  In fact, one of the reasons I decided to get a new model was because the battery on the old one was beginning to diminish in strength and duration of usefulness.  The saving grace for this slight disappointment is that the battery charges to full capacity in much less than an hour, so I can travel or do whatever at home without any serious shortage of availability to shave the way I have come to do this thing.  Over all, I would recommend this shaver to anyone, even heavy users such as myself.  I was just disappointed that the battery could not do better (overcome by rapid recharging).  Panasonic is and will probably always be my preferred shaver.  They seem to find a way to please me with each new iteration.</li>
            <li> Have had shaver for 2+ years now. Generally pleased with the shaver, especially in comparison with other electric shavers I have had over the years. Its performance in shaving was comparable with other electric shavers--OK, but not as good as manual razors. Cleans very well. In comparison with rotary electric shavers, I have found the battery to last much longer; recently, it seems that I am not getting as many shaves per charge, but in my previous experiences with rotary electric shavers, I have had battery problems much sooner. In comparison with foil electric shavers, I have found the Panasonic shaver to be much sturdier; the foil in previous foil shavers seemed to break very easily. The major issue with the Panasonic shaver was the noise level, as mentioned in other reviews I read.</li>
            <li> Hey gals for those of you looking to find a good shaver for your legs and underarms, this is it.  I tried the &amp;#34;for women&amp;#34; shavers, they wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge and barely cut butter. This shaves extremely close and stays charged for a long time. Love it. Wish I had found it sooner.</li>
            <li> this is the best electric shaver I have ever had. With very gentle pressure against my skin, it quickly and completely shaves off all my whiskers. It holds its charge well and clearly shows what percentage is left. It is easy to clean every now and then.</li>
            <li> Not very good.  leaves hairs behind, even when going over them 10+ times. I don&#x27;t even have a lot of facial hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for about a year now.  It doesn&#x27;t really give you a smooth shave.  There are better options out there.</li>
            <li> I have had a couple of Braun and a Norelco  shaver and they were pretty good.  The Panosonic ES8103S is by far a much better shaver.  Wow....I cannot believe the difference.  I have very sensitive skin but a tough beard.  Even with new blade razors I still have to go over and over my face to get the beard.  I used this shaver this  morning without gel...... and the shave was fantastic....AAAA+++</li>
            <li> Was a horrible razor. It didn&#x27;t shave stubble on my face. Most of the time I got frustrated and finished with Gillette razor. Other than not doing what it was built for. It felt like it was well built.</li>
            <li> I dont speak english well&lt;br /&gt;It works good</li>
            <li> Clean shave, feels good. The blades can get dull but it&#x27;s nothing that a replacement won&#x27;t fix. :)</li>
            <li> I should have got the 4 head razor I have to keep going over the same spot over and over.</li>
            <li> This razor is everything I had hopped it would be.  I t easy to use and easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;I get a great shave.</li>
            <li> This is my second Panasonic shaver.  For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.  Great shave for an electric shaver.  I&#x27;ve used Braun as well, but this one beats it hands down.  Highly recommend this model, I can&#x27;t see spending any more than the cost of this shaver, even though there are newer models out there.</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY SECOND SHAWER.LIKE IT .EASY FOR USE AND FOR CLEAN AS WELL. LITTLE BE TO EXPENSIVE BUT IS GOOD</li>
            <li> Amazing - seems to work even better for me than the reviews here. Pat a little water with a trace of soap on, and it does the job in an easy minute. No more razor rash from the manual approach...</li>
            <li> Received as a birthday gift. After 1st charge the shaver worked very well, but on the second charge the LCD display stopped working and then it quit running. Tried to charge it again but no luck. Going back to my 10 year old Braun.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my husband as a necessity, as he could not chance getting a razor cut.   He had another one which was fairly new which gave a poor shave, so I paid for fast shipping to get this one which had good reviews.   Unfortunately it is just slightly better than the one we disgarded.  I doubt it will get better in time.  He will have to get by with this until he can use a manual razor again.</li>
            <li> IT IS THE BEST SHAVER I EVER BOUGHT. WORKS PERFECTLY AND IT CAN BE USED IN DRY CONDITIONS OR AT THE SHOWER ...</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have a constant rash on my neck from shaving.  I have tried many electric and manual razors and every one always caused a rash.  This is great for my skin.  It doesn&#x27;t do the best job on soft neck hair, but with a little persistence you can get a perfectly clean shave.  I can shave dry, wet, or with shaving cream and any way I choose this is better on my skin than any other razor I have ever owned.    This is a great 5 star shaver.</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for about 3 wks and so far I am very satisfied with the quality and the shave performance. A charge lasts about 10 da. and I use this razor everyday. I switched from a norelco and find that this razor causes me less irritation.</li>
            <li> I needed a new electric razor to replace an old one that had stopped working.  After about two weeks of searching the internet, I settled on the Panasonic ES8103S as a good comprimise between price and performance.  I purchased it from Amazon because of their return policy.  When it arrived, it was very easy to set up and charge.  Operation is a snap.  As advertised, it works extremely well for dry or wet shaves.  I have a tough beard, but this little gem gets it after just a few easy passes.  I get results that are as good as or better than any streight razor I have ever used.  The real beauty though is in cleaning.  You just add some liquid hand soap, turn on the high speed mode, rinse it in cold water, dry it, and in no time at all, you are done.  This is the best electric razor I have ever owned, and I rate it as 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I was a Braun guy for years. One day I looked in the mirror &amp; said \\&quot;This is not a close shave.\\&quot; I did my research and came up with the Panasonic ES8103S. The reviews were excellent, so I bought it on Amazon for $64.00 and received it, as usual, very quickly with no shipping charges. This is BY FAR the closest shave I&#x27;ve EVER experienced with an electric shaver. I discovered a tube of Alba coconut lime shave cream lying in my drawer, and that made my experience even better. My wife, the true judge of a good shave, had no idea I had purchased a new shaver. She looked at me the day after I began using the Panasonic &amp; commented on what a close shave I had.     I have NO negatives. The PROS: very reasonably priced; fast, ridiculously close shave with no nicks or pulled hairs; very easy to clean with the high speed cleaning feature; charges quickly; light weight &amp; easy to travel with. Sure the case could have been more substantial, but I improvised, using a heavy duty pouch I had lying around, which works fine in protecting the shaver while traveling.    I clean the shaver with a little liquid soap after each shave rather than waiting for the prompt image to show up on the display because I&#x27;m afraid otherwise the Alba product (which I also highly recommend) might gum it up. Oh, and one more thing- when I&#x27;m at home and not traveling for business, I shave every other day, just because the day after I shave with my Panasonic, my face looks like it did immediately after shaving with the Braun!</li>
            <li> Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Rechargeable Linear Pivot Action Shaving System, Silver    I have very sensitive skin, and to boot I not only shave my face but my head as well.  I had owned a previous wet and dry shaver from Panasonic for many years until it finally gave out.  I tried to replace it with several other common brands to no avail either they did not shave smooth enough or really were too abrasive for my sensitive skin,until I bought this one.    First it charges in less than an hour, second, the charge lasts me three shaves or roughly a week&#x27;s worth.  The charger is very compact unless all the other bulky ones I was used to. It comes in a little pouch for travel that takes no space at all.    Now to the shave, it is smooth as you can imagine almost as good if not the same as with a regular blade, it is fast as well, I liked it so much that afraid I may not get another one in the future if this one wears out, I went ahead and bought a second one.    Highly recommend this shaver it has to be the best around and it wont take you to the poor house either, priced at under $80 it is well worth the price of more expensive shavers that do not work as well.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to try it you will not regret it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Panasonic wet/dry shaver user for many years now; this is my 3rd model and I needed to replace my older version as it no longer held a charge and the model itself was phased out. This new model (8103) does a very good job at the first cut (I always touch up with a straight razor anyway as my beard is way too thick for ANY electric to get close enough). A few things I like and see improvements on, compared to my older model: it charges quickly; the motor is quieter; provides a closer shave; is lighter weight. The only negative I&#x27;d point out (and it&#x27;s a small one) is that the on/off switch is right in the center of the unit, and because of my hand position when I&#x27;m operating it, I&#x27;ve accidentally turned it off; no big deal, I&#x27;m just re-training my hand to keep the thumb off of dead center. This model is proving to be dependable and an improvement over my old one, and cost-wise, is also an excellent value.</li>
            <li> I have bought my husband many razors over the years and thought this would make a great birthday present.&lt;br /&gt;I feel very bad because this is a torture device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We read all the tips and tricks here before he used it and followed all insctructions to a \\&quot;T\\&quot;. My husbands beard is of medium thickness . We tried wet with shaving cream and dry he gave it several tries hoping there would be a learning curve. Each time after he was done his face turned red and raw within 30 minutes after shaving with or without special products that prevent aftershave irritation. This razor also took 2-3 times longer for him to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am seeing people who rate this product badly get very nasty responses so in advance of youre nasty responses&lt;br /&gt;I would like to state again My husband can use other razors without problems and we followed instructions.</li>
            <li> THIS IS AN AWESOME ELECTRIC RAZOR. BY BEING ABLE TO USE IT IN THE SHOWER WITH THE ASSISTANTS OF THE STEAM/WATER YOU CAN AQUIRE THE CLOSEST SHAVE POSSIBLE WITH NO IRRITATION. I WOULDN&#x27;T HAVE BELIEVED IT IF I HADN&#x27;T TRIED IT MYSELF. IT&#x27;S CHANGED EVERYTHING IN MY SHAVING EXPERIANCE. I&#x27;D REALLY MISS IT NOW IF I COULD NOT USE IT. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS RAZOR. BEST SHAVE I&#x27;VE EVER HAD.</li>
            <li> Pros: Quiet, close shave after a couple of passes, great battery/charges very quickly  Cons: Not as close of a shave as I expected, takes a little longer than other shavers</li>
            <li> This shaver provides a good shave.  I switched to the Panasonic from a Norelco rotory blade shaver and it took a couple of weeks until I felt like I was getting a better shave but I would now rate it above the Norelco.  The digital readout is also helpful in knowing exactly how much power is left in the battery.  Quick and easy to clean under the faucet.</li>
            <li> Since skin absorbs applied moisture, causing the skin to swell around facial hair, I always dry shave, preferably 20 to 30 minutes after a shower in order to get a closer, longer lasting shave.  My prior shaver was a Panasonic ES4025 model, and it is this shaver that I will be comparing to my new Panasonic ES8103 model.  The older model is superior to the newer one in closeness of shave, and in the power of the cutting action.  Both shavers require more repeat strokes than I would prefer. The newer ES8103 shaver is more comfortable to use largely due to the pivot action, the blade action is much faster (although it doesn&#x27;t reduce my shaving time appreciably), the battery lasts about twice as long per charge, doesn&#x27;t slow down as it discharges, and recharges in a much shorter time.  The display of battery power remaining is a nice touch, and the trimmer action is good (as it was in the older model).  All in all, I am quite happy with the ES8103 model, and expect to use it for years to come.</li>
            <li> This shaver has the intention of being the best. It gets a close shave to most of my face. Very close. But Where it is excellent in this it is very bad at finishing my whole face and neck. I am not the hairiest person. I&#x27;d say my facial hair is medium. I cannot for the life of me shave my neck jaw area with this product. Even If I go over it forwards or backwards 20 times it still leaves me with patches of fluff. I have resorted to using my old shaver to do this area. Not a great solution using two electric shavers. I wish I bought a product that was circular and not this rectangular shaver.</li>
            <li> The razor matched or exceeded expectations and is performing well.  We would purchase the item again or give as a gift.</li>
            <li> I like this razor.  A good price for a nice shave.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.  I have very coarse facial hair and other electric shavers pulled the hairs more than cutting them.  This is great dry, wet or with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had an electric shaver since I was 13 years old.  They never really worked right.  After getting sick and tired of buying razor blades and all the things associated with having sensitive skin I decided to give this a try.  It&#x27;s ok.  Takes a long time to shave.  You really have to go back and forth a lot.  It gets pretty close on my face but doesn&#x27;t at all on my neck.  I have to always go back with a razor on my neck.  And this electric shaver will still cut me if I go over a area too much or press too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to return it but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  It might come in handy for when shaving with a blade isn&#x27;t an option.  It&#x27;s also good for mid day touch ups.</li>
            <li> My wife bought me this shaver as a gift, I really am happy with my purchase of this shaver, it works great no problems what so ever and the shave is awesome, close and my skin is so smooth after using it.&lt;br /&gt;Here are some pro’s and con’s&lt;br /&gt;Pro&lt;br /&gt;Works great no hassle&lt;br /&gt;Fast charge cycle  (30 min)&lt;br /&gt;Battery life I can shave for a week between charge cycles.&lt;br /&gt;Con&lt;br /&gt;No brush to clean it&lt;br /&gt;No case I travel allot and wish there was a case</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8103S shaver is light, compact and delivers a comfortable clean shave.  I like the charge percent meter.  It lets me know when  a charge is needed before it runs out of juice.</li>
            <li> I like it just, wished that I had gotten the 4 or 5 blade....&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying one as soon as I find one at the right price..</li>
            <li> My Braun cordless finally died even plugged in so I needed a replacement fast. I found this one on sale and the reviews were good. I decided to give it a try and am very glad I did. It is comfortable and smooth and shaves almost as close as a blade. I would definately buy another if I lost it.</li>
            <li> First electric shaver I have used EVER. Wow, it really does replace my blade and saves alot of time. Very easy to use and clean. Close shave and easy to travel with. Quick charge</li>
            <li> I use this shaver dry, though I did try shaving with shaving cream when I first got it. I find it&#x27;s easier to clean when i use it dry, and only need to apply soap and clean under running water about once/week. It does a good enough job to get me through the day.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an electric shaver for my boyfriend ( he had been looking for one for a long time) My dad ordered this one and really liked it. He had very sensitive skin and has never had any problems breaking out at all with this one using it wet or dry. He recommended this one to me and I am sooo glad I listened. Works great and will order again if anyone else needs an electric shaver.  I would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Best change in shavers I have made.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t judge this shaver until you have used it for a month.  Your face adapts gradually until you get a fast, smooth and clean shave in one or two passes.  The sideburn trimmer is nice, plus less irritation of your skin over blade shaving.  Nice!</li>
            <li> I use this razor with shaving cream for a wet shave and it is by far the smoothest and best shave I have ever had.  Any other electric razor does not come close to the shaving ability of this razor.  The battery lasts me for about 6 days before recharging and I have used it when it read only 10% left with no problems of the razor slowing down.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the display can be a little flaky in its read out when getting wet.  When it dries out the display is fine so that is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> Started out okay, but over time it&#x27;s become more rough on my neck.  Since, I&#x27;ve switched to shaving with a DE safety razor.</li>
            <li> As an old man, I have probably used almost every brand of electric shavers, and Panasonic is head and shoulders above the others in terms of true value.  The shaver is a best buy with regard to performance and quality.  Those that I have owned have been great at shaving my face at a price that is affordable.  But what do I know...I&#x27;m only a 72 year old man who has been shaving for almost 60 years!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been eyeballing this Panasonic shaver for over a week, and finally ordered it a few days back, and earlier today it arrived - I charged it - and it DOMINATED my facial hair!  I had \\&quot;the Bruce Willis\\&quot; type of stubble, and this 8103 ate right though all of it.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with its first performance test: zero discomfort, very efficient and a really close shave too.  ...Going by first impressions, this shaver kicks @ss &amp; chews bubble gum!  I hope it has the durability to last me a long time, because so far I really dig this purchase; I def recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Here&#x27;s a little update, I guess I pressed the shaver a bit too vigorously against my skin, because 24hrs after I first used the shaver I noticed (just under my lip, above my chin) were approximately a dozen little sores (they looked like zits).  ...Although I didn&#x27;t notice it while shaving, it appears the shaver has the ability to shave a few microns off the top layer of \\&quot;bumpy skin.\\&quot;  So I&#x27;ve learned to not be so aggressive with the shaver, because it can cut a bit too close if you ram it against your face like a noob.  ...Granted the sores are few &amp; superficial, but maybe using \\&quot;aftershave\\&quot; is a good idea to help serialize the area after shaving.  Anyway, this shaver still rocks, I just need to be less of a killer when using it, lol.</li>
            <li> Shaves closer, and costs much less than my Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is the shaving time. Have to recharge about every 5 or 6 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;A very good shaver for the cost.</li>
            <li> This reasonably priced shaver has all the performance of the more costly versions with \\&quot;drying chambers\\&quot; etc at a much lower cost.     It takes a little time to learn how the closest shave is achieved.    The bottom line: this shaver gives me the closed shave ever AND... with no irritation compared to my old shaver.    Minor Con: The number of shaves per battery charge is overstated in the specification... I get about 7.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but it doesn&#x27;t cut all the hair. It leaves little shaggy strands of hair on my face. Not a smooth shave at all.</li>
            <li> This razor was terrible, its EXTREMELY LOUD, it only worked the first time I used it, which I guess dulled out the blades and it was just pulling hair out of my face which was extremely painful. The battery only lasted 3 shaving sessions(took me about 20-30 minutes because it just would not cut). Maybe it just wasn&#x27;t a match for my dense beard, but I ended up returning it.</li>
            <li> Requires lots of skin streching and passes back and forth over the same area to get down to a decent stubble.&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended for a QUICK touch-up and go. For the results I&#x27;ve gotten, I suspect I could have spent half the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got about 2/3 of the hair on my head left and so decided to go commando (no hair at all).  I have never used an electric shaver but after a couple of tries with my regular razor I figured that I would give electric a try for the top of my head.     I did some checking on various shavers and liked the wet/dry aspect of the Panasonic.  I chose this model based on features vs price.      So far it has worked very well on the top of my head.  I did try it for facial hairs but am sticking to my edge and a razor for the face.   The five star rating applies only for shaving my head, not my face.    As it has only been a month or so, there is no way of knowing how well it will hold up over the long run.</li>
            <li> Pros:  It works much better than any I have owned.  It is a smooth operator. I would highly recommend it.      Cons:  Sideburn trimmer is not very good. You still need to touch up the neck with a blade.  But that is true of any electric that I have tried, so that is just par for the course.</li>
            <li> My favor electric razor since I can use it in the showers. Super easy to clean (doesn&#x27;t require cleaning fluid or anything) just rinse with water. I shave every other day so I only charge it about once a week.  Battery life is good so far, about 3 months and still going strong.</li>
            <li> The shaver overall is nice because of the outlay of it and how fast it charges plus the speed that you can clean it using water. The cons are that the price was quite high for the quality that it provides. The reason I bought this razor was too try and prevent getting ingrown hairs and it doesn&#x27;t help to well with that but it does cut really close to the grain.</li>
            <li> After much research, I settled on this particular shaver.....partly because of the price from Amazon and free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased .......and would highly recommend it....in fact, I just did to our houseguest this morning....</li>
            <li> I have a moderate beard and shave my face and head regularly. I used Norelcos for decades and have also had Brauns and Remingtons among others through the years. I bought my first Panasonic shaver about seven years ago and have become a huge fan. It seems to do the best job of quickly shaving my scalp as well as navigating face curves. My old ES8047 gave up the ghost after about five years and I needed a replacement. But most of the new Panasonic shavers are bigger and heavier with more heads. Many of the reviews seem to indicate poorer reliability. When I found the ES8103, I found a shaver with all the strengths of the ES8047 plus better battery life.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;  Light weight&lt;br /&gt;  Quiet - if you think this is too noisy, you need to go back to a blade&lt;br /&gt;  Agile - does a good job with tough spots on your face&lt;br /&gt;  Picks up stray hairs well&lt;br /&gt;  Easy to clear under running water&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;  Side trimmer cuts well, but you does tend to close unless you keep a finger on it (the 8047 had the same problem)&lt;br /&gt;  Replacement blades are expensive (but way cheaper than a multiblade razor)&lt;br /&gt;One tip: Make sure you change the blades when you see the performance drop off. I haven&#x27;t had to do this with the 8103 yet, but I&#x27;ve only had it a few months. I found I needed to change the blades about once a year on my 8047. If your beard is very coarse, you may need to do it more frequently.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this shaver</li>
            <li> He used to shave with a razor blade everyday, now he never touches that!  He uses this everyday and says he gets a close shave, but he has to keep moving it around and around to get it close.  It&#x27;s very convenient for him to use before going to work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now, it gets pretty close to the skin but I have a few trouble spots that this shaver just seems to have a hard time with.  Underneath the jaw bone you have to go over and over and over and even then it seems like it just won&#x27;t get those last few pesky hairs.  I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of things like pulling the skin different directions but no matter what you do it seems there is just a few hairs it won&#x27;t pick up.  So mostly I shave the best I can with it and then whip out my regular Gillette razor and just quickly hit the problem areas rather than spend 10+ minutes going over the same spots with no result.</li>
            <li> This razor works well and is very easy to clean.  The instructions say to shave with it for about a month so that your beard&#x27;s growth patterns can adjust to a new shaver.  I have to say that was correct, it took about 3 weeks before I felt this razor was shaving as close as my previous one.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with the quality, appearance, ease of use, of this product.  The shaves I get are close and smooth. Much better than with my old razor.  I bought this based on the customer reviews at Amazon and the product reviews at Consumer Reports.  The reviews were spot on. Also very happy with the purchase and the price from Amazon .</li>
            <li> the shaver is the birthday gift for my boyfriend. My boyfriend likes its good look, it is metallic luster and looks very cool. after using it, he found it works great! it is clean and soft, and you can clean it with water, it&#x27;s very convenient. In a short, it&#x27;s a good shaver.</li>
            <li> This razor met my expectations! I use it dry and it gives me a fast, close shave. I only have to charge the battery once every two weeks.</li>
            <li> I had purchased the more expensive 4 head model and returned it within a week.  It is just too damn big.  The head is not easily maneuverable and it is cumbersome.  Its hard to do your upper lip and near your nose.  And as far as their stating it gets longer hairs, thats BS.  I returned it and got the es 8103, the three head model and the difference is noticeable as soon as you take it out of the box.  The head is smaller, easier to use and just does a better job.  The head moves in and out as you our more pressure on and it pivots from left to right.  It is perfect.  Its kind of compact, really great to hold and comfortable to use.  An added bonus is that it is made in Japan rather than CHINA.  Would be better yet if it were American Made.  But, if you had to make a choice, this would be a smart move.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001DNE3KQ Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Rechargeable Linear Pivot Action Shaving System, Silver]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this razor for my husband.  I reviewed all the comments from the gentlemen who have this razor, and decided this was the best razor for the price.  While I am happy with the fact that my husband is happy for the most part...we both are unhappy with the fact that it will not run with the cord inserted in the razor.  If you forget to charge it and the charge is out of the razor, you are out of luck.  Otherwise, it is quiet, runs well, my husbands says it cleans well, cuts well, and overall, he likes it.  Except, for this one drawback.</li>
            <li> My husband has worn out 2 of these razors and came back for another one.  He gets the close shave he wants without irritation.</li>
            <li> I had always bought the little rinky dink electric razors and was never satisfied with their performance. When I started shaving my head daily, I decided to get a nice electric razor. I was afraid of spending so much money for something I might not want once I get it. This model was highly regarded and once I got it, I saw why.   With a little dab of &#x27;shave secret&#x27; lotion, this razor will give you a smooth shave with no problems. It works good with shaving cream too, but the shave secret lotion seems to &#x27;hold&#x27; the blades to the surface with ease and get it extra close. Shaving your head with it really wears out the blades and foil a lot more than average because your actually pressing against skeletal bone rather than just a cheek or neck. I have had it over a year now and it still shaves close and performance is great.   When I was cleaning it recently, I did decide to take the blades off and clean around in there a bit with a Q-tip. Well, the blades came off and on easily. When I originally read how to do it in the instructions, I dreaded to ever have to do any of that. Well, it&#x27;s not too bad. I&#x27;m really impressed with this model and would highly recommend.   Oh, and the charge on this model gives you a countdown and you can easily chart it from 100% charge to 10% charge. I think it tells you when to clean or and other prompts on the little display as well. There have been times it needed to be cleaned off and it lets you know.   If there is a newer version of this model, you might give it a look, but I can tell you it would be tough to top this model for the price.</li>
            <li> My Norelco needed replacement after many years, and that model was discontinued.  I wanted a wet/dry so I tried this model.  It requires a lot of work to get a clean shave, and even that only comes at the expense of my skin.  I do not recommend this at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 3 different electric shavers and every blade out there...this is by far the best shave. My skin has cleared up quite a bit since I started using it, razor bumps have gone to zero. Cleaning is rinsing with liquid soap under faucet..no big deal. I let it air dry while I shower. However, I like it so much and it works so well, I&#x27;m curious if the cleaning system is as good as the razor..so I may upgrade to that at some point. I have moderately thick, fine hair.  I highly recommend \\&quot;Lectric Shave\\&quot; rather than soap and water or water based shave gels. For my sensitive skin, that&#x27;s what&#x27;s worked best. I drop a couple drops of Lectric Shave on the foils after its dry and before putting it away..does a good job lubricating. What&#x27;s odd, is after 30 years of trying everything, I&#x27;m back to the same approach to shaving my dad used...electric shaver and lectric shave. Dad was right.  This does not pull the hair out of your skin so that the hair is cut below skin level..which is what causes my razor bumps. This fact alone is worth the price of the razor..but I like all the features on it so far. Yes this means I sometimes touch up in evening if I&#x27;m going out...no big deal. I would rather do that than suffer all the irritation for a longer lasting shave.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Hands down, this shaver is the best electric shave I have ever had. Of course a blade will do one better, but as far as electrics go in this price range I don&#x27;t think you can do any better. I tested rotary shavers in the same price category as this shaver, and they didn&#x27;t compare. I like how this shaver tells you how much juice it has left (my old shaver just died). It also tells you when it&#x27;s time to clean it, and it&#x27;s waterproof so you can easily wash it or shave in the shower. My old electric shaver would not shave the neck no matter how much I asked it to. This shaver will shave the neck, but it will take a few passes. Time wise, this shaver will take about the same time as shaving with a blade- but obviously without the hassle of doing so. Some reviewers also commented on the heat and the noise. This shaver isn&#x27;t quiet, but it&#x27;s not too loud either. A little louder than my last electric shaver. Also, yes, the shaver does heat up a little bit on your face. The heat and noise though are only minor inconveniences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a foil person my whole life so maybe I just work better with foil. But simply, this is the best electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had and I highly recommend it. If I had the option of purchasing this shaver again, I definitely would. Now there&#x27;s no \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; shaver. It still takes time and multiple passes to look clean. But this shaver has so many high reviews for a reason. If you&#x27;re in the market for an electric, give this one a try.</li>
            <li> The only thing wrong with the Panasonic ES8103S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade shaver is that it has a light that flashes after its charged so you cannot keep it plugged in all the time. No electric shaver is going to shave as close as a blade and will require several passes to get the job done. I have a light beard and still it requires multiple passes over the same spot. I thought I&#x27;d like the floating pivoting head but after the novelty wore off in a few days I put it in the lock position so that it would stay steady. It is a good as my old Braun and the replacement parts (blades/foils) are less expensive so I like this shaver because of its lower parts cost versus the Braun.</li>
            <li> This morning I finall got the shaver here in the Bahamas, Charged up and had my first use. This was a very comfortable and close shave. Had Braun for years. But this Panasonic shaver is great.  After a week of use, the shaver gets better and better and grows on you.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;This shaver was high priced, yet LCD display stopped working after after 8 mos so I couldn&#x27;t tell when I was getting low and resulted in poorer shaves. Blades dulled after 1 year when these were supposed to not need replacement for 2 years and I have skimpy, light beard growth.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have never gotten such a close shave than I have with the ES8103S, it is also very gentle on my face, it is so easy to clean with the turbo clean mode feature, and the pop up trimmer is also very good. It also has a privet lock/unlock feature, its digital readout always lets you know when to charge it.&lt;br /&gt;I really love this neat razor, so much that I won&#x27;t go back to hand razors.</li>
            <li> pros:&lt;br /&gt;- close shave on most parts of my face&lt;br /&gt;- great trimmer&lt;br /&gt;- good build quality&lt;br /&gt;- easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;- good display&lt;br /&gt;- comfortable in hand / ergonomic design&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;- struggled in thicker parts of my beard - took longer and more passes, and you could hear the thing struggling (fyi this did not happen with the 14,000 linear motor in the ES-LA63-S).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;- though gave a close shave for most areas of my face, couldn&#x27;t cut it with thicker parts of my beard, so no go.</li>
            <li> This razor is very good at cutting the hard to get at hairs on the neck - 5 stars.  This razor is deficient in hair clipping capture. When I shave, I am covered in whiskers and need to wash down the sink and dust off my shoulders and collar afterwards. - 2 stars  This razors battery life isn&#x27;t all that impressive. It wont even get me through the work week before recharging is needed - 3 days is typical. It also doesn&#x27;t allow you to use while plugged in. - 2 stars  I am coming off of 1 year of use and previous experience with a Norelco which didn&#x27;t have any of the drawbacks above but didnt get the neck hairs that lay down nearly as well. Pick you poison I guess.</li>
            <li> Great quality and you can not beat the price.  This shaver gets a close shave and does not irritate the face</li>
            <li> Well, it does the job for a great price! But, I really had to get used to it and its disadvantages. For example, at first, I couldn&#x27;t shave my neck. After a while a learned that I must point the machine really opposite to the hairs - and that means a lot of rotations, cycles and juggling - yes, juggling. Now, after a month, I get pretty good results. It&#x27;s not perfect or user friendly, but if you learn how it works, you can get the job done.</li>
            <li> Price, performance, and everyone is satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Asians on my face shows a good performance.&lt;br /&gt;Want to buy a wider variety of products.</li>
            <li> I have used electric razors for about 27 years. Unfortunately, my trusted Remington has bit the dust and cannot be replaced. I tried the new one and it is horrible. I wanted  one that could be used for multiple areas.  I just got this one yesterday. It does not work well on legs (shin area). And as for &amp;#34;downstairs&amp;#34;, unless you are completely bald and want to keep it that way EVERY DAY, it does not work well either. First you will have to shave with a real razor and then just try to keep things trimmed up with this one, which defeats the purpose.  It caused razor burn and pulled and would not cut even &amp;#34;two day&amp;#34; length stubble in the bikini area.  Husband tried it on toe hair and it just went right over it without cutting it.  The flip out cutter is very small and will nick you if you are not careful when trying to cut down on the hair length first.  It did ok on under arms and face. NOTE that because these areas are shaved EVERY DAY so there was just small stubble.  You think for the price, it would be much better  Probably will be better off buying a cheap razor from WalMart. They are practically disposable.  Going to return it.</li>
            <li> For the price, I cannot find a better product.&lt;br /&gt;The grip and overall fell are good.&lt;br /&gt;If there is a con, I think this item is a little noisier than past razors I&#x27;ve owned.&lt;br /&gt;I got used to it ... Mine is a few years old and still working fine.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything for a great shave without burning myself. This was not it. If you are in the market looking for a smooth shave that will not irritate your face for those of us with sensitive skin keep on looking.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly good razor for the price. I use it while I am traveling. The charge hold well and it does a good job with multiple growth levels. Edge feature works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like every electric razor I have ever used it doesn&#x27;t truly replace blades but it does a really nice job</li>
            <li> I have been using Panasonic Wet/Dry shavers for the past 25 years or more and have nothing but good things to say about them.  Prior to this and over the years I have tried Braun, Norelco and Remington shavers but they do not compare or even come close to the build quality, durability and closeness of the shave.  They clean up easily and give a smooth, close shave and they last for years.  I bought this one to replace a model ES 8016 which is 9 years old and still works although it doesn&#x27;t hold its charge as long, down to 7 days from 14 when it was new, and the blades really need replacing.  This updated model has a floating head which is nice but it can be locked if you prefer and an LCD screen showing remaining charge.  As far as I am concerned you can&#x27;t go wrong with a Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;m retired and lazy and don&#x27;t want to take the time to pull out the shaving cream and razor. I owned a Braun many years ago and loved it. I gave this a try because it was on sale. It does okay as long as you don&#x27;t let your beard get beyond a stubble. I would not purchase this model if you need a close shave for work; but it&#x27;s great if you want to look retired and not homeless.</li>
            <li> This was a great value for the quality of shave.  Hands down best electric razor I have ever owned.  There may be better ones out there but it&#x27;s hard to think that there is something else with this level of quality at this price.</li>
            <li> This shaver works decent, it comes with a clipper that works very well, but the actual shaving part tends to miss a lot of hair. I don&#x27;t think that any electric shaver is efficient like a regular razor, but for this price I shouldn&#x27;t have to go over my leg five times in order to get a good cut. It should work just as well on a womans leg as a mans face. My leg hair isn&#x27;t even as course as that, and it tends to miss lighter hair a lot as well. I guess Electric razors are only good for getting missed hair after shaving in the shower. It just doesn&#x27;t work like I wanted it to at all. Kind of a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Noisy. Takes a long time to shave. Leaves some whiskers behind no matter how many passes. Works better when I use shaving cream.</li>
            <li> This is the fastest electric razor I&#x27;ve ever hard. I would highly recommend this product, and will never go back to the other major brands.</li>
            <li> This product is just OK.  The high pitched sound is very annoying.&lt;br /&gt;It take slightly longer to get a complete shave.&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the battery charge meter is&lt;br /&gt;a very handy idea.</li>
            <li> II like it.  After reading all of the reviews, I decided to go with a well-known simple shaver.  It works great and does what it says.  I use it mostly when I am on the go and it comes in very handy.  I have no trouble with the number of shaves that you get with a full charge.  I tried it with a Dry face, a wet face, and using baby oil.  The shaver did well on each of the shaving environments.  I found it easy to clean.  One important thing to me is that I did NOT get any razor rash.  Although others complain about the sideburns trimmer, I found it acceptable.  After using it for over a month, I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> For me it gives a good shave and battery life is very good. Easy to clean and can be washed with water without any problems.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my father, and he really loves this gift. The only bad thing is it makes a lot of noise when my father uses it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever had.  I&#x27;ve been through several and this thing shaves like a safety razor.  Excellent for shaving my head too.</li>
            <li> Gives very close shaves and I would recommend this item.  Best electric shaver I have had in the last 40 years.</li>
            <li> With this electric shaver, it took me 3 times longer to get a shave that was one-third as good as a disposable razor.</li>
            <li> I love saving money and not having to buy replacement cartridges for my Gillete razor. This product works well wet or dry, but if your going to use wet buy the gel that foams not the foa out of a can. The difference is the smoothness and the glide of the strokes. On a one day old beard its fantastic, on a two day old beard you will find some straggler hairs it did not cut, and a three day old beard is worse. So my experience is keep a razor handy if you do not plan on shaving every day. The other thing I love is the quick charge of this thing in about an hour im at 100%, really fast, but a few minutes is all you need if you want a quick shave and do not want to wait. I love it Hope you will too.</li>
            <li> I bought the razor for my husband. He is delighted with it. He had been using his fathers, I think more for sentimental reasons then for practicality.  He has since donated the old razor to a men&#x27;s shelter.</li>
            <li> It ok . But I have one like this befor . Make in japan , it way better then this</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the trimmer part never worked very well but the shaver part is awesome and works very well. I can get about a weeks worth of daily shaves on a charge. I&#x27;ve had this thing for about 2 years now and it&#x27;s still going strong. I&#x27;ve replaced the foil and cutting blades once each. One other small issue is that it won&#x27;t run when it&#x27;s plugged in and charging, so cordless only. The charge indicator on the front is very accurate and easy to see. Easy to clean as it is water proof. I wash it regularly with hot soapy water and then use a spray lube after it dries off.</li>
            <li> Quality shaver at a good price! Lovin it</li>
            <li> It works fine.  Man of few words</li>
            <li> After wearing out a Braun series 3 and a cheaper Panasonic, I bought this as a compromise between price and performance.  So far, several months later, it seems to be a wise purchase.  Shaves quickly and cleanly.  Sounds like an angry mosquito, but you get used to it.  With my fairly light beard it lasts two weeks between charges.  Ordinarily I charge once a week, but recently I forgot and ran out of juice and discovered that it will not run while the shaver is plugged in to the charger--a minor inconvenience as it charged enough to use in a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> works as expected, my last one lasted a little over 4 years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased three of these razors...the first one for myself, the other two for my father and step-father...we all really like it. Great performance. I love that you can use it in the shower, with shaving cream or dry.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s great. I bought it bc I developed moderate adult acne &amp; shaving w Gillette Mach3 blades was wreaking havoc on my skin. This is much gentler, even though it still does cause very mild irritation. I have somewhat sensitive skin &amp; this has basically accompished exactly what I was hoping for. Since I figured my skin might clear up in a few months as my medication starts to take effect, I did not want to spend a lot on a shaver. Consumer Reports rated this a Best Buy, so I debated taking the plunge. When Amazon ran a holiday special for about $65, this seemed too good to pass up. Very happy I made the switch. It took only a few shaves for me to get used to using it. My main complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t give a very close shave on the delicate skin toward the bottom of my neck. Often I will go over it 7-8 times, which can cause redness. The Lock/Soft switch produces a noticeable effect on comfort &amp; performance - useful for different areas. Battery life is decent &amp; charges very quickly: 1 charge is probably good for 45 mins shave time, about 1/2 dozen shaves. (I DO miss the speed of a blade) I&#x27;ve always found shaving dry skin is faster &amp; gives a closer shave. This 1 is no different ... though it&#x27;s definitely functional &amp; shaves comfortably w a little shave gel. Cleanup is very easy by just popping off the head &amp; rinsing. All in all, I&#x27;m very satisfied w the product at its price. I would definitely recommend it, a good option even just to pick up if you&#x27;re looking for an occasional alternative to using your blade w/o breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> LIFE CHANGING!  I don&#x27;t hate shaving every morning anymore.  I also have a Norelco and a Braun, and this is far and away my favorite.  Can&#x27;t believe the low price, and it is a GREAT shave!  A co-worker had a Panasonic and loved it, so I tried this one and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  You can hear it cutting the hairs, so when you stop hearing the trimming it is done.  Quicker and more thorough than either of my other electrics.  Also, no problem going through my beard even after letting it grow for a few days.  The others did not like to tackle a longer beard without a pre-trim, but the Panasonic motors through with no problem.  I&#x27;d give it 6 stars if they were available.  I just hope they never stop making replacement blades (although I&#x27;ve had it almost a year and still haven&#x27;t replaced the blades).</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried a Panasonic shaver before and was pleased with this one.  Gives a great, close shave.  Relatively quiet. handles easily  Recharges quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a good electric razor. It is relatively quiet when compared to the older Remington I had. It does a nice close shave and it does catch the longer hairs also. Better than the Remington did. It says in the instructions it might take 1 month for your face/whiskers to adapt. I did not find this an issue. What you need to be careful of is not to push too hard and make sure your skin is stretched out enough so the middle blade does not take a nip out of you. Once you get used to this it is all good. The only thing is I wish the power supply was inside the razor and not on the charging cable. It is not as compact for travel as my Remington was.</li>
            <li> not as good as razor but works.  best in shower with lots of soap for closest shave</li>
            <li> works well just wish it had a stand type recharger instead of just a cord</li>
            <li> Quite disappointed with the quality and feel of the unit. I do not want a Japanese company selling me Chinese products!!!! For the most part Panasonic has meant quality products made in Japan, not anymore. I will be very careful before I buy Panasonic again. The unit is very light and feels cheap I have been using a Braun Series Seven for Five plus years and still use it. This was bought as a gift for my son as he is just starting to need to shave (teenager). The 5 year old Braun still outperforms it and I guess will be my replacement brand when it fails. The unit is not as noisy as some people complain about. It provides a decent shave but the lack of quality in the components has me believing that it will not make it much past the warranty period before it fails or breaks due so a short drop to the counter while shaving. Cheap Plastic seems to be the priority in the manufacturing of the unit. At the price I paid (about $50.00 USD) it is alright but there are many better units at the non-sale price of this shaver. Companys with a reputation for quality need to keep quality and the end user experience as their number one priority to survive in the new world of global cheap products, customers want quality; and if we know that is what we will get we will pay for it but the amount of crap being produced has many people buying cheap crap because when they buy a supposed quality brand these days they are actually buying the same quality as off brand junk. It used to be that a quality product cost more but paid for itself in the long run. This is a rare thing anymore and needs to be the norm again not the exception if quality brands want to survive. Market them as quality and STAND BEHIND them and we will buy them.</li>
            <li> i guess i didn&#x27;t really know shaving until i got one of these&lt;br /&gt;main issue i have is it does not shave my neck hairs well, but on my face it is absolutely fantastic&lt;br /&gt;trimmer is also awesome</li>
            <li> I have had this Panasonic ES8103S men&#x27;s 3 blade wet/dry shaver since July 2, 2013.  Today is 12-6-13 so I will rate the shaver, since I had some time to use it.  Follow the instructions.  It&#x27;s a great shaver for me.  Recharge is once a week for about an hour. The shaver will tell you when to recharge &amp; clean the head of the shaver.  When cleaning don&#x27;t forget to use liquid soap as it helps keep the head of the shaver very clean.  Also the trim edge works great for sideburns etc.</li>
            <li> Close shave without any burning. It feels good in my hand...is that ergonomicly correct? Holds charge well. Charges quickly. Smooth, so it packs well.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor because I get very bad razor bumps using several different razors. This is the first razor that has left me razor bump free! It does take a few passes to get all the hairs but it gives a very close and clean shave. I would recommend this to anyone who has sensitive skin and/or razor bumps.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my husband this year (2013) but since I have an incredibly nosey spouse, it was discovered and used the same day it was delivered to my house. I walk in on my husband using it and I couldn&#x27;t even get mad because he loved it so much, I have to say it does do a great job, his face is as smooth as it is when he uses a real razor. I love it and so does he, 5 stars for me.</li>
            <li> It looks better than it works.  Cuts very slowly so takes longer to shave.  Instructions not clear on how to \\&quot;wash\\&quot; under water, so I just brush clean. One positive, it is very quiet.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my father not too long ago and he says it works really well. Close shave every single time. He can&#x27;t be any happier than he is now.</li>
            <li> My second Panasonic as the battery was starting to go on the old one.  Better recharging setup on that one.  But, the important part is the shave and this does it.  No snags and close.  I can let it go a couple of days and it wades right and gets things smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little noisy but it works like it should. I haven&#x27;t used it in the shower but it works fine when shaving dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver now for 9 months.  I recently replaced it with another Panasonic shaver, model ES-LA63.  I&#x27;ll get to that later.  Let me just start off by saying I&#x27;ve used Panasonic shavers for 20 years and have always been very happy with them, until this model.  I read all the reviews here and decided this was an easy choice.  The first thing I noticed was that the ES8103S took longer to shave with than my 5 year old Panasonic Linear shaver ever did.  No matter how many times I went back and forth over my neck area I would have stray hairs all over that I needed to get with a blade.  I also noticed the shave I got was not as close as my old shaver on top of the longer shave time.  Not only was the shaver sub par in the neck area, it had a lot of problems around my chin, a spot that no shaver I&#x27;ve owned has had a problem with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I went on using it over the months, I noticed the battery life on this shaver was also a lot LESS than my 5 year old shaver!  I simply chalked that up to the new shaver being lighter and just using a smaller battery.  Of course now I realize it was because I was spending so much more time trying to get a close shave with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint though was the big mess this shaver makes the entire time you use it.  I shave dry and I only rinse the shaver out a couple of times a week.  This was never a problem with my older Panasonic, but it&#x27;s a big problem with this one.  Unless you clean this out EVERY time you use it, there are whiskers all over your shirt and sink after you&#x27;re done shaving.  Even worse, this shaver holds water like no other.  If you think you can just rinse it off and put it in a cabinet you&#x27;re mistaken, as it will drip water for hours even after a good drying.  Of course if you intend to use this shaver wet your experience might be far different than mine, but as I never once used this wet I can&#x27;t comment on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was for all of these reasons that I picked up the 4 bladeES-LA63.  Wow, what a difference!  This is what a Panasonic shaver is supposed to be like.  Not only does it provide me a FAR closer shave, it does it much, MUCH faster than the ES8103 ever could, and all the while does it while not dropping whiskers all over.  The best part is that by 2pm my face still feels smooth, which couldn&#x27;t be said of the ES8103.  At the time I bought the ES8103, it was far less expensive than the ES-LA63, about half the price.  Now there is only about $30 separating the two, and I can tell you from experience that the extra $30 is money WELL spent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good. However I have a round face so I have maneuver it around. But it cuts really well. For those tough spots I have to use a regular razor to get a clean cut. Good product</li>
            <li> United Airlines lost my luggage containing this shaver. It (or my luggage) was never found. I bought another one just like it because it&#x27;s just that good</li>
            <li> This shaver surpasses the Norelco tripple blade I used for years. It leaves a clean skin without pre shave lotion. I recommend it to anyone who needs a new electric shaver.</li>
            <li> well made and I like it very much.</li>
            <li> my friend said, like this shaver</li>
            <li> It does provide a close shave but also creates serious razor burn on sensitive skin .. Probably works find on skin that isn&#x27;t sensitive.</li>
            <li> My husband had never used an electric razor before, but had to go on blood thinners long term, so we purchased the Panasonic and he is very pleased with it.  He feels it provides a close shave and cleans up easily.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT SHAVE CLOSE EVEN WITH A PRE-SHAVE CONDITIONER. NEED TO SHAVE TWICE DAILY NOT RECOMMENDED AM GOING BACK TO NORELCO</li>
            <li> It does absolutely nothing for my neck; unless I don&#x27;t shave for awhile.. then it&#x27;ll act like a bad trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most men seem to have medium - light beards, that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s so many great ratings. I&#x27;ve been doing alot of research and it seems that men with rougher / thicker beards need to spend more money on a stronger electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to return it, and spend $150-$200 on a more powerful / advanced one.</li>
            <li> Having used my Norelco razor, given as a High School graduation gift, for some 45 years, it was time to get an upgrade.  I thought this would be it.  Almost - but not quite.  The shave is not nearly as close as the 45 year old Norelco.  The only exception being the built in trimmer, which has become broken on the Norelco.  Though, the manual suggest two weeks of shaves should be expected from a single battery charge, I doubt that it will happen - after three shaves the battery indicator puts the charge at 30%.  A single charge will likely last a week.  I have  occasionally use a manual razor to either give myself a fresh shave or a touch-up from that provided by my new Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the ability to use the razor in the shower (i.e. wet) or at the sink (i.e. wet or dry) - that convenience has made the purchase worthwhile.  I also appreciate the ability to set closeness (&amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;) and the speed of the motor (&amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34;).  These two setting allow me to have more control over the shave I am getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic ES8103S will serve best for a last minute touch-up, rather than the regular morning shave.  Am I glad I purchased it - YES.  Will it replace my Norelco - I DON&#x27;T KNOW YET.</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use, it is recommended&lt;br /&gt;This product is very easy to use, it is recommended that you buy. The price is very good, very clean shave.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8103S Arc3 Electric Shaver was a great buy. I purchased it while it was one of Amazon&#x27;s Daily Deals for a discount. The product works fairly well. The main issue I have with the product is that I have accumulated razor bumps due to using razors for a while, and this machine is unable to differentiate between the raised bumps and the hair on my face. So, by the end of my shave I have places on my neck that have some patches of hair remaining where there are razor bumps. This is a fatal flaw in the product, but I&#x27;m assuming its some sort of safety function so that I don&#x27;t tear open my razor bumps. Other than that, this product works very well and I was very happy with the remainder of its performance.</li>
            <li> After using rotary shavers for the past 14 years, I decided to try a foil type.  I purchased this Arc3 at the beginning of 2014, and have been using it for two months now. I started using it dry, but recently begin using it with Aveeno shaving cream.  I am really impressed with how close of a shave I get, especially when using the shaving cream.  It&#x27;s much closer than I got with the rotary shavers.  Also, it&#x27;s a lot easier to clean than the rotary models I&#x27;ve owned.  On the downside, the battery life isn&#x27;t as good as the rotary models I&#x27;ve owned. Fortunately, it has an indicator showing how much battery life remains before it needs to be recharged.</li>
            <li> I found I really like this shaver when I use shaving cream.  I get a good shave.  Dry shaving is so so.  I also like the way it shows me how much of the battery charge remains.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Very good for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor in May 2011 and it stopped working because the lithium battery already failed.  Moreover, the battery needs to be replaced by an authorized repair store or a Panasonic repair locaton in another state. If it had failed within the two-year warranty I would be good for a free replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the cost of this razor it should last longer.  I used a Gillette razor for over 20 years before these razors went high tech.</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift to husband thinking it would make shaving easier for him, but he still prefers using a blade razor.</li>
            <li> I have used one for a year and just now replacing the screen.  I bought this one to keep in a suitcase for frequent trips. I always use a preshave lubricant and am convinced this extends the life of the blade.</li>
            <li> I keep this in the car for emergencies. Even after a good shave with razor however this thing cuts closer especially for hard to reach areas like upper lip. Charges fast and the charge lasts through many shaves. If you skip a few days however, expect a little pain using the panasonic.</li>
            <li> This shaver is great.  I use it every day and finish shaving in under 30 seconds.  I love it.  You don&#x27;t even need to dampen your skin or use shaving cream.  Plus, the battery life on it lasts weeks after full charge and it is water proof, making it easy to clean.  I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> It works and cut well. But I cannot stand the huge noise which sounds like car engine. The low quality does not match the high price.</li>
            <li> smooth dry shave  i haven´t try it in wet shave, i would just recommend i tiny brush for diary care. after a month everything is ok.</li>
            <li> Value for money. It function as advertised. A pity it does not come with a hard storage casing for traveler.</li>
            <li> These was on sale for $59 in December. I got it for my bf as a xmas gift...Based off the reviews i ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;He loved it! Great purchase</li>
            <li> this is my first item purchased at amazon&lt;br /&gt;i bought this  at a good price.. i am satisfied...&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s works well..</li>
            <li> I especially like Panasonic prolducts, and this razor has held up very well. The trimmer gets stuck nlow, bujt the rest of the razor continues to do its job.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver the end of May 2012 for my husband.  By mid-July, it was dead.  Would not take or keep a charge.  When I went online today to return, I saw I was past the return deadline for a full refund.  I would not suggest buying something like this thru Amazon.  You would be better buying at Walmart or Target where you can return without hassel.  Not happy at all to lose out on $70!</li>
            <li> I\\&quot;m used to a rotary shaver so this one is a little different.&lt;br /&gt;Plus is it is so easy to clean which saves time and hassle&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it shaves quite as close as my Rotary but with the ease of&lt;br /&gt;cleaning I prefer this one.&lt;br /&gt;Needs to be charged about every 17-20 days using it once a day.&lt;br /&gt;Overall pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with cream/good news razors for over 35 years and started having trouble with little cuts.I didn&#x27;t know if was my now wrinkled face or the razors. So I researched on CR and saw that this was the best razor under a 100 dollars. Of course, Amazon had the best price.What I like about it is no more cuts and sitting down while I&#x27;m shaving.Clean up is easy and has a battery meter right on it.Can easily go 6-7 shaves between shaves.What I don&#x27;t like is that it misses a few whiskers .that no matter what angle and how many times I go over it.Also the trimmer is kinda worthless to me.All in all, it beats cutting my face and I recommend this razor!</li>
            <li> I have used electric shavers for 50 years. This is the best one. Just take off the screen and rinse, to clean.</li>
            <li> I used to have a Remington electric razor that barely lasted me 5 years... I suppose that&#x27;s a good amount of usage though. Anyways- this new Panasonic is incredible! It shaves super close to my skin, has an LCD to indicate how full the charge is, and lets me know when I need to clean it. By the way, cleaning this thing is a breeze! No small bristle brushes to rid the device of remnants... just turn it on and run it under the faucet. I am hoping this device holds up for a while... it seems like a quality build.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: So i&#x27;ve had this razor for about a year now and I noticed that the hair trimmer is broken. There is a small piece of plastic that comes in contact with this tiny vibrating arm. I would like to try and get it replaced but it&#x27;s hard to get information on how Panasonics repair process works.</li>
            <li> After one year of using this shaver, I still hate it as much as the first time I used it. It hurts your face, makes enough noise to wake up the un-dead and the wife. I finally gave up on this junk and bought a Norelco, its like going from a Pinto to a Rolls Royce. Do yourself and the wife a favor and stay clear of this.</li>
            <li> After years of ho-hum shaving I had given up on the electric shavers and went back to a blade.  On a whim I checked out Consumer Reports and saw this was a best buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, I had rather low expectations about the shaver.  But when it arrived I took it out of the box (didn&#x27;t even clean it first) and gave it a go--and I have never looked back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are over the age of about 23, and looking at this review, you probably already have an opinion on electric razors.  I have been shaving most of my life (and no one cares how long that is) and have primarily used the Braun suite of electric shavers at multiple price levels.  This shaver puts them all to shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is fast, smooth, and easy to use.  It can be used dry or in the shower (it is waterproof).  This is the only shaver I ever used that cuts closer than a blade.  And it does not nick my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am convinced that, like most things in life, you need to try it for yourself. If you do not already know, shaving is different for most every man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I would have no hesitation recommending this product.</li>
            <li> Like others who have reviewed this, I have sensitive skin.  Shaving has always aggravated it, but so does not shaving, as my skin is also very sensitive to my own beard.  Now I shave every day in the shower.  The Panazonic ES8103S saves my face and saves me time shaving.  Along with an unbreakable shower mirror, I shave with soap lather and it takes me about 1-2 minutes for a close, smooth shave.  My face loves me again and I&#x27;m out the door about 10 minutes faster in the morning with the time I save not shaving at the bathroom sink.  This has held up great in the water after over six months.  I only have to charge it about once every two weeks with daily use.  I highly recommend this product for anyone considering switching to an electric razor or to a waterproof electric razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this a little over a month and I&#x27;ve had no problems. Easy to hold handle shaped body. Works well as a wet shaver; I use it once a day so at a full charge of 100% I can get approx eight 3 minutes shaves before it has to be recharged. I don&#x27;t grow a beard easily so if you are in the market for a meduim priced shaver, I&#x27;d recommend this for the money.</li>
            <li> Despite my opinion at the end of the day everyone&#x27;s face and shaving experience is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two weeks of using the Panasonic ES8103s shaver I must say its a good comfortable shaver for the price, but for me I&#x27;m going to pass. Although the shave is pretty close on the face, for me it struggled on the jaw and neck area. I guess I was hoping it would do a tad better since I shave daily and my hair isn&#x27;t that thick. I know electric shavers don&#x27;t give the closest shaves and by no means was it bad, it just took a little long considering my dull dying Norelco could do the same job in less time. With pre-shave oil and/or shaving gel it only improved the results by a little. Another big thing for me was the shaver head movement. The side to side pivot was fine, but I didn&#x27;t care for the in and out motion (like a car shock) on my face. It felt like I needed to apply more pressure so I ended up leaving it in Locked position most of the time. Other than those two things I liked everything else, it was very easy to clean, built well, nice battery display, and most important little to no irritation. So for under $90 its a solid performer, and many people here have given it glowing reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for a person who wants to try out electric shaving or someone who primarily uses a manual type razor, but is looking for an affordable and quick shave in between their normal routine. However my face is sensitive to manual razors and so electric shaving is currently my only way to shave. With that being said I&#x27;m going to pass on this shaver and maybe invest in the Panasonic LA63s or Braun series 7.</li>
            <li> Great Product with good battery life. The shaving heads are excellent and it as good as shaving with a blade. in fact its even better.</li>
            <li> Replaced the latest in a series of Braun shavers with this after reading the ratings on Consumer&#x27;s Reports and find this to provide a better shave at a much more affordable price than the Brauns.  This unit is light, fits well in my hand and does a very good job shaving.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing electric shaver I have ever had -- or used.  It shaves as close as a blade, and can be used when the hair on your face is longer than most shavers; i.e., two days growth was the maximum length of my previous shaver.  This one will shave with three or four days growth -- although I imagine that depends on the person and how fast their beard grows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only negative comment is that it cannot be left charging for more than an hour.  It has no \\&quot;cradle\\&quot; to sit in, so you have to watch the time when you charge it.  I called Panasonic and asked!  They said to leave it charging continuously can damage the batteries.  Still, it is worth that small inconvenience since it gives such a great shave -- and I do mean as well as when I wet shave with a blade.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the performance of this shaver, but at about 15 months of use, it started working intermittently and then completely stopped working (wouldn&#x27;t turn on).</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a fathers Day gift.  My dad loves it especially since he is always on the go.  He loves it so much I decided to buy one for myself.</li>
            <li> Had a heart attack and taking blood thinners SO small nick from safety razor was causing problems so I SWITCHED TO ELECTERIC. Consumers Reports and several friends recommend I try the Panasonic. I, like a lot of people miss the closeness of a manual razor BUT this Panasonic is actually doing a pretty good job. I&#x27;ve used it wet and dry - wet works best for me. I use the Williams Electric Shave \\&quot;SOME\\&quot; which seems to help BUT I can&#x27;t stand the \\&quot;SMELL\\&quot;. On scale of 1-10, I would rare the Panasonic an \\&quot;8\\&quot;. JOE</li>
            <li> My husband was looking for new shaver, we was gonna buy from Costco.  I was looking into Amazon, I read reviews and decided to give it a try.  My husband is very hard to please and doesn&#x27;t like anything I buy for him.  After he used couple days, he said he really like it and it shave so close and doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin.  I was shocked that for the first time he liked something I bought for him!</li>
            <li> This is an ok shaver, doesn&#x27;t give a close shave. But then again I used to use shaving cream with this shaver.</li>
            <li> A superb shaver and trimmer. Well worth the cost. The charge lasts a long time and I like the display in the handle that shows the percentage of charge remaining and the percentage of charge attained when it is attached to the charger.</li>
            <li> Shaves right down the center of the head and leaves the sides untouched. That plus the fact the foil has such ultra tiny holes in it (glides right over the stubble), I have to go over and over and over my face until this tiny, delicate little \\&quot;shaver\\&quot; can cut the stubble. I need a shaver made for mans face panasonic, not a mouses soft, pink, delicate little tummy! It went back, I&#x27;m trying the braun wet and dry next, but the head on that looks pretty soft, delicate, ultra tiny soft and gentle holes in the foil as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a 1 star because it&#x27;s a cute little mousy shaver :)</li>
            <li> As all Blackmen know our skin and hair type are different from all other ethnicities. Likewise we have extenuating issues with the skin on many of our faces due to our hair being tough yet our skin being soft causing ingrown hairs &amp; razor bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally have used \\&quot;Magic\\&quot; shaving depilatory for the past 12 yrs now (I&#x27;m 32 yrs old) due to my inability to use any kind of razor without incurring massive skin repercussions.  I&#x27;ll make this short and sweet to help you decide more efficiently if this is best for you...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- my hair is not \\&quot;kinky\\&quot; but more like in between mixed and coarse&lt;br /&gt;- my skin is relatively sensitive (caramel in complexion)&lt;br /&gt;- I can sit 20 mins in direct sunlight and get a noticable tan&lt;br /&gt;- MAGIC works well but is too inconsistent (e.g. chemical burns)&lt;br /&gt;- the 3 circle electric shavers cause the same adverse skin reactions for me as razors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that&#x27;s all I can think of, so perhaps you&#x27;ve similar type skin and you would like to try this. I can tell you from my experience this thing is AMAZING!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggestion:&lt;br /&gt;- if your ingrowns or blemished skin (due to hair growth and shaving) are really problems for you and you don&#x27;t care for facial hair anyhow just get laser hair removal. Find a doctor utilizing the \\&quot;Yang Laser.\\&quot; 5 - 8 sessions once a month will have you hairless for years - if not for life. The cost is generally $35-$50/face session.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for nearly 2 years, and after recently replacing the blade and foil it is still going strong.  I believe it provides one of the closest, smoothest shaves of any electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned (better than Norelco and Braun I&#x27;ve owned in the past).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is wet/dry, since I often prefer to shave in the shower.  Lathering my face with a dab of body wash before shaving seems to provide an even closer shave.  I&#x27;ve usually let the battery go completely dead before recharging, as I believe this keeps the battery from developing the memory effect and shortening the duration of the charge before needing plugged in again.  Even after 2 years, I only have to charge mine after 4 or 5 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as you keep a sharp blade in the shaver, I think this machine is a great value.  You can clean it with soap and water instead of any expensive solution, the upfront purchase cost is reasonable, and the quality of the shave is very good.  If mine ever dies, I will definitely be looking for another Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li> A great deal! I got it on sale, and it was a steal. I suggest more people purchase this shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver as an upgrade from a Panasonic ES8043SC.  I called Panasonic customer service to see if this upgrade would be worth it.  They had no idea.  The ES8103S shaves no better than my only ES8043SC did.  And in fact, this new unit gives me razer burns and bumps on my neck where the ES8043SC didn&#x27;t.  The only good thing is that the 8103S is quieter.  So if you&#x27;re buying a shaver based on noise level then this model would be considered an upgrade.  In terms of shave quality it&#x27;s junk.  And speaking of junk, this unit is a lot lighter and appears to be less sturdy than my ES8043SC.  Every thing feels light and plastic with this new unit.  With my ES8043SC I could tap the top of the unit after I removed the top to knock out the cut shaving hairs.  Don&#x27;t try it with this unit because you&#x27;ll probably break the top.  I get about 5 shaves before I have to recharge the 8103S because the performance is so bad.  What a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - 11/18/16.  The foil now has a hole in it so it needs to be replaced.  Cheapest replacement foil is $22.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve replaced the blades twice now.  Cheapest I could find the cutters for is $24.&lt;br /&gt;The clip which holds the plastic cover on is now also broke on one side, so the foil is now pressing into the cutter when I shave.  I can&#x27;t find a third party seller to replace this part so I&#x27;ll have to call Panasonic to get a replacement.  I expect this will be at least $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good news is that Black Friday is upon us.  Time to chuck this shaver and buy a different brand.  Panasonic used to be good but now their quality is in the toilet.</li>
            <li> Happy with my shaver. Charges real fast from 0-100 percent in about 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;One of the best shavers for the money[[ASIN:B001DNE3KQ Panasonic ES8103S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Silver]]</li>
            <li> This razor is amazing. I have used a safety razor for a very long time and have NEVER achieved a shave like this. Feels like a baby&#x27;s bottom when I finish. No shaver burn, just fast, smooth, no hassle procedure. Love it !</li>
            <li> Wow!  What a great shaver.  My old Braun was on its last legs when I decided to start checking out shavers on this (my favorite) web site.  Panasonic makes lots of shavers and are less costly than most of the other +$100 shavers out there.  After reading the reviews, I decided to take a chance and get this 8103S shaver.  I ordered it and got it in about 4 days with the Super Saver shipping.  Opened it and got it hooked up to the charger.  I like the small LCD that shows battery strength, and it didn&#x27;t take very long before the shaver was completely charged.  So, I fired it up and it was much quieter than my old Braun.  The pitch of the sound it makes is also much higher.  I guess that&#x27;s because the blade frequency is much higher than my Braun.  Anyway, I shaved with it and it was excellent.  I have pitted and bumpy skin from years of acne, so I have tough skin to manuever and get a close shave without getting nicked.  This shaver did it all.  Smooth skin and no nicks.  I was impressed.  I still need to try it in the shower but I&#x27;m betting that it&#x27;ll do just as well or maybe even better.The sideburns trimmer works great as well.  I&#x27;ll probably get a new screen so I can replace it in a year as recommended and then eventually get a new blade set to replace after 2 years of service.  All in all, Great Shaver, Great Price.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves it and uses it almost everyday! It gives him a close shave without the mess of shaving with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Though I prefer stubble, my wife disagrees! I use it when my face is required to feel baby soft and it does after using this shaver!</li>
            <li> Last time I&#x27;ve used electric shaver 30 years ago. It was fragile, noisy, does not shave well and require special care. So I&#x27;ve decided to check the modern technology. So what I get? Shaver is much rugged now, can be cleaned using running water, but it is still noisy and does not shaves well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to switch to dry shaving to reduce time needed for shave and also avoid all that clutter. It seems to be impossible. Despite being using this shaver already a month, as manufacturer suggests, I still need at least 5x more time to shave with this, than with Gilette Mach 3 system. With razor blade, I know and I feel that one motion&#x3D;one clear area. With this junk, I have to repeatedely move it back and forth, back and forth. Also this beast is damn noisy, and foil gets considerably HOT, even when ussing very slight pressure! So hot that I have to let it cool down, to  avoid burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you are shaving with rasor blade, even don&#x27;t think about electronic shavers, do not waste your money and time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this review will get many negative voices, but this is my personal opinion, not biased by discounts, trade-ins and other goodies people get for &amp;#34;proper&amp;#34; review.</li>
            <li> All good but the battery life. I get about 6 shaves per charge out of it.</li>
            <li> alright been using now for awhile, I first thought it was great, guess because it didn&#x27;t eat my face off.  But now that ive used several times and the new factor has worn off, it doesn&#x27;t do as well as I thought, but they work, I use them almost till the battery is dead tho each use, so that isn&#x27;t to good I guess.  Didn&#x27;t turn me into a believer, a regular razor runs circles around this thing, especially after a 5 oclock shadow has set in.</li>
            <li> Great shaver. Very clean shaving. Very convenient to wash by water.</li>
            <li> OK, but I prefer a closer shave</li>
            <li> worst costumer support ever, never buying another Panasonic product again. the trimmer failed on this product and i have had the worst time trying to rma this thing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how good an electric razor could be until I tried this.  I&#x27;ve been using Braun shavers for the last 30 years.  But the difference is like night and day.  I should have switched to Panasonic years ago.</li>
            <li> Too much sound and takes different angles and movement, time consuming.will not want to recommend this, better to use the normal blade.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews on Amazon (this is my first I believe). However, I am so satisfied with this razor that I was motivated to get off my butt and write these words. Really terrific product. I picked it up for around $55, but it looks like the price may have jumped to $80. Great deal when around $50-60, but I don&#x27;t think I would be willing to pay more than $65-ish.</li>
            <li> Best shaver on the planet</li>
            <li> Thus far this is the best rechargeable razor I&#x27;ve ever owned (have used it for a week).  Other electrics/rechargeable shavers didn&#x27;t do a good job of cutting some of the stubborn whiskers on my neck.  This one does the job!  Overall, it gives me a very close shave!</li>
            <li> I usually used phillips brand when I change to Panasonic product.I found it&#x27;s better than phillips. And also the price is better!</li>
            <li> This is a good razor that has served me well now for 2 years. I really like the wet/dry feature as I don&#x27;t always have time to do a wet shave. It gives a pretty close shave- but sometimes I will need to go over areas a couple times. I am very light on facial hair so don&#x27;t know how it would perform on a heavier shadow or beard</li>
            <li> Best electric shaver ever. Got it for my husband who has tried several brands. Finally - I bought one he loves. He says he can shave his face in less than 90 seconds. He&#x27;s happy, so I&#x27;m happy. Thanks, Panasonic !</li>
            <li> Best razor my husband has ever used.</li>
            <li> Not as close a shave as a razor but good for someone with disability or inability to use a cutting blade.</li>
            <li> The rubber skin of handle start falling within a few month.(see attached image for detail)</li>
            <li> Gets most of the facial hairs with little effort.  Does not cut pieces of meat out of my neck like most shavers and this one works well with water.</li>
            <li> I am new to modern wet/dry shavers. I have an old Norelco with the round heads and it did an okay job, but for the most part, for the past 40 years I shaved with a blade. I decided to try a wet/dry electric razor and after several weeks of comparing went with the Panasonic. I have no experience with the Braun or other competitors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used this shaver wet, with shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First use, just about tossed it in the trash. It felt fine, but it took forever and once I cleaned off my face, half of my beard was still there, and I don&#x27;t have much of a beard each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second use, a little better. Took forever, but I made sure I got a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since...I have used it for two months or so, and doubt I will return to a blade. I get a good shave with the Panasonic, the skin in not irritated, and it all works. The primary negative is the time it takes. It takes me easily three times longer to shave with this razor compared to my blade. If I had to shave each day before work, well, it would not work out. Luckily I shave whenever I want, as I work from home (the ugly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the time it takes to shave, it eats up about 20% of the charge.  I charge the unit every five or six days. Surprised how quickly it charges. I have not used it to shave with the cord plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is simple to take apart for cleaning, and I dunk in water as I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the good: it makes a clean shave. The bad: takes forever. The ugly: me!</li>
            <li> I buy them for father,i  think it is ok for use everyday .hope it is useful for you.plerse try it</li>
            <li> The card that comes in the box that says \\&quot;please stick with it it&#x27;s worth it\\&quot; is very true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first used the razor I wasn&#x27;t very happy with it. My hair grows in very strange directions on my face so shaving was always uncomfortable, and it was even worse with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I used it I found that I had sort of figured out the proper way to use it and I was getting a closer more comfortable shave with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The THIRD time I used it, I freaking love it! No need for shaving cream or any sort of mess. Before I leave the house I spend about 10 minutes with this powerful little guy and I have a clean face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STICK WITH IT. Especially if your coming from using a razor and shaving cream. You WILL get used to it, you WILL learn how to use it properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest tip if you cant seem to figure out how to use it properly is to LISTEN. You can hear hair being cut off when your using it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOOD LUCK GENTLEMAN! ....and some ladies.</li>
            <li> seems to work better as a wet shave but that is very messy. Good balance but need electric shave for a smoother dry shave. Product itself is quality but so far I liked my old Norelco better and it gave a closer dry shave.</li>
            <li> the shaver does ok, small size I like gets into tight spots, high speed I like but, I have sensetive skin with a heavy beard, the head screen openings are a little to small for the size of my wiskers, so it takes several passes to get all the beard.  I thought I had ordered the shaver that U can also shave while pluged in  but this one U can&#x27;t, ( my fault)  so the shaver screens being to small, and non- cord use,  the shaver is ok.</li>
            <li> I ordered it blindly,read the Amazon reviews,and it is everything I wanted.Light,easy to hold and good shave.I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard so this is a perfect shave for me.Do like that the percentage of battery life left lights up,so you always know when you must recharge.The charger is a little bulky,that&#x27;s why the 4 stars.</li>
            <li> This razor gives closer shave than old shaver did for my husband. Our son has also tried the razor and likes it well enough for me to order one for him. The only negative is a high-pitched whine while shaving.Since it takes so little time to get a close shave, it is tolerable.</li>
            <li> I have owned a lot of razors in my lifetime. as everyone will agree that nothing shaves as close as a blade. I have owned the early norelcos to the very expensive braun&#x27;s. I have owned this razor for about two months now and wanted to really get used to it before giving my opinion of it. this razor comes as close to a blade as I have ever had, much closer than the braun I replaced. I have not had any problems at all with the lcd readout and like the way it lets you know when it needs to be cleaned which is very easy and quick to do. it shows you what percentage of charge is left which for me reduces by 10% per shave. at 10%  it reminds you that it is time to recharge. the shaving in the hard to shave areas like the point of the chin and along the jawbone is very easily done. I would recommend this razor to anyone who is either buying one for the first time or for anyone who is dissatisfied with their current razor. I think it is the most bang you can get for your buck. you cannot shave with it while the charging cord is plugged in but it charges in about an hour so I have not found this to be any drawback at all.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor and I was pleasantly surprised at how close a shave this razor can provide. Once I figured out that a wet shave working in a circular motion and using my favorite gel lather gave me the best results for my skin and beard type, I had no problem getting shaves that are very smooth and comfortable. Works for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver for my 92 year old father as a Christmas present last year.  He had never used an electric shaver (&amp;#34;You can only get a decent shave with a razor blade&amp;#34; were his thoughts and opinion for all of those years).  Then he got placed on a blood thinner and was so afraid he would knick himself that he started mumbling and grumbling how long it took to complete his daily shave since he had to be so careful.  Now it was time to introduce him to an electric shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been almost 9 months, and I cannot count how many times he has thanked us and commented on how wonderful his new shaver is.  He can&#x27;t believe how quickly it works, but better yet, how closely it shaves.  He has had no trouble with it and it works as well as the day it came out of the package.  He has mentioned over and over that it was the best Christmas present he has ever received, and considering how many Christmas&#x27; he has seen and how many children and grandchildren he has received presents from, that says a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was such a great testament, I just finished placing another order to replace my husband&#x27;s electric shaver (another brand).</li>
            <li> this baby is noisy, but nothing cuts as close. i am coming off a braun. it was ok for a foil, but this baby rocks. it is very light weight and easy to hold. i cant believe how close a shave i get. much better than a safety razor or any other electric i have owned or tried. very much worth the money. hands down the best!</li>
            <li> Had this razor/trimmer/whatever for over a year now, still works great!</li>
            <li> it is easy to wash and clean.&lt;br /&gt;it is very easy to catch the beards under chin.&lt;br /&gt;very good price during promotion.</li>
            <li> Simply the best electric razer I have owned.  Have not tried wet yet but intend to. Great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> Works great dry or wet. Visual charge % is a huge plus. Cuts without pulling . Haven&#x27;t tried cleaning it yet.</li>
            <li> I prefer to wet my face prior to shaving. Also shaves well by using a gentle daily cleanser. I use &amp;#34;Yes&amp;#34; age refresh.</li>
            <li> cheap and very suit my taste!!!&lt;br /&gt;automatic clean will be better!!!&lt;br /&gt;transport is a little slow~&lt;br /&gt;but it does not matter</li>
            <li> This is my second shaver. Excellent! Highly recomendad.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for two weeks, I am very happy and impressed.  The razor I was replacing (another brand) was very old and I couldn&#x27;t purchase foils or blades.  I decided to spend a little more on a razor than the cheapest option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this dry.  I have always had certain areas of the face and neck that I can not get a close shave. There always seemed to be stubble in these areas, this shaver took care of that problem.  I have a close shave in all areas of my cheeks and neck.  I have a goatee and I am able to get close and shave around the goatee with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it once as a wet razor with shaving cream, it did a fine job and the instructions for cleaning were simple and worked well.  I would rather dry shave but the wet option was fine.  I did not try it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read complaints about the trimmer not being a good trimmer but I have not used the trimmer.  I own a separate trimmer. My only complaint is that it does not have a travel switch.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my husband for Christmas. He had been switching between a blade and Remington electrics. When he first tried it he thought it was just ok. He came back to me a few days later saying now that he is used to it he gets a better shave than any other razor he has tried. He can shave very close without getting in-grown hairs or breaking out, which has never happened before. He likes to use the razor while running it under water every minute or two during the shave.</li>
            <li> Had it for about 5 years now and love it. Tried many and this is the best. great price too.</li>
            <li> Save money on expensive razors but doen&#x27;t get as close as I&#x27;d like. It&#x27;ll do the job for now. More words.</li>
            <li> just perfect as i expeceted. clean fresh shaving just like manual blade and very mobile and flexible to use. try it</li>
            <li> My 16 yr old is new to the electric razor.  He thinks he has to work too hard, but it could be his technique.  The price is great.  It is quiet, keeps a charge a long time.</li>
            <li> My older [[ASIN:B0009DT342 Panasonic ES8043SC Pro-Curve Pivot Action Linear Wet/Dry Shaver, Silver]] gave up the ghost recently. I was getting ready to purchase a replacement foil and cutting block for it, which luckily I had not yet purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was interested in this model and the [[ASIN:B001DKMY9Q Panasonic ES8243A Arc IV Nano Men&#x27;s Wet/Dry Rechargeable Shaver, Blue]], which was more expensive. After comparing the two (the only difference is an extra head on the 8243), I decided on the 8103 and have to say that it is a very good shaver. It shaves closer than my 8034 ever did, and for the money, it is an excellent buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gained a closer shave, the ability to know how much battery charge is left (via an LCD readout) and a prompt to clean the razor when necessary.</li>
            <li> I have an older Panasonic 800 series shaver, but this one is the best in shaving that I have experienced, much faster than the older models. Excellent.</li>
            <li> Up till now I have been a dedicate Braun user. I have found that Panasonic shaves a lot closer than my previous shavers.</li>
            <li> My face took a while to get used to this shaver, but it&#x27;s a very smooth feeling shave now. I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> best electric shaver I have had!</li>
            <li> I use this every day and it is great.  The display will say 10% for weeks, so not sure how accurate that is.  It provides a great shave though, and that&#x27;s what it is all about.</li>
            <li> Great shaver.  I replaced an old Panasonic with this one and it&#x27;s been great.  Cuts close like a razor and has a handy trim tool on the back.  Works wet or dry or even in the shower.  No issues at all.</li>
            <li> I would like to give some support to this line of shavers, because it seems to me like Braun and Norelco have managed to dominate, even though their products aren&#x27;t very good, in my opinion. I wore a beard for many years but recently decided to go clean shaven. I remembered using a Norelco as well as one of these in the past. So first I  went ahead and bought the top of the line Norelco a month ago, with the auto cleaner and all that, and what I found was that it didn&#x27;t work very well. It takes forever with the circular movement and just doesn&#x27;t shave all that close. I was getting 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at noon. As for the Panasonic, I remember that I picked this shaver up in college when my roommate said that it had the most powerful motor available and that meant it could cut the hairs quickly without snagging or causing any irritation. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s true. What I do know is that I decided to revisit this shaver, and while it&#x27;s not perfect, it really does shave close and it does it pretty quickly. So keep up the good work Panasonic.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut quite a closely as the product info suggests.</li>
            <li> Razor is as described, works great and delivered on time, Provides a clean, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Got what I paid for, pretty happy but it could be cheaper.</li>
            <li> Has worked well for me for several years.  Shave is typical for electrics.  Good battery life.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor about a year ago.  It still holds a charge for a long time and recharges quickly.  However it seems to take longer to shave my face and I have to go over it multiple times.  It&#x27;s also more noisy then previous shavers that I have owned.  The price was good on it.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few razors over the years and gave up on all of them and went back to a blade.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this one per the good reviews and the razor is probably ok, but I was expecting more,&lt;br /&gt;I am 70 yrs old now and lazy, so I can do a respectful job while watching TV. If I was younger and&lt;br /&gt;more active I would not be satisfied. If I am going to soap up my face, I will just use a disposable&lt;br /&gt;razor.</li>
            <li> You need to stop using a razor blade and use this for about 30 days to start getting a close shave.  But other then that it works great.</li>
            <li> I like the razor, but only use it occasionally.  My beard is such that it needs a gel and blade most of the time.  The Panasonice model that I purchased is better than most that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Had it now for several years and it is durable and provides a clean shave</li>
            <li> I love this shaver.. This one replaces the same model I dropped and broke. This shaver is the only one that handles a week&#x27;s growth with no pulling. I hope they make it forever.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave, you have to go over and over and it irritates and  hurts the skin, wet or dry</li>
            <li> My first foil type shaver in many years.  I use an electric only for touch up or occasionally for a late day shave.  No electric (for me) has ever matched a blade but this one is impressive in its cut.&lt;br /&gt;A little noisy but not too bad.</li>
            <li> I was not that into a shaver, the last I had didn&#x27;t make me smile, I have to admit this worth the buy</li>
            <li> If you let your facial hair grow out more than a day, this shaver will not do very well. It&#x27;s a well made little machine, but, it doesn&#x27;t like cutting into hair more than .0055334 microns long. For that I use my trusty $40 Norelco three-head shaver (which I keep hidden under the towels on the shelf). That thing works great all the time. But it isn&#x27;t fancy. This shaver is fancy. So, if you shave every day, this thing does a nice job giving you a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Good razor. Holds a charge well. A little loud but overall great value for the cost. I would recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> Best razor I have ever used. Daily use for 2+ weeks on a single charge. I have been shaving daily for 3.5 years and the battery still holds a charge like the first day I got it. I replaced the blades last year and did not notice a performance benefit; I am guessing you could go almost 5 years without replacing the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I did not figure out how to use the trimmer properly for the first 2 years of use. You have to press the trimmer switch as you are using it to get the trimmer to gear up with the motor. When this is done properly the trimmer is excellent.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my boyfriend. He usually uses razors and because of that, it didn&#x27;t give him a super close shave the first few times. Now that he&#x27;s getting used to the shaver, he&#x27;s getting a really nice close shave.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this new technology device.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s low level of noise.&lt;br /&gt;light weight.&lt;br /&gt;little vibration.&lt;br /&gt;Accurate shaving.&lt;br /&gt;wonderfull choice.</li>
            <li> THE SHAVER DOES NOT EVEN COME CLOSE TO MY BLADE IT LEAVES TOO MUCH BEARD ON MY FACE AFTER SHAVING</li>
            <li> shaver has a high vibration and high pitch noise. several rotations over sections of the face are required for a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought it and use it for almost a year.&lt;br /&gt;It works as expected and nothing goes wrong so far.&lt;br /&gt;The most impressive thing is that after a fully charge, it can work for about 2 weeks with daily usage.&lt;br /&gt;It means when I travel overseas for a short holiday trip, I don&#x27;t need to bring the charging cable at all.&lt;br /&gt;It is washable and the blade is sharp enough for me.</li>
            <li> Shaves OK, but, I&#x27;ve had to replace the blades several times over the nearly 3 years I&#x27;ve had it . . . which is sort-of to be expected, but, I wish the blades would last longer (and I don&#x27;t even have thick/coarse facial hair).  Now I&#x27;m in the market again for a new shaver (not quite 3 years after buying this one!) because the display has gone totally dead . . . I have absolutely NO idea what % battery life is left anymore.  Used to get a week&#x27;s worth of shaving on a charge, and now it&#x27;s down to 2 days (3 if I&#x27;m lucky).  If the display still worked, I&#x27;d just buy replacement batteries, but, at this point, what&#x27;s the point ?!? :-(</li>
            <li> I got this for him to take to the field where there isn&#x27;t water for him to shave. It&#x27;s great and loves it.</li>
            <li> Bought one for my son, and then bought one for me to replace my almost 20 year old Braun (which I love, but after a rebuild and a final death, I was ready for a more modern shave). This shave 2-3 times faster than my old Braun. Battery doesn&#x27;t last quite as long between charges (4-5 days vs 7-ish days), but it recharges in less time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also appreciate how the whiskers don&#x27;t fall out like grey snow while shaving like with my Braun - they are retained much better in the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer feature is not as beefy as the Braun trimmer. If it were hit while it was extended, I fear it would break easily. Body is plastic and not metal (again, the 20 year old Braun was all metal), so not expecting it to last 20 years. I&#x27;m sure Panasonic is not wishing that it lasts that long either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a fan of the shavers that you have to use the cleaning station for - I think that is a way for the shaver companies to be like the Ink Jet printers - another way to get a lot of money out of you for something that should not cost that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate that you can use the shaver in the shower, but I have not gotten in the habit of doing this. Tried it once, was &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; about it. Probably should try it for a week like suggested to get used to it before I judge it. I just think it is harder to shave without a mirror - takes longer, more damage to your face by going over spots multiple times due to not seeing what you must shave.</li>
            <li> I expected it to outshine Braun. I t did not - about equal. Did not have a chance to compare to Norelco wet/dry shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for his birthday and he likes the shaver</li>
            <li> Expected a little more then what it does.</li>
            <li> Does a very neat close shave, both with lather, or dry with a shaving powder.</li>
            <li> My primary shaver is a regular blade. I use this one occasionally. The micro screen holes must be pretty small, as it take a lot of work with back and forth movement to get a reasonably close shave. I used to have an old single blade Remington that probably only cost 35 bucks which gave a less painful shave. Generally disappointed.</li>
            <li> Just got this, so cannot comment on battery life and the LCD display that others have mentioned as potential weak points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this shaver (1) shaves much much closer than my previous two Panasonic linear shavers (2) this has a wider head than my old shavers and may have problems getting into tight spots, but haven&#x27;t had those problems yet so maybe it&#x27;s just illusory and (3) other reviewers are right, this thing is noticeably louder than my old Panasonics.  Sound level is probably equivalent to a Sonicare toothbrush.  So it&#x27;s gonna be a problem if you&#x27;re a ninja.</li>
            <li> Pros: the first shaver that worked on me. Almost close shave if I shave &amp;#34;every other day&amp;#34;. Very comparable to blade/razors. I really like this shaver however:  Cons: 1- Did not shave with regular shaving cream, got sticky and I used 60% battery on my third shave. 2- after 1st shave 90% batter left, after 2nd shave 80%, but after 3rd shave 20% was left. This does not look normal.</li>
            <li> Shaves as close as a razor, great price, seems sturdy, has great trimmer. This cost less than just the replacement blades for the Remington Arcitec (or however you spell it). Plus the trimmer is full sized and works, unlike the Remington which has a &#x27;toy trimmer&#x27;. The replacement blades for this are reasonable, also, price wise and seem sturdy compared to the triple-head razors. Also, after using this and getting a close shave I would not go back to the inferior triple head.</li>
            <li> good price~~&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s  big sound when i use.&lt;br /&gt;but helpful using shaving.&lt;br /&gt;keep the time and check the battery good for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with a Phillips-Norelco rotary electric shaver for over 25 years, and it&#x27;s always worked well for me. When the Panasonic ES8103S (Arc 3) was on sale, I decided for the first time to try a foil shaver. For the most part, I&#x27;m happy with it. It doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close as my Phillips-Norelco, but it also does not irritate my skin at all like the rotary shaver sometimes does. The Panasonic&#x27;s battery also does not last as long, but I can get a week&#x27;s worth of shaves between chargings. A couple of other cons are that the Panasonic is made almost entirely of plastic, and I have my doubts it will last very long. It is also very noisy. It&#x27;s buzzes like a giant mosquito and I&#x27;m trying to get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic ES8103S (Arc 3) is an overall good shaver for the price. It&#x27;s not perfect and in several ways not better than my rotary shaver. I&#x27;m happy with it though and recommend it especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different brands of electric shavers over the years but none can compare with this one. The higher RPMs of the motor made shaving much easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a middle-aged woman, replacing an old ladies&#x27; razor.  So far, so good, after one week.  Much easier on the skin, charge holding well.  Keeping my fingers crossed.</li>
            <li> Works well for more than 2 years</li>
            <li> I just received the Panasonic ES8103S Arc3 shaver.  I prefer shaving with a double edge safety razor with feather blades, but needed an electric razor for travel.  So far the Panasonic has exceeded my expectations.  It is brand new I have only used it once but I am impressed.  It didn’t shave as close as a blade, but was pretty darn close!</li>
            <li> Love this shaver; it does a better job dry than wet, but that&#x27;s to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it discharges relatively quickly, but fortunately it doesn&#x27;t take long to charge up, either.</li>
            <li> Usually go w/ the Norelco circular blades, but wanted to give this a try.  After 8 months... it give a good shave, has some interesting features (including one to tell you to clean the head w/ the built in ultrasound/sonic cleaner).  But battery life needs some work.  I like Panasonic products, but after a few months, the charge was not held very well.  I would get 60% or better charge after a long shave in the beginning, but soon this dropped to about 40% or even 20% after a single shave following a full recharge.</li>
            <li> i hate this razor! i tried it wet, dry, with shaving cream, with shaving gel. takes way longer than a blade, far worse results, irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> We really like the razor.  Just what we ordered.  So glad that we made this choice when there was so many to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;It also came with a receipt which I was so glad to see.</li>
            <li> My son refused to use electric razors after only finding ones that pulled and were uncomfortable to use. I read excellent reviews on this so I bought it for a gift and sent it to him. He loves it! Complete convert to an electric razor now....this one anyway!</li>
            <li> I am not sure how this has any good reviews. I tried to use this shaver it took me almost a full charge to shave my face completely, with horrible results. This shaver left tons of irritation, cuts and was super time consuming and didn&#x27;t even do a good job. The trimmer didn&#x27;t even work well my $15 trimmer made by Gillette gives a better shave then this. I really don&#x27;t recommend this electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Former blade user with rare exceptions. Did not like closeness of electrics in the past, even though I have light beard. Found this model almost as close as 3-4 blade devices, much easier to use, and better at handling spots where hairs grow in different directions. The unit is extremely quiet in  comparison to other electrics I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  ADDENDUM: After using for several months compared this to Norelco rotary. Found the latter was even quieter and gave a closer shave on facial hair, but irritated the skin on my neck. The Panasonic definitely is not similarly abrasive, but, again, is not quite as close and noticeably louder. Note that I&#x27;m in my 70&#x27;s, so younger people may not have the same concerns with neck skin irritation.</li>
            <li> It takes me a long time to shave with this thing.  I guess it might work better if I shaved everyday.</li>
            <li> I have not purchased an electric razor for a while and was uncertain what features would work best. After using the Panasonic for a couple of weeks I&#x27;m convinced this was the right purchase. Fits the hand well, provides a close shave (although multiple passes help insure this),has excellent battery life and clearly shows how much charge remains. I would certainly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I got this product for my husband as a Christmas present. He said that he wanted an electric shaver. He is still trying to figure out how to get a close shave but that has nothing to do with the shaver and more to do with his learning curve. He LOVES it and that is all that matters to me.</li>
            <li> Used a rotating razor for years.  I find that this foil razor gives a much closer shave.  I always use it with shaving cream or soap.  Does not seem to be as good dry as a rotating razor.</li>
            <li> not a CLOSE shave at all .After 8-9hrs u need a shave again. NOoo I would NOT recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> This product was chosen as a gift for my 17 year old son, and was based on a recommendation from my oldest son who has a very heavy beard.  The electric shaver is fulfilling all expectations, operating very effectively!</li>
            <li> Two disclosures that may affect my review or your evaluation of it: 1.  I have a beard 2.  I have been using Panasonic wet/dry shavers for over 20 years  This shaver&#x27;s head seems just the right size.  And the flexibility (which you can lock out) seems well designed.  The weight is good and the handle is comfortable in any position or grip.  This may be the quickest charging model I own.  {You may want to ignore this retrospective.  I still have my original 8066 as a backup.  It has worked fine for over 20 years.  My RF41 4-head model works very well but for a beard it is not as good for edging.  My ES8043 has been a workhorse for travel.  Holds a week plus charge and is easy to pack.}  The only downside is the trimmer.  Panasonic seems to put this as a secondary feature and it rarely shows the same kind of careful design as the rest of the shaver.  My 8043 has the best trimmer.  The size is right, the blades stay sharp and it stays solid while in use.  This 8103S seems just as good for size and, right now, for sharpness.  However, when I use it, I have to keep my thumb on the actuator switch or it will collapse while in use.  Not a deal-breaker for me.  Panasonic and Amazon do a great job of giving side-by-side comparisons of the current shavers.  You should be able to find the one that best fits your needs and lifestyle.</li>
            <li> Great shaver especially for the price.  Would highly recommend this to anyone.  Shaves close without irritating your skin like razors.</li>
            <li> very good shaver.  I have two in my house.  One for travel and one for home.  I love both.  It shaves really well.  I would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> It works, still getting used to it.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor after doing lots of research. It has the features I need: 2 weeks worth of shaving on a single charge, quick 5 minute charge for a single shave, 1 hour total charge time, showerproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it has a very good trimmer for sideburns and the pivoting action of the razor head made more of a difference than I thought it would. All in all, this is a very good product and the best in its price range.</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for my husband. He has just now used it for the first time. Said it works wonders. Thanks</li>
            <li> This is my 7th Panasonic Wet/Dry Electric Shaver.  I bought my first one over 20 years ago and won&#x27;t use any other brand.  I&#x27;ve tried another brand once then went back to Panasonic.  I get a really nice, close shave with it.</li>
            <li> It is a good shaver, but for my hand the shaver shape is not comfortable. Had an older Panasonic model before with a wider handle and that seemed to fit my hand better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is very good and smooth. The water foucet icon display is a good reminder to clean the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this ahaver/</li>
            <li> Really good for shaving in the morning. It&#x27;s so useful for me.</li>
            <li> Bought it almost 3 years ago.  I use it for about 20 minutes, once a week to shave my beard.  It works like a charm by giving me a clean shave.  Fully charges in about 2 hours and a full charge will give you about 60-90 minutes of shaving.  The trimmer is also pretty handy.  The blades are still good as new and it is very easy to clean.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love the wet/dry razor. Have recently changed from blade shaving to electric. Took some getting used to but I am quite happy. Cleaning is a snap. Holds a charge quite a while, and recharges quickly.</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal Braun user for decades. But their recent price spikes into the stratosphere led me to venture out to new brands.&lt;br /&gt;I dry shave with electric shavers. I found this Panasonic to be excellent for that &amp;#34;baby&#x27;s bottom&amp;#34; results. Really like the digital battery level indicator. So good, I bought 2.</li>
            <li> Works well. Close shave. Battery lasts several shaves and charges fast. No skin irritation after. I like to have an electric razor for travel when I don&#x27;t feel like fussing and this one gives me the closest shave of the several I&#x27;ve tried over the years. When available as &amp;#34;Deal of the day&amp;#34; it&#x27;s a steal. Update 10/16/15. I&#x27;ve had this shaver a while. Just replaced the blades because it wasn&#x27;t as smooth as when I first got it. Now it&#x27;s like day 1 again. The blades were expensive, but once a year or so I guess it&#x27;s necessary. I like it so much I bought another one for my son.</li>
            <li> I had considered buying a new Braun (I&#x27;d owned two already), but I was a bit put off by the cost of the cleaning and lubricating cartridges for the high end models (one of the things I like about electric razors is that the only additional cost is periodically replacing the screen or cutters).  So I thought I&#x27;d give this Panasonic a try.  Note that I always use the razor dry right after I shower - never with water or in the shower.  Right out of the box it gave me one of the closest shaves I&#x27;d ever experienced (this was on two days&#x27; growth on my face).  It didn&#x27;t seem quite as close on one day&#x27;s growth, but it was every bit as good as my old Braun (before it got old).  Some people mentioned a longer shaving time... it seems that I do spend a bit longer with this model, doing several passes to get my face just right, but that might just be my own idiosyncrasies and getting used to the floating head (the old Braun would just pivot). I&#x27;ve now owned it for almost 3 months and I&#x27;m still highly pleased with it.  It charges fully in about an hour and the charge indicator takes the guess work out of when to plug it back in.</li>
            <li> I had a braun for year and and loved it but have had problems getting the correct head this shaver dose just as good as the braun and at 1/3 the price</li>
            <li> This razor is very versatile and does a good job with shaving and trimming. It also really holds a charge.</li>
            <li> The shave could be closer. You get what you pay for though. Next time I will pay more for a better shaver.</li>
            <li> This is a very lightweight and smooth cutting shaver compared to my Braun shaver.  I have light morning growth so it seems to cut easily and cleanly.  The only negative is that the sideburn trimmer does not have as solid of a feel as my Braun.</li>
            <li> Does not shave that close. It replaced a ten + year old remington electric 3 round head razor and it does a better job.</li>
            <li> Panasonic ES8103S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric... does a faster job for shaving, trimmer works great for my mustache and side burns and the unit is easy to clean either with a brush or by washing it. So far I have only used for dry shaving (saves me water &amp; soap!) It fits perfectly in my hand &amp; glides smoothly to my face contour &amp; lightweight. Also, it comes with a cord for fast recharge. And great price from AMAZON.COM - I LIKE THIS SHAVER FOR THESE FEATURES: 5 STARS!! Why only 4 STARS FOR MY REVIEW? Because the motor of this shaver IS SO LOUD IT MAKES ME THINK I AM RUNNING  A VACCUM CLEANER!! I am surprised it does not come with hose attachments to clean my house while shaving! Oh, well I guess a perfect product is more expensive. Otherwise very pleased with the shaver performance so far. I hope it lasts a while.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase (brand new) of this model...both times, after only a couple of months the LED screens begins to die...although it is advertised as a WET razor...the design is obviously lacking...!</li>
            <li> Update on product.  Still working excellent; just ordered more blades for it this week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Husband loves this early Christmas present!  The price was great too.  Shaves close and is quiet.  Bonus is that is cleans up under running water which means it can be put away and not left to sit in festering &#x27;cleaner&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Quick and super easy to clean and gives a quick, close shave on course whiskers with no cuts! Great cordless razor.</li>
            <li> it is good !&lt;br /&gt;I check the quality and it is working very well.&lt;br /&gt;it is cheap than other shop.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my hubby. He loves it. It does what it is designed to do. A fair price for the product</li>
            <li> I never really use electric shavers before  but this one I have to say works good.&lt;br /&gt;the only downside is that I had read this will be discontinue i really don&#x27;t know when i need a replacement will i be able to find it.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave so well.</li>
            <li> I actually really like this shaver. I have tried the circular shavers for many years, but finally switched to this version. It took a bit to get used to, but I really enjoy this style. It is much easier around the neck and frankly, all over the face. The one issue I have is if not used at least once or twice a week, it can cause irritation and in-grown hairs, as it did when your first getting adjusted to the new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean, it provides the usage remaining, and a little protective cover and travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver after reading the reviews on Gizmodo and I&#x27;m not disappointed after 2 weeks of use.  I bought this item for weekend use when I don&#x27;t want / need a full-on razor shave.  I can easily see brining this shaver when I go on long weekends and holidays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this item.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what I want.  I have sensitive skin and have always had trouble with getting a close shave with an electric shaver.  This does great.  It sometimes does take a few passes but I had to do the same thing even with a regular razor and this doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  I use it in the shower and have had no issues.</li>
            <li> I already have had one of these for several months, and I enjoy its ability to provide close shaves of three-day growths as easily as one-day growths of my moderately stiff beard.  The high speed of the blade is a great plus, as is the wet/dry shave feature.  I tried wet shaves, but prefer a dry shave, although it&#x27;s nice to be able to clean the blades operating and under warm water flow with the cover/comb headpiece removed.  My only wish would be that the batteries would last longer between charges.  I get about five days before needing to recharge. The charge indicator with a percentage countdown is a welcome feature.  The charging cord is long...VERY LONG!  I have to bunch it up and tie it off with a twisty. Also, there is no carrying case furnished, but I have an adequate one from a former razor.  But, even considering those minor detractions, I bought another one on sale to keep as a spare, because THIS IS A GREAT SHAVER.</li>
            <li> This unit is Fa-nominal not only in design but the comfort is beyond description. I have Panasonic land line phones having never imagined they also built Electric Shavers too...Fantastic !! Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> I have used Remington and my last three were Braun shavers; the syncro, activator, and series 5. This is by far the best shave and most comfortable I have ever had in my life. It is not a one swipe shave you do have to go over an area a few times but I have had to do that with every shaver I have ever had. This gets a very close shave and with no irritation. I have sensitive skin on my neck and nothing; no bumps, no redness, nothing. I also used this as a dry shaver for my first time. I cant wait to try it with shaving cream. If I knew a shave could be like this. I would have switched to this brand years ago. Buy this shaver, or similar Panasonic one. You will not regret it!!</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had and the least I&#x27;ve ever paid for one.  This is the Ferrari of shavers.....</li>
            <li> I waited more than 6 months to write a review, just to see how this would last - BAD! I don&#x27;t have a thick beard - this shaver has never given me a real smooth shave. The blades are shot - the motor is making a funny noise. I don&#x27;t shave on the weekend, on Monday the shave is so bad I have to go back over it with my razor - I took a 3 day weekend, The shaver was useless!! Maybe I expect too much - but this one just doesn&#x27;t make it.</li>
            <li> good controlled shaving. Don&#x27;t need to look an alternative to it.</li>
            <li> best razor I&#x27;ve ever had. I only wish it came with a cradle that my razor could rest in. in my first shave, it felt so smooth &amp; light that I thought it was not working but it gave me a very good &amp; close shave &amp; removed my hair very well. I recommend it highly. it is very lightweight&amp; comfortable to hold. to clean it, I merely remove the head &amp; hold it under running warm tapwater for 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this razor. He has used Norelco brands in the past, but says this Panasonic is hands down better.  So easy to clean. Put a dab of liquid soap over the razor, turn it on and let the bubbles begin. Rinse it off and it&#x27;s cleaned.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for myself to replace my normal razor and shaving cream in order to save money, however, the product did not work as I had expected it to.  No matter what I tried, I could not get the shaver to do what it was for, shave. Family is using it now, seems to work for them though, so 3/5.</li>
            <li> Work excellently. I like it that it can be rinsed off with water.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend  this to friends and family.</li>
            <li> its made in China, not Japan</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually easy to please, but this razor just struggles to shave close... it miiiight help with trimming down some before shaving, but honestly- it&#x27;s pretty bad.</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely fabulous deal, given the price these sell for now. I used my first one for a little under two years, shaving in the shower almost every day. I used Neutragena Men&#x27;s Raxor Defense Shave Gel for lubrication (that stuff is great too). The display on the razor started going out two months before the warranty went out, so I sent it back to Panasonic and they sent me a new razor. During the two or three weeks I had to wait for it I went back to a Gillette razor, which really does give you a closer shave--but just barely closer. For the convenience, I was glad to go back to the Panasonic. The replacement lasted 10 months before its display started going out, so I replaced it with a Panasonic Arc-4 ESLA63s, which has a slightly faster vibration speed and more cutting blades. It also is terrific. I highly recommend either.</li>
            <li> I had an older version of this which i liked a lot but it burn out on me since i used it out of the country with a higher voltage. Glad this works internationally. The battery seems to last a long time in between charges. It provides a non irritating close shave after your skin gets use to it. I also like that it remains just as fast when the battery is low unlike the previous one i had.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift for my son and he loves it!</li>
            <li> Still not as good as a blade, but does the job and is much more convenient. The price was right and I&#x27;m pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li> Received it 2 days after I ordered it and it looks good!!! My husband will love it when I give it to him for Christmas!! Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is my second razor. My first one was still working well but battery was getting weak, &amp;#34;had it for 15 years&amp;#34; Would recommend this to anyone who wants a close shave, fast!</li>
            <li> the shave isn&#x27;t as close as a blade but it sure is quick and convenient. the price was definitely right.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor on whim (aka today&#x27;s deals). It was about 70% off so I figured what the heck, give it a go. The first shave was decent, not quit as good as the razor I have used for years. The second one though was better and probably a little faster and certainly more convenient. Then my son comes home from college. He hasn&#x27;t shaved in months. He has an electric as well (some off brand). I suggested he shave before he goes on his date. &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t&amp;#34; he says. &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t have my shaved.&amp;#34; I suggested he use my new one. His thought, &amp;#34;this is awesome! Way better than mine.&amp;#34; So now my son owns it. Ah well, I went and bought a different one, the EF-LF51-A. It&#x27;s just as good if not slightly better. Hard to tell, I only had two shaves with it before my son took it over. If he comes home shaved next time, I&#x27;ll know it was a good deal.</li>
            <li> Charges up quickly. Like most electric razors it doesn&#x27;t get my face smooth even after several passes in every direction. It performs much like my old Norelco. No electric razor will ever compare to the blade shaver. Yes, I&#x27;m talking about the cheap plastic ones you buy 5 per pack. I just hate using those. I will continue to be scruffy with this electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use. I prefer a wet shave, and this shaver performs&lt;br /&gt;that task flawlessly. It works well as a dry shaver too, but I rarely&lt;br /&gt;use it that way. Super simple to clean. Charges very quickly, and&lt;br /&gt;for me, one charge takes less than an hour, and it powers the shaver&lt;br /&gt;through seven shaves. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Gives a reasonably close shave, especially when fresh from the box. Definitely an improvement over my geriatric Norelco. One criticism of this shaver is that it&#x27;s noisy and hums along at the same frequency as one of those big municipal wood chippers at full rev -- not as loud, of course, but I do have to turn it off to have a conversation.</li>
            <li> Good for the face.  Not so good for the neck.  Eventually it will work, but you have to apply it lightly to those stray whiskers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting and waiting for this to go on sale and it finally happened.  I had an eight year old Braun shaver that refused to die. I replaced the rechargeable batteries and put a new shaver foil on it and it was like new again.  But it still didn&#x27;t give that great a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now that has all changed with the Panasonic shaver.  It arrived with a fully drained battery and I had to wait overnight for it to charge.  This is a much lighter weight shaver compared to my Braun shaver and it has a much higher speed motor inside.  It has a high pitched sound that my wife can&#x27;t tolerate.  I think I&#x27;ve lost all my upper end hearing, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I can shave much faster now and the shave actually does approach that of a blade shaver.  I still do a dry shave with my disposable blade shavers after using this Panasonic if I&#x27;m going out in public.  But if I&#x27;m staying home, this provides a shave that is perfectly adequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery doesn&#x27;t last all that many days, especially compared to my Braun shaver.  But it is good enough.  The LCD display is easy to read and shows the amount of battery life remaining in percent.  I leave it to charge overnight once it is depleted.  I don&#x27;t know what the more expensive versions of Panasonic shavers do, but this model is plenty good enough in my opinion.  My beard grows fast and is fairly tough.  I&#x27;m very pleased with its performance and price.  I paid $55 on an Amazon sale.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this shaver. It is fast and gives a very good shave in a minimum of time. Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Have used for several weeks and so far a good shaver.  Like the readout of the percentage remaining and how quickly it charges.  Would recommend.  Pleased so far.</li>
            <li> Best Shaver I&#x27;ve got so far.</li>
            <li> Works well. Do not believe the negative reviews. Bought at a great price. More than half off list.</li>
            <li> Very good product, very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;My 2nd panosonic product but will not be my last one.  Very quite too.</li>
            <li> Although I did not purchase from Amazon, still wanted to write a review. I looked at many reviews here and felt I should add mine too. Happened to find one a little less at Best Buy. I use both hand and electric razor and this one by FAR yields the best results! I have never had a closer shave...ever, until I used the Arc 3. Very well worth the money. No wonder there have been so many reviews on this one...simply amazing! Would recommend to anyone looking for the closest shave possible. If I had to say anything negative, it&#x27;s a tad loud but I could care less as long as I continue to get a close shave!</li>
            <li> this is a good shaver，recommend it</li>
            <li> This shaver gives a smooth and easy shave. The size is good and the charger works well. This product met all of my expectations.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor I have ever used. Panasonic has got it right. The high speed motor really cuts the stubble quickly.</li>
            <li> Got this for the spouse for Christmas.  He&#x27;s pleased with it..  Has only been using it for a month or so..</li>
            <li> The build quality is reasonable, and it shaves well enough, though requires more &#x27;passes&#x27; in these early weeks to give a clean shave than my, admittedly, far more expensive Braun. The instructions say use for a month before judging, so I&#x27;ll see. It is light and easy to use and has good instructions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my model 8103 for 3+ years now and I can say it still works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last couple Christmases I&#x27;ve gotten a new set of blades (this season I got the blades and foil).&lt;br /&gt;So once a year I give it a good cleaning and replace the blades and it&#x27;s good as new.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used it wet but it works fine dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually after a couple years the battery starts to crap out but not this one. When it was new I got exactly 2 weeks worth of shaves and as of today I still get exactly 2 weeks worth of shaves. Pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only 2 cons I can think of.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer isn&#x27;t great. I keep another old shaver around for trimming. Not a big deal but it could be better.&lt;br /&gt;It would be nice if you could lock the shaver in the &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; position. I&#x27;m always afraid when I pack it when going on a trip it will accidentally turn on and be dead when I land. And because it lasts a while I don&#x27;t usually pack the charging cord and I would be screwed. Admittedly a remote chance but some kind of power off lock would be nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall I am happy and the thing still works great. It&#x27;s probably the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor as a travel companion to my usual razor.  It soon replaced it and became my go to razor.  It gives an incredible shave, smooth and easy to use.  It&#x27;s light and easily packed and just wonderful.  I hightly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I think I bought all my Christmas from Amazon this year and everything was a hit !!! This was a gift for hubby and he&#x27;s using it everyday and loves it</li>
            <li> Been a foil shaver for over 50 years.  First, and best till now was a Ronson...  But this Panasonic gives an amazing fast and close, comfortable shave.  I highly recommend it.  The Li battery should be a real plus too.</li>
            <li> Having been a loyal Panasonic razor owner for many years, I have learned that you can keep these relatively inexpensive guys going a long time and they work really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, until I purchased this razor.  Maybe I just got a defective unit, but my 3 year old razor still shaves better than this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, Amazon is the shizz, and they are refunding me my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the fact that it didn&#x27;t shave worth a crud, this seemed like a pretty good razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only gripe I had about it was that there was no indicator light when you plugged it in.  It would be nice to see a green or red light to let you know that the unit is charging.</li>
            <li> Nice close shave.  Good deal for the money. Light weight and easy to use and maintains the charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> I used it a few times now . It is a really good. It is fast and it has a pretty quite sound.</li>
            <li> Look pretty, but the sound is horrible. Sound like mower.&lt;br /&gt;Is it faulty? if it is, can I get replacement?</li>
            <li> Replaced a 7 year old linear Panasonic.  This one is lighter and more compact.  I&#x27;ve had Panasonic wet/dry shavers for many years and this one seem to be the best one yet without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> Best electric shaver I have ever owned. Doesn&#x27;t pinch or cut like some cheaper ones. Gentle pressure gives a very close shave. Doesn&#x27;t work while plugged in, so you can&#x27;t shave and charge at the same time, but this doesn&#x27;t bother me imo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent shaver.  I like the batter percentage indicator.  I like that you can lock it or have it rotate.  But I&#x27;ve never received a really close shave especially under my chin/neck and mustache area.  I get a nice close shave on my face but the other areas are an issue.  I find I have to shave my chin and neck with a blade shaver most of the time finish shaving the mustache area with a blade shaver.</li>
            <li> First, I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it worked but after time, it great! It seems to be working better everyday I use it. I am very happy with this item, I completely give it two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Panasonic after reading Consumer Report&#x27;s glowing review.  I have never been sorry.  It has been a year since I bought the razor,  I have not shaved with a blade since I bought it.  There are many great features.  Charging is rapid. A full charge takes about 30 minutes.  Cleaning is a breeze.  You put some liquid soap on the blades and hold the start button until it goes into some sort of high speed function and then the unit shuts down when it is done.  You don&#x27;t clean the blades with a brush, and that is probably why they last longer.  If you are considering a good razor, at a reasonable price, this is the one to get.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have a nice clean shave once again.  That&#x27;s all I can say about this [product, Thank you.</li>
            <li> I had trouble under my jaw line and on the neck area. Having to go over the same spots countless times as the razor got hot and irritated my skin. No thank you.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome. Will still shave after 3 days of growth. Works in shower and dry. Shaves up to 10 times without recharging. Great for sensitive skin. No more rashes or bumps.</li>
            <li> Using this for quick leg touch-ups it&#x27;s fantastic! A lot closer a shave than any women&#x27;s shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned, has a higher RPM, easy cleaning and fast charging (less than an hour). I would recommend this to any lass wanting to wear skirts or capris in the Summer months without having to laboriously leg shave in the shower!</li>
            <li> Got this for my balding head. Works great! No irritation, flexible. This is exactly what I have been looking for. I hope it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gift for my nephew. and he is glad to receive it. it handles very well. good fit for orient people&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> This razor is miles ahead of my former Braun. It&#x27;s light and beautiful and cuts very close. A higher pitched buzz, similar in volume to the Braun, louder than a rotary, but closer cutting than either.</li>
            <li> Okay but I miss my rotating head shaver.  Shaves close enough on the straightaway, but can&#x27;t handle the curves too well. Can&#x27;t get to the upper lip near the nose easily because of the bulky head. Well made and solid, though, and I expect it to hold up.</li>
            <li> It shaves horrible. I tried more than fourty minutes but also could not shave half of my face.&lt;br /&gt;It is really horrible.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it from Azerbaijan, it took long time to arrive to my country, so now I cant also send it back</li>
            <li> This is my third Panasonic shaver.  True to form it shaves very close.  I think my 9-year old shaver still works but the blades are expensive, so I tried this newer version.  It seems to shave closer than the old model, except it is much bigger and harder to get into places like under my nose.  The fancy pivot mechanism seems to add at least an extra inch of bulk and I&#x27;m not sure how much more effective it makes the shaver.  Overall I am happy with it.  It holds a charge for 7-10 days, just like my old one.  I like the digital readout.  My old shaver just had colored lights and would sometimes stop in the middle of a shave when it still had a green light.  Time will tell if this model will last as long as my old model.  I may purchase a blade set for my old model and use it for travel.</li>
            <li> The razor motor sounds powerful, but...I have to pass it over the same area a bunch of times to get a close shave. It takes longer to shave than with my old &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; Panasonic razor.</li>
            <li> Husband liked the shave</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT SHAVER YOU CAN SHAVE IN THE SHOWER OR WHERE EVER DONT WORRY ABOUT GETTING IT WET</li>
            <li> I am happy with this shaver, it cut closed and clean. However, it is rather noisy. I don&#x27;t mind this noise and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have always used either a top of the line Braun or Eltron. My favorite Braun unexpectedly died so I thought I would try this shaver based on the reviews and the price. I must say I am extremely pleased with this shaver. Have never gotten such a smooth shave as with this shaver. Really nice to be able to use it wet or dry. This is now my daily shaver and an old Braun is the backup. I have a pretty tough beard and this goes right through it without any irritation or redness. I do not believe you will be disappointed with this product!!</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver. Very well built and cuts really clean. Operates a little on the loud side, but I don&#x27;t mind as long as it continues to be reliable.</li>
            <li> Charges fast, shaves closer than any shaver I&#x27;ve owned before (namely Norelco/Panasonic electric shavers). Love the speed and the battery really doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;fade&amp;#34;. If you let it die (it gives you way more than enough notice with the display) it goes from full function to dead in an instant. That&#x27;s not a downside, trust me. It tells you &amp;#34;10% Charge&amp;#34; with about 30 min of continuous use left and it will perform at 100% capacity until it just quits. I can go almost 2 weeks on &amp;#34;10% charge&amp;#34;, shaving every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10, would recomend</li>
            <li> I started using this product a month back. The first experience was WOW. I clean so perfectly. But it took lot of time to clean the neck and lower chin area , I had to use my Saving blade to clean this. Hopefully this will get better once I get adjusted with the saver</li>
            <li> This is definitely a step up from my old shaver. Having the charge indicator is a big plus. I love it!</li>
            <li> I have not used an electric for 20 years. Stopped because I could not get a close comfortable shave. Boy has that changed. I am totally pleased with every feature of the Panasonic shaver. Thank you for coming up with a great way to shave! John Daniel</li>
            <li> Should have returned it when I had the chance.  This is my first electric razor, so maybe they all suck, but I don&#x27;t get a good shave.  It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s not close, it is, but there are always a few hairs that just don&#x27;t get cut.  I&#x27;d rather a not so close shave but more uniform.  With a close shave you can clearly see every hair that isn&#x27;t cut.</li>
            <li> Takes a week or two for your beard to become &amp;#34;accustomed&amp;#34; to the up and down motion vs the previously used rotary razor but once that happens,  it&#x27;s a close shave.....B B.....</li>
            <li> Not as close of a shave as a blade, but certainly better than older electric razors that I used in the past.  Especially like that it can be used in the shower without an issue.  Usually I shave with the blade and then clean up my face with this razor.  I recommend at the discounted price, but at regular price there are better razor options out there.</li>
            <li> This is apparently the best shaver my husband has ever had. He can even use it in the shower. And he says it really shaves well. He had the kind that has round shaver blades before and would sit around buzzing away forever and still not get a decent shave. With this straight line, apparently it&#x27;s SO much better. It&#x27;s also easy to clean and charges fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s all I know about men&#x27;s shavers. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Exactly what it says. Great product. However, after a few months does not give the razor blade-close shave that it did at first. That&#x27;s why not giving it a 5 star. Love the ability to shave in shower!</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd Panasonic wet/dry shaver I bought. First one I dropped in the shower and broke a piece of the head. The only con is the electric connection to the handle is soso.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when buying this item because I didn&#x27;t think these shavers actually shaves like a razor blade, and so said so proven, it takes too long get that clean shave. Therefore, I just use a Gillette 5 blade shaver, which cuts right through it and gets the job done even closer than these fancy machines.</li>
            <li> Light, quiet motor, and a very smooth cut is provided by this particular shaver. The&lt;br /&gt;overall design is both attractive and ergonomically comfortable. I owned three Brauns&lt;br /&gt;before and liked them, however, this is an amazing value considering performance and&lt;br /&gt;build quality. Unit is made in China (surprise!), but compares well to the German made&lt;br /&gt;Braun shavers previously owned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of different makes of shavers, including Phillips and Remington. The rotary shavers don&#x27;t shave close enough and the Remington blade shaver is so noisy that it wakes the neighbors. This Panasonic shaver is simply great. It gives you a close shave and it&#x27;s the quietist shaver I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to have a decent razor, and read in the manual  that you should use it wet for the first several times.  So I used it in the shower and instantly dropped, which broke both the foil and blades.  Beware that this is very delicate!</li>
            <li> This item is not bad at all. The only issue I have with it is that it wont stay charged for long. You&#x27;ll get a full charge in under an hour but the machine dies after about half an hour into shaving.</li>
            <li> Trust in Panasonic and this is just another evidence. Powerful and clean effect. Recharge time is short, dual voltage good for intl travel.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift.  He does not like the size of the head because it is too big to trim around beard.</li>
            <li> When my husband had a heart attack, he went on blood thinner. He was advised to buy a electric razor. which was very gentle and could get wet. Charge last a long time, easy to clean, also very attractive design.  Everything for the price I was looking for. I love Amazon, never had a bad product and always the shipping is fantastic. I give Amazon 10 stars for service.</li>
            <li> I have been using a rotary unit for about 30 years now. I hated using it as it would tear up my skin and take forever to shave. When it&#x27;s a twice a day thing, it shouldn&#x27;t take that long. I was given this shaver as a Christmas present from my parents. It&#x27;s effortless to use, even with tough facial hair like my own. There is a zero skin irritation factor and it&#x27;s easy to use and clean. You&#x27;d have to be real rough on this thing to break it. I carry mine in a leather accessories bag when I travel. I highly recommend it if you currently have a rotary blade shaver or its just your first shaver.</li>
            <li> Having recently started shaving and cutting myself with ravors this product helped. I am an older guy who always had facial hair and my face is very sensitve. This Panasonic really does what it is advertised to do.</li>
            <li> Does the job but I had higher expectation for this product after all the positive reviews. Would consider another product down the line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this electric razor every day for the last few weeks. I have sensitive skin, but I&#x27;ve had no &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; from this guy.  Even so, I still use Lectric Shave since I like its very light conditioning of the skin as opposed to something like Edge which would make it hard to see what I was doing. I would not say this is much faster than using a razor, but you can be way less careful.  I&#x27;ve knocked off a star since I still have to really go back and forth under the chin and go in different angles to get everything, so it&#x27;s still not perfect.  However, it&#x27;s nice not having to worry about cutting my face since I do sometimes need to hurry in the morning.  I&#x27;ve never used an electric razor until now, so I can&#x27;t comment on its loudness, but my friend said this electric razor was much more quiet than the one he uses from a few years ago.</li>
            <li> It is a great pleasure to use this foil shaver. I use it with shaving cream and it provides a smooth and close shave, with no skin irritation at all. However, the blade and the foil need to be changed every year.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this for over a year. It still works well both in and out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I have an extremely tough beard and never had an electric razor that gave me a close shave until I got this one. This razor gives as close a shave as using a blade when shaving using shaving cream, or a wet shave. A very smooth shave even in the hard to get places such as under the chin and at the jaw line. I was totally amazed at just how close a shave I got!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for an exceptional shaver I would strongly recommend this one. the cleaning cycle works great, the shave is, to me, as close as using a blade without the irritation and nicks.</li>
            <li> The best thing I can say about this razor is that it&#x27;s very light, perfect for travel. And that&#x27;s about it. I&#x27;ve used it 4 or 5 times. It simply doesn&#x27;t cut your beard and it feels clumsy. I&#x27;m done with Panasonic and am moving to a Braun razor. Considerably more expensive but at least I won&#x27;t be irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John F.</li>
            <li> Nice razor, have had for approx 8 months and has worked great so far. Provides a very close shave though i notice the curved hear may require more passes to hit all of the areas. The razor charges quickly and the charges seem to last for 7-8 uses.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace a Panasonic shaver I had used for years, which replaced another Panasonic shave I has used for years. This one is substantially better than both. It is a great combination of price and performance. I would recommend it to anyone and would certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco rotary razors for many years. The front part of my Norelco 6613X that has the switch started to come off plus I was tired of using that little brush to clean it, so I decided to try this Panasonic. I was pleasantly surprised at how close it shaves and the cleaning is very easy and it charges fast. So I think it is a five star product. But I am deducting a star because it is noisy with a loud hum and the trimmer is not as good as the Norelcos.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this for shaving daily.  So far he has had no complaints other than the replacement coil costing almost as much as a new shaver (we opted for a new shaver).  This is his second one -- the first lasted for almost two years before it needed new coils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband&#x27;s beard is coarse, and the razor does the job with no knicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It recharges to 100% in roughly 1 hour if most of the power has been drained.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver.  I had the old model for many years but to replace the blade it costs about half of buying a new one so i decided to buy thie ES8103S model.  It shaves so smooth.  Love it!</li>
            <li> The battery is strong and lasts long and the blade cuts close.  What I didn&#x27;t like was that the blade cut too close and left my skin irritated. How close does a shaver have to cut.  Pretty soon the line between a close shave and and hair extraction will be blurred. Due to the shape of the head, the shaver is not as good at getting the area under the nose as a Norelco triple head.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a lightning deal and thought I&#x27;m getting something good since it&#x27;s quite expensive! But I got totally disappointed after struggling to shave with it for a month!&lt;br /&gt;1. It is not efficient and you must spend so much time going the same spot back and forth until you get a clean shave, but you&#x27;ll destroy your skin this way!&lt;br /&gt;2. on wet shave it&#x27;s even worse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I like about it&#x27;s how it looks!</li>
            <li> Yep, the packaging//marketing is on target :) I&#x27;m a newbie at shaving my head and have never used a manual (blade) razor. I&#x27;ve always said, &amp;#34;maybe one day&amp;#34; (when I gather the courage) so I can get a closer shave than with my former electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I think I&#x27;ll keep saying &amp;#34;maybe one day&amp;#34; with the manual (blade) shaver! With this wet/dry electric shaver, I get the closest shave I&#x27;ve had - no nicks, cuts nor irritation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works excellent in the shower - lather up, shave and clean - all in one flow. Quick easy, no fuss, excellent results all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside? Well, I&#x27;ll probably never learn, nor (have to) gain the courage, to shave my head with a manual/blade razor :)</li>
            <li> I love this electric shaver!  The shave is as close as a manual razor, but it is much more convenient.  I was hesitant to buy an electric shaver, since they tend to be rather expensive, and I did not know how good they could be.  This is my first &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; electric shaver (not just a travel shaver), and I feel like it was a good investment.</li>
            <li> This is way better then blades and almost blade close, does a great job and no cuts or irate skin. Would highly recommend if you were tired of blade prices</li>
            <li> My husband loves it! He even lets me shave him sometimes (as he can&#x27;t see very well). Very nice to use.</li>
            <li> I love this razor. I especially love the fact that I have the option of shaving wet or dry. For those who use an electric razor, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Use razor daily and it cuts closer than any electric razor I hav used. I would recommend it to anyone interested in purchasing an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I do not like the Panasonic shaver because it does not shave close and it makes too much noise.  I would like a new shaver or a refund.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband.  He said he really likes the shave.  It has a close shave and did not leave him with any redness.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> When I decided to purchase this, I had spent years looking for a shaver better and cheaper than blades. I shave as I have unruly hair and a few bald patches.&lt;br /&gt;As I was getting older 70, I needed something better and easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;When I first got it I thought another con job, but I stayed with it. at present it is better. Onemust keep trying. at the moment I could not be happier. It&#x27;s  quick and clean. It is easier to clean then an old razor and comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;The main thing it saves you a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many types of razors all promising to do a great job, none did, except this one.&lt;br /&gt;When I got useto using it, its so handy and quick to use, there is no messingaroundwithsoapand water. And it is ready to use at alltimes. You only have toremember to charge it up after 5 or 6 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for selling it to me.&lt;br /&gt;RQ</li>
            <li> After a year and half of having this shaver, I am very satisfied with it. It shaves very smoothly. I had a Braun 5000 shaver before this and this is by far a better shaver.The only issue is its battery, although still pretty good, not the same as it was advertised. The battery&#x27;s life time is about 2/3 of what it was supposed to be.</li>
            <li> Shaves and performs much better than my old norelco. Closer shave and less passes. As mentioned before, it is a tad loud and the battery doesnt last too long. Pick this up, you wont regret it.</li>
            <li> I am sure this works for many people, but it didn&#x27;t meet my expectations after using it. I don&#x27;t shave my face on a daily basis so I tried to allow sufficient time for my face to get accustomed to the new foil razor. This was the first time I decided to use these due to the reviews promising a more comfortable shave. It is more comfortable, but it also take 3 times as long to shave my face than it has in the past. I have coarse hair so take that into account when reading this...    Pros:   Easily Cleaned  Awesome Battery Life  Comfortable Grip    Cons:  Super Loud  Slow Shave</li>
            <li> I started looking at Braun electric shavers, but they were out of my price range. I found this Panasonic that advertised the same features as the higher end Brauns. It works perfectly. I have used it for a year now, and I have had no problems. It cleans easily and the clipper is powerful and precise enough for my needs.</li>
            <li> Gives a decent shave, but it takes a lot of back and forth and pressing hard to get a close one.  I usually use a manual blade instead. I thought this would do better. I guess you have to spend more than this to get a good electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Pretty darn good razor!  After spending almost $200 on the top of the line Braun I decided this was not so bad after all.</li>
            <li> I have used a Panasonic shaver in the past and it was very good.  However, no shaver lasts forever and mine simply died after about six years.  So, when it came time to purchase a new one, I thought I would try the new Braun with the \\&quot;odd-shaped\\&quot; holes in the screen that were supposed to give you the best possible shave because this screen captured the hairs from all angles.  Dream on!  It was the poorest shave I had ever gotten.  So I purchased this Panasonic and now I&#x27;m back to a very quick, very clean shave.  This thing is terrific.  Anyone want to buy a slightly used Braun??</li>
            <li> Works well. The battery lasts about one week less than my Norelco</li>
            <li> Husband has not complained. It still works. It is two years old now.</li>
            <li> I have been using for about a month. I wasn&#x27;t too impressed at first but now it&#x27;s doing a better job. It&#x27;s not as close as a razor but a lot less hassle and it comes in a very close second. I have been using it dry, but may give the wet test soon. The charging is quick and I get about 10 shaves on a full charge but it depends on how long it takes you to get the shave you want. I like the pop-up trimmer but don&#x27;t use it much since I have a little Wahl beard and mustache trimmer. It&#x27;s very ergonomic, and easy to control. I would recommend this shaver to anyone wanting to change over from a blade. Be sure and give it the month to see if it works for you.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace a Braun 5614 - expecting the Panasonic to shave closer and faster. That has not been the case. It runs much quieter than the Braun, but it is not faster nor does it give a closer shave.    The user manual states that the shaver should supply roughly 14 shaves of 3 minutes each when fully charged. I do not have a rough, thick beard at all - I could go a few days without shaving and most people might not notice. Yet it STILL takes me 8-10 minutes to shave (wet or dry) using the ES8103S. Thus, I only get 6-8 shaves out of a full charge.    Since the manual states a shave of 3 minutes, my conclusion was that Panasonic tested the model with 12-year-old boys -- or that I had a defect. So I sent my shaver back for a replacement and the new one is no different.    This is not a bad shaver at all; just know that you won&#x27;t get 14 shaves on a full charge. Expect 5 to 9 shaves depending on how thick/heavy your beard is.    **Nov 2014 Update** - Now this last only 2-3 shaves. The display will say 30% or 40% yet the shaver will die 15-20 seconds later. So 4 years seems to be about the life of the battery.</li>
            <li> This razor is a dream. It doesn&#x27;t take a long time for me to get all the stubble (unlike my previous razor), and works will even if I go a couple days without shaving. Holds a charge for a long time too. Had considered the more expensive Panasonic models, but I&#x27;m perfectly satisfied with this one.    I have sensitive skin and this razor doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> Seems to work reasonably well but doubt made by Panasonic. Farmed out product that is overpriced but we&#x27;ll see how long it operates. Won&#x27;t dare get it wet.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver I have used in the last 20 years.  I have tried many brands cheaper &amp; more expensive than the Panasonic ES8103S but, have always been disappointed until now.  I am glad I read the review &amp; gave this shaver a try.  The shaver last about 10 days on single charge &amp; does not loose power at the end like most shavers.  I also like the counter that tells you when battery is used up.  The shaver is quick &amp; does not leave long hairs on neck like some shavers.  I have been using the shaver for about 3 months &amp; the blade still works like new.  I am very happy with this shaver.</li>
            <li> Wet shaving with blade will allow a closer shave but takes longer. This shaver gives a very good shave in a very short time.  It may do even better with soap and water but not tried as I am satisfied as is. Of maybe a dozen shavers over many years, this is the best yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a blade for many years because I like the closeness of a wet shave.  But I&#x27;m now taking blood thinners for a heart condition and they make me susceptible to bleeding.  Just a slight nick will have me walking around with a little dot of toilet paper on my face all morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try an electric shaver despite bad experiences many years ago.  Early models caused irritation and never gave me a really close shave.  I wasn&#x27;t about to shell out $200 to try one of the new electrics, but the $60 price on this one seemed reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it both wet and dry and have gotten excellent results both ways.  I&#x27;m back to shaving daily again instead of skipping days.  I&#x27;ve experienced none of the skin irritation that I always associated with electric razors.  As a matter of fact, I even skip using aftershave lotion most days because it&#x27;s not necessary.  The shave is not quite as close as a blade but it&#x27;s more than satisfactory for my needs.  The only problem is a small area on my neck where the whiskers seem to lie flat instead of standing up.  The shaver has trouble mowing these down so I&#x27;ve taken to giving them a once-over with a blade after I&#x27;ve shaved the rest of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is easy to clean and the batteries last for five or six shaves without recharging.  I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This shaver has no problem handling 3 days of growth with no pulling, and gives a real close shave.  The battery lasts a couple of weeks between charges.  I love the digital battery life display.</li>
            <li> i shave my head and face, i read a lot of reviews and this was so well received I had to try it. unfortunately it missed my head hair all over the place. I had to go over it so much that it left me with tiny bleeding spots all over my scalp. it was fairly smooth over my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for 15 months.  Shaves were fine, but today while I was shaving I felt a mysterious burning on my hand--I thought I must have cut myself.  Eventually I figured out that the chalky substance on my hand was the source of the burning sensation--the battery had corroded and leaked out on me.  Sadly I did not keep the warranty paperwork...</li>
            <li> Just as the title states, pretty good shave. It does not pull or irritate my sensitive skin, its pretty good.</li>
            <li> I have had many electric razors over the years....This model and brand is the best ever.....I even ordered a second one for travel.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised with a little patience a fine clean shave.  Cleanup is very simple small amount of soap and water and it is shiny and clean.</li>
            <li> This shaver is absolutely terrible nearly shave my face off. Braun makes 100 times better shaver than this crap Panasonic!!!</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN SHAVING WITH AN ELECTRIC SHAVER FOR OVER 50 YEARS  AND HAVE NEVER USED A SHAVER AS COMFORTABLE AND CLEAN SHAVING AS THIS PANASONIC SHAVER.IT IS VERY LIGHT TO HOLD AND EASY TO CLEAN WITH WATER AND IT HOLDS A CHARGE FOR OVER A WEEK OF SHAVING.I CAN&#x27;T FIND A SINGLE THING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had Norelcos and they tore the ba jesus out of my neck. The Panasonic works much better without the irritation. The only gripe is the shave isn&#x27;t as close as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> Took almost a month for my skin and beard to adjust to the shaver.  Now it works great equally well wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Very good shaver for the money.  Simple to use, clean. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Just bout this and am enjoying it a lot. So far it looks like it holds a charge for about two weeks (using it everyday). I&#x27;ll keep you posted.</li>
            <li> Have been using it a few months now. Like that it can be immersed in water. Like that it provides decent shave for ~90% of the face. Dislike that it leaves 10% or so with a little bit of hair. I have never been able to use it without the need for a touch up with regular shaving razors. Couple of times I did, I got &#x27;missed a spot&#x27; kind of comments. If there was a choice to pay the difference and upgrade it for a better model, I&#x27;d do it in a heartbeat. Won&#x27;t buy again even on a significant sale, as was the case this time.</li>
            <li> This razor is way more economical to keep clean than having to buy the cleaner cartridges to keep my previous Braun clean, and the replacement screens don&#x27;t cost as much as a replacement razor.</li>
            <li> This a great shaver.  It cuts smoothly and efficiently.  I got it to replace my old Panasonic shaver, which I had bought refurbished, that lasted almost a decade.  This shaver is even better than my old one.  The battery lasts a very long time, it is relatively quiet, and gives a great shave.</li>
            <li> big discount，but make a little noise</li>
            <li> Very impressed with the warranty and the durability of the razor. The razor worked well for bald head shaving for about 1.5 years. I was pretty rough on the unit, keeping it in the shower, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 1.5 years, one of the holders for the razor heads broke off. I sent it off to Panasonic and they gave me a refurbished unit in return. Was very impressed with their warranty and service.</li>
            <li> I love Panasonic razors.  This is my second and it&#x27;s an improvement on the first.  Great shave, waterproof, indicator for battery life remaining, nice little popup trimmer, easy to clean, charges fast, good grip--pretty much everything I could expect in a razor.  I&#x27;ve had a couple of brauns that I liked a remington I hated and then my two panasonics.  I&#x27;ll stick with Panasonic until they let me down.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Very loud and doesn&#x27;t cut as smooth as my previous Panasonic that I bought for $29.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the battery doesn&#x27;t last as long either.</li>
            <li> Great shaver -- I&#x27;ve had mine for 4 years, and it still does a pretty good job.  Sometimes you have to go over the same patch of face-lawn multiple times, but I&#x27;ve had the same problem with a few straight razors, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LED recently stopped functioning altogether  -- but, it still holds a charge a long time (20 shaves?), and I haven&#x27;t ever actually replaced the blades or screen.  I clean it thoroughly before/during/after every use, as it seems to perform better..  I typically add a bead of liquid soap and a little water which has the double-benefit of keeping it cleaner and is less irritating on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably buy the $31 replacement screen/blades and hopefully get many more years out of this.</li>
            <li> alittle loud compare to other shavers I&#x27;ve used....but it does provide a clean shave</li>
            <li> great shaver, good value for money.  perhaps best wet/dry electric shaver</li>
            <li> My husband has been very pleased with this razor.  It holds charge and gives a good clean shave.  He has had other razors and they did not hold a charge, so we were really concerned with that...  No issues on that!</li>
            <li> This item gets the job done without putting too much pressure on your skin. If only I had started using this a few years earlier.</li>
            <li> I have been using Panasonic Razors for several years now after trying other brands. This is the best one I Have tried.It gives you a really close shave and has the wet feature that allows for ease of cleaning and clearly shows how much charge is remaining.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my grandson. He is very happy with it. I have been shaving with a similar Panasonic for about 5 years and my pleasant experience was key in selecting this one for him.</li>
            <li> Great for the price. Shaves really well and fairly quiet. Right out of the package, I thought it felt cheap and sounded cheap while shaving, but it is durable and cuts well. Easy to clean and nice to know how much battery life is left before the motor fails part way through a shave. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for over a month now and have experienced great results. Easy to clean, battery lasts, and leaves my face smooth. The &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; shave doesn&#x27;t work as good as I would have hoped but that may just be the shaving cream that I am using. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> the razor is one of the best electric razors i ever owned. been using cordless/electric razors over 20 years, this one was costly but works really welll</li>
            <li> I have used an electric shaver from another manufacturer through many different models over the past 55 years. I finally tried this one, and it is clearly superior in many respects.</li>
            <li> After serious research, I bought this for my son&#x27;s first razor. He did not want to use disposables, and I wanted a good quality product with all-in-one options to take care of his facial grooming needs. I did buy a 2-year protection since this is an expensive product, although I got an extremely good discount during the holidays. It gives a good smooth shave, and I have tried it on my legs as a personal test. I have never gone wrong with Panasonic! Great RAZOR!</li>
            <li> Never found an electric razor that would do an adequate job. So far this razor has exceeded all my expectations, wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a wide range of electric shavers, from low to high dollar, but nothing in the last 5 years. I was sold on the outstanding reviews, and jumped on these for the $59 sale. It charged quickly, and runs quieter than any electric I&#x27;ve used by far. It also shaves closer and better than any as well. No pulling or chafeing, or electric razor burn using it both wet and dry. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this razor, and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is my fourth Panasonic of the same kind. I have a heavy beard, and this gives me the closest shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> I did not use the shaver because it was Used.  Cannot comment on the quality of the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Happy now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m liking it..charges quickly, trimmer works well.Nice design.(shape)&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll have to see how it holds up over time. At this point I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> Shaves like a regular shaving razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Runs a long time on one charge and cleaning is a snap.  Still doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a razor, though.</li>
            <li> I used a blade for the past 20 years.  About every few years I will try an electric, but I always end up disappointed and back on the blade.  I am actually really happy with this razor.  I bought it when it was a lightning deal, and figured it was cheap enough to risk it.  I have used this for a couple months, and it works just as good as a blade.  I use it in the shower.  I can use it for a week and a half before recharging.  The head is really flexible, and does well on the hard to cut areas.  I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> I received my new razor 3 day ago. I have had a Braun for 10 years and i thought it was a good one. This new Panasonic proved me wrong. Guys, this is the closest shaving electric razor I have ever used!!! I can&#x27;t say enough good about ! If you shave with an electric razor you really need to try this one. You won&#x27;t be disappointed !</li>
            <li> This is a value decision for me.  I can&#x27;t tell any difference between the ES8103S (previously ES8109) and the $200-$300 shavers.  My beard is heavy but not dense.  I may be a shaving Luddite, but pivoting heads (I use this one locked) and exotic cleaning systems are a waste of time and money for me.  I clean this with liquid dishwashing soap, takes about a minute, let it dry and hit it with a quick shot of Remington Shaver Saver.  Replace the blades and foils every 8 to 9 months and it&#x27;s good for about 3 years, after that the batteries won&#x27;t hold a charge for more than one or two shaves.</li>
            <li> When I first received this shaver it worked well.  After about 2 months of daily use the shavings no longer stay inside the unit.  They end up all over the counter and/or my shirt.  I&#x27;ve cleaned the unit multiple times according to the instructions, and even right after cleaning the shavings still fall out.  I don&#x27;t see any sign of damage, and I&#x27;ve treated the shaver with care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Panasonic, and they told me to pay to ship it back to them.  They also said if it needed any parts replaced I would have to pay for them, as they aren&#x27;t covered by the warranty.  This is after only 2 months of ownership.</li>
            <li> My husband thought it was awful.  The blades were not sharp and skipped more than they cut.  Returned it quickly.</li>
            <li> Good item, Thank you.</li>
            <li> Bought for my bf who likes to use it. Delivery as I expected.</li>
            <li> great shaver, reliable and affordable. this is the second one I bought in the last 4 years. Recharges quickly, blade and screen lasts about three years. But above all, clean it after you use it. A little liquid soap put on the screen, start it up and put the head under running water and cleaning is done.</li>
            <li> Very noisy and misses a lot of hair. I would go with the Phillips over this Panasonic. Battery drains quickly too but recharges quick as well.</li>
            <li> This is the favorite electric razor my husband has ever had.  He&#x27;s 67.  He loves everything about it.  Won&#x27;t ever get another kind.</li>
            <li> Birthday gift for hubby was better than expected. He loves it. After using different brands over time this was the best said my 83 year old mate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to buy one of these for a while so I could use the shaving cream that I like to do as well as have an electric shave instead of blades. It has turned out to be a great investment. I love to shave with it and it does a great job. Would recommend it for anyone who likes to use shaving cream while shaving.</li>
            <li> Not a single complaint.  Cuts smoothly, quickly, and charges fast. Easy to clean.  Just need to keep it away from the rest of my family!</li>
            <li> This is the 4th and 2nd 8103S I own. They worked great overall as long as you replace the blades every 1-2 years and clean it after each use. .</li>
            <li> Everything is ok except the great big noise!&lt;br /&gt;I use it to wake up my family.&lt;br /&gt;It is a shaver alarm.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda loud, which was surprising. And the trimmer attachment is at a bit of an awkward angle, but it is the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric razor.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband.  He has sensitive skin and gets shadow by noon;not a good combination.  This works very well and does not irritate his skin as much as other razors.  Plus it is a closer shave.  Easy to clean and easy to carry.  Happy with this purchase all around.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BB5YHEI to test and compare. They both have basically identical features. IE: waterproof, battery indicator, popup trimmer, middle blade for longer hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic irritates my skin and misses spots around the jaw and neck. It actually shaves just as close if not closer (since you can go opposite way much easier) than my Gillette fusion, which was surprising and unexpected. It misses spots at the jawbone and neck, but you could get them with the pop up trimmer if you needed. I originally wanted this due to hearing that electric razors irritate less than cartridge razors. So I was pretty disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington doesn&#x27;t irritate, doesn&#x27;t miss any spots, and is cheaper.</li>
            <li> It works well wet or dry...the battery lasts a good length of time..it cleans easily..what&#x27;s not to like? I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I bought two of these shavers for my two boys. I read many reviews before picking this model. I am glad that I spend a little more to get a little more. They are a good investment because it provides a close shave, it easy to use, keep its charge and good sleek. They love them.</li>
            <li> I have been going between blade razors and electric razors for a while. Have been using&lt;br /&gt;and older braun model that was breaking down, i purchased this razor almost on a whim&lt;br /&gt;but most of the reviews were positive and i am very satisfied with it. I get a very close have with it and it doesnt&lt;br /&gt;require alot of time, i guess every body will have a different opinion and i can use it wet or dry which is  very easy and get a very good shave&lt;br /&gt;with either.Charge last a good long time.Really dont use a blade much anymore as this shaver does&lt;br /&gt;the job for me..Do recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this because my es8243a has a decent number of years on it, and this shaver cost about as much as a new block &amp; cutters for the es8243a. I thought the 3-blade system wouldn&#x27;t be much different than the 4-blade, but I was very wrong. The shave is much worse. It looks close enough at first, but my shadow grows in (visibly and to the touch) about half a day sooner than the es8243a. I would have returned this shaver but the 30-day window had expired before I could really try it out.</li>
            <li> A really nice close shave! I was a rotary user for years, and I would recommend this razor&lt;br /&gt;to anyone.</li>
            <li> Any new razor will take a few days for you to get the hang of, for your skin to get used to, and for you to really see the pros and cons. If you give this one a chance you will find that it shaves very close once you get the hang of it. It&#x27;s easy to use and feels high quality. Cleaning is not hard - a quick rinse and air dry does just fine. Feels great in your hand. My first one lasted 15 years (would have replaced the blades and kept using it but was almost the same price to get a new one on sale and got the swivel head as a new feature -which works great BTW) and I&#x27;m a couple years into my second one. Just got one for my son (age 15).  Recommended!</li>
            <li> Have been fairly pleased as I was a razor user for years....still have to clean up my neck with the razor, but nothing too terrible. Using foam works best.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it.  Have used it for a couple years now.</li>
            <li> This razor has a motor that cycles much faster than the older model, which overcomes some difficulties the older model had with cutting longer hair with the clipper. I am disappointed that this model did not come with an induction charger &amp; a docking station. This is a serious drawback.</li>
            <li> I have tried many electric shavers, but this one is the best. I like the option of using it with water and shaving cream</li>
            <li> I gave this a fair shot. Tried it for almost 3 or 4 different shaves of varying grain.  It just doesn&#x27;t work.  I really pushed it against my skin, but the shave was never even close to as clean as it would be with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and the Doc recommended I switch to electric.  This razor was disappointing.  I am sure most electric razors with this technology will have the same result.  My search for a cleaner electric shave continues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only plus I can give to new users is that it works in the shower, works great even with the water running.  I ended up returning it just because it does not give a good shave.</li>
            <li> Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Rechargeable Linear Pivot Action Shaving System, Silver is excellent and performs as advertised. This is my second ES8103S which I purchased because I like my first one so very much and was afraid it might become unavailable.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend as a gift and he loves it. He has very thick facial hair and this shaver gives a smooth close shave.</li>
            <li> I read the many good reviews from others who have a similar beard problem as I do; easy to shave face but very difficult to shave neck (hairs don&#x27;t grow straight and skin is somewhat sensitive).  Since I wanted to get away from the pain of a regular razor, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.    I received my Panasonic ES8103S the first week of June.  I followed the instructions on proper handling, care and shaving technique in order to allow my face the recommended 30 days to get used to the new shaving technique. Things started out good, but then it was all downhill.    Initially I was quite pleased.  The shave wasn&#x27;t perfect, but there was no irritation, it did a nice job on my face and a decent job on my neck.  I thought things would improve over the 30 day \\&quot;get used to\\&quot; period.  WRONG!  It now takes me longer to shave and the result is horrible.  My face doesn&#x27;t feel smooth and my next barely looks like I touched it with the shaver.  And the more I try to get my neck clean, the more irritated it becomes.  I&#x27;ve tried a variety of shave creams but nothing helps.  Dry, it just hurts.    I really want to return this thing but since Amazon only gives a 30 day window, which, when counting the day of receipt and time required to charge and then adequately go through the trial period, you pass the return period.      So, now I&#x27;m stuck with a product that is essentially a useless waste of money.  If you want to take a chance with this product, I recommend you buy it from a store that has a more reasonable return policy... you&#x27;re gonna need it!</li>
            <li> Bought this shaver as a result of not being completely happy with the shave I was getting with a Norelco Arcitec shaver. At first I was very happy with the Panasonic shaver, but enthusiasm has waned over the period of several weeks.  The Panasonic shaver is very loud and seems to run down the battery faster than a Norelco. It also seems to now cause more skin irritation than it did at the beginning.  Bottom line is that I just put a new blade set in the Norelco Arcitec and will probably go back to that as my primary shaver.</li>
            <li> I decided to go back to using an electric after years of using a blade after getting a good deal on the Panasonic ES4026NC Sonic-2 Pro Curve.  I liked that shaver but had a few reservations about it so, after reading reviews, I decided to purchase the Panasonic ES8103S Vortex Wet/Dry Shaver.  So far, it&#x27;s been a very good purchase for me.  The shaver comes with a charger, a travel pouch and the instructions.  Operation is simple enough.  Plug it in for about an hour to get a full charge and away you go.  There&#x27;s also an option to plug it in for about 5 minutes if the battery&#x27;s dead and you need a quick shave.  There&#x27;s a LCD screen that displays the status of the charge in 10% increments as well as displaying when the shaver should be cleaned.  In my experience, the battery goes down about 10% with every shave so, you get about 10 days worth of shaving before you need to charge it again.  There&#x27;s also 2 settings for the head to allow more or less pivot.  Even when the firmer setting is chosen, the head still pivots to some degree just not as freely.  There are 3 heads on this model; 2 foil heads that float independently and another head in the middle of them to grab longer hairs.  I&#x27;ve been using this shaver now for about 3 months and my experience with this shaver has been very good.  I get a nice smooth shave time after time.  Like any new electric shaver, it did take a while for me to adjust to it but honestly, the shaves just keep getting better and better.  It doesn&#x27;t grab the longer hairs quite as well as a rotary shaver but if there are any stragglers, I hit them with the pop out trimmer and then go over them with the shaver.  Not really a big deal to me.  About every 3rd shave, the LCD displays a faucet and it&#x27;s time to clean the shaver.  Simply rub a little liquid soap over the head and hold down the power button until it enters Turbo Mode which oscillates the blade at 17,000 rpms. I run it under water until the unit shuts itself off then, pop off the head and rinse it off.  Nice and clean.  People have complained that the shaver is loud and compared to others, this may be true.  To me, it&#x27;s not annoyingly loud so, the noise is really a non issue.  Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with my shaver and look forward to many more close, comfortable shaves from it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simpler for shaving on those mornings where you feel like a zombie but it doesn&#x27;t get close enough and I have  to go back later and shave again to not look ragged by the afternoon. If you have the time the ol&#x27; razor is still # 1.</li>
            <li> boyfriend is really happy with this product. All his roommates try to use it too... at least its easy to clean!</li>
            <li> I thought I would have seen an upgrade over my prior Panasonic shaver ( model ES8019) but I did not.The ES8103S takes the same time to shave as the older Panasonic shaver that I was replacing.I had hoped that I would have seen a faster shave but this is not the case.If you have a full beard you will need to work at shaving with the shaver ES8103S. I am still in the market for a new shaver.One final point the new shaver feels very light and delicate not like the older model.I am curious how much abuse the ES8103S will be able to handle with extended use.</li>
            <li> This is the same razor as the ES8109 except it doesn&#x27;t have the brass contacts on the back to work with the charging / cleaning station. That said, I found the cleaning station to be kind of useless anyway. Unless you use it all the time you&#x27;ll find that is gets kind of a moldy smell and quite frankly you can clean this razor just as well if not better with soap and water than the cleaning station can. I purchased the whole razor since it wasn&#x27;t much more money that a couple of new blade and foil sets. At the same time it&#x27;s considerably less money than the ES8109. The razor does a good job although I find that it doesn&#x27;t do a great job on your neck. As well the attached hair trimmer option is just &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34;. All in all a good electric razor that I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Great price.  Works very well wet or dry.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great shave</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver as a Christmas present for my husband.&lt;br /&gt;It replaced his older Panasonic. My husband loves this shaver, it&#x27;s great for his skin. Which he has sensitive skin with no breakouts thanks to this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I did lots of comparing and honestly no one really &amp;#34;needs&amp;#34; those self cleaning shavers. He had that previously and it was such a hassle and more money for cleaners.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great shaver when compared to the rest.&lt;br /&gt;So happy I bought it :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;Hubby loves this razor so much I&#x27;m buying him a new one for Christmas. He broke the sideburn trimmer or whatever it&#x27;s called. He loves this one so much, figured he&#x27;d love it again! :)</li>
            <li> Found this shaver is very good and gives a close shave all over my face and neck like the way it cleans and using it as a wet shaver</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d  used Braun electric razors for 40 years until I was given a Panasonic for Christmas about 8 years ago. It was one that came with a cleaning system. I&#x27;d usually leave the cleaning fluid in too long, so my razor began to smell--to the point that changing the fluid/filter didn&#x27;t get rid of the odor.  My wife was threatening to have me keep my razor outside, when luck would have it...the spring mechanism that holds the blades in place broke. Probably an easy fix, but it gave me an excuse to buy a new razor. I didn&#x27;t want one with a cleaning system...way overpriced gimmick if you ask me. So I bought this one. Amazing. Shaves close. Very quiet.&lt;br /&gt;On the downside, the grip isn&#x27;t quite as nice. More plastic.  And it requires a cord with an ac converter on the end (the old panasonic had it built in). But it holds a charge longer, and I swear shaves better.  Would highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I used to use a Norelco and switched to this based on the good reviews and price.  It does allow you to shave very close...closer than my Norelco did.  I have noticed however that it takes multiple passes over the same spot to get the hairs cut all the way down.  I also found that it feels much warmer, almost hot, as it passes over my skin.  That&#x27;s probably due to the high speed of the head as it rubs against the very thin foil.  If you use it wet, it probably wouldn&#x27;t feel so hot, but I&#x27;m used to shaving dry and not having to mess with shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a very good shaver at the discounted price under $100.</li>
            <li> This is my first time to use an electric razor in 40 yrs of shaving with lather. I picked this panasonic razor based on a rating where a guy said he&#x27;d been using electric for many years and this was the closest shave he had had. Since it&#x27;s a wet dry I can lather up wet me face and use it on the go mostly. Nothing&#x27;s as close as a razor shave but this one is very close and feels nice and balanced in my hand. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I had an older model that was a really good razor. It was worn out after over ten years of service. This is a current model of my old razor  and is working fine. It shaves as close as a razor.</li>
            <li> I got this product three days ago and this are my observations:    PROS:  Good for my skin (I have sensitive skin and this product didn&#x27;t cause any irritation.  Can be use both, wet and dry.  Indicates the power level as ¡00%. 90% Etc.  Battery charge in one hour.     CONS:  Cannot be use with the power cord attach (you need to use the battery).   Is not as good when shaving corners and Adam&#x27;s apple. I use my old Phillips for this purpose.   Battery does not last long (but it charges in an hour).  Not as good if your bear is longer that 3 days.    Conclusion: Still a good product, I use to be able to shave two times a week, with this product I can shave more often since is good with my skin.    Update: I am happy with it, it is not perfect, but does the job.  As I said before, is not ss good for a long bear.  You may want to shave often if you want to have a good shaving experience.</li>
            <li> delivered faster than promised. excellent condition, shaves as close as a triple regular blade. very easy to use and hold. better than my old norelco. easier to get under chin, nose , &amp; neck.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to minimize time for shaving   Panasonic is a good brand too   However, it is not powerful if you have not shaved for a couple of days   That was an unpleasant surprise</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Brauns, Norelcos and Remingtons and it usually takes weeks for an electric razor to shave closely but this one was close from the first shave.  I tend to be hard on things so I had to adjust to the light touch of the razor and not push it too hard as I shave.  Great design and it cleans with water quickly and easily.  Charges fast.   I can&#x27;t think of anything negative to say about the razor.</li>
            <li> Best shaver I have ever owned.  I think it shaves as well as the Braun and you don&#x27;t have to pay for cleaning solution.  Great buy for the money!</li>
            <li> I very much like this shaver. I ordered this after reading reviews of a number of men with extra heavy beards got close shaves with this shaver (my beard is like having a wire brush growing out of my face; I have to keep it shaved or my boss might use my face to sand the hardwood floors we refinish to save on the cost of sanding belts) Just kidding, maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get the best shave with this Panasonic ES8103S I have ever gotten (excepting a blade)! It isn&#x27;t very noisy. Fits well in the hand. Easy to maneuver into the hard to reach areas of the face and jaw. Easy to clean. Very fast recharging (one hour maximum)! Glides easily across the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replacement foils and blade cartridges are not too bad in price (around $30 or less).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My criticisms are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;The posting on Amazon is misleading. In the product description the last line says, \\&quot;When you&#x27;re done shaving, simply rinse clean under water, click the shaver into the HydraCleanTM dock, and your razor will be ready the next morning.\\&quot; There is no HydraClean Dock included in this package. Product packaging does not show the HydraClean Dock is available as an accessory. To get the HydraClean Dock with this shaver you need to order model ES8109S (for an additional $60).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I selected this shaver believing it included the HydraClean Dock and wanted that feature. I am not going to return because Amazon can&#x27;t write accurate descriptions in this case. This is \\&quot;good enough.\\&quot; I don&#x27;t think the HydraClean Dock is worth an additional $60 to the cost of this shaving system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other point is Panasonic doesn&#x27;t describe enough about the battery care.&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Rechargeable batteries need attention to how you care and charge them to give you the longest useful life. Most rechargeables require a long initial charge to ensure the battery will work well.&lt;br /&gt;* Panasonic doesn&#x27;t give any information about the initial charge only simply saying the battery takes a maximum time of one hour to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;* The shaver should have been allowed to run while plugged in (as the recharger is in the outlet plug to the wall socket and other, less expensive brands/models do so).&lt;br /&gt;* There is no specific statement that the shaver, while recharging, cannot be \\&quot;overcharged\\&quot; (another way rechargeable batteries useful life can be shortened).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Researching the Panasonic website doesn&#x27;t provide any answers to the about points either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will see how long this shaver actually lasts. I am very happy with the purchase at present.lowed to run while plugged in (as the recharger is in the outlet plug to the wall socket and other, less expensive brands/models do so).  * There is no specific statement that the shaver, while recharging, cannot be \\&quot;overcharged\\&quot; (another way rechargeable batteries useful life can be shortened).

            <li> This razor is horrible. it leaves so much hair on my face and I have to go over it with a razor blade. Lost all my trust in Panasonic.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor I have ever bought as far as the actual razor goes...the only reason it got 4 stars instead of 5 was because the &amp;#34;clippers&amp;#34; on the back aren&#x27;t good at all...but the main function is perfect!</li>
            <li> When i first received the product i thought it will not work well on my skin But after couple of times i used it my opinion changed works Great</li>
            <li> This was my first electric shaver. I have always been the lather/blade type, but that takes too long every day. So I figured I would try this out (and it was a daily deal at the time). It does the trick on my facial hair, gets the hair down almost flush with the skin. Obviously not as close as a razor/blade would, but not too far off the mark. Might just be my hair, but occasionally it will pluck hair instead of cut it. And don&#x27;t try to use this to trim other parts of the body... doesn&#x27;t handle contours too well.</li>
            <li> The back trimmer is clumsy, and it drips hair as you are using it</li>
            <li> very good product excellent shave</li>
            <li> So far, after one week, working fine.</li>
            <li> This product gives a very nice shave.  My last shaver was a Braun for about the same price and there is no comparison.  Easy to clean.  I had issues again with UPS, but eventually received the product.</li>
            <li> it works like it should. but the neck and chin are some trouble spots for the shaver but all and all good shaver.</li>
            <li> Love would order another</li>
            <li> I have tried electric razors for decades but they always leave my face raw. This is the first that didn&#x27;t and was a reasonable price. Daily use for7-8 months with no problems at all. Quick charge is great too!</li>
            <li> Love this razor. Easy to clean shaves close. Great price. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> A great razor for those who like electric razors</li>
            <li> Best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had. Don&#x27;t need to say anything else.</li>
            <li> This is the third Panasonic wet/dry razor I have owned in 25 years. I still think it&#x27;s the best electric razor on the market.</li>
            <li> Far superior than all other razors available.&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic really cares to make the design and quality they are known for.&lt;br /&gt;BEST BUY!</li>
            <li> I bought this 2 months to replace my 2 year old Norelco rotary. It&#x27;s fine, but not right for me. I have a pretty light beard, and I got used to how close the Norelco could shave without causing irritation. Perhaps it&#x27;s my fault, but in order to get the same close shave as I got with the Norelco, I have had to keep going over the same area several times with this shaver, which caused irritation on dry shaves. I now do a wet shave every 4th time, to get a really close shave. Part of the irritation may be from the fact that the blades get quite warm on this with dry shaving after 2 or 3 minutes of use. I&#x27;m sure a lot of people prefer foil shavers to rotaries, and that they work well for them. What I can say is that after using this for two months now, my next shaver will be a Norelco.If you are used to Norelco, stick with it would be my advice. Maybe it&#x27;s all in what you are used to.</li>
            <li> Great Shaver, one of the best I have ever owned and would purchase again if this one should die. Thank you</li>
            <li> I got this on my budget and is very useful.&lt;br /&gt;It seamlessly does savings and not having any trouble. I will recommend this product to other</li>
            <li> Fantastic shaver. Extremely quiet shaver but does an excellent job of providing a very close shave. This is my third Panasonic Wet/Dry shaver and is by far the best one. Highly recommend you try it.</li>
            <li> My old Remington, while still running well, has never had a change of blades in 35 years. Since the cost of replacing them is more than the cost of a new electric razor, I began to look for a modern replacement and hit upon this Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually, I shave with a blade and shave cream. But when I tried the new Panasonic on one side of my face after shaving as normal, I could tell the difference - the electric got what the blade missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the razor is simple and effective (a little liquid soap and running water), making it even easier to use. I&#x27;ll stay with my razor blades for now (habit, I suppose), but will be using the Panasonic ES8103S more and more, especially when I travel.</li>
            <li> Works great love the fact that its waterproof can wash it under the sink.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my husband (I borrow it) and it is a very good shave.</li>
            <li> could not get a close shave so I returned it</li>
            <li> greatest shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned !  close shaves !  no complains whatsoever.</li>
            <li> WOW what a shave. This model is worth the price increase over model ES-SL41-S. It shave faster and cleaner. It recharges quickly. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great electric razer and price 100% satisfied!</li>
            <li> This product was a deal of the day, so I grabbed it since I desperately needed a new shaver. I like the style, but it only does an OK job of shaving, and I have to continually go over some areas several times till they finally get fully shaved. It works best if you go in a circular pattern. The thing I like the least is that the clippings have to be cleaned out all the time. At least once per shave. If you don&#x27;t, it&#x27;ll spray clippings all over you. I just love going to work, looking down at my shirt and seeing clipping dust from shaving that morning. Also, it doesn&#x27;t operate while charging. No idea why. Overall it gets the job done, but given the choice between getting another one of these and taking a chance on another type, I&#x27;d try another type.</li>
            <li> Currently owned an older model (ES7035) and was reasonably happy with it. Got this model and the difference is night and DAY.  Thrilled with the quality of the shave using this model</li>
            <li> Ordered this to replace a duplicate razor (dropped in tub while shaving)  Great razor at a great price.  I have a tough beard and this blazes through it.  Only down side is it&#x27;s not impact resistant--blame the operator not the machine....would recommend.</li>
            <li> Great shaver.  I have had many cordless shaver.  This is the best.</li>
            <li> Just started using the Panasonic electric shaver, after using blades for 40 years. I was really surprised to find the shave as close as the blade.  Lot less time used for the same end result</li>
            <li> Works great, especially with Gel.  Easy to clean and dry.  Will irritate skin after a couple passes, especially if lotion or gel is not utilized.</li>
            <li> I had a Braun razor before this and had to buy cleaners every three weeks for it. This razor is better and so easy to clean, without having to buy anything else. I love the razor and it out shaves the Braun.</li>
            <li> Wow. I gave it to my husband after years of using Norelco. Boy, was he glad right from the first use. And I love his smooth face. Best gift ever!</li>
            <li> Panasonic ES8103S is very easy to use . It recharges very quickly..So far so good. Just a little loud. Ping lun zishu yaoqiu zhen teme mafan !!</li>
            <li> It is small but yet very powerful.  It shaves close as a typical racer. For the price this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Good use. Good price. . . With a very comfortable, the next will buy.I highly recommend it! I will recommend my friends</li>
            <li> Have used top of the line Braun and this shaver shaves just as good. Make sure you clean regularly with good mineral oil, such as any baby oil and the foils and cutters will last longer.</li>
            <li> I have the previous model to this one also, es7103. It was a fair shaver but this one blows it away. I guess i have been lucky, every shaver i buy is a little better than the previous one. This shaver may not quit be razor smooth but its damn close. the first time or two my skin had to get a little used to it but that&#x27;s expected. I can now shave my neck area where i have never been able to before with an electric because it caused irritation and was never able to get a clean shave. This one does a good job on the neck, you have to work it a little more because lets face it the neck has some tougher areas. I still use my razor on the neck for now but once i&#x27;m out of blades i probably will not buy anymore.</li>
            <li> I paid the same amount so apples to apples.  I really like this.  I am Asian so I don&#x27;t need to shave every day if I decide to leave a little &amp;#34;shadow&amp;#34;.  This suits me fine.  I received this a couple of months ago and charged it up once.  It has been on 10% for the last week and I&#x27;m trying to run down/condition the battery before its second charge.  I replaced a Braun which was ok, but didn&#x27;t give the same shave quality the same as the charge ran down.  This one leaves my face very smooth.  So far, I really am enjoying this shaver.  I&#x27;ve had a Braun&#x27;s and Panasonic&#x27;s in the past and I think I&#x27;m like the Panasonic&#x27;s suit me better.</li>
            <li> smooth shave 10 days use after full charge would recommend to anyone looking for shaving satisfaction and very quiet performance</li>
            <li> my husband was looking for a wet dry chaver.  this one is really nice and the price is great. order automatic shaver head shipments too.</li>
            <li> so far excellent shave . I have pretty coarse beard and the ES8103S is doing the job even if I skip a day</li>
            <li> Cleaner shave than any of my prior electric shavers. Quick and comfortable and holds its charge well. The high-speed cleaning feature is a nice addition.</li>
            <li> My husband found this both uncomfortable (scrapes and burns) and ineffective after having used a rotary shaver.  He returned it.</li>
            <li> When i bought it and started using it it went well gave a smooth shave then after a while of using it the foils stared to wear out so i bought the inner and outer foil and when bad very quick this time and i really got pissed off, threw the whole thing away, thank you panasonic for being a cheap bastard for quality of your products</li>
            <li> This is the first electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used, but have been curious about getting one for quite some time. After reading the mostly positive reviews, I decided to purchase this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one good thing I&#x27;ll say about this unit is how easy it is to clean. The head snaps on and off, and from there it&#x27;s simply rinse with hot water. Snap the head back on, and you&#x27;re good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual shaving, however, leaves MUCH to be desired. I will come right out and say no...this is nowhere near as close a shave as an actual razor. You have to angle and maneuver this thing every which way to get anything close to a close cut. It&#x27;s not a simple up and down...its up, down, left, right, diagonal, repeat. No time is saved with this product. I&#x27;ve also nicked myself a few times with this thing too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product very steadily for a few weeks, and I really regret purchasing this Panasonic electric razor. I&#x27;m pretty sure I can no longer get a refund, which is understandable, but I also in good conscience can&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone. Maybe it works great for others, but definitely not for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor knowing I like the other kind of head better but if you aren&#x27;t in any hurry and are willing to go over the same spot 100 times it works.</li>
            <li> I have had a Remington and a Braun over the past few years.  Decided to try this one and am very glad I did.  The shave is the closest yet, and the razor works very quickly.  It is very light and comfortable to hold.  The battery goes longer between charges than the other razors, and I like the indicator telling you how much battery is still left.  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> excellent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is as shown in the description, I loved it and fulfilled my expectations. I recommend the purchase. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I like this shaver very much. Easy to clean after use and it cuts very close. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a mid price range shaver.</li>
            <li> works great, best electric shaver I ever used.</li>
            <li> A fine shaver at a decent price.  I am finally retiring a 10-year-old Panasonic because its battery is not holding much charge.  This new one shaves close a bit quicker, and is easier to clean using a bit of liquid soap and warm water.  Easy to hold.  I wish the edge-trimmer blade was on the same side as the on-off button, but that is a personal thing.</li>
            <li> Great electric razor, fast recharge, keeps its charge for a long time, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling like I just got burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried it wet with shaving cream once, and I feel like if I&#x27;m going through that much effort, a razor blade is just better hands-down.</li>
            <li> I have the luck to try both the highly rated Braun 3Series 380S-4 Wet &amp; Dry Shaver AND this Panasonic.  One of the two works well but the other not so much.  But faces and facial hair vary too, another factor manufacturers have in their favor.  I have thin, fine facial hair. If allowed to grow longer it curves at an angle then I can have trouble.  So I am shaving clean my neck, chin and mustache area as I want neither a mustache or beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using both for 90 days separately the Panasonic was clearly the closer and more effective shave.  I had to rake the Braun over my face over and over again.  Where the Panasonic cuts much closer.  No contest.</li>
            <li> Works fine but takes 4 times as long to shave than razor.  I bought it to break a habit of shaving in shower and wasting water.  Charges quick.  Good for several shaves.  Saves water unless you plan on using it in the shower (then you will need a big water tank).</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband after reading all the positive reviews about it. He loves it! He says it&#x27;s the best electric shaver he&#x27;s ever used. It&#x27;s easy to handle, easy to keep clean and has a good battery life. It was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I did not think such a close shave was possible with an electric razor.  I could not be more pleased at the performance and value.</li>
            <li> Not as impressive as I&#x27;d hoped. It works well but if you miss a day it&#x27;s not as easy. Particularly around the neck. Good razor but won&#x27;t be replacing my manual razor permanently.</li>
            <li> Exactly as ordered.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I bought this razor to replace one I had for 25 years. It is amazing; it does everything the description said it would do. The fact that you can use shaving cream, gel or nothing and you can use it in the shower- there isn&#x27;t anything it can&#x27;t do! It is easy to clean and charge. It indicates how much power remains and it charges quickly. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> VERY QUIET AND SHAVES FAST.  GREAT PRODUCT.  Just ordered a second one.</li>
            <li> I owned a Remington few years back, but quit using it because it was a pain to clean and the foils did not last that long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again I have become tired of using a razor and shaving cream. The reviews seemed pretty good, so I gave this one a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is not a bad electronic shaver thingy. However, if I don&#x27;t shave with it at least every other day it is more hassle than a razor with shaving cream. Any whiskers older than two days are quite rebellious to the shaving attempts made by the Panasonic ES8103S. It does not take kindly to facial hair that lays down, especially those on the under the chin area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I like it... that is if I use it at least every other day. I want quick fast shave in the morning, to mitigate the process of using razor and cream. But, if I go longer than a few days, it takes longer to shave with the ES8103S than with a razor and cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still using this item after about 3 months or so, the battery has held up well so far, and the foil does not seem very warn. I reckon I will be able to use it for quite a while before I have to replace the blades and foil. This brings me to another point. The foil and blades are so much more cheaper for this unit than the quad blade max quintuple face lift lawn mower style electric razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you plan on shaving at least every other day, want low cost replacement foil/blades, and are satisfied with a 80% clean shave, this is probably great bargain.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor!</li>
            <li> With age the battery begins to lose capacity as with all such devices. It gives a reasonable shave. Not the best but quite adequate.</li>
            <li> I am a 77 year old man who is very pleased with this shaver.  It delivers a very smooth shave and it does it in less time than the Norelco I used for years.  I am impressed with the fact that it has a&lt;br /&gt;lithium battery and lets me know how much charge is left at the end of my shave.  I am not interested in using it in the shower, but still pleased that I can rinse it under the faucet to clean it.  Have already recommended it to a son of mine.</li>
            <li> I bought this over a year ago and it has worked great. I used to you a different brand, but after using the Panasonic I won&#x27;t change back.</li>
            <li> Works. No real complaints.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to shave quite as well as my old panasonic from years ago.</li>
            <li> The hubby loves it so far, no complaints.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver. I bought this because there was an Amazon coupon to try out. So far this electric shaver is the best. I just wish I tried this sooner. I&#x27;m throwing away my razors. This shaves a lot cleaner, more comfortable, deeper, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about cuts. Better than anything razor I have used before. I will be getting my wife one too.</li>
            <li> What a shave and a great razor for the price.</li>
            <li> I have used Remington electric razors for decades going back to a few of the corded type. I have had two other brands, the last one with the expensive cleaning cartridge system. The foil got a hole in it so tossed it and bought this Panasonic which I have had for about 4-5 years now. I like it the best on any I have had plus it has an easy to use pop out trimmer.  This is my first wet/dry shaver so I shave mostly in the shower with glycerin bar soap which I also use for bathing.&lt;br /&gt;I wrote this tip in another Amazon area to advise on keeping the razor blades sharp as long as possible:  I always clean my razor after every use. Remove the foil and shake the water out of the blades, then blot the blades on a dry towel--do not rub dry. Then activate the high speed mode to finish the drying. I keep the foil off until next use. The reason for all this is to reduce oxidation of the blades sharp edges. Oxidation is a slow process that prematurely dulls any sharp steel edge when wet. You normally see this as traces of rust but stainless won&#x27;t show you this and process takes longer but does happen. This is true of your electric razor or throwaway razor. Do your own research. You should not keep the razor in the humid shower stall between use. Last, I would not remove the blades unless replacing them because they have seated themselves with the foil and reversing may render a less close shave.&lt;br /&gt;I recently gave it it&#x27;s first tune up with new foil and blades, the display still operates like new and now the shaver does too.&lt;br /&gt;Someone wrote that the razor will shave while charging--it will not but charges rapidly.</li>
            <li> Very good. And I feel that this is the best that you can find with this price.</li>
            <li> My husband had not tried electric in a decade. I bought it for him for Father&#x27;s day. He loves it!! I hope it lasts a good long time.</li>
            <li> I have this razor for over year and a half and still works perfectly. Must buy</li>
            <li> I have owned this for more than 4 years now.  It is still holding up pretty well.  The only thing that is wearing out is the part that display the remaining battery level.  I had to look from an angle to tell how much is left. The best thing I love it about it is that I can do wet shave with it.  SO MUCH more comfortable than my old Philips Norelco dry shaver. It gives a close shave but you need to replace the blade to continue to get that result.  I replaced every 1.5 years and but replacing it every year is probably not an overkill.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a reasonable priced electric razor that would still get the job done.  This has worked perfectly for me so far.  The shave is close for an electric razor not perfect but better than any other electric razor and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like a non electric one.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;You purchased this item on February 28, 2013.\\&quot;    That&#x27;s right. Today is December 7th, 2014, and I&#x27;m just now writing a review for this product. Almost two years after purchasing this product, shaving at least 5-7 times per week, I have yet to find one complaint about this product. The blades last for a long time. The battery is still working great. The shaver itself is built like a tank. The dang thing just won&#x27;t stop working! This shaver is better than some $200 shavers I&#x27;ve owned!    If you&#x27;re in the market for an electric shaver, just buy this one. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Best Shaver I Have Ever Used !!!!!</li>
            <li> After exploring my choices, and reading the reviews for many electric shavers, I decided to go with this Panasonic. Just like many have found out, this is a really good shaver. I shave everyday just to keep it very close, but I could go every other day with this shaver. It is the closest shave next to my Gillette Pro-glide, which I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using for a very long time now, hopefully if all goes well with the longevity of this Panasonic. I am very pleased, and would recommend it to everyone. It&#x27;s a joy to use and charges very fast...battery last long also, like 9 full shaves. Charges in about 40-50 minutes to 100%. Especially at the price now, it is a REAL steal IMO.</li>
            <li> item was as described and was shipped promptly</li>
            <li> I bought this almost 2 1/2 years ago &amp;  just ordered new blades &amp; foil. What a great shaver, I should have ordered the new blades &amp; foil several months ago, but it still shaves very well, it will just be more comfortable. It still holds a charge for a week or more &amp; I still get 6 to 8 good shaves from it, so buying the new blades &amp; foil make this a bargain, almost like getting a new shaver for less than 1/2 price.</li>
            <li> Due to the high cost of replacement razors for Gillette Fusion and the inevitable nicks and cuts that come from using even very good cartridge razors, I started looking around for an electric razor.  The price on this Panasonic made it a low risk option to try after ~20 years of shaving with Gillette cartridge razors.  There is definitely an adjustment period switching to an electric razor, and I had to fight through a week of skin irritation on my neck and chin.  But after getting through that unpleasantness I have had a very good shaving experience with this razor.  I have tried it both dry and with shaving cream, but always after a shower and washing with a scrubbing face wash.  I prefer the wet shave; it actually seems to go a little faster than dry although it definitely takes a little longer than shaving with the Fusion.  The best part is I haven&#x27;t cut my upper lip since I&#x27;ve started using this razor.  The battery doesn&#x27;t last as long for me as some have suggested.  I only get about 5 shaves before it needs a charge, which still isn&#x27;t bad in my book.  Hopefully the battery does not wear out too quickly.  Update November 2011: After about 10 months using the Panasonic I&#x27;ve decided to try a Merkur safety razor.  The electric is still superior to the cartridges in that I haven&#x27;t had the cuts and ingrown hairs I experienced with the Fusion and I have already come out ahead on the cost.  But I do find that I have to touch up on my Adam&#x27;s apple with a disposable.  I&#x27;ll give the safety razors a try but will have this as a fallback option as I continue the quest for the perfect shave (which may not exist!)</li>
            <li> I had previously owned a Panasonic linear shaver and that is why I purchased this one.  This one is even better.  It gives a close shave, has a very nice grip, plus it has a battery life indicator.  I charged the unit in about an hour on Christmas morning and then I used the shaver for 16 straight days before the charge indicator showed 10% remaining.  It has a cleaning mode that is activated by holding down the power switch for about 2 seconds.  Since it is a wet or dry shaver I simply hold it under cold running water and turn on cleaning mode.  They do not recommend cleaning under hot water.  You can not go wrong purchasing this shaver for less than half it&#x27;s suggested retail.</li>
            <li> UPDATE June 2014 - Over three years later this razor is still going strong and shaving close!  Never replaced blades, just use the integrated cleaning feature - absolutely amazing.  Only get about 6 - 8 shaves out of a full charge since the batteries are aging but that&#x27;s still only charging once a week.  Looks like the price has increased a bit but this is still better than razors costing 2-4 times as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for a wet/dry for fifty bucks but this is the best shaver I&#x27;ve had.  It&#x27;s faster, smoother, closer and gentler than the other Panasonics, Norelco 3 head rotary wet/dry or Brauns that I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ultrasonic self cleaning works great and it&#x27;s even quieter than the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to really think hard and come up with a negative it would be that the battery life could be longer.  I get 8-10 three minute shaves out of a full charge.</li>
            <li> Received my shaver yesterday, charged it overnight and was ready to go this morning   Shaver shaved my face with ease no problems there. When it came to my neck i had to use a combo of this shaver, flip up buzzer and hand razor. i dont have a thick beard at all and shave about twice a week. The clean up was simple, love the wet dry feature for cleaning but i am not to happy about the neck area. I will try again and see how it does on the neck</li>
            <li> This is a good product. It is affordable and is a good deal for the $80. It feels like it is made to last. It charges quickly. With some lectric shave I have been getting very close shaves. It is a breeze to clean, dont waste your money on the self cleaner.</li>
            <li> This is a very good shaver as it can reach places under your nose and around your neck that a razor with the three spinning blades are unable to cleanly shave.   Have not tried the wet shaving feature. Will try soon.  After a month the blades are still sharp, but a small change in the quality of the shave vs. the first out of the box.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t decide which electric shaver has what you need without breaking the bank??? Do you want all the bells and whistles like shooting soothing shave gel on your pretty face while taking a shower or more doo-dads than a swiss army knife...MOVE ON FOLKS!!!!! There is no super shaver out there, unless you find it at a firesale or craigslist (Do you want a deal that bad?!?), that does all those things for less than 100 bucks. If you&#x27;re looking for a relatively inexpensive quality shaver then put this on your list. The question is, does your face like linear shavers like this one, Norelco type tripple circular floating blades or some other fangled contraption? But that&#x27;s assuming your face can even handle an electric shaver at all.     I have only had it a short time but it&#x27;s a great shaver and the replacements won&#x27;t break the bank. It saves me the hassle of using a traditional blade and seems to be of decent quality for the price. You save on replacements in exchange for a less fancy shave. It works for me and does the job.    This shaver has linear blades and a foil screen that are recommended to be replaced every 6 months to a year and cost under 27 a set here on Amazon. [[ASIN:B001J6O0JG Panasonic WES9013PC Combo Replacement Shaver Foil and Blade Set]] The Norelco type shavers need to be replaced 2-3 times per year and cost roughly the same if purchased again, here on Amazon. [[ASIN:B001AJ8YGC Philips Norelco 7340 Men&#x27;s Shaving System]] The key is shopping online for blades and parts because if you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll end up spending the price of the shaver or more for each replacement set. I know because I had a Norelco shaver  3 or 4 years ago and by the time I realized I could have paid a lot less online for the OVERPRICED replacements, my model was discontinued and the price was expensive no matter where I went. Please don&#x27;t make the mistake of buying a shaver without knowing it&#x27;s repair/replacement costs and where to buy them for the best deal. That is no more sillythan finding a great deal on a BMW and finding out you can&#x27;t afford to fix it. The one thing you have to keep in mind with this unit is DON&#x27;T LOOSE THE POWER CORD!!! It&#x27;s a great little shaver but it is meant to be used until dead some years down the road and thrown away. It may last 5 or 10 years if you&#x27;re lucky enough to have replacement parts that long but if you are careful not to leave it somewhere when out of town, then you should have nothing to worry about.     ***( Just keep in mind that all shavers are meant to be discarded over time and replacement parts are normally priced extravagantly no matter what shaver you get, so don&#x27;t pass this shaver by just because of the cord issue, this is an industry reality)***</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this shaver.  It is more expensive than some other shavers, but is worth it (after all, you will use it every day).  It cuts closer than any other shaver that I have ever used, fits the hand well, and cleans easily.  Being able to use it in the shower is very handy.  I will buy another when my present one dies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this and other Panasonics for years, and they&#x27;re the best electrics I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m pretty compulsive about shaving - I want my face to feel as if hair has never grown on it. The option to use Panasonics wet with shaving cream provides remarkably close shaves with little irritation. The \\&quot;linear\\&quot; feature on their higher-end models is excellent, moving the blade so fast that the the beard seems to evaporate. I&#x27;ve used Brauns and Remingtons in the past - and liked them - but my first Panasonic made me a convert, and the upgrade to linear deepened my enthusiasm. The curving, pivoting, \\&quot;soft\\&quot; shaving head makes it conform to various parts of the face with minimal irritation. When you need precision, a switch lets you lock the head. As electric shavers go, it&#x27;s pretty quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned this shaver for, maybe, 2 years. It just died. All the others I&#x27;ve used have also died dismayingly quickly. My guess: that&#x27;s the price you pay for using it with water. Replacing them so often makes Panasonic an expensive option. On this model, the little display screen is poorly thought out. It flashes icons that are not explained in the owner&#x27;s manual. Suddenly, a little faucet with a drip appears. What does it mean? Am I supposed to do something? The owner&#x27;s manual gives no clue. The screen also began to malfunction pretty quickly. It died completely a week or so before the shaver croaked. There is no option to use the shaver with a cord, so if it runs out of juice, you can&#x27;t plug it in and continue. But - five or ten minutes of charging will be enough to let you finish - and a complete charge is pretty quick, too. Like other such models, the cleaning base is a nuisance and, to my mind, a negative rather than a positive. If you go on a trip, you have to pack the bulky base, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later:  I bought another one. 49 weeks after I purchased it, it has died, too. I think I&#x27;m going to switch back to a dry-only brand. This frequent replacement is silly. Also: Amazon gives me no information on warrantee, so I don&#x27;t know if I can get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still later:  I told the company that I was dismayed by the early death of my shaver.  They contacted me immediately and sent me a new one - an upgrade, even.  I&#x27;m bad with time, so I don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;s been working, but I continue to love these electrics.</li>
            <li> Ive always had Rotary Norelcos and wanted to try a diff kind. This Panasonic had great reviews and was on sale half price.    Ive Used it for 3 weeks now and it works great.  Much smoother shave than with the Rotarys, cleans easily, and I have used it 8 times before it  needs to be charged.  Charge percentage indicator is a plus.    Great buy. 4 stars, only negative to me so far is that I cant seem to get a straight line shave precise just under my side burns..prob user error..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a bit more than a month now. At first I was delighted with it, but gradually noticed that it takes repeated passes to give a really close shave. It is very noisy, and the high pitched whine can be annoying. The shaving head gets a bit warm, though not enough to burn the skin. It does have trouble with neck hair, though persistence will get the neck smooth. I like the looks of the razor, the hand comfort, the cleaning process, and the displays. One charge lasts about a week. I have not used it wet, as I only dry shave, so I don&#x27;t know how it performs with a wet shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum...After using it for several months, I decided to try it with a wet shave. So I wet my face, dabbed some shaving cream on, and was pleasantly surprised to get a smoother, more comfortable shave. I had never before done wet shaving with an electric shaver, but will continue doing so now. So as a dry shaver, I&#x27;d rate this one three stars, but as a wet shaver five stars. Thus I average it out at four.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum after using it a year and a half.....Well, now I actually regret buying this razor. The reason is that the longer I used it, the noisier it has become, until now the noise is extremely aggravating. It still shaves well as a wet shaver. But it is by far the loudest razor I have ever used!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum...Now after using this razor over two years, I am trashing it. The reason....it has now become so noisy that I can no longer stand it.</li>
            <li> I bought this newer Panasonic shaver because the cost of replacing the foil and blades of my previous  5-blade Panasonic cost almost as much as this new, less expensive shaver.    The shave takes a little longer than the higher-end unit, but that&#x27;s OK. What I am NOT happy about is that water has leaked into the LED display in just two months of use. I shave in the shower and then rinse the shaver under the showerhead - nothing contrary to instructions.    What bums me is that I have to pay the return shipping and wait for two weeks for Panasonic to replace the unit.</li>
            <li> I wanted a Panasonic Shaver because I have had good luck with Panasonic products. It was hard to decide which Panasonic Shaver to buy from Amazon because there are so many models to pick from. I picked one that had the features I wanted and was about in the middle of the price range.  I was thinking that maybe I should have spent more, but this one turned out to be the best shaver I have ever owned.  It does an excellent job and actually gives you about 12 shaves before it needs recharging.  I am very happy with it and highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> Pros: Fast &amp; very close shave. Feels good in the hand. Glides easily over face. Easy to clean.    Cons: Trimmer is WAY too small and is at an awkward angle. No induction charger base.    I replaced my obsolete Panasonic ES8097 (which I thought was the best shaver ever) with the ES8103. At first use I didn&#x27;t like it much. It just didn&#x27;t feel as good in my hand but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t rush to review it then. As with any new product there is an adjustment period. Now after getting used to it, I like it as much or more as my old model. I used my old one again and now IT feels strange in my hand. The ES 8103 shaves even faster and closer than my old one. It glides over the face nicely and the closeness of the shave is superb. I would have given it 5 stars if it were not for 2 things: first, for that awkward and WAY too narrow of a trimmer. The wider trimmer that slid straight up on the ES8097 was far superior. The angle on the new trimmer is awkward to use. For those occasions when I have a few days growth, I like to &#x27;pre-shave&#x27; by running the trimmer across my neck and face first to remove the longer hairs before using the shaver head. This is where the wide trimmer really excels. Or when trimming a beard. Secondly, there is no induction charge base. You have to plug the cord into the bottom of the shaver like a tether and let it lay on your counter. The old charger base was so much nicer to use. Just stand the shaver in it and it was ready to go for the next use. Plus, it took up less space on the counter and looked much nicer. I REALLY miss that charger base! If Panasonic would put the pop-up trimmer from the ES 8097 on this shaver and add an induction charger base to this shaver, it would be phenomenal.</li>
            <li> I have used Braun shavers for the past 15 years and always felt they were a quality product. After seeing some of the reviews of the Panasonic shavers over the last 5 years, it was time to try one. This is an absolutely tremendous instrument. It shaves closer than any electric I have ever tried and is very comfortable to use. The motor is much quieter and considerably faster than everything I have experienced. I would highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> Much superior to my OLD Norelco..closer and smooth shave without pinching..love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Panasonic ES8103S electric razor for over a month now and I love it.  When cutting your beard in the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; mode you can&#x27;t tell the difference between a razor blade and the ES8103S.  I have sensitive skins and am a fussy customer when it comes to shavers.  Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had an electric razor for more than 30 years.  Thought it was time to give them a chance.  The Panasonic works good but it isn&#x27;t as close as a razor shave.  That said, I still am using it more than 90% of the time.  I like being able to use it in the shower and contrary to some of the reviews, I haven&#x27;t experienced any problems with it not holding a charge.  The sideburn trimmer is somewhat useless but other than that the razor itself works good.  I&#x27;m not throwing away my razor.</li>
            <li> After two Braun shavers that were good but not special, read the Amazon reviews and decided to try this. I&#x27;ve had it for a month now - needed all that time to familiarize myself adequately - so am finally pretty comfortable with it.    PRO:  Powerful: doesn&#x27;t slow down like the Brauns when shaving 2-day whiskers, especially toward end of charge  Comfortable: hasn&#x27;t ever pulled at a whisker like happened occasionally in the past  Effective: very good (but not great) shave; easily shaves virtually all hairs growing tight against the face, unlike previous frequent exceptions  Long-lasting charge: as claimed, charges last about two weeks with no slow-down toward the end - best I&#x27;ve ever had in this respect; fast charge too  Convenient: readout of charge remaining is nice; blinking \\&quot;charge me\\&quot; icon is convenient  Well made: solid and nothing flimsy here    CON:  Trimmer is small but even worse quite awkward; however, when used it works quite well   While it easily shaves most areas very well, to me it&#x27;s harder to get equally good results on my chin and just under my nose - a bit frustrating  Shaving surface gets just warm enough at times to be slightly uncomfortable    Overall, generally well satisfied and would recommend this to others with the caveat it&#x27;s not perfect (what is?).</li>
            <li> Great razor&lt;br /&gt;In fact just bought another one for myself. It gives a good close shave and is very quite.</li>
            <li> Reliable razor - my first electric. It&#x27;s now been 3 years since purchase and use, and still reliable. Change the blades about once a year, runs wet + dry. Easy to clean, easy to charge. No charging base means less to manage/ more space on my counter top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Sometimes misses hairs under certain spots - looking into the Arc 4 for a good price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver.  It quickly cuts through my beard and leaves my face smooth and with relatively little burn.  While others have commented that its required back-and-forth motion for shaving makes it harder to shave their necks, I have found just the opposite to be true.  While I have to tilt it different directions, I find it ultimately does a better job than my previous razors that used a circular cutting motion.  It charges very quickly and six months in demonstrates no irregular loss of charge.  I would highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a brush to use for cleaning.  I have one from an older razor, but this should be a part of the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I have only used the razor dry.  I cannot speak to its wet shaving capabilities.</li>
            <li> I find modern life pretty empty and pointless without the possibility of a good shave looming in the future like a raccoon under your bed, so I thought I would try an electric Panasonic. Panasonic makes my favorite other electric items like a camera and also a cassette \\&quot;Panasonic Walkman\\&quot; music player that I used to use (with Panasonic \\&quot;tapes\\&quot;) so I decided to try this one. Boy was I!    I especially like the \\&quot;wet/dry\\&quot; aspect ratio of this unit. At first glance I will admit that I was confused and a little alarmed. Why use electricity around water? It seemed hazardous in potential. Also, if you can use it both wet and dry, how would you know which way was best? It seemed like the only thing to do would be to do an experiment, so I proceeded to order the Panasonic and also got a bunch of regular razor blades and, as a control, one straight razor like the barbers used to use, which I got on eBay.    After some sleepless nights I had all my purchases, so I pushed aside my jars of facial pleasurer and lined up the shaving equipment on my bathroom counter. To be totally fair in the process, I thought I should test each razor in both advertised modes, \\&quot;wet\\&quot; and dry. I decided to use water for the wet mode (cheapest) and air for the \\&quot;dry\\&quot; mode (plentiful). First up was the regular razor, which was the generic twin blade kind I get at \\&quot;Pay Cheap.\\&quot; Shaving in dry mode seemed really not the most efficient. It took about eleven passes to get a good shave and an additional nine under my chin to make that area as smooth as I prefer, which is pretty smooth, let me warn you. There was a certain amount of discomfort in this process though and a bit of chafing also, so I waited a few months for that to resolve before trying the twin razor in wet mode. Better! Still couldn&#x27;t help thinking that maybe shaving cream would have been a good idea, but I was on a roll and didn&#x27;t want to start over (chafing!). I next planned to move onto the straight razor but realized I&#x27;d accidentally thrown the whole thing away with the shipping box because it was \\&quot;recycle your boxes\\&quot; week at my local garbage establishment. So I was able to move on to the main contender, the \\&quot;Panasonic\\&quot; with Panasonic technology! In wet mode it seemed to shave my face, and in dry mode it seemed to also shave my face. Both were shaves! Equally competent! And no waiting two months to shave again!    So, in conclusion, wet shaving with a blade might be better with a cream, and wet shaving with an electric Panasonic seems fine, plus it makes a pleasant humming noise to indicate that your hairs are being ground up effectively (use them as fertilizer). Shaving! \\&quot;Save your face for PANASONIC!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Shaver works great have no problems, doesn&#x27;t shave as well in your neck area.  My previous Panasonic had a nice recharge stand this one lays flat, I could have gotten one that has a stand but all they have now is stands that have washers while recharging.</li>
            <li> I bought this blade as a gift for my husband.  Unfortunately, he cannot use it because the blade pulls his hair.  His hair is fairly coarse (which I would say regular man&#x27;s facial hair) but very thick.  It causes pain and discomfort.  The back blade for the sideburns works well.  But it is not for shaving his face.  So, he gave it to me for my feminine use.  I tried it on my legs and arms (my body hair is soft and thin) and it does the job.  Yet, I did not give more stars because this blade is advertised as a man&#x27;s blade.  I will be looking for a replacement for that gift now...</li>
            <li> Just not all it&#x27;s cracked up to be.  Runs out very quickly, not very happy with it. I&#x27;m not recommending this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is my 4th Panasonic razor. I love the close shave, the quick charge, and the overall quality and build of their razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a lot of electric razors in my lifetime and this one is by far the best yet.  I&#x27;ve had it over a year now and am still on the same blades and foil.  I clean it with liquid soap every time I use it and charge it about once a week and it keeps on cutt&#x27;n.  It&#x27;s waterprod and has a sideburns trimmer and the price is right.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I was a forty year Norelco guy. Their steel had gotten so bad that I couldn&#x27;t get a good shave in a year from buying new heads or razor. This panasonic last 3 years or so before it needs new heads, gives a close shave and never caused me a rash, etc. There are so few products today that really measure up that it is a pleasure to fine one this good.</li>
            <li> Hi, did I mention the word BAD TRIMMER?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you rely on the trimmer, (like I did from my 4+ year old Braun), you will ABSOLUTELY HATE the long hair pop-up trimmer on this Panasonic ES8103S.  i don&#x27;t shave for 5+ days, and rely on the trimmer to actually trim off the long hair before I start my shave.  The trimmer on this unit actually pulls out your long hairs more than cutting them off; I couldn&#x27;t believe how terrible it is.  Panasonic should be ashamed at attaching such a sub par piece of junk onto this shaver.  I ordered it without searching the reviews about the pop-up trimmer, boy did I regret it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you DON&#x27;T rely on the long hair pop-up trimmer, it actually does do a pretty close, decent shave, leaving my skin smooth without much irritation.</li>
            <li> Good electric shaver with a great price. I would recommend it. Works better with thin beard hairs in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Have a special needs son, and this razor works great!! Not real loud, gets the job done very easily!! Best buy !!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my father who is blind. Been through three Norelco shavers and they all eventually slow down, and none provide a closer shave than the Panasonic. This shaver is a beast. It cuts fast and clean. The side burn cutter is also amazing. Some great features are the battery level display which shows the percentage of battery life left; the ability to keep plugged in and not over charge (my father is 80 and forgets it all the time); and the water proof feature. Also, it&#x27;s shape is better than the circular shape of most electric shavers. It provides for a realistic shave compared to a razor cut and gets closer around and above the lips. If you are looking for an electric shaver, stop looking, this is it.</li>
            <li> But, this one started better than the others I&#x27;ve had, and after nearly a year, it&#x27;s still holding up better.  Most importantly -- other than pulling hairs occasionally (particularly when battery is low) and missing hairs occasionally (probably at least partly an operator error) -- this one does NOT burn or chafe as badly as my rotary or manual razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this one wins the &amp;#34;best so far&amp;#34; award.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my father of the age of 92.  His eyesight is poor.  I was having to shave him with a regular disposable razor.  At times nicking him.  I bought this for him and shaving is faster, easier and no nicks.  The cleaning is so simple.  You can also use this wet or dry.</li>
            <li> After using an electric shaver for years I needed an upgrade since my previous one will no longer hold a charge.  I liked that this one could be used wet/dry, but it wasn&#x27;t as close of a shave as I had been used to with my old razor.</li>
            <li> My husband shaved in record time. So fast. His face was so smooth. Best shaver he has ever had. He loved this Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> Perfect Shaver provide a close, touchable shave.  The shave is light but very powerful. A very reasonably priced.move smoothly across the skin.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for a family member to give as a Christmas present.  However, I can say the recipient of this gift was very pleaed with it and had great raves about it.  My husband has had one for years and is very please with his razor.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me...I used enough force to burn my skin but did not get a shave even as good as my pretty ordinary shaver gives me. I bought it after going through the reviews. Most of them are 5.</li>
            <li> At 85 decibels this far out shouts other razors...for example ..a norelco triple header at 75 decibels.  So if you are super noise sensitive you may want to get a quieter one. It does a good job. I keep it in the car and can shave and drive. I do not use the complicated cleaning apparatus but instead pour boiling water over blades and head after separating them. It gets them both very clean with no cleaner or fuss....instantly. The same way I monthly clean my houses sewer pipes....just use more water.  I bought this on another account from amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this a few months now, its good.  This razor really does shave wet without losing its edge (I&#x27;m always nervous that wetting metal is bound to dull it quickly) - and it really does shave closely with a small bit of foamy soap rubbed in to the heads, best after a good hot shower so the beard is nice and soft.  Good charge retention and a readout of the remaining charge which is handy.</li>
            <li> Can get at places on the neck that straight razor misses.  Easy to clean and easy to charge.  Charge holds for awhile.</li>
            <li> WHA WHA WHAAAAAA&lt;br /&gt;I blew it on this one. Thought I would be giving my hubby some relief in his morning routine alas, it didn&#x27;t work to his satisfaction. He prefers a much closer shave than this provided.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin i think this would be the perfect machine for you. Razors aren&#x27;t my thing and for my job i have to be clean shaved everyday... it&#x27;s such a drag but with this machine my skin is safe!</li>
            <li> Disappointed. My old razor died and i bought this during the amazon sale for ~50 bucks. It doesnt shave around my jaw line or neck so its just a razor to shave your cheeks. Then i have to use a old school razor to shave my jaw line and neck. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Good shape, fast shave!</li>
            <li> I am a guy who has very thick facial hair. In a day without shaving I have sandpaper for cheeks. However, daily use of this electric razor keeps me looking clean and my face clear.</li>
            <li> Like it so much I recommended it to my son.Light weight,easy to use and you get a close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t sure how this shaver would work with me having a tough beard. This one works great and i would buy it again and again. Really gives a close shave leaving you with a smooth face....</li>
            <li> Very close shave.  Best razor I&#x27;ve bought. Easy to clean and charge.  Recommend it for first time electric shaver users or anyone who wants a replacement.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my husband.  The best thing about it from my standpoint is how quiet it is!  From my husband&#x27;s standpoint, he likes the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li> Took a chance having good success with prior Panasonic shaving products.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a winner. Very comfortable shave with no razor burn and it&#x27;s shaves quickly.</li>
            <li> I needed a new shaver and noticed this was the &amp;#34;Deal of the Day&amp;#34; so I decided to purchase it. Shipped very quick due to being a prime member. I absolutely love this shaver, it charges very fast and leaves a very clean shave no matter how much hair you have. I highly recommend purchasing this shaver!</li>
            <li> One of the best value wet/dry shavers ever made, all the guys in my family have one!</li>
            <li> It works better than most electric shavers I have tried. That being said, there must be something odd with my facial hair as I still have to follow up with a quick dry shave with my razor for touch ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like not having to get my face lathered up and then shave with my razors for a quicker shave, but I would expect it work a little better with my neck and under-jawline areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works way better than any 3 shaving head shavers I have used, those are just worthless on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life seems good, will try to update in another year.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave as well as a safety razor. It misses the fine hair on my neck and I still have use a safety razor. After a year the display went out, but a few months later it came back.</li>
            <li> My favorite shaver I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Has been a work horse shave for several years.  A bit loud and a bit slow, but never a knick.  Typical Panasonic quality item.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this shaver. Quiet and works great</li>
            <li> Have not owned an electric since I was 20 years old or so, now 68, since I never could fine one that worked as well as blade shaving. Then I spotted this one. So far I would rate it excellent. If you use it I would always do same in the wet mode. I also recommend the http://www.amazon.com/Fusion-ProGlide-Clear-Mens-Shaving/dp/B005SPMINY/ref&#x3D;pd_ys_sf_s_rp_a1_3_p?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;04H432MFTYE6ZYTVTXGA. This product as far as I can tell is only available on line. It is much better than their other shave creams since you can see your face.&lt;br /&gt;This Panasonic Electric Shaver is great in all aspects. Easy to use, shaves are great and clean-up is super easy. It charges very quickly and holds a charge well. If you travel I also would add on this item as it is very inexpensive but will protect your razor as it was made for it. Panasonic ES-GFPM2 Men&#x27;s Shaver Storage Case. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I bought this in 2010. Used it for years and thought that a Braun would be better. The Braun had a bigger name and more blah blah to it. the Braun turned out to be a POS. EXPENSIVE DAMNED THING that did not shave good. I recently pulled this out and shaved with it again (face and head) and I felt like I had betrayed an old friend. The biggest names with the most blah blah are not always the best. This shaver is kind to the skin and does a marvelous job. If it were to die on me tomorrow I would buy another. The Braun will stay in a box for a long time until I cannot find another of these. It is light weight and elegant yet does a very manly job of shaving close without damaging my skin. Easy to clean as well. It works so good it is what a shaver would be if Apple made one ;-)</li>
            <li> Great shaver at great value. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver in over 20 years.  Typically I&#x27;ve use double-bladed disposable razors.  I bought this shaver for those few times when I don&#x27;t want to bother doing a &amp;#34;wet shave&amp;#34;.  However, after one month of occasional  usage,  I find that it shaves so well that I may consider making it my &amp;#34;main shaver&amp;#34;.  This razor provides an excellent and  surprisingly comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Simply does not give as close a shave as expected, especially limited on longer hairs of the neck.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t write an essay about how great this razor is but I made this review video, check it out!    [...]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used foil razors and needed a replacement for an old Braun series 5 model. I decided to try the ES-8103s due to the high ratings and significant price difference from the current Braun 5. The Panasonic has been very good in every respect. The shave is close but comfortable. It&#x27;s much quieter than my old razor (not a fair comparison, though, I&#x27;m sure Braun has also improved over the last 10 years). The battery life has been consistent with each shave using 10% of the battery (i.e. up to ten days on one full charge). A full recharge with 10% left takes about 1 hour. It appears solidly built and I&#x27;ve had good service from Panasonic products before so I expect to use it for several years. I factor in the cost of replacement parts when buying. The price of a foil and cutter was reasonable given replacement every 18 to 24 months. The cost of ownership is why I skipped models that use an alcohol cartridge for cleaning the foil and cutter in the base. I&#x27;m happy with the performance and the price was exceptional due to a limited time offer.</li>
            <li> This was and is my first electric shaver.  I have used for years and just replace the head/blades once a year.  Extremely comfortable, reliable, and holds a charge.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Lightweight, easy to use.  Gives a close shave but requires you to go over an area repeatedly.  I like the percentage charge&lt;br /&gt;gauge on the front.  It holds a charge sufficient for a week long use so you can take in on a trip without the charger if you like</li>
            <li> never thought I would have a reason to recommend an electric shaver this is an excellent product no razor burn or pulled hair. my other shavers have been uncomfortable and buzzed loudly like a bunch of  angry hornets which after using felt as though it was angry hornets stinging me. Also does a fine job under the chin.</li>
            <li> great little shaver. great for travel.</li>
            <li> I have tried Philips norelco before this for 18 months. I just assumed a certain quality for electric shaver. But panasonice proved it all wrong. This is simply the best! Easy to maintain, easy to use! With norelco the blade keeps falling off, but here it stays put and even cleans easily with simple tap water. I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This shaver works great and comes with all the function you need. Every aspect of the product is perfect except for its noise.</li>
            <li> I prefer Panasonic razors to the other brands.  I&#x27;ve owned this model for about 5 years now and gave one to my two sons-in-law.  For Christmas now we send rebuild kits (new foil and cutters), one to each of them and one to me, part of our end of year Amazon purchasing.  We all rave about the close, comfortable shaves.  Someday my battery will not recharge sufficiently and I&#x27;ll have to look for another razor.  It will be another Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor and directly compared it to a braun 340 that I have had for a few months.  The Braun was a hand me down so I wanted a fresh new out of the box razor and thought this might be worthwhile.  Overall, if this were my first razor without a frame of reference I think my review would be higher.  In terms of shaving comfort and closeness, this model is very much the same as the Braun with the exception that it does create more neck irritation (at least for me) and the trimmer that comes with it is very weak especially when compared directly to the braun.  So my ultimate solution is to buy a new cartridge for my braun and continue using it and donating this guy to the salvation army.</li>
            <li> After one year now, the razor still runs very well. I have not had a single problem with it, whether I am shaving in or out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I purchased it seeing all the reviews on the amazon and saying it was a cheaper option for a good shaver, but it ruined all my expectations. It says please wait for 30 days so that your skin can adjust to shaver and it has been more than 3 months since I have been using it, and it has never ever given me a perfect shape.&lt;br /&gt;I would strongly advise not to purchase it, as it will be waste of your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying electric shavers for my husband for years--he&#x27;d use whatever--not interested in buying his own.  Changed from the 3-head thing to this type and he actually said it was great. Better type for him.  If you want to buy on a recommendation of it&#x27;s great compared to no comment, then you might want to try this one.</li>
            <li> Gets a close shave, very high power - stays charged for days, and it was a very good price before Christmas. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son for his 16th birthday as his first razor after reading many good reviews.  He states it is easy to use, clean and does a great job.  Still only shaving a couple of times a week so cannot attest to how it would do on a heavier beard but many have said it gives a close shave then as well.  It is a little noisy but no more so than any other electric razor.  This has been a good purchase!</li>
            <li> After reading several reviews and comparing it to its competitor offering in the same range I pulled the trigger on this shaver .&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with this and it really takes care of my daily grooming needs swiftly.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver isn&#x27;t the most silent one And the rechargeable battery is kinda short lived.&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless it works great and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase . I recommend this to anybody looking for a well priced kosher Shaver.</li>
            <li> This is my first modern day panasonic shaver. I have facial hair of medium thickness and have been using electric razors all my adult life(20 yrs) Tried all the brauns starting from the 1990&#x27;s models all the way to their most current 7 series shavers. Loved the braun 6520 (which is now obsolete) but was somewhat disappointed in their new 7 series model when I bought it a year ago. It gave a great shave on the cheeks, mustache, and chin but was ineffective on the jawline and neck area... so I decided since the overall shave wasn&#x27;t good enough I had to try a new brand. And that&#x27;s why I decided to go for this panasonic es8103s last month. I&#x27;ll admit after reading all the positive reviews here I was almost expecting the thing to be perfect when I got it. After using it for about a month I can say that its good but not perfect. It gives a close shave on most areas of the face and quickly. It does get close on the neck but you have to press the foil pretty hard against your neck and do a few repeat passes to get it smooth. On my face the shaver caused no irritation, but because you have to press the foil so hard against your neck skin it can give a slight burning sensation for the next few hours even after lotion is used. But not bad.. It just seems like the cutting blade may be a tad bit too far from the foil and that&#x27;s why you gotta press hard on the foil to get close. Overall this shaver is good for the $70 price, so with the price factored in I&#x27;ll give it 4 stars. I still prefer the braun 6520 foil/trimmer design and its overall shave though even though that one isn&#x27;t perfect either.</li>
            <li> &#x27;m a Black man with very coarse facial hair that grows in multiple directions.  I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for just over 30 days.  It will provide a close shave on my face, jaw line, and neck given enough passes.  However, the extra contact can cause irritation, even when using wet.  Using shaving gel made it less effective for me and didn&#x27;t help reduce irritation.  The shaver also cuts a little too close for me.  I believe I would have fewer ingrown hairs if the foils left the hair a little longer.  Technique is critical, and it will take time to figure out the best way to use it on different parts of your face.&lt;br /&gt;The battery charges quickly and usually gives me 3 to 4 long shaves before recharging.  The unit is very easy to clean -- simply pop off the foil and rinse under the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;The absolute biggest drawback of this shaver is the pop out trimmer.  The blade is too small and the action is pitifully WEAK. I can&#x27;t line up my goatee with it without major effort.  I still have to use my clippers if I want to look clean.</li>
            <li> This was given as a gift.  The person I gave it to likes it very much especially for the convenience in shaving.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my father for Christmas to replace his ancient razor. Seemed like the best value for this type of razor and he likes it and said it was light-weight.</li>
            <li> i got this for my husband and he loves it.&lt;br /&gt;my husband loves it bc if he is in a hurry and can do a dry shave</li>
            <li> I had been using the ES7103S shaver for years and decided not to buy new blades or foil, since the battery was only holding about a 3-shave charge.  Upon receiving the new ES8103S, I immediately noticed how much closer each shave was in the shower.  I have used it for nearly a week and it still has 70% charge.  This ES8103S is much sleeker and lighter than the old model.  Overall, a good shaver and a decent price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric razors about 15 to 20 years ago and they did not get any better.  If you need a clean shave, stick with razors.</li>
            <li> I ordered the unused product. However, the product is arrived at using the trail.There was a razor cut beard.&lt;br /&gt;Also the sealing chamber was removed state.Delivered to the world of discrimination felt as though foreigners.</li>
            <li> I had moderately high hopes for this shaver, and expected it to, at least, shave my face well.  Unfortunately, it does not do so.  I shave once every 2-6 days, and usually will trim all of the hair down with the trimmer prior to shaving, to avoid the hairs getting pulled out.  This shaver, while it eventually can get all the hair off of my face, takes an annoyingly long time to do so (about 10-15 minutes in total, usually), and requires me to go over the same spots many times.  Furthermore, for those with a protruding jawline, you will need to stretch your skin quite a bit to be able to get into those corners, whereas some shavers, regardless of expense, can do a much nicer job of this.  I usually have to essentially scrub my face with this shaver to get solid results, and I didn&#x27;t expect to have to do this.  It leaves my skin more irritated than it should, and turned out to be a downgrade from my much older, less expensive shaver.  My hair is rather thick, though not coarse, so perhaps those with thick hair should be wary of this...idk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note, the shaver is easy to clean, retains a charge fairly well, feels nice, and the blades don&#x27;t appear to be getting any duller.  Nice to have it be waterproof, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for whatever reason, this shaver has poor performance for me, though obviously many others are satisfied.  My product doesn&#x27;t appear to be defective in any way.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;This is a much better shaver than my old Braun.&lt;br /&gt; It will run two weeks on a charge, and charge up in 45 min or so.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great that its waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;after about a year the LCD backlight for the charge level indicator began to fail (intermittent, mostly off).  Not a huge problem as you can kind of see it and it goes so long that it doesn&#x27;t need frequent charging.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer isn&#x27;t very convenient.</li>
            <li> This razor was rated highly in nearly every site that I researched. I was persuaded to step away from the trusty Braun razors I have used for years. I used the razor for 7 days to try to &amp;#34;acclimate&amp;#34; to the razor, but my skin has been broken out like I have never had before. I sent it back to go with another Braun.</li>
            <li> I used it first time in my life, I been hesitating to buy it but after reading good review I go for it and I am glad I made a good choice.</li>
            <li> Great simple electric razor.  Fast charging and great shaves</li>
            <li> *It works. And it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> works great! no burns under neck</li>
            <li> Good shaver for the money. But, must go slowly (multiple times) to catch and cut all whiskers, especially on neck area.</li>
            <li> Been using for over a year now. Great shaver, holds charge still for a very long time. No qualms.</li>
            <li> I was initially concerned moving to an electric razor. Seeing people say they are not as good as regular razors. Seeing people say it takes a month for you to get &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; to it. This meant to me, that you had to get used to a bad shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very surprised. I get a shave 95% as good as a razor on the first shave. Battery life is good, design is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for a similar Panasonic unit that lasted me about years. It was about as cheap to order this new unit at the special price rather than ordering a new battery, head and cutter for the old one. The new one works fine.</li>
            <li> Quick quiet and adequate.</li>
            <li> I like the shaver very much, but I would rather have a charging stand like the previous Panasonic shaver I had for 15 years. Having to plug it in each time is a pain. I&#x27;m happy for the most part.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple of the Panasonic shavers and find they are well built and last for 3-4 years with regular use. When it was time to replace my old one I went for the an upgrade and I&#x27;m happy with the decision. This one has sort of a shock absorber/spring effect and it&#x27;s great on the corners of your jaw and chin areas. I really like the digital read out showing % of charge remaining.</li>
            <li> I admit the line up of available Panasonic razors was intimidating when I started out, so there might even be a better fit for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the wet / dry shave ability is the clincher.  I scoffed at first about the wet shave, no razor could put up with the clogging mess, I thought.  I was wrong.  I&#x27;ve been using this for months and it&#x27;s still the closest, most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  As another reviewer has said, if you have sensitive skin this is the shave for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lather up with my cheap Barbasol shave cream and let this razor do it&#x27;s magic.  Light touch and your beard is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great deal!</li>
            <li> Have used a Norelco for over 30 years...decided to try something different.  Shaver works great - cuts close and smooth, without any &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34; effect.&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint...battery life is so-so</li>
            <li> I have owned this razor for over a year and I still love it.  Dry shaving leaves my beard with little stubble and  wet shaving is as close as a blade.  One charge lasts about 10 days.  Easy to clean by removing blade cover (it snaps on and off) and rinsing under the faucet.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this purchase. This shaver cuts as close as my safety razor. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Miss the charging holder and this one does not shave as closely as the previous Panasonic I owned.</li>
            <li> NICE! i like it, clean close shave safe, fast charge, quiet and smooth!</li>
            <li> Awesome shaver. It lasts many cycles and does a really nice job. I love how it&#x27;s washable too. Super easy to maintain. Glad I finally found something that perfectly meets my needs.</li>
            <li> I call this a &#x27;finishing&#x27; razor because if you have only one day of stubble, this will shave your face to razor-closeness, or even better. Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;It takes a decent amount of shaving for me to achieve that (10+ mins for me), but it&#x27;s convenient. Battery runs out after only a few shaves, but it charges quickly. Very light to pack, feels like it weighs 1/3 of my Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its only flaw is that unlike my trusty Braun, it will not work well on 2-day growth or longer, it just takes too long, and you migt as well break out the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although my Braun can handle any length of stubble, it will never shave as close as this one does. Tradeoffs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takeaway - If you&#x27;re looking for an affordable, wet/dry travel shaver, this is worth looking into. It&#x27;s light and shaves very close.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item on April 25, 2014. I don&#x27;t have any problem. I like it.</li>
            <li> hard to get my neck right, but all and all a good razor.  it gives me a bit of razor burn/rash, but i have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good. And with quick shipment. I received 3days after bought. But it&#x27;s pretty new so I do no know if it is break in the future.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it. As the stay at home girlfriend/ maid I wish it didnt throw hair everywhere. I have noticed it does need to be brushed out every day in order to keep a good performance but it holds a charge for 3-4 days. Going on 3 months of use and its still just as good as the first day. My boyfriend uses it for both his face and his head and he has fairly thick hair. Good purchase</li>
            <li> I owned a few previous shaver but this one is the best Nice and comfortable on the face and pivots nicely. Long battery life as well a simple one hour charge allows about 3 shaves without recharging. Great.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this every week. Works great. Still has to use a regular razor for the real close smooth shaves, but if he forgets to shave this looks just as good!</li>
            <li> This shaver provides a close fairly comfortable shave. The trimmer works nicely. I shave every day and have to recharge it about every two to two-and-one-half weeks. It is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This razor takes getting used to, but, then it is great.  It shaves as close as a blade.  You want go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> Coming from a cheaper brand, which is no longer as efficient after 2 years of use and a blade replacement, I thought I was getting an upgrade after reading all the positive reviews on this brand &amp; model. Wrong! Now I find myself going back to my $45 old shaver (ok a Remington) more often than I would care to admit. The only department where this shaver gets due credit is in that it is easy on the skin. It hardly causes any abrasions. I shall mention though that I only use it dry; I haven&#x27;t tried this in the shower. But I now know I can get an equivalent shaver for 40% less than I paid for this. And I don&#x27;t see myself buying this product again. I will probably buy my old shaver again or try a different brand.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8103S provides a nice dry shave, but it leaves a mess below where you shave.  In my case, my wife constantly reminds me that I am the reason the sink and counter are dirty as there is hair dust all over.</li>
            <li> replaced my previous panasonic shaver, that was over 10 years old and still working fine. The first impressions with this new one are excellent, very smooth on the skin. May not be the best shaver ever built but for this price it is a bargain.</li>
            <li> I upgraded from a rotary shaver, and this works much better. Its not as good as a shaving blade, but thats a given. I did not buy it with the cleaner since its really easy to wash in the sink. You still need to go over some areas repeatedly, making the battery not last as long, but it lasts 4-5 long shaves, so its okay. The wet-dry aspect and optional use of shaving gel are both the best, making it super convenient. My only gripe is that it is quite loud, mostly due to the vibration. Overall a good purchase, but don&#x27;t toss your blades yet for a super close shave on the days you need it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an older guy so I&#x27;ve used lot&#x27;s of brands over the years.Rotary shavers don&#x27;t work for me so i&#x27;ve been using foil types for decades. I tried the Panasonic because the price point on Brauns has gone through the roof. This shaver works great and shaves closer than my last two Brauns. I&#x27;m sold for now. If it last&#x27;s at least 5-6 years I&#x27;ll be sold for good. Being able to replace the battery is another big plus. That&#x27;s all that ever died on my Brauns.</li>
            <li> Bought this approx 2 months ago.  As you can tell from my tag line, got a little caught up in reading all the reviews and variations on the brands, price points, features, etc...   This is the best razor I have ever owned, but lets face it guys, while a little more hassle, nothing competes with a razor shave.  I know some people can not go that route, so this is not a bad alternative.  Does seem to shave a little closer, and it does clean well with a little liquid soap added when rinsing off.  I do have a hard time understanding why anyone would spend more than this...really, its just an electric razor -- a good shave is what I needed, and this is doing the trick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried electric razors periodically over the years hoping to find one that gives a shave relatively comparable to safety or disposable razors.  Inevitably, I&#x27;ve found the electrics notably inferior to blades and have switched back.  Fed up once again with the rising cost of disposable blades, along with the accompanying nicks, cuts, and irritated skin, I decided recently to try the Panasonic ES 8103s based on the strong positive reviews on Amazon.com.  I&#x27;m truly glad I did, and encourage those looking to switch from blades to an electric razor to give the ES8103s serious consideration.    I should note that I have a relatively light beard, so those with heavy beards might want to look for a review of this product by users with similar features.  I also have a mild case of psoriasis, with patches of affected skin near my sideburns and on both sides of my neck near my larynx.  This chronic, genetically inherited skin condition means I have a sensitive face that is prone to razor burn and other shaving-related irritations.  Thus, a clean, close, comfortable shave is particularly important, since nicks and other problems associated with shaving tend to get magnified.    I&#x27;ve used the Panasonic ES 8103s for about two weeks so far, and can honestly report that it has delivered by far the best shave I have ever had, blade or electric.  It&#x27;s easy to use right out of the box.  Just unpack it, plug in the detachable charging cord and when the digital display reads \\&quot;100%\\&quot; it is ready for use.  Right away you will notice a very positive feature: the ES8103s charges very quickly, going from 0% to fully charged in about an hour.  The razor holds a charge (based on my shaving needs) for about a week.       Cleaning is simple.  When the razor needs to be cleaned, a \\&quot;spigot\\&quot; symbol shows in the display.  Press and briefly hold the on/off button until the razor enters the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; mode (a digital indicator will show, plus the blade sound is clearly different), wet the foil (bladecover) under running water, apply liquid hand soap to the foil and allow the razor to clean itself.  The foil is then easily removed by depressing two black buttons on either side of the razor head.  Rinse the now-exposed blades and the foil, and let dry.  Quick, easy, and efficient.    What about the shave?  Five stars.  The razor looks big, but is actually light and well balanced in your hand.  Never mind the few reviews that call attention to what the reviewers perceive as a \\&quot;freakishly large\\&quot; head.  It just looks that way.  I find the ES8103s makes fast, nearly effortless work of my beard.  Virtually no pressure is needed to ensure a very close clean shave.  Even problem areas (just under your nose, for example) are a snap.  The result has been an astonishingly close shave that leaves my face smooth and clean.  The shave it delivers lasts longer than a blade shave.  No bumps.  No nicks.  Absolutely no razor burn.  Best of all, the ES8103s absolutely does not irritate my sensitive skin.  In fact, I swear it does the reverse: it leaves my face so clean and smooth it actually reduces the underlying day-to-day irritation that accompanies mild cases of psoriasis like mine.    The ES8103s simply delivers the best shave I have ever head.  Every time.  If you have sensitive or prone to chronically irritated skin like mine, this product is worth every penny.    PS -- you may note that Amazon shows other users purchasing the WES 9013PC replacement kit (outer foil/inner blade) plus a second inner blade only replacement kit.  Don&#x27;t make the mistake of doing this.  Just get the WES 9013PC replacement kit on its own.  Panasonic recommends replacing the outer foil once a year and the inner blades every OTHER year.  Assuming that&#x27;s right, you won&#x27;t need 2 sets of replacement inner blades.    PROs:  GREAT shave. Zero irritation.  Lightweight razor.  Fast charge.  Easy to use.  Very decent price for the quality of the shave.  Works wet or dry (I have only used it dry).    CONs:None.    USER UPDATE (12-30-2010):  I have now been using this product daily for a month.  I can report no changes necessary to my earlier review, except to say that it takes less time to fully charge than originally reported (30 minutes or less as opposed to 1 hour).  Bottom Line:  Great shave, great price.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I replaced a Panasonic ES-8068 razor because of problems with the pop-up trimmer and it wasn&#x27;t until I started using my new ES-8103S that I realized how worn out my old razor had become.  The new razor is so much lighter in weight and gives such a trouble-free shave that I can&#x27;t wait to use it again.  An all-around great razor for me, I love it.</li>
            <li> Charges quickly enough; I get 10+ shaves from a full-charge.  Shaves are pretty good - best results have been right after a hot shower or with shaving cream.  Shaving after splashing some warm water on the face yields pretty good results too.    Note: if you are switching from using a blade-razor such as Gillette Fusion to using an electric shaver, be aware that the electric generally does not give as close/smooth a shave as the blade-razor.  It took me a week to get used to that.    All-in-all a great razor.  I would buy it, knowing what I know now.</li>
            <li> Bought this shaver when my 11 year Braun finally quit working. I am very impressed. Shaves very close and shaving takes very little time. Unit is very quiet, easy to clean and battery charges quickly. Shaver comes with a fabric bag to store or transport. Wish Panasonic would have spent more money on a case. Bag is too small to store the charging cord. Great service from Amazon.  Got free shipping and a $10.00 rebate.  Noticed that price of the shaver went up $25.00 since I ordered it. Would recommend buying this shaver.</li>
            <li> Edit - July 13 2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this razor for about 18 months and although in its first weeks its job was not that great, I can say that nowadays its performance has been pretty solid. As long as I don&#x27;t grow too much of a beard, I can get a clean face very quickly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m upgrading from my 3 year old Norelco rotary type shaver.  I paid about $60 for it.  It wasn&#x27;t holding a charge and didn&#x27;t shave my neck very well.  I did a lot of research, starting with Consumer Reports&#x27; ratings and a lot of user reviews at Amazon and other sites.  I&#x27;m happy with my choice of the Panasonic ES8103S, and at $53 it&#x27;s a great value.  I was set to pay $150 or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been many comments on battery life.  I have a pretty light beard.  Having used it 8 days, it says 70% charge.  So in my case it looks like I&#x27;ll easily get the 14 three-minute shaves out of one charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to closeness of shave-- the old Norelco left a lot of stray hairs, esp. on the neck.  Not so with this Panasonic.  I only use it dry... have never tried the wet shave option.  I suppose it would be good for someone with a heavier beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some say it&#x27;s noisy.  Well, it would be nice if it were muted a bit.  But hey, it&#x27;s not a blade shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some say it gets uncomfortably hot.  It does get warm, but not at all uncomfortable.  Maybe if I had a heavy beard and took longer to shave it would get hotter, but it seems to get warmed up and not continue getting hotter as I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think a lot of one&#x27;s reaction to the first use of this (or any) electric shaver is affected by what one has been used to.  If it was a blade, it will take some adjustment.  Since I was used to a rotary, it felt comfortable and smooth from day one.</li>
            <li> First, I used safety razors.  Gillette Fusion gave me the fewest scratches--but even then, I could barely shave every day.    Then, I used a Norelco.  I could shave every day, but it left me with a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  Moreover, I still had to use a hefty amount of aftershave (which stung) and lotion, otherwise my face would hurt from irritation.    After a few hours of online research and reading numerous reviews, I bought this shaver.  Differences?    + No more 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  My face actually feels as it I&#x27;d used a safety razor.  No stubble when I go against the direction of the hair.  + Barely any stinging when I apply aftershave.  3 seconds, and then I feel nothing--as if I haven&#x27;t shaved.  + Cleaning the shaver with running water is a plus.  Now there&#x27;s no need to retrieve the tiny brush, and the results are much cleaner.  + It&#x27;s not noisy, despite what I read in other reviews.    I definitely recommend it to everyone looking for a new shaver.</li>
            <li> I have never written a review before...but this was WAY too good not to give credit. I just now used it the first time. Been shaving since 1965, expect for my hippie beard days. Been through all the different blade products and then had a couple of electrics.     NEVER have I had such an easy, quick, comfortable shave...and so smooth. Wow...give the Panasonic engineers credit on this one guys, and I have a fairly tough beard, A+. Period.[[ASIN:B001DNE3KQ Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Rechargeable Linear Pivot Action Shaving System, Silver]]</li>
            <li> Works well,easy to clean and holds charge a long time. No complaints&lt;br /&gt;Love it, looks great. Lots of compliments. Why are a certain number of words required. If i can get my point across in a few words that should be acceptable.</li>
            <li> After shaving with traditional blades all my life, I was using Philips rotary shaver ($40 range) for last few months and always had to struggle around the neck area. When using the Philips rotary I always used to end up with a little bit of irritation in the areas where I had to use the shaver multiple times to get a closer shave. But this shaver does the job in half as many attempts and with almost no irritation whatsoever. I have used it dry twice and with water once and it does the job nicely in both conditions. This is real value for the money spent. Build quality looks and feels fine. And the clipper also works nicely. I wud say: go for it.</li>
            <li> Pro - Battery level display, clean alert; rapid charging process; looks good  Con - Need wash after each wet shave; feels not as powerful as I imagined  This shaver is of good value at sale price.  My last entry-level Braun lasts 6~7 years; will see how this Panasonic serves me.</li>
            <li> After reading all the great reviews, I wanted to love this shaver, honest I did...but, it left too many uncut hairs (used it to shave my noggin). Had to make too many passes over the same spot. Perhaps your experience might be better than mine.</li>
            <li> Gave this product to my teenage son who just started to shave. He loved it. Very easy to use and got it for the best price.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried many types of razors. Electric and all types of blades. I read the reviews on thIs razor, and decided it was worth the try. All I can say is wow!! One of the other reviews said it shaved as close as a blade, and I totally agree. I have used the fusion blade and it does shave close but as with blades they get dull, and can irritate your skin. In my opinion this shaves just as close without irritation, without the need to keep replacing dull blades. I have shaved dry or with afta pre-electric lotion, and like how quick I can get done shaving, without using shave cream and water. If you are like me and have felt like you have tried so many and and are still looking for a satisfying shave, by all means try this one. I think you will be writing a positive review like I just did!</li>
            <li> I need to shave everyday.  This shaver has surprisingly shaved very close.  Shaves close, but doesnt damage your skin.  Just need to get used to shaver.  I wouldnt hesitate in buying this product.</li>
            <li> I was unimpressed initially and considered returning the shaver, but kept seeing Panasonic&#x27;s counsel to give it 30 days for face/shaver adjustment (although it has to be returned within 30 days if dissatisfied). I decieded to work with it, and when I finally used it as a wet shaver, I was amazed at the shave&#x27;s closeness (it&#x27;s my first wet/dry shaver).  The shave isn&#x27;t as good as a razor, but it&#x27;s darn close.  I&#x27;ve shaved for 50 years, mostly with a razor, and I&#x27;ve finally found an electric shaver I like.</li>
            <li> Hey Guys here&#x27;s my 2 cents. I was using dry for about 6 months. FELT GOOD BUT WAS LACKING IN THE NECK AREA FELT I ALWAYS HAD TO GO OVER WITH A RAZOR.       then I decided to lather up with some good ol barbasol. WOW WHAT A DIFFERENCE!!!    FELLS LIKE A BLADE SHAVE NO KIDDING. IM SO IMPRESSED. I WAS GOING TO BUY A NORELCO. BUT NOT ANYMORE.    SO HEED THESE WORDS \\&quot;LATHER UP\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I normally shave with a Braun Series 3 Model 8985, which is a terrific shaver. Because I forgot that shaver on my two-week vacation, I bought the Panasonic at a local Target on sale. After a week, I would say it&#x27;s the equal of the Braun at shaving closeness and comfort. The only negative would be the sound: whereas the Braun has a pleasing hum, the Panasonic sounds more like a giant hornet. It&#x27;s a little irritating when near the ear, which of course isn&#x27;t for very long. Overall, a nice shaver.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used an electric razor after 45 years of various blade systems. The factors that were important to me about this Panasonic were that it is cordless and can be used in the shower. I find that it has taken a couple of weeks to get used to the way it shaves, and now get a close shave without any of the irritation a blade can cause.    I experimented with several pre-shave protocols... dry, wet, light shave oil, light shave oil with Dr. Bonner&#x27;s pepperment oil soap, and just the soap. I didn&#x27;t like the scent of any of the easily available commercial pre-shave preparations. I have found that using the soap on lightly wetted skin is enough lubrication to let the razor move smoothly, and does not clog the razor or foam excessively. There may be better ways to do it, but this works the best for me so far.    The razor charges very quickly, from 10% to 100% in well under an hour. I find it takes me approximately 10%-20% charge per shave, with the biggest variable being if I have not shaved for several days. I am also finding that as I get more familiar with an electric razor it takes less time. I rinse it out after shaving and wipe it off, blow through the foil and the cutters to get rid of most of the water, and leave it open on the counter to finish drying.    I recommend the razor for its ease of use, ergonomic qualities and how well it works. After a fair amount of research it appears to be one of the best values available. Amazon delivered it earlier than expected and packaged appropriately.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a 99 year old man. Alex is completely satisfied with it. I&#x27;ve not gotten any complaints as of today.</li>
            <li> I have a really rough beard and sensitive skin, especially when using an electric shaver in the neck area.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of shavers over the years, Norelco with gel, Braun, etc.  This is by far the best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric, and I&#x27;m using it with cheap Barbasol, not some expensive cream, by the way.  Usually, it takes 30 days of use to acclimate the face to a new electric shaver, but after 3 days, the skin is responding extremely well (even the neck area), as it did upon first use. I&#x27;m not sure what is so incredibly great about this shaver, whether it&#x27;s the nanotechnology that produces a closer shave or if it&#x27;s something else, but I&#x27;ll be using this shaver or another one like it for years to come.</li>
            <li> After a great deal of research and reading reviews on several different razors I decide on the Panasonic ES8103S.  The choice was a good one and exceeded my expectations.  This razor is gentle on the skin no burn marks.  It gives the closest shave of any razor I have owned and I have owned most of the popular brands out there.  I have not tried shaving with lather and water but I get close enough shave dry.  Razor is easy to clean just follow simple directions.  Batery life is good and razor is very comfortable to hold and shave.  As mentioned in other reviews this razor is a little on the loud side but you get use to it and it not bad enough to bother.  I highly reccommend this product.</li>
            <li> I always hated shaving until I got this razor when it was on the deal of the day for 54$. What a great deal, now I shave 2 times a day without any irritation, granted it does not give you the ultimate close shave but for my and my skin it&#x27;s perfect. The batterie life is good for now, 5 days with one charge. Again great razor for the price but don&#x27;t expect the same shave as a 300$ plus razor.</li>
            <li> This razor is very well made and recharges is only one hour. It is unfortunately a bit louder than my Norelcos...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned 6 or 7 electric razors, mostly inexpensive.  This is certainly the best of the lot.  It does well with long and short stubble, and the trimmer is more than adequate.  I don&#x27;t use the &#x27;wet&#x27; option, so I can&#x27;t speak to that.  It does a great job of providing a close shave in a short period of time.  Unlike some other razors, I don&#x27;t have to press down hard to get a close shave.  Honestly, I can&#x27;t imagine a better shaving experience for what I paid ($54.99).  Highly recommended, especially for people who have never had a good razor.</li>
            <li> i like to shop amazon from time to time for its ease and simple website but getting back to this purchase of razor i must say that i am not a happy camper its doesnt perform like its rating i wish i could get my money back on this one</li>
            <li> Excellent item thanks..</li>
            <li> So so. I bought it for my husband but he doesn&#x27;t use it much because it leaves it not well shaved. It takes him forever to shave with this one. If you have a thick beard(like my husband)you probably won&#x27;t be happy with it. If you have just a few hair-you might be satisfied.</li>
            <li> after years with another brand i needed to get a new one. this totally stepped up to the plate. Was a great buy!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for 3 years which is about as much as you should expect for a product that costs $80.00  I&#x27;m searching for a new shaver now but, for the four years I had it, I was very pleased with the performance and battery life.</li>
            <li> Works well to shave my legs, I love it. I would recommend it to other women. I really like the handle and the battery time indicator. Only reason did not give it 5 stars, is you do have to past repeatedly over same areas but it does closest shave of my 3 electric razors that I have owned in my 50+ years.</li>
            <li> I returned it because it ripped up my face!  I do not have &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; skin either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was really heavy and loud and did not come with a base.</li>
            <li> Excellent, close shave &amp; very well built. This product is exactly what was described and expected. I have used Braun, Renmington &amp; Philishave, the Panasonic has been the best!</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for an older weaker razor. I am very pleased. It is easy to clean and gives a great close shave. The only negative is it does not come with a charging stand.</li>
            <li> This razor sucks, it doesn&#x27;t cut the hair very well, and it does not cut the hair on your neck at all.  Save your money!</li>
            <li> i am a first time electric user. so far I am very pleased with the results. my shave is close and comfortable.</li>
            <li> My previous razor was a nice Braun. When it was new 10 years ago. This new Panasonic puts it to shame. It is the smoothest, softest shave of any shave I&#x27;ve every had electric or blade. I&#x27;m stunned how much better this feels than when my Braun was new. If your razor is old, if you&#x27;re considering a new one and thinking (I&#x27;ll just replace the cutters and screen\\&quot; - don&#x27;t. You will thank yourself daily when you use this.    Aside from the close shave, I like the charge meter that lets me know when I need to recharge it so I don&#x27;t wave up and try to shave with a dead battery. It&#x27;s also got a \\&quot;time to clean\\&quot; indicator on the display. Very handy.    I wish I could describe in words for you how smooth this will feel on your skin. But I can&#x27;t so you&#x27;ll just have to get one and feel for yourself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much awesome, but it&#x27;s better used wet then dry bc it kind of irritates my skin when i try to do a quick shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty. And that is all. I have a real beard not some fuzz you need the sun in the background to notice. Fuzz is all this razor was ever built to cut. The actual cutting surface of the head is so small that you have to really work hard to cover your face in any reasonable time. The cutting blades actually dive away from the cutting screen when presented with a strong beard and it doesn&#x27;t even cut the hair much. You have to constantly go over the same area again and again. Went back to my old Remington. Gave the razor to my girfriend and she promptly threw it out after trying it on her legs after a week. Finally, cutting your beard when your skin is hydrated and therefore swollen is not very effective. When you skin dries under normal air humidity your beard comes out and it feels like you have a half-day growth. Totally flawed in every respect.</li>
            <li> The first time i used this shaver it was terrible. It took me 30 minutes to get some stubble off my face and even then it didn&#x27;t do a very good job. But after a couple of weeks of using it, it started to work pretty well, even around the neck and adam&#x27;s apple area.   The battery doesn&#x27;t last very long, but you will always know when it&#x27;s about to run out because of the lcd displaying percent left. This is a nice feature because i&#x27;ve been caught before with a razor out of energy and only half way done with my shave.   I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, just because i&#x27;m still looking for the perfect electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my brother for Christmas and the following day felt his cheeks.  It was definitely not a good clean shave that he can achieve with a manual razor.  Was quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift to myself in 2010, and almost a year later and its working flawlessly.  I&#x27;ve rotated the blades once to be sure that they weren&#x27;t dulling, but I really think I could have gotten another few months out of their original position.  I shave my head with this and can get 2 full face/head shaves off of a single charge and still have 10-20% charge remaining depending on how much growth I had.  It recharges quickly and is easy to clean with simple running water and soap.  For the price and efficacy, I can&#x27;t think of a better razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mixed experience with Panasonic razors - the first one I had was great, the second was pretty mediocre. When I wanted to replace that last one, I was hesitant to get another Panasonic but the reviews seemed better than the other options (except perhaps those the $200+ range) so I took a chance. I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ProCurve gives a really good shave, and that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s really all about. Even working the post-weekend, three-day stubble it went through it quickly, leaving my face very smooth. In the past I&#x27;ve sometimes had to \\&quot;finish up\\&quot; with a blade razor over parts that my old Panasonic didn&#x27;t do well on, but I don&#x27;t have a problem at all with this model. It might be the first razor that I can honestly left my face smoother than a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the quality of the shave, there are a few good things about this razor; it&#x27;s very comfortable and light in the hand, making it easy to maneuver. The head of the unit can be put in to \\&quot;soft\\&quot; mode with a tremendous amount of pivot in two planes of motion, or put in to \\&quot;lock\\&quot; keeping the head perfectly fixed. I find that different parts of my face are best served by using different modes, and it&#x27;s a quick flick of the switch to move from one to the other. The trimmer on this is small but effective, and I appreciate that it flips out a good inch, which makes it easy to see where sideburns or mustaches need to be trimmed. The unit doesn&#x27;t vibrate much at all, and is pretty quiet, though I would still say it&#x27;s going to wake up the spouse if used in a nearby bathroom. And of course I like the fact that it&#x27;s a wet/dry shaver, which makes it good no matter how you like to shave and also it&#x27;s easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I can think of is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a cradle; the one thing I liked about my old Panasonic razor was that it had an inductive charging cradle which was very convenient, and because the charging was inductive it meant the shaver was completely sealed. This unit doesn&#x27;t seem as well sealed, and there may be damage to the power connector over time if exposed to water. One good thing about the charger though is that it is relatively compact, and curiously is almost shelf-like when plugged in to the wall, which allows the razor to sit on top of it while charging, almost as if it were designed that way. I say almost because it&#x27;s not exactly secure there - a bit of a bump might knock it off. If they designed it as a shelf while charging, that was pretty smart but because it&#x27;s flat and the body of the razor is curved it&#x27;s not a perfect fit. Just a little tweak and it would be a perfect shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;d say this was definitely worth the price, and I&#x27;m overall very happy with it so far. It remains to be seen what kind of battery life it has, but if it&#x27;s like my old razor it should go a couple weeks on a charge, which is fine for most business trips. I&#x27;m giving it four stars instead of five only because I feel like, for the price, it should include a cradle, and because of my concern about the charging contacts standing up to rust over a few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After a couple of months and a couple of trips with this razor, I continue to be happy with the purchase. The shave is still among the better I&#x27;ve had from an electric razor and it&#x27;s very comfortable to use. My trips have given me the opportunity to test battery life and I&#x27;d say that overall it&#x27;s a little low - good for probably a week long business trip (shaving every day) or perhaps a two-week vacation (shaving less frequently). I&#x27;m still satisfied with it though, I just need to remind myself to bring the charger if I&#x27;m going on extended business trips.and there may be damage to the power connector over time if exposed to water.

            <li> I have had it for over a year now. Never has it gave me a clean shave. I have balding clippers that i use first then i use this product to finish the rest. Therefore, if Panasonic needs assistance to do its job then its not worth the 80 bucks. Now I am on here once again looking for new clippers.</li>
            <li> Great and so soft/smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used rotary style shavers for years - have burned up 4, that I can remember, mostly if not all Norelco&#x27;s.  This was my first screen style and, cheaper than either the fancier Brauns or another Norelco, this $85 wonder shaves beautifully, cleans easily and apparently would even work in the shower.  Not my style to do that, but whatever.  My only complaint is noise - this thing is loud, but not deafening.  Overall I&#x27;d recommend both on value and performance.  Hopefully the battery will outlast the 1 1/2 years I usually get out of the Norelcos.</li>
            <li> I use this for shaving my head, and it provides a nice close shave. I&#x27;d recommend a pre-shave such as a lotion or the Remington FaceSaver talc. The Shaver Saver is nice to use in between shaves as maintenance. The shaver works perfectly either dry or wet.</li>
            <li> First thing out of the box was to plug in the shaver to charge it.  Attempted to power on the shaver.  Discovered that the shaver does not operate when plugged in.  Based on my previous experiences with rechargeable electric shavers, this was a deal-breaker.  Have no idea whether it shaves well.  It went back into the box for return.  Bought a different make.</li>
            <li> I had to find a shaver good for a senior gentleman  well in his 80&#x27;s.  This is a good product. I usually   find what I want on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Husband was not pleased with the closeness of shave.</li>
            <li> I have been using Panasonic (or National) shavers for a long time. About this ES8103S model:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Has a \\&quot;Soft\\&quot; mode, making shaving more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;2. One time full charge can last for a while. For me it&#x27;s about 2-3 times of shaving per 10% of power used. But I have been using it for only about a month. Maybe it&#x27;s too early to say. I belive any battery will degrade gradually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. When turned on, ES8103S is louder than my another older model ES4026.&lt;br /&gt;2. Doesn&#x27;t allow shaving and charging at the same time. Shaving function is disabled when it&#x27;s being charged. I thought it would, because the charger has a decent length of power cord connected to the shaver. This is a pity. What if the battery is too low to use and there is no time to charge? ES4026 charger does not have a power cord.&lt;br /&gt;3. Doesn&#x27;t come with a brush for cleaning. Some older models have. Cleaning is not as easy as ES4026.</li>
            <li> Packaging was great, item met all my expectations.</li>
            <li> This is my 4th Panasonic razor and I think they&#x27;re great, mainly because the motor is just stronger than what I&#x27;ve experienced in other electrics.  The Panasonic 13,000 RPM motor cuts right through with no grabbing or tugging, whereas my last Braun would freeze up because it wasn&#x27;t powerful enough.  The shave is close and comfortable too and of course you can use it wet, even in the shower if you want.  Don&#x27;t get a Panasonic with the cheaper 10,000 RPM motor.  And don&#x27;t get the docking/charging/cleaning stations that are a waste and force you to buy supplies you don&#x27;t need.  This is very easy to clean and it says when it needs charging, which takes less than an hour.  One charge lasts me over a week.  The only reason I&#x27;ve had four of these is that I&#x27;ll replace the blades once after about 18 months or so, but then 18 months later I&#x27;ll just buy a new one if it&#x27;s a good price.  This one&#x27;s about half as loud and heavy as one from a few years ago.  The only complaint is that the charging indicator isn&#x27;t very accurate.  When it says 10% there&#x27;s still probably over 25% of a charge remaining.  But still, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It does the Job...!I like it due to the close shave and after recharging it last for at least four shaves...</li>
            <li> I am using this as a wet shaver after having used dry shavers for decades.  This shaver shaves closely and painlessly.  The charge lasts fora week and recharges quickly, as advertised. Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have brought one a couple of years before buying another one to travel with. Good battery and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the razor so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is very nearly as close as a Gillette Fusion or Mach 3, no noticeable difference. And much faster. Battery is long-lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build could be better, but for $90 I really have no complaints. It works superbly, that is what counts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this new shaver now for about 8 shaves and it&#x27;s doing great.  This is my 4th electric/rechargeable razor and this is the best one so far.  It shaves through a 1-2 day stubble very easily (admittedly, I don&#x27;t have the thickest facial hair) and after 8 shaves the power is still at 40%.  The nice thing is I notice no drop off in power from 100% charged to the 40%.  For the price this seems like a very nice razor.  It can handle 120 volts or 240, so it&#x27;ll work overseas if you travel without an adapter, too.  Overall, not anything for me to dislike on this and it definitely shaves closer than my older Braun (mid-level price) one that it&#x27;s replacing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this model shaver for many, many years. This purchase is my second one. I don&#x27;t recall when I purchased the first one as it has been many years. It still shaved great but eventually the battery needed recharged too often. I did not hesitate to order a new one. It&#x27;s a great shave.</li>
            <li> I love the clean close shave of a bladed razor like a Gillet, but I always get razor bumps no matter what I do. This gets just as close and leaves my skin baby smooth. It works well on other areas as well. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My Norelco took a dive so I was looking for a new one. For whatever reason  Norelco no longer makes a razor (that i have found) that has a battery indicator count down. Well, this was a deal breaker for me so I started to look around and found this razor on Amazon. The price was right and the ratings were very good.  Once out of the box, I charged it up and got busy on my face.  All I can say is this razor is much better than any Norelco I have owned.  In fact, this is the best electric razor I have ever used.  Granted my last Norelco was an older model but what can I say-this razor rocks!</li>
            <li> Hubby is happy with it!</li>
            <li> So much nicer than the Panasonic it replaced! Shaves smoother, lasts longer and tells me how much battery power is left!</li>
            <li> This is the best of many shavers I have tried.  I usually shave with a blade in the shower, but I wanted a reliable electric that would come close to the blade&#x27;s effectiveness.  The ES8103 does give a very close shave and is easy to use.  Accidental cuts with the blade are a thing of the past! It holds a charge a long time. The floating head feature can be disabled, but I found it to make the shave more comfortable. It says in the instructions that putting extra pressure on the shaver does not increase the effectiveness.  The floating head helps to maintain the correct pressure.  All in all a very good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better razors -need to go over many , many times before I get a half-way decent shave.</li>
            <li> I have never used an electric shaver before purchasing this one.  My primary method of shaving was \\&quot;old school\\&quot; double edge wet shaving with vintage razors.  I grew tired of not being able to take razors in my carry on luggage when I fly.  I seldom check luggage so this became a problem.  I must admit that with a little practice, this shaver gives me a close shave comparable to wet shaving with double edged razors, without the occassional nicks.  This razor is easy to clean, comfortable in the hand, and I can get six to ten days of shaving on a single charge.  Since this is my first electric shaver, I don&#x27;t have any other brands to compare this shaver with, but I am pleased with my purchase and the results it gives me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not your typical men&#x27;s shaver user but I was tired of the pretty coloured ladies shavers that did nothing.  This one is super! Quiet, and works well for me.  I give it 2 thumbs up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27; works ok.. He doesn&#x27;t love it.. but that&#x27;s ok.. I use it  too! I like it.</li>
            <li> Works great for wet shaving and thick beards. Holds a charge for about two-three weeks with every day use (each shave about 4-5 minutes)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a young guy and have always had an issue with irritated skin and ingrown hairs in the neck area. I have tried just about every multiblade razor on the market as well as learning to use old school DE razors (Merkur HD). Success varied with these different approaches with the double edged razor giving me pretty decent results. However, I&#x27;d still have to go digging in my face to retrieve an ingrown hair pretty frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give this particular razor a try after reading some  stellar reviews about them. I got it home, shaved away and woke up the next morning with an irritated face and neck. Worse yet, I developed the same ingrown hairs I&#x27;ve been trying to avoid for years. I decided to change my approach and apply a preshave (Afta pre shave ) lotion and buzz my neck area with an Andis outliner I used for my sideburns instead of shaving with the razor. If cut too short, my stiff neck hairs grow horizontally and then under my skin causing the ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This technique worked like a charm. I honestly don&#x27;t remember the last time I had an irritated face or an ingrown hair. I still don&#x27;t shave everyday, usually 3-4 times a week. If I get lazy and wait more than few days to shave I use the andis outliner as a beard trimmer and mow off the long hair so that the shaver can get the hair in its foils. Since I don&#x27;t shave everyday the blades and foil have lasted this whole time with no noticeable drop in performance. After shaving I rinse it with antibacterial soap and spray the inside with a tiny bit of razor lubricant (Remington shaver saver).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself is holding up fine. The pop up trimmer is still flimsy but I use the outliner for any heavy duty detail work, it&#x27;s adequate in a pinch. Battery performance is still fine, I can get about 10 shaves per charge. My display is holding up great. I know people have had issues with displays going blank after some time, mine has not but I don&#x27;t use the razor wet so that may havesomething to do with it. Overall this has been a great purchase and at this point much cheaper than going with Gillette&#x27;s overpriced cartridges.</li>
            <li> Recharges very quickly.  Two different types of cutters in the head tackle whiskers effectively.  I shave every 2-3 days and this does a good job of mowing my face.</li>
            <li> Everything went fine, cheers</li>
            <li> Pros: Close shave and can be taken into the shower. Works decently dry also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Some hairs are hard to shave due to growth direction. May take multiple runs over area in different directions to get it.</li>
            <li> One star for each month this product worked for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand built in obsolescence, but enough is enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor shaves very mild hair adequately, but not thick or filled  areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to using nothing after using this and 14 other electric razors I&#x27;m going with a beard,  scissors and a mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Panasonic (and others)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll always remember the leaky battery when I think of you,  your products and your company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merry Christmas and happy holidays</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally post reviews, but had to comment on this one...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just recently bought my 2nd one of these in 6 years. My last razor was nearly identical and was given to me as a gift. I had never owned an electric up to that point, so I was skeptical. I really love using a conventional blade razor, so I was not easily converted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up liking the use of both... I kept the conventional for my neck because the electric just didn&#x27;t seem to cut every whisker, and for some reason gave me razor burn. Otherwise, I used the Panasonic on my mustache and cheeks twice a day, for 6 years! It never quit either. I just bought a new one because it was a daily deal that I couldn&#x27;t pass up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great razor for the money - lasts forever!</li>
            <li> This is really a great razor. Works great love the fact that its waterproof can wash it under the sink. Never let me down. Easy to use and charge. Give a great shave every time. Great product from Panasoni.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another model that you may consider is this&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043DMNHS/ref&#x3D;as_li_tl?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;camp&#x3D;1789&amp;creative&#x3D;390957&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B0043DMNHS&amp;linkCode&#x3D;as2&amp;tag&#x3D;hocivfd-20&amp;linkId&#x3D;ESLAPZII6J32VSFX</li>
            <li> Excellent product and get a great shave. The automatic cleaning function works great as well. I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in years. Due to surgery on my neck I need a better way to shave because I couldn&#x27;t look up, down or twist my head while shaving. I thought about buying a much cheaper model because once healed I figured I would go back to a razor. Not now, I get as good as a shave with the Panasonic ES-LA93-K shaver as I do when using a razor and no nicks.</li>
            <li> I had one of these for years and love the Panasonic quality. This one was for my teenage son, it&#x27;s his first one and I believe in starting him off with the best. The fact is works wet is very helpful and the shave is awesome. The battery charges quickly, holds the charge a long time and with yearly replacement of the cutting foils the shaver works well.</li>
            <li> I bought this electric razor for my Dad who is elderly.  I was worried that he might cut himself bad with a bladed razor, so I got him this.  The razor works very well, it&#x27;s easy to clean, and the blades are easy to replace.  The trimmer works well also.  If my Dad hasn&#x27;t shaved in a few days, I help him by using the trimmer to get his beard short enough to use the normal head portion.  The swiveling head is also a nice feature, and it can be locked into straight position if a person doesn&#x27;t want it to swivel.  This razor lasts pretty long after a full charge.</li>
            <li> I have owned many electric shavers and none has given me the satisfaction that this Panasonic has.  It is light, easy to use, and it cleans itself.  Best shave I have ever had from an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> It has been a long time since I owned an electric razor.  They have always been a poor substitute for a blade and/or irritating to my skin.  I got a special offer from Panasonic for a different model, but this one was better and cheaper, with faster shipping from Amazon.  This shaver is the closest an electric razor has ever come to a blade&#x27;s results in my experience.  You can press fairly hard to get a close shave without irritation or razor burn.  I picked the 3 blade razor because I have a beard and figured the 4 blade model would be too difficult to maneuver around my beard.  I have never had an electric be so considerate of the skin on my neck or cheeks.  It is super quiet and cleans easily.  The display makes the level of available charge easy to see at a glance and it charges quickly for single shave use if you let it run down.  The head pivots in all directions.  The only downside that I can see is that it will not run off the power cord if it is not charged.  Overall an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I like it and use it it at home, but replaced it with a small battery operated panasonic model I purchased in Japan during travels as this one is quite heavy, bulky and noisy (it is noisier than Phillips I own as well, but cuts closer with less effort).</li>
            <li> Quite possibly the best electric shaver and the best shave from one that I have ever used. I&#x27;ve used Remington, Norelco and Braun before and although the Braun worked well, I really like the smooth shave this Panasonic delivers. I&#x27;ve not tried it with water yet as I don&#x27;t shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> Own a similar model.  Great price. Nice product.</li>
            <li> I really liked this razor. It provides a really nice clean shave and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like others have in the past. I use it in the shower, which is really nice to get a close shave. My only complaint is that after a year, the monitor display no longer works. I have no idea when I need to charge or clean (although I tend to clean it every other use anyways). Not knowing when it needs charging has led to a couple of times using the old fashioned method. The bright side to that negative is that it is fully charged in less than an hour. If the display continued to work, this would be an easy 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my prior six year old Panasonic shaver that I use primarily when I travel.  The LCD display on the older model stopped working and you could not tell when it needed to be recharged.  This one works and looks essentially similar to the older model, which is fine.  It provides a close shave without irritation.  I find Panasonic electric shavers to give closer shaves than Norelcos, without the irritation Brauns cause.  Over the years, I have tried all three.The bottom line is I was able to purchase the new model for far less than a repair plus new blades for the old model would have cost.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Works great.</li>
            <li> good shape and easy to use</li>
            <li> awesome razor, best I&#x27;ve owned</li>
            <li> I just ordered this. Will write more after I get it.&lt;br /&gt;This will be my first electric razor. Except one my parents got me 30 years ago. Don&#x27;t know if I was doing something wrong or what? It didn&#x27;t work very good. I&#x27;ve stayed with blades all these years. I was using those Schick Atra blades. They had the plastic in the middle to push and clean between the two blades. Worked good. They lasted a decent time. They&#x27;ve quit making those. I&#x27;ve been buying blades. Feeling like I&#x27;m wasting money. They&#x27;d get dirty between the blades quickly. Keep buying. They&#x27;ve gone up to four and five blades now. They still get dirty quickly. Have to buy more. And they&#x27;re expensive. So I decided to look for a good electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I have a nice little Wahl trimmer that I&#x27;ve used on my sideburns. They always grew because I didn&#x27;t want to get my blades stuck with hair in between. Would shy away from the long hair of sideburns. That would mean immediate throw out and using another. I&#x27;m counting on this eliminating that problem.&lt;br /&gt;I really like that it has a Lithium-ion battery. They&#x27;re great batteries. A charge indicator also. So I don&#x27;t get stuck with it drained and no shave.&lt;br /&gt;The page has a coupon on it. So I got this for $66. That made it a done deal.&lt;br /&gt;I looked around a lot. Was hesitant to buy an electric shaver. From all the reviews I see here. That&#x27;s what made me decide to buy this one. Appears to be the best value in electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;I also saw a ratings website. They claimed you might not get a better shave from any razor.&lt;br /&gt;I also believe in the Panasonic name. Just got some rechargeable batteries from them. They&#x27;re great. Have always gotten good honest value from Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;I just know I don&#x27;t like keeping on spending the money on blades that don&#x27;t last long. Why the heck did they quit making those Atra&#x27;s?&lt;br /&gt;So we&#x27;ll see how it goes. I&#x27;ll add to this.&lt;br /&gt;7/19... Ok just received this.&lt;br /&gt;Charging.... Max one hour. That&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;First impressions. It&#x27;s not all that light. It ain&#x27;t heavy. It doesn&#x27;t feel or look cheap in anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Usage.... Now I checked first on using this wet with bar soap lathered up. That&#x27;s because I have shaved like that for years. I can&#x27;t see wasting money on shaving cream. I did shave this morning. Been about 5 hours. Could use it, so I did. Even though I know they all say to give this a month to get used to it. I have to honestly say it worked great. Not perfect, yet. In many ways, this is the best shave I&#x27;ve gotten in years. Checking critically. In other ways. I think I can do better. I think it&#x27;s me getting used to it and how to use it the best it can be. Even then, I have to admit, I haven&#x27;t been getting a very good shave with my disposable three blade razors. Maybe a brand new disposable on the first half of my face was better? This is better. I do think the wet soap on my face helped. I couldn&#x27;t help but rinse it while running and shaving. Result is I kept lathering up soap that was on my face already. Worked great.&lt;br /&gt;*Sideburns....This is wonderful. First time trimming the big stuff wet. I was afraid to go wet with my nice little Wahl trimmer. With this. No problem. Just release the trimmer blade. Go for it. Finish of course with the main blades. The best part is it&#x27;s all wet now. Don&#x27;t have hair going all over the place. Wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;*Cleaning.... The way I shave, with the wet soap. I choose to not follow the cleaning instructions. I choose to clean immediately. It works great. Very happy.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m extremely happy with this. Have no intention of ever going back to disposable blade razors. I&#x27;ll keep this at a definite five star. Suggest to anyone to buy it. I have to agree with the ratings site. I don&#x27;t know that any razor can do a better job of a shave than this one?&lt;br /&gt;*Technique.... On the going back and forth for the technique with this razor. Heck, I had to shave at least two directions with my blades to try to get a decent shave. This is no problem. Don&#x27;t even have to turn it around. And it does better.&lt;br /&gt;*Under nose and around lips.... I always had issues doing both of these with my three blade razor. Two blade was better. Now with this, it&#x27;s not a problem. Especially the lips. If I got too close with my blade, I would cut my lip. With this, I can go right over my lips. Works great. I was worried this wouldn&#x27;t get close edges well. Like right at the bottom of my nose. I was wrong. It gets nice and close on edges.&lt;br /&gt;*Overall quality of shave... I am thinking many are being too critical of electric shavers. This one specifically. I&#x27;m just starting to learn to use it. I find I can rub my hand one way. It&#x27;s smooth as can be. Rub another way and I can feel stubble. I&#x27;ll shave with this in many directions. Am learning to get it to where it&#x27;s smooth as can be in any direction. This smoothness is something I haven&#x27;t quite felt with a blade razor. Even feeling stubble. It looks ok? I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;m just plain getting a better shave than I have in the past. I am thinking that I&#x27;m being very critical of this electric razor. I didn&#x27;t think about being critical before like I am now. It&#x27;s doing a great job.&lt;br /&gt;I find it entertaining the lathering up of the soap on my face with this razor. Lathers more after I run water over the blades. Kinda a habit from when I used a blade razor and had to rinse it often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably add more later. After more experience with this. For now I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this electric razor.m. Don&#x27;t even have to turn it around. And it does better.&lt;br /&gt;*Under nose and around lips....

            <li> I have had one similar Panasonic shaver in the past and it lasted for years. I had trouble finding a good shaver at this price point. I&#x27;m happy to have it.</li>
            <li> I read the positive amazon reviews and decided to take a chance. I bought this for my 71 year old dad who has short term memory loss from a stroke. I wanted something that was easy to use, could get wet in case that were to happen, easy to clean and works well. So, I guess I want it all. LOL. Well I didnt get it all with this unit but its close. The three blade razor cuts close and provides a good close shave for loose skin types. The size is good because anything wider ( like the 4 or 5 blade razors) would be too wide.) My dad can operate this on his own and then clean it. For him it produces about 6 shaves before it needs to be charged but this is NOT NORMAL use since he takes an extended amount of time shaving due to his issues. I would recommend this unit. If this exact one comes out with longer battery life and it works with the cord plugged in when the battery runs out of juice then it would be almost perfect. In my opinion you dont need a five blade unit or even four unless you have a large head/face because the amount of razor head surface would be too large around rounded corners. I hope this helps you.</li>
            <li> I bought the Panasonic ES8103S in December of 2010 and it is still going strong! As a military man, I am required to shave on a daily basis so the panasonic gets alot of work in and provides me with a good shave without the &#x27;burn&#x27; marks that I would receive using a rotary head razor. There is no doubt that one can get a closer shave with the ES8103 when using shaving gel or cream but I usually dry shave on my way into work and still receive a pretty good shave. Best razor that I have owned...hands down!</li>
            <li> Works well &amp; cuts clean.  Works better than my Philips HQ9070, which misses a number of hair. This Panasonic ES8103S is a bit noisier than my Philips shaver.  I would recommend this Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li> I gave this shaver a cousin who absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> 5 stars for the price. I got one for my dad for Christmas while it was on sale. I tried it out and it worked well enough so I got myself one after it went on sale again.</li>
            <li> Great shaver so far - fast motor, fast charging time, upscale look and feel. We&#x27;ll see how the battery holds charge after a year of use.</li>
            <li> As others have reviewed - and the reason I bought it - it gives a good close shave. Battery lasts about 12 days of daily use.</li>
            <li> Bought it for senior relative who dropped and broke his original. He was very happy with it and requested same one as replacement. Was not happy with other less expensive brands.</li>
            <li> The first thought I had shaving with this: &amp;#34;This is the most pleasant-feeling shave ever!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;This thought was quickly followed up by: &amp;#34;Oh, it&#x27;s... not actually doing anything...&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, I have a pretty coarse beard, I have to buy the &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; disposable razor blades because the regular stuff is also completely ineffective. I was hoping an electric shaver would save me some time &amp; effort, but this thing simply wasn&#x27;t up to the job. I tried fast, slow, holding it in the same place, wet, dry, shaving cream - nothing worked. It never got past what I&#x27;d call halfway done, leaving me me with patches of stuble all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say this though, the shaver starts to emit an astoundingly terrible stench if you use it for any length of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver does seem to get good reviews, so it&#x27;s obviously working well for some guys. I&#x27;m guessing this shaver is far more effective on softer/thinner beards.... if you have a coarse beard like me, this thing is pretty useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Important note: the manual says it can take up to 30 days to adapt to an electric razor... so if you wait for better results, you won&#x27;t be able to return it... I ended up tossing mine in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I have thick beard hair and have to shave everyday and all this did was pull my hair and left me with bumps and in grown hair. I tried this in water with lather and all the same for me. If you have thick hair I&#x27;d say stick with blades.</li>
            <li> Works quite well.&lt;br /&gt;longer hairs are tough to get as there are no slots accomadating them.</li>
            <li> Not so sure when I ordered, never had great shaves with electrics.  Love this!  Easy to clean, long charge, close shave.  Far better than the Braun shavers I used to have.  Two months and alls well!</li>
            <li> all those years I put up with the Norelco product thinking that it was the only wet shaver made.I find myself shaving in half the time...even realize that I am finished but can&#x27;t believe it as I have been taking so long to shave in the past with that Norelco product. Round blades never made sense to me and now I have no reason to struggle with round blades. One draw back - hardly - it seems that I am re-charging it more than the Norelco. This is the best wet/dry shaver that I have found and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Quality item works good and price was great</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband as a gift. He finds it very convenient and has nothing to complain about. However, it is a little bit on the pricey side but it&#x27;s worth Since it doesn&#x27;t seem flimsy.</li>
            <li> It does the trick in a pinch. Does replace a razor shave (duh).</li>
            <li> I gave it to my father, he is very happy!</li>
            <li> Bf likes it and it arrives earlier</li>
            <li> I have had many electric shavers over the years, but this one is exceptional.&lt;br /&gt;The four row shaver is only good if your face is totally beard free.&lt;br /&gt;The three row means that the slotted, longer hair remover is always close enough to the beard edge.&lt;br /&gt;Its high speed is a must have, do not waste your time with lower speed razors!&lt;br /&gt;Getting the automatic cleaner is a total waste of time and money. Dab a bit of soap on the foil and hold it under the tap and you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;Some advice:&lt;br /&gt;First time you use it shave with an unwashed face, the oils will help run it in nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Then shave after the shower, when your face has dried just enough for the shaver to run smoothly over the face. The hairs will have absorbed water and will be softer and fatter. After the shave they will dry further and shrink into their pores.&lt;br /&gt;Never, never use pre-shave powder, it may make the shave feel more comfortable, but it will soon grind the sharp cutting edges round.&lt;br /&gt;Use light pressure when hair is longer, then at the end use more pressure to cut short hair shorter.&lt;br /&gt;If the speed of the shaver is affected, then you are pressing far too much.&lt;br /&gt;Wash the shaver and use a drop of shaver oil occasionally.</li>
            <li> I love how you can clean it with hand soap.  You can also use it wet and dry which is why I chose this over the braun.</li>
            <li> I like it. Can&#x27;t wait to clean it. I was very impressed that it can be used wet or dry. I had asked my wife to find me a razor that is easy to clean and this one seems like it will hit the mark for easy cleaning. Glad she bought it for me.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend its his first electric razor and he loves it says it gives a quick close shave pretty much exactly what he was looking for. So far a great product and the price was definitly reasonable would recomend.</li>
            <li> I still have this blade and I have to buy another one, I think I will recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Charges quickly and the charge lasts for days.  For a 2- or 3-day business trip you shouldn&#x27;t even need to take your charger.  Very comfortable head.</li>
            <li> Certainly there are other models out there for more money (including the higher end Panasonic) but for the money this is WELL worth it.</li>
            <li> Gave it as a gift to 20 year old college son.  He loves it.  States it is the best razor/shaving system.</li>
            <li> Very good performance.  I typically shave right after I shower.  I start by running a little hot water over the foil while the shaver is running.  I then rinse the foil a couple of times during my shave.  When I am done, I give it a good long rinse with the razor running.  I have tried using a shaving cream and it works well, but shaving cream is not needed to get a good close shave.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine ever using a dry-only electric razor again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic also sells more expensive versions that have fancy cleaning systems.  Save your money and buy this one. A simple hot water rinse while the razor is running will keep the razor performing well.</li>
            <li> A little light in weight; cheapish feel to it. But so far no redness caused by it.</li>
            <li> Great shaver. It is fast and shaves clean. I highly recommend this. Best shaver I have had in a long time</li>
            <li> Panasonic ES8103S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Rechargeable&lt;br /&gt;This item Provides great features for price&lt;br /&gt;Charge indicator is very usefull to me&lt;br /&gt;Overall  I&#x27;m very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> Used a Norelco for years and then bought this model a year ago. I&#x27;m here to shop for another Norelco. My experience with the Panasonic is: Extremely noisy, in fact I suspect some degree of hearing damage with this thing screaming while shaving close to your ears. The other negative is that I have to go over and over the same spot with the P, when the N used to do the same cutting in 2 or 3 swipes, it takes 6 or 8 with the P. I tried it, I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> This shaver offers the best value of Panasonic&#x27;s excellent line of shavers. It does a beautiful job quickly and quietly. It also holds its charge for a longer time than previous razors. Highly recommended for all users of electric shavers.</li>
            <li> Did a lot of research on electric shavers to replace my ancient Braun one.  I kinda wanted to try something different, that&#x27;s just my personality, so I settled on this Panasonic due to other reviews and price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it does a fairly good job.  In comparison to my old Braun though, I think it falls a bit short.  I had my Braun for over 10 years and never replaced the blade ONCE (I did replace the foil once though)!  It still works good, but the cord wouldn&#x27;t keep a connection to the shaver so I had to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next electric shaver will probably be another Braun.  The shave seems closer and less effort to cut the whiskers.  I have a medium to heavy beard and don&#x27;t use it daily.  More like couple times/week, the other times I shave with a blade, but I really only shave a couple times week in general since I work from home and am lazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t really tested it using wet, just seems odd to me, since my Braun couldn&#x27;t get wet.  I do rinse it in the sink when I&#x27;m done and have noticed that it has a nice &#x27;stench&#x27; afterwards.  Probably from water mixing with hair and the blades steel?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kind of a pain not being able to use it plugged in, but it makes sense, since you can get it wet.  Just need to make sure you don&#x27;t run the charge way down and forget to charge it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a Remington lady shaver that I lost on vacation. This one performs so much better. The battery charges really fast (full charge in an hour) and it doesn&#x27;t lose power as the charge goes down. Even though this was designed for a man, I like using this on my legs and underarms. It gives a nice smooth shave with no irritation. It came with a travel pouch and is easy to clean. Hubby uses it too.</li>
            <li> Always liked the cheaper single head Panasonic shavers and thought I would try the more expensive version.  Like it fine and would recommend to anyone who shaves with an electric shaver.  Faster charging with the Lithium Ion Bat.</li>
            <li> Its hard to get rid of the neck beard. I&#x27;m pretty sure that goes for anything that isn&#x27;t a razor.</li>
            <li> My last Panasonic died in 2011 - I got a 100 dollar Braun to replace it, huge mistake. I grow pretty heavy stubble very fast, So I returned to this brand hoping the quality hadn&#x27;t declined since 2006 (yeah, my last Panasonic lasted 5 years). First thing I did to test this one was to dry shave a 3 day growth.  Oh the joy - I will not stray from the fold again. Build quality is very solid. I have not tried wet shaving with it yet but I mostly don&#x27;t do those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like any Panasonic - they ain&#x27;t kidding when they say it will take time to get used to it. Apply very little pressure and let the speed of the blade do the work. I did not follow that advice on my first one and actually cut myself with it. You&#x27;ll take a good ribbing all day if you are seen cutting yourself with an electric.</li>
            <li> Great shaver! The charge lasts a long time. It&#x27;s easy to clean, and is relatively silent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far and works great.  I knew it would as it is a panasonic product.</li>
            <li> I bought this on impulse from daily deals. I&#x27;ve never been much of a fan of electric razors but this Panasonic gives good service. I usually use a little hand washing soap and that&#x27;s enough to provide lubrication for a close shave. I&#x27;ll keep using it from time to time.</li>
            <li> This baby lasts me about 10 shaves per charge and provides a close enough shave to be useful. I have a sensitive face with slight acne and sebbhoric dermatitis, and this helps keep me from irritating everything or cutting often. The foil is smooth and the blades are fast, and it contours to my face well. My only negative is that while cleaning is easy, I&#x27;ve had to replace the foil as the stock one started rusting. no problems with the new one.</li>
            <li> long story short, i bought norelco 7310x for 35$, shaved good but felt underpowered and trimmer felt the same, i&#x27;d rate the shaver 4.4 stars, then i bought panasonic ES8103s very powerful motor and trimmer, it got 3 heads on the trimmer, i liked it especially the trimmer vs norelco,, plus you can use it wet or dry ,i paid about 60$ for it, then i saw the ES-LA63-S panny 4 head shaver on sale for around 110$, tried it but the head was a little too bulky for me and it didn&#x27;t shave any better to me. my favorite is the panasonic es8103s 4.8 stars, panasonic ES-LA63-S 4.5 stars, too bulky; Norelco 7310x  it shaved well but felt underowerered and pop up trimmer didn&#x27;t trim as clean as the panasonics. if you are on a budget the norelco is a good shaver for the money it will do the job, but a little slower , i highly recommend es8103s especially if you get it on sale, around christmas k mart wanted 99$ for it, but i found one at target on clearance for 60$. i would even pay 100 its that good a shaver. this was a great christmas present for me i haven&#x27;t used a hand razor since, well satisfied</li>
            <li> worst shave ever. seriously. this product doesn&#x27;t even come close to resembling a shave. the interceptor cutter between the foils irritates the skin just as bad as razor burn, if not worse because you don&#x27;t even get a decent shave with this product. this shaver gives the same effect as shaving with a neck trimmer or battery operated clipper. a neck trimmer will actually get closer to the skin if used properly. should have sent back immediately but tried to make it work. overpriced garbage. huge waste of $65. heavy beards and sensitive skin beware.</li>
            <li> Why I purchased 8103 of all Panasonics:&lt;br /&gt;1&gt; I didnt want the turbo washer as I didnt want to pay for monthly soap supplies.&lt;br /&gt;2&gt; Some reviewers said that 4 and 5 blades are so huge that they have problems shaving under the nose.&lt;br /&gt;3&gt; Annual replacement cost of foil should not be 50% or more than the shaver&lt;br /&gt;4&gt; 8103 is the best given the three constraints above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Point number 2 above is moot as I have problem with this one as well. Hence the 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the philips Norelco from Costc that was priced at $90 with a $20 coupon. Even if it were the same performance, that one is more value for money as it comes with an extra head. Choice was between returning Panasonic to Amazon or returning Philips to those retailers. I kept this one as the shave with Philips was not close enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BATTERY - All shavers for some funny reason dont allow me to shave when plugged in. Apparently they are more hazardous than women using dryers! Out of the box, some reviewers said they got 5+ shaves. I get 3 probably because I am trying too hard to get close shave at the curves. I would have really appreciated ability to use standard batteries if Panasonic really didnt have intention to milk customers for supplies and spares. Dont compete with printer companies, please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update on Aug 2012&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get a burning sensation in my skin. Panasonic cust support tells me to replace the blade and foil; in 6 months of purchase. I tried to reason that the replacement parts cannot be living 25-50% of their suggested lifetime. Since they are not covered under warranty, they will keep repeating the offer to help you buy the replacement part and test your patience.</li>
            <li> Great Service and Great Product</li>
            <li> By far the best electric razor I have ever had in my 64 years.  Highly recommend this product! It&#x27;s smooth cutting and gliding across each contour of my face, with no pulls to my skin, makes shaving pleasant and not a chore.</li>
            <li> It is not \\&quot;great for the price\\&quot;, it is just great.  I like the indicator; the battery lasts long; the shaving is smoother than in other shavers; and I like it that it is washable. Well deserved 5 starts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a female and have always had issues with eczema and dry skin.  I can only use a bladed razor to shave my legs about twice a week, even when using the super lubricating venus spa blades.  This electric razor is incredible and I can use it every single day without any irritation.  Unfortunately you really do have to shave every day since it doesn&#x27;t get as close to the skin as a manual, bladed razor, but it is still an amazing shave.  It&#x27;s gentle enough to use on the bikini area, underarms, back of the neck (I have a short hair cut), etc.  I highly recommend this razor for women and men, alike!</li>
            <li> This is my second Panasonic wet,dry razor in over 4 years and it is the best razor I have ever used brilliant !</li>
            <li> I love the digital readout and the wet/dry ability of this shaver. It charges for a good 12 shaves in only 40 minutes. The digital readout tells you when you&#x27;re getting low on juice. Cleaning is a breeze, just hold under tap faucet, optionally using sonic vibration to clean.</li>
            <li> Very good shaver, hold a charge very good</li>
            <li> Much better than my older one. Low noise, low vibrations. It may resonate sometime but is ok. Charges very quick about 15-20 mins. Battery lasts for almost 8-10 rounds. i wash it under the tap water after use no issues so far. Blades nice and sharp after about 6 months of use. Display is very useful.</li>
            <li> Great shaver for the price!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now. Gives a decent shave I&#x27;ve yet to find an electric razor that gives a perfect one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware... if you are switching from a regular razor blade or from a different electric one, it does take time (at least for me) to &amp;#34;readjust&amp;#34; your beard to a new device. If you except a Barber Shop cut, you&#x27;ll need to go there</li>
            <li> Fantastic razor for ladies!!!&lt;br /&gt;My first electric razor after trying many razors from disposable to expensive. Tired of underarms burning and itching. I thought it was my deodorant causing itching so kept trying different ones. Nope it was the manual razors. This is a great razor wet with cheap shaving creme or dry. Very close shave and no more itchy arms. Ladies don&#x27;t hesitate to buy yourself one. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 31 year old Asian male. My facial hair is thick and straight. For my whole life I just used a traditional razor. I recently noticed my facial hair started to growing faster. Just a few years ago I was shaving once every 10 days. Now I&#x27;m forced to shave once every 4-5 days. If you&#x27;re like me, I hate shaving with an old school razor - I consider it a miracle when I don&#x27;t cut myself or get a nasty razor burn even when using cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon was running a deal on this Panasonic razor for $54.99 so I decided to jump on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this electric shaver for the first time, I quickly asked &amp;#34;Why didn&#x27;t I buy one of these years ago?&amp;#34;. No joke, it&#x27;s an awesome product. It&#x27;s easy to use, fits comfortably in my hand and provides a pretty close shave. Compared to an old school razor, this is light years more convenient for almost the same exact results. Yeah, I might have to shave with this Panny every 2-3 days now because it doesn&#x27;t cut as close as a traditional razor, but it only takes me a couple minutes to shave my face clean with this thing. Compared to 5-10 minutes with how I was doing it before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Gives a clean shave&lt;br /&gt;- Fits in my hand comfortably&lt;br /&gt;- The attached trimmer works very well&lt;br /&gt;- Glides with the surface of my skin with ease. The shaver head will bend to the contour of your face, most notably your jawline&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to clean. Just remove the head and rinse under water&lt;br /&gt;- Charges quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Louder than expected. It&#x27;s a pretty high pitched humming noise&lt;br /&gt;- Charger is a little clunky</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who went on blood thinners, so no more razors! I loved the clean shave, he wasn&#x27;t impressed.&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;m still using it .....</li>
            <li> I love this shaver! My old Panasonic ES8018 shaver was about 15 years old and had never needed any repair. But its trimmer broke suddenly and I decided it was high time for a replacement. This thing shaves close and smooth, and it&#x27;s very quiet! I also like the floating head, which can be locked for those who need to apply more pressure for a tough beard. Charges quick and holds it&#x27;s charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> i love one its great but u shipped two shavers to me so let me know how to get the 2nd one back too u.  perry o.</li>
            <li> Great electric shaver.  I use it in the shower every morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had an &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; razor, like the older version coveted Brauns with which to compare to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m coming from a $30 Panasonic electric which lasted about 10 yrs before the battery croaked, so keep that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a medium type beard. I shave usually twice during the week electric, once on the weekend blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My blade shaves were always closer than my electric shaves but I have to say, this razor seems to match if not surpass my blade shaves.&lt;br /&gt;(caveat emptor: I almost never shave up when using my blade unless special occasion- I&#x27;ve always understood it&#x27;s really not good for the skin to shave up so I just don&#x27;t.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My understanding is high RPM&#x27;s is a main characteristic to seek for a great electric shave and this certainly is much higher than any other I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great shaves could also be due to the cutters being brand new so time will tell there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The popup trimmer is good but I prefer the one on my old Panasonic because it came out further and it just seemed to be more effective, but not by much.</li>
            <li> I kept it but too noisy!!</li>
            <li> Has a great shave for the money. Batterie life is good around 10 between charges.</li>
            <li> Excellent product; this is my second one. Best value for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is great. You can go days without a recharge and without losing power. Feels good on the face. Pivots and flexes nicely. Trimmer function works perfectly. My only knock is it doesn&#x27;t do great on the neck with longer hairs, but I&#x27;ve never had an electric shaver that does a good job there. Still good value for the money and a solid machine that keeps on going.</li>
            <li> Found this for less than $75 - excellent value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Nice little shaver which gives me a smooth, fast shave with no nicking.  Long lasting battery with LED display of percentage remaining. Flip-up trimmer works well.  Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: both minor for me - it&#x27;s noiser than any of my past electric razors &amp; I seem to accidentally hit the off button fairly frequently while shaving.</li>
            <li> Works OK but display syarted acting up within 3 months</li>
            <li> High quality item and it was on sale.  I love the responsiveness of the flexible shaver head, and the electronic display for battery life was also a convenient feature.  It was a good upgrade from my older Panasonic shaver, and I will not hesitate to recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Good shaver for the price!!!!</li>
            <li> husband loves this razor. easy to use and keeps its charge. I like it for my legs too</li>
            <li> I am a lifelong user of electric shavers, and I have owned this shaver for over one year. I use it every morning to shave. I also use the trimmer to cut longer hair around my face. I have never used it in the shower, always shaving dry, with no shaving cream or oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an effective shaver, although the cutting ability has declined moderately over time. It takes me longer to shave now than it did when new. I have had no other complaints with the quality of the device. The foil has been remarkably durable, more so than the remington micro foil shavers I had in the past. The cutting action is about the same as my prior remington shavers, and slightly better than norelco electric shavers. It cuts better on the flat surfaces of the face than it does on the curves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery allows me to shave four or five times before requiring a recharge. My main complaint with this unit is the battery recharge. Unlike some other electric shavers I have used, this unit does not function while recharging. If the battery dies, it requires at least 20 minutes to recharge enough to finish the shave. Since I can&#x27;t wait that long on most work days, I have to finish my shave with a conventional razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this unit again. The price is pretty good, and the quality is equal to any other electric shaver I have used.</li>
            <li> Great razor!!  Works well; no problems.</li>
            <li> Awful experience. It is painful and it does not cut well. I wanted to replace its blade, and guess what - it is 33$ (!) Just for replacement blade. Almost as much as the razor itself. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> I hate this shaver!  It doesn&#x27;t hold a charge and you cannot shave with it plugged in. You have to wait for it to recharge and unplug it.  It does not cut well either.  Only thing good about it from my perspective is that it is quiet.  It would be fine for someone with a thin soft growth... like an adolescent just starting out.  But definitely not worth more than $39.95</li>
            <li> The shaver is not very good, I have to go over the same areas multiple times and still have to use a regular razor to clean up and get a close shave</li>
            <li> great little shaver. can&#x27;t use it while it&#x27;s charging, is noisy, but who cares? easy to clean with soap and water.</li>
            <li> it did nothing for my stubble</li>
            <li> Great product for the cost.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my husband, he like the speed and the clean cut. But I do not like the noise it makes, the shaver woke me up every morning when he uses it. It makes a very loud noise. This is the loudest shaver I have ever known.</li>
            <li> QUIET, compared to my old Remington. First thing I noticed.&lt;br /&gt;The good: Very good close shave overall. Have to go over a number of times to get a good shave. Remington micro screen might get a closer shave. Panasonic does a good job overall.&lt;br /&gt;The good: no missed hairs like with my old Remington micro screen.&lt;br /&gt;The good: Performance good wet or dry shaving. I primary used wet with shaving cream. Also used dry with shaving powder.&lt;br /&gt;The good: Charging lasts for about a week worth saves, recharge when it gets down to 30%. Performance drops off below 30%. Charges pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;The good: Cleans up well, rinsing with water.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t used trimmer yet.&lt;br /&gt;Used about a month.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied. Its a keeper.&lt;br /&gt;Received in timely manor. In excellent condition.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for some 55 years and really like the design of the shaver and give it five stars for its performanace.  It was shipped promptly, but the first one I received would not charge so, I returned it and was promptly shipped a replacement that works like a charm.  Great product great service Thank you.</li>
            <li> Wanted something not crazy expensive I could take to and from the firehouse and get a decent shake on the second day I worked.  It&#x27;s works well enough, don&#x27;t really have any complaints.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and perfect shave!</li>
            <li> I ordered this Razor for my husband. He has had it about a month.  He just had radiation treatment to the face/neck, very tender skin.  He is able to shave with this shaver very comfortably.  It gives a smooth shave and holds a charge for 5-7 days.</li>
            <li> Figured I&#x27;d spend some decent coin to get a good shaver. It get&#x27;s most of my beard but still leaves a lot behind that I have to do a back-up sweep with a blade to finish off. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> The instructions that came with the razor said to give the razor a try for at least 30 days.  I had my doubts, but after 3 weeks my beard, face or razor is getting  better, or all 3.  I went from a full beard to a close shave and had reservations as to the ability of this razor.  Now that I&#x27;ve  become accustomed to the razor, it does a very nice job.  I have to admit that taking an electricial appliance into the shower was an unnatural act, but it works very well.  I would recommend it,  but give it an honest try for at least 30 days.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband&#x27;s birthday.  He really likes it.  Smooth shave, easy to clean.  You can even take it into the shower.  Really good price through Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best shaver i had!&lt;br /&gt;The battery is charged very fast and lasts several shaves.&lt;br /&gt;It picks up almost every hair at the &#x27;first strike&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;I am not aware of any cons, but i own it only a few weeks...</li>
            <li> I loved this shaver, and for about a year it worked fine.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately it died on me. The display stopped working after a year and then the rest of the shaver died shortly thereafter, failing to turn on at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never once dropped it or ever used it as a wet shaver (even though it was designed for it). Also, I used it only 3-4 times a week and never over-charged it(if that&#x27;s even possible).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this shaver because of the great reviews on it.  Only after it broke did I realize that there where also a lot of reviews complaining of similar malfunctions that I had experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just Ordered a Remington Shaver, I&#x27;m hoping that I can get more than a year of use this time :-/</li>
            <li> I bought this when my $39, 5-year old Remington finally wouldn&#x27;t take a charge. And I&#x27;m glad for that. The shaver gives a very close, comfortable shave. Isn&#x27;t that what it&#x27;s all about? It cleans under water, and the trimmer works very well without blocking your view when using it (I had once purchased a Braun that didn&#x27;t allow you to see what you were trimming, believe it or not, and they took it back with no questions because they admitted they had had a lot of complaints). Anyway, back to the Panasonic - I purchased it at $69.00 and then the price immediately went up to $81.00. But even at that higher price, it&#x27;s a great shaver for the money. There is a newer \\&quot;ARC 4\\&quot; model which I guess has an extra set of blades, but it had fewer reviews and they weren&#x27;t as good as the reviews for this shaver, so I stuck with this older model. In summary, it gives a great comfortable shave, handles nicely, and appears to be of high quality. The only con might be the lack of a zippered, protective catrrying case (it comes with a cheap drawstring pouch) but that&#x27;s ok, use the case from your old shaver. Conclusion: there are higher priced shavers out there that look fancier, and I&#x27;m sure they have some useful bells and whistles this one doesn&#x27;t have, but this is a great, attractive shaver that feels good in your hand and is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> better compared to norelco 3xxx series, but difficult to reach corner of nose and upperlip and folds on neck,&lt;br /&gt;better get the automatic cleaning stand, messy to clean with soap and turbo mode.&lt;br /&gt;price is descent, every shave will drain about 12-15% of charge.&lt;br /&gt;displays faucet image when needs cleaning (showed that sight once after 10 shaves)&lt;br /&gt;lock (used to lock the head) is slipping sometimes with force causing mobility of head</li>
            <li> I was hoping using an electric shaver would be quicker but it isn&#x27;t, at least for now. It is getting better though. As the product description said, it takes about a month to get used to your skin. Hoping it would be really quick once it is set well. The shave as such is really smooth, love that aspect of it. Cleaning is simple as well.</li>
            <li> Excellent, use it everyday for a couple of years now. This is my second Panasonic in a decade.</li>
            <li> I used a three-headed, six-year-old Norelco electric razor that did fine. It was just getting old and needed to be replaced. Based on the reviews, I bought the Panasonic ES8103S and tried it for the first time yesterday. The shave is fairly close - typical of most electric razors - but it is really loud. It charges quickly, it&#x27;s easy to use and to clean, but the noise is a huge drawback. Also, can&#x27;t use it while it&#x27;s plugged in and there&#x27;s no stand. We&#x27;ll see how good it is six months from now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried foil shavers in the past and was sorely disappointed - this razor is by far the best razor I&#x27;ve used...ever.  I have been a tried and true supporter of rotary shavers for better than 30 years...not anymore.  Been using this for about a month now and no lie, it shaves very close and comfortable with no burn.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Best shaver ever - very quiet and smooth.  Much better than my last Panasonic model.  Linear motor really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Got this to replace a five- or six-year-old Panasonic ES8152 with a dying battery, when I realized I probably couldn&#x27;t replace that battery myself.  I was very satisfied with the old model and this seems almost as good.  It is a little smaller and maybe less robust but seems to do the job for me.  My only quibble would be the trimmer--it&#x27;s smaller and a little more difficult to use than that of the old model.  I&#x27;ve only had it about a month, so time will tell.</li>
            <li> Not the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned, takes a while to get a semilose shave, some what disappointing. Thank you</li>
            <li> I don´t use razors anymore. This is a very reliable shaver. It´s been 5 months and it works just as new. Battery charge last for more than a week. I had to clean it a couple of times to get her back in shape. The only con is I have a goatee and it´s hard to get a close shave around it.</li>
            <li> i like the wet shave best. easy to clean. what I dislike,will not shave clean under the nose area. It is a good razor for the money,I would recommend.</li>
            <li> The best razor we&#x27;ve found. No pulling as others said.  Easy to clean. Waterproof is a good advantage. Great buy!!!</li>
            <li> We have two ES8103S now.  The first one, I ordered to replace an electric shaver I used on my legs.  This one seemed sturdier and to have overall better reviews than most of the designed-for-women shavers I looked at, and a little time searching around the web confirmed my suspicion that I would be FAR from the first woman to use a man&#x27;s razor to shave her legs.  I ordered a second one for a 91 year old woman who prefers to shave, not tweeze, the thick hairs that grow on her face and under her chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all areas, the trimmer first:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re shaving hair more than about 3mm or 1/8 in. you NEED to use the trimmer first.  The shaver seems much more likely to pass over longer hairs, leaving them uncut.  The pop-up trimmer thing seems to work great.  Moving it gently over skin leaves, basically, semi-long stubble that the shaver has a much easier time with.  Looking at how it seems to work I wouldn&#x27;t recommend pushing hard with the trimmer at all; it looks like it could pinch/tear skin that managed to get caught.  So we&#x27;ve been using it with respect and haven&#x27;t had it hurt either of us.&lt;br /&gt;(There&#x27;s no way to adjust the length of hair the trimmer cuts in case anyone reading this is curious.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For legs:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t expect an electric shaver to get as close as a razor.  Using this on my legs I can get the skin smooth to the touch, but the stubble will be back the next day as opposed to using a razor which usually leaves my legs feeling smooth for closer to two days.  I use it in the shower with shaving cream on my legs.  I have to go over most areas at least twice to get rid of all the stubble, and I seem to get the best results shaving in multiple directions instead of always with or against the hair&#x27;s grain.  I&#x27;ve never had it cut my legs or even leave razor burn/irritation.&lt;br /&gt;I could use it out of the shower on dry skin, but I prefer the results I get using it to shave when the skin and hair are all wet and soft from the shaving lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For underarms:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try using this to shave under my arms, but I gave up.  The only way I could ever get the skin to feel smooth to the touch required many passes pushing pretty hard.  I&#x27;d wind up with scratches/welts from where the edges of the foil scratched me.  So I stick to a disposable razor for shaving my armpits.  After that experience, I&#x27;m in no rush to test the shaver on my bikini line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For 91 year old female face:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use this on her face after she&#x27;s had a shower.  It would probably work better in the shower, but there are non-shaver related reasons which make that impractical.  I can shave her even if she hasn&#x27;t recently had a shower, but I get better results when the skin/hair is still soft and damp right after bathing.  Like my legs, it usually requires multiple passes and directions to get the skin to feel smooth.  I have the most trouble getting hairs near the corners of her mouth and under her chin where her skin is very loose.  Best results seem to come if we can manage to pull the area of skin we&#x27;re shaving taut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints about the quality.  The thing seems sturdy enough and looks like the pictures.  It doesn&#x27;t strike me as complicated to operate.  It recharges within a few hours; it&#x27;s always finished charging when I think to come check on it, so I&#x27;m not sure exactly how long it takes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If speed is an issue, I would not recommend this over safety razors because it always takes us longer to shave with this.  I use this on my legs to avoid the irritation and cuts I get from razors and to reduce the number of disposable razors I go through.  I advised it for the old lady because her hands shake too much to shave herself and none of us, her caretakers, are confident enough using a razor on the rather loose and wrinkly skin on her face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it four stars for, \\&quot;I like it\\&quot; because it pretty much does everything I was expecting.  I&#x27;dgive it five stars if it didn&#x27;t take multiple passes, but it might be more apt to irritate the skin if they redesigned it to cut more aggressively.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver on Amazon because I had had a previous Panasonic that had performed well, and the price was attractive. I&#x27;ve used it for about a month, and get about a week&#x27;s worth of shaves per charge. The percentage of charge remaining display is quite helpful. Unfortunately, it does not give a very close shave; my old one did better. I have only used it dry, and it may be that it works better wet, but I would expect it to shave well in either mode.</li>
            <li> After my Norelco gave up being just a year and a half old, I decided to go with this one. I figured it was a good middle-range price option. I didn&#x27;t want to go super cheap or super expensive. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks now, about 4 or 5 shaves, and I have some very good first impressions. First of all it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. It has a nice weight to it. You can also take it in the shower and clean with soft soap, which is nice. It gives a really nice close shave, and even gets the hairs around my neck and throat with little effort, which were impossible with my Norelco. It only has 3 drawbacks. One, I feel like it heats up a little faster than the Norelco did, so for extended use it can wear you down a little. However, it does shave quickly, so it hasn&#x27;t really been a problem. After 3 or 4 days of hair growth, a 10 min shave will do the trick. Two, the clipper is the only thing about this shaver that feels cheap. It flips open from the back and looks nice, but it doesn&#x27;t really do that great of a job. Still, since the shaver itself does a great job, I haven&#x27;t had a big need to use it. And finally, it&#x27;s a little noisier than my Norelco was. It&#x27;s not a big deal for me, because it again it&#x27;s really quick, but I mention it in case any one else needs a quiet one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final thoughts, totally worth the price in my opinion. You&#x27;re not spending $400, so don&#x27;t expect the world. Yet still, it&#x27;s a very close shave, and feels like a well designed, thought out product. It&#x27;s got my vote.</li>
            <li> Great shaver, recharges fast (in about 1 hour at 220V) but the LCD display is dying with segments disappearing only after 6 months of use. Now it will be harder to know when to charge and how long to charge it for.  It wouldn&#x27;t be cost effective to return it to Amazon even though I could. Shaving function still works great though.</li>
            <li> Hi this is the best shaver I have ever purchase excellent on everything charge quickly  and not to noise and when I shave is like shaving whit the razor blade thanks</li>
            <li> Have had an opportunity to use this shaver over the past several weekends, and I am impressed.  It holds a charge very well, and has an indicator with the percent of charge left.  The fact that you can use it wet or dry is a very nice feature.  I&#x27;ve experienced zero razor burn, and get a good, clean, shave. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is the third replacement (under warranty) of this razor.  The first two the batteries self destructed after 1 year, and the next, six months.  The shave is good, however, after six months the battery life has degraded from 1 week of shaves to 4 days.  The liquid crystal display failed after about 2 weeks.  I&#x27;ve been a loyal Panasonic shaver user for about 25 years but am really dissappointed to watch the quaity degrade in the recent models.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I heard that foil shavers are much better for those with sensitive skin than rotary shavers.  After a couple months of use, I&#x27;ve found that to be confirmed.  I&#x27;ve experienced literally no irritation since I started using this shaver.  It doesn&#x27;t pull the hair at all, and the high rpm on the blades is very reassuring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t do as well with longer hair, however.  If I let my beard grow too long, I have to use the trimmer (which is top notch, by the way) before shaving.  I&#x27;ve also noticed that it doesn&#x27;t get as close a shave as my old rotary shaver, but that&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t pull the hairs up to cut them.  The difference is marginal; it still cuts very close and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to clean, too!  I haven&#x27;t had the display tell me I need to clean it yet, but I have.  Very simple and well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy it again for the price, especially when compared to other options.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this razor I had been using a Braun shaver. However, it became difficult to purchase blades for the shaver I had. After checking various web sites, I selected the Panasonic ES8103S because of the features and the excellent price I found on Amazon. So far I have been very satisfied. The shaver is quiet, charges quickly and has a readout which shows the amount of charge left and when the razor needs cleaning. The razor gives a good shave although not as close as my old Braun did before they began manufacturing their shavers in China. I have used the Panasonic now for about a month and am glad that I selected it over the other shavers I researched.</li>
            <li> Went from a razor to this product without the pain expected.  With the cost of razor blades continually raising, this is well worth the money.  Highly recommended</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8103 and 8109 (they&#x27;re the same) shave well when they work. I have owned 3. But there are two big problems with both. One problem is the battery. It just doesn&#x27;t last. Yesterday my shaver died after less than one year. My two other shavers also had battery and charging problems. The other problem is the little screen that indicates how much charge is left. That screen begins to lose characters and definition within weeks and after a few months they go blank, meaning that you don&#x27;t know how much charge is left. These Panasonic models will give you a good shave if you plan to use them for just a few months and them throw them away. If you hate wasting your money and want to have a good shaver that will last a reasonable amount of time, then buy a different brand.</li>
            <li> I read the good and the bad review on this product. I have to say that I am impressed with this shaver. It feels very solid on the had, It shaves very well (I used it right out of the box with just 10% power on it) this is something I have never been able to do since I have very sensitive skin. The shaver gave me a painless, and close shave. It makes a humming sound that is not too loud. All in all, I can recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is my second of this brand and style. I like the high speed of the Panasonic razors. The  first one was generallly used as a dry razor, and has lasted three years, with a replacement blade and foil at year one. It is still working and is my travel razor. The new ES8103S has been used almost exclusively as a wet razor with Edge foam. It provides a very good shave. Keep the charge up, because it does not run with the charger cord plugged in - the only drawback I can mention, but it makes sense as you probably do not want to be wet shaving while plugged into a wall outlet.</li>
            <li> The shaver doesn&#x27;t cause irritations on the skin at all and can be washed with water. My brother is very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Let me start my review by saying, if you&#x27;re looking for an electric shaver that won&#x27;t mangle your neck into a red blotchy mess, look no further!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve previously owned electric shavers from Remington, Norelco and Braun, all of them but the Remington cost more than this Panasonic.  Every one of those other shavers I owned would randomly irritate my neck and leave patches of stubble.  They say that you need to keep using the shaver, tough it out and your skin will get used to it, I&#x27;ve owned all of them long term and this was not my experience.  All of my other shavers were like a skin torture device to some degree or another on seemingly random days.  The Norelcos and the Braun that I owned were all top of the line models as well, I&#x27;m not a cheapskate.  I will say that I was skeptical about a Panasonic brand shaver at first; since Remington and Norelco pretty much exclusively concentrate their product development efforts on personal care technology like shavers, you&#x27;d think they make the best ones, wrong.  I don&#x27;t have to push and stretch and repeatedly go over stubble that would otherwise be left by my previous shavers.  I&#x27;ve been using this Panasonic (dry) for over a month and this is the closest and most consistent shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  Unlike the Braun electro-foil shavers, this Panasonic seems to oscillate at a much higher frequency, I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so much more superior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I have to find any negatives about it, I would say that the flip-up trimmer is kinda weak, it tends to bog down and miss hair if you plunge it into a patch of thick beard, but if you&#x27;re patient it works ok.  The other annoying thing about the flip-up trimmer is that you can only effectively use it in a downward motion, if you push up ever so slightly, it starts to flip shut and disengages from the motor.  The battery life indicator seems to be rather dumb, the shaver does charge very quickly and holds a charge long enough to work for at least 2-3 weeks off charge, but the indicator predictably drops by 10% intervals every morning that you use the shaver.  Once you&#x27;re at 10% it doesn&#x27;t indicate any lower, but in my experience it will shave at least 5 more times after it reaches 10%.  Beyond the 10% though, there is absolutely no other warning, when the shaver decides it&#x27;s out, it stops abruptly.  Really these are minor issues in an otherwise excellent product in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rarely write reviews as my review history will show, but this is such a good shaver that I actually felt compelled to write a review about it.  This Panasonic is hands down the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned!arge, but the indicator predictably drops by 10% intervals every morning that you use the shaver.

            <li> Hey there&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t ever feel the need to write reviews if I am disappointed or not. This is exactly just right for the average face. Consistent, accurate and holds a charge, also easy to transport safely. I searched for shavers reviews before I jumped into buying, completely sick of a razor and completely overwhelmed by the variety of shavers. This one does the trick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave my head bald and have a very angular face if it does me right it will do you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy.</li>
            <li> This one is almost identical to my older one which I used for about 5 years without replacing anything. I didn&#x27;t really need a new one but saw this one and bought it on impulse since I figured the old one would just give out some day and leave me high and dry. I am retired and don&#x27;t shave every day. When you use this one wet, it is as close as I remember a blade to be. You should use an anti-bacterial soap on the blade every couple of weeks to avoid a mildew smell.</li>
            <li> Bought this February 2013 and paid more than I ever had for a shaver.  The self-cleaning feature is very nice, and it gives a good shave, but now 13 months after purchase the display that shows the percentage of charge is going out.  I can barely read anything.  That is important, since you need to know when to recharge this shaver, and it uses up at least 10% of the charge with each shave.  Nice shaver for the money, if it would only last.  Looks like it is just more planned obsolescence.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be much better than I  found it. It is not sharp enough. The normal razor is far better actually.</li>
            <li> Received item as described, thanks ...</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver. Price was good and provides better performance than the brand I was using previously. So far I am very happy with this shaver and recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> I used to be a disposable razor person but I decided to give this a go. It&#x27;s a great wet/dry shaver and I had no problems adjusting to using an electric razor. Cleaning is a cinch as well.</li>
            <li> Loud noise, makes you nervous.  Battery life is only about 7~8 times of shaving.  Not so comfortable on face.    But it does its job of shaving. Never tested it in wet.</li>
            <li> Not a fan, cut&#x27;s poorly</li>
            <li> Very good with a razor, I like it.</li>
            <li> Simply put, this is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned. I&#x27;ve pretty much tried all the different brands and models over the years and none of them have given me as close or as comfortable of a shave as this. Seems to be a little better wet shaving (with foam) as opposed to dry, and it does take a week or two for your beard to adjust, but after that the shave is very good. Would highly recommend.    Amazon seems to be having problemss with their order processing and delivery lately as I experienced on this and other orders (which has caused me to start shopping elsewhere), but that is another issue unrelated to this shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Panasonic shavers for about 8 years.  They are simply the best and keep getting better.  First of all, they already have the fastest motor (13K RPM when you buy the Linear models) out of any shaver out there.  That means you&#x27;re already assured of a close shave.  Now they&#x27;ve added 30 degree blades and an angled shaver head?  Wow.  Amazing.  It truly is as close as a blade.  And to top that off, you can shave with shaving cream, in the shower or dry and you just rinse off to clean it!  Look no further, this is the best shaver for the money you can buy.</li>
            <li> I received the product quickly as usual with amazon,and at an incredible price.Sleek and compact design is very nice to handle. i used it dry first time out and results were great! Very quick and efficient, yes it is a little loud but not in annoying way. cleans simply without costly cartridges like my old braun self cleaner. I highly reccomend this shaver you won&#x27;t be dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Gives a decent shave, but rather noisy. Use it and a Norelco...A good shaver is an oxymoron.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this razor and he says it gives him a very close, aggravation free shave. He has no complaints at all.</li>
            <li> OVERALL A FAIRLY GOOD SHAVER FOR THE PRICE. HOWEVER POWER AND SHAVING SPEED RAPIDLY DECREASES AS BATTERY INDICATOR GETS BELOW 60% REMAINING. NEED FULL CHARGE FOR AN EFFICIENT SHAVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT NEARLY AS CLOSE A SHAVE AS OTHER ELECTRICS BUT VERY HIGH ON COMFORT AND SMOOTHNESS. MARKETED AS A THREE BLADE APPLIANCE BUT IT&lt;br /&gt;HAS ONLY TWO FULL BLADES.</li>
            <li> I tried a Norelco in high school 20 years ago, it stunk, so I have stuck with razors ever since.  I saw this on Amazon for $69, read the great reviews, thought I would give it a try and am very glad I did.  With my beard, shaving down with a razor looked just o.k. and was rough.  Shaving up on the face got me really smooth, but it was hard on my skin, and shaving up on my neck was not an option.  In just a couple weeks of getting used to this Panasonic, my face gets near-up razor smooth, and my neck is closer than I could ever get it with a razor.  And no burn, rash, nothing.  Very comfortable.  It&#x27;s not quite as good if you let your beard go a few days and the hairs start to lay at all, but otherwise it&#x27;s great.  If you can get this razor for anywhere close to the price I paid, I am not sure why you would spend more on anything else.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this shaver after I had read all the positive reviews here on Amazon, and I&#x27;m glad I did. This is my first electric shaver ever, and I just received it today so I can&#x27;t really judge it from the first time. After using it, my beard is smooth, but not as smooth as when I use the razor. I&#x27;m giving it more time and hoping that my beard will adjust and get used to the new shaver, so it can shave even closer.    P.S. This machine doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to cut small hairs that get stuck to the skin, and I have to use the razor to remove them. Any advice on that? I don&#x27;t have any experience with these electric shavers.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver a little over a month ago. I was looking for a specific set of specs and this seemed to fit the bill perfectly. I&#x27;m taking a trip overseas and wanted a single shaver/beard trimmer combo (at the time I was using a separate ancient Remington Triple Action shaver and Wahl trimmer) that also had an international power supply (neither previous device had). I can say that this is an excellent shaver. It shaves cleanly, quickly and efficiently. I have thick, dark facial hair and this goes right through it. I get about 10 shaves per charge, though I do have a full beard and so am only shaving my cheeks and throat. Others&#x27; uses per charge may vary. I&#x27;ve had no razor burn from it and only once has it pulled a hair in the month I&#x27;ve been using it. Clean-up is fast and simple using soap and water. I have no particular complaints with it. The sound is not quiet (as others have pointed out) and quite high-pitched, but I don&#x27;t find it painfully so and it is still quieter than my previous shaver. All in all, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s one of my best purchases of the last year.</li>
            <li> After my older Panasonic razor didn&#x27;t cut it anymore (after almost 3 years). I decided to get another Panasonic.  After looking at what was out there I purchased the ES8103S shaver.  It didn&#x27;t have all that cleaning junk with it.. Just the shaver and charger..  Shaver works great!  My face is soft and smooth!  Would definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> Months of skin treatment required use of electric razor instead of blade razor. Purchased ES8103S due to excellent reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;m very satisfied. I&#x27;m already getting a decent shave. I&#x27;ve tried both dry and with gel and gel is closer for me. At first I failed to keep the foil flat against my skin, was using too much angle...need to have all three blades in contact...duh!  I estimate it takes about twice the time to shave with the electric than it does with my blade razor. I was pleasantly surprised how effective the shaver is around the mouth/chin area.  There is less irritation than the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are a bit vague and could be better, especially re cleaning. However, cleaning is fairly easy. If the razor continues to perform well over time, I will raise the rating to five stars.</li>
            <li> Great shave and use it to shave my head as well.  Battery life is not so great and have to charge very few days.  Probably not terrible for the time it is in use each day shaving that big head of mine.  Have two, one for travel so I never forget it.  Good backup as well in case I drop it or otherwise damage it.</li>
            <li> I bought one for myself a few year ago and just bought one for my dad for Christmas.  He loves it!</li>
            <li> almost as good as a straight edge.......I said almost.</li>
            <li> Bought as gift. I have been using electric shavers for over 25 years and have tried most major brands. This Panasonic ES8103S shaver is the best I have used. Charges very quickly and the charge last over a week. Blade and screen still shaves close and irritation free after 2 years. I recommend purchasing the ES8109S which includes the drop in charging base.</li>
            <li> This shaver is the second electric wet/dry from Panasonic I have purchased.  The first one lasted several years even after being dropped numerous times.  This shaver works fine in, before or after the shower.  The charge lasts approximately one to two week.  It recharges in two hours or less.  The shaver is very lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave itself is close, but not as close as a blade.  However, the trade off in closeness is worth it because the razor never cuts my face.  I have had the best results using any brand shaving gel with the shaver.</li>
            <li> THE MOST QUIET, SMOOTH, EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE SHAVE I HAVE EVER USED. FAR BETTER THAN OTHER BRANDS COSTING MORE DOUBLE THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> Having formerly used a Remington two-blade Titanium electric razor for many years, I feel qualified to review this Panasonic two blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Quiet, good close shave, nice floating head, waterproof and easy to wash, battery charge state indicator easy to understand, plastic protective cover fits well and stays on. Reasonable price for what you get. I&#x27;ve never used a Bosch, so I can&#x27;t offer any comparison to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Hard to use sideburn/long-hair trimmer (it&#x27;s on the back and you have to work to get it open, and then turn the whole shaver 180 degrees to use it. The Remington design is better and easier to use.)  The charger is a small wall-dongle, not built-in, so you have more to carry when traveling than with the Remington. Replacement heads are somewhat pricier than Remington&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waiting to see:  Can&#x27;t tell if the battery is replaceable when it dies, unlike the Remington. Hated to throw away the Remington just for that.</li>
            <li> This is a superior product.  I used to have a Braun and this is far, far better, smoother, faster, closer.  Great product!!!</li>
            <li> Very good electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:  It is easy to operate, the shave is close (not closest I&#x27;m had with electric razor), easy to clean, quick and long charge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:  Slightly noisy</li>
            <li> Easy to clean,holds charge well--I get many shaves from one charge.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t shave in the shower. the cap works smoothly</li>
            <li> I got one of these as a gift over the holidays.  I am really disappointed in its performance.  I&#x27;ve been using electric razors for at least 15 years and for the price, this has got to be one of the worst I&#x27;ve used.  It takes FOREVER to shave with it and the trimmer is just terrible.  People say the battery lasts a long time but I completely disagree.  And the worst part is you can&#x27;t even use it while it&#x27;s charging.  I did not like my previous Remmington razor either but I got an equivalent shave with a battery that DID last forever and I could use it while charging.  Not to mention it cost about half as much and the trimmer was functional.&lt;br /&gt;I will say it is one of the more comfortable razors I&#x27;ve used but I believe it&#x27;s because it does not cut that close.  I feel I need another shave in a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;Razors in general with a straight head design are just comical to me.  I will only shop for ones that have the 3 circular blades in the future.  There&#x27;s almost no place on my face where you get most of the blades to contact your skin.  The other style with 3 circular blades covers so much more of your face at once and shaving takes half the time.  Plus they actually pivot with your face and make so much more sense.</li>
            <li> Quiet; Excellent battery life, enough for ten shaves before recharging is necessary.  Gives a nice, close shave in a very short time.</li>
            <li> Works great battery life not as good as expected. I would recommend it to others. I actually bought a second cheaper model.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for a year, and I&#x27;m very pleased with it. I&#x27;ve used similar styles of razor from another manufacturer for decades, but my beard still took a week or two to get used to this one. Since then, it consistently gives a great shave. The ultra-sonic cleaning feature (with the reminder to clean the blades when necessary) is handy. I also like the battery charge readout (in 10% increments). The battery still holds a charge well after a year. The blades seem like they are just becoming less sharp now.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver for my personal use that was suggested by ny son for a replacement of previous shaver.</li>
            <li> It does not fully shave my facial hair, which I usually grow up to a quarter an inch at the most. I&#x27;ve tried wet and dry shave, putting more/less pressure, nothing works. I&#x27;m very disappointed, considering all the great reviews.</li>
            <li> Good but it can&#x27;t cove small hairs</li>
            <li> I went through all the reviews and settled on this shaver because of the price.  I paid $60 and have not been disappointed.  I was going to get the 4 blade model but would have paid $40 dollars more.  I figured that with the cost of maintenance for these shavors, its not worth it to get the most updated version.  I was right.  This shaver works like a champ.</li>
            <li> Pros:  - pivot head, shaves well, easy clean up, wet/dry use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - Can&#x27;t use corded, LED screen quit working in well under 1 yr.  I could make out the charging status though, so I continued to use.  One morning I turned on and dead - no warning.  It was the end of the week and thought I just needed to recharge, so I charged.  Unit came on for maybe 5 seconds and now is completely dead - in under 2 yrs from purchase date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a Braun person for years before trying this Panasonic unit, and generally I&#x27;ve always had good luck with Panasonic products, so have been unhappy with my experience on this shaver.  Never have I had a Braun unit just die on me, I switched units as I was wanting to upgrade after years of use.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son over a year ago.  He absolutely loves it, it&#x27;s durable, easy to use and has stood the test of time so far.  Would highly recommend this product as I can&#x27;t think of even one way it could be improved.</li>
            <li> I had it for 3 months, and i use it once a week. I love it and its so nice. I bought another one before but didn&#x27;t work as much as this.</li>
            <li> Works great for the most sensitive areas.  Not so great for my neck, but I had so many years with a blade there I do some with the blade still and mustache and chin with this.  No rash and it&#x27;s faster.  Seems closer than the blade for my chin and upper lip too.  Been using it for a month, still love it.  Still miss my beard... but it will be a while until I grow it back.</li>
            <li> Great. My husband loves it!! And no messy sink from a straight razor.</li>
            <li> I give the shaver 5 stars and the instructions zero. I guess, I should get used to instructions that say nothing in 14 languages - written by the legal department. This was worse than most. I got a picture of a faucet on the small screen and couldn&#x27;t find out what it meant (in fairness, it was buried in the instructions). I called the support line and was told I needed to take it to a service center, since they didn&#x27;t show that icon as something that should be there. Unbelievable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in over 25 years, but minor surgery required me to buy one. This does a decent job and I am pleased with the actual shaver.</li>
            <li> Husband loves the razor and the price so much he bought another for a spare.</li>
            <li> I purchased the shaver and quickly realized it was well worth the price as a dry shaver.  Easy to charge and even has a small orange display that provides the current power percentage.  Often I can go five shaves without needing to recharge.  It provides a close dry shave every time.  Wet shaves are another story, often catching the hair and needing multiple passes to get anything resembling a acceptable shave.  The shaver is easy to clean and maintain.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a great buy, just skip the using it in the shower.</li>
            <li> My favorite razor. Does a nice  conferrtable shave. Light, easy to clean, and holds a good week charge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a hairy guy.  I used to use a Gillette Fatboy flat razor but only shaved every other day.  That was enough.  But since my doctor put me on blood thinners and I nicked myself and bled for 3 hours, I decided to buy an electric razor.  Years ago my wife bought me a Nurelco electric razor.  It did a mediocre job but what I disliked the most was the noise.  It was incredibly loud.  Fortunately, it died about 15 years ago and I switched to the Fatboy.  In doing research for this purchase, I decided my top price would be $100.  I cannot imagine spending more than that for an electric razor. But I wanted something that gave me a close shave and was quiet.  I chose the Panasonic ES8103S and I am glad I did.  The shave is close - as good as I ever got from the Gillette Fatboy, but there&#x27;s no chance of nicking myself.  And it&#x27;s quiet too.  I did notice that because of the way the razor works I have to shave regularly on a daily basis.  I also noticed that because the blades do not touch my skin that my skin is not irritated as it used to be from shaving.  I still use skin balm after shaving, but now I do it to smell nice.  The only CONS for this razor is that the charging wire should have been coiled, and the razor should have included a cleaning brush.  But for under $100 I cannot complain. (Perhaps I&#x27;m just cutting hairs??)  And if my Panasonic ES8103S  were to be stolen or broken by a mislaid hammer blow I would not hesitate to purchase another one just like it.  One more thing - other reviewers have complained that the razor won&#x27;t work while charging.  Well, this is a WET/dry electric razor.  If it&#x27;s plugged in and you decided to use it WET then it could kill you, so just maybe that&#x27;s why Panasonic decided to disable this feature. Eh?  UPDATE: I do not always shave on a daily basis yet find that this razor does an admirable job.  I do not know why my shaving is better than I found initially, and I really don&#x27;t care.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the Panasonic ES8103S razor and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It works very well and is easy to clean. I appreciate the fact that it is waterproof (it is easier to clean it by just passing it under the water) although I did not like to use it under the shower (it is not as smooth as when your face is dry).</li>
            <li> Bought this to help cut costs on blade razors.  It cuts close, but it&#x27;s not a blade.  Easy to clean.  Works well.  Have used for a couple years now, through a couple blade changes.  I use it during the week, then Sunday night, use a blade in the shower.</li>
            <li> Leaves behind a lot of hair, and the trimmer is basically useless.  The motor isn&#x27;t too loud, but this is a shaver I can&#x27;t endorse. (at least if you have course hair)</li>
            <li> I have always used Braun and bottom line is they really are the best. I had a Synchpro which, while large and heavy gave a great, close and smooth shave. This may become my back up/travel shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The Panasonic is compact, light and sits well in the hand. The trimmer cuts nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It&#x27;s a battle to get a smooth shave. I feel it pulling as it cuts, particularly on the upper lip area. Leaves my face a little sore which i never got with Braun shavers. I gave it a few months to see if it&#x27;s just my skin adapting, but to no avail. The battery also doesnt last particularly long.</li>
            <li> My husband had started shaving his head and I looked at reviews for this shaver, it does not disappoint! Delivery was fast and he absolutely loves it. He had purchased in the past much more expensive shavers but always went back to blade. NO MORE. Great Item</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver. First rate quality, first rate design, and superb shave.  Shaves my tough old Italian beard like it was peach fuzz, close, smooth, fast  and in perfect comfort.</li>
            <li> I replaced my previous Panasonic shaver (ES8103), since I had dropped it in the bathroom one too many times. This new shaver is identical in design, but works much better and is slightly quieter. This shaver is easy to like, because it works as advertised, has the percentage remaining charge displayed, recharges in less than 1 hour and has the detail trimmer conveniently located on the back side, easily accessible.</li>
            <li> Have been using this shaver for about 2 weeks. So far, so good. Very smooth shave, minimal skin irritation. I do have to go over certain parts a few times to get everything, but overall it is a very comfortable and smooth shave. I like the charge indicator and the cleaning mode - it doesn&#x27;t seem to make sense to buy a shaver with the special cleaning apparatus that you need to put cartridges into. This one seems to clean just fine with minimal time and effort (and no extra expense). My only pet peeve is the skimpy travel \\&quot;pouch.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The battery lasts for several days even after several years of use and I could not imagine going back to a shaver that can&#x27;t get wet. I don&#x27;t usually use it in the shower because I don&#x27;t have a mirror in there but works great either way. I hardly ever even use a blade because this makes shaving easier.</li>
            <li> I got tired of all the hassle and mess of shaving cream and blades and all that, and I&#x27;ve never looked back. This is comfortable, quick and effective. They warn you it&#x27;ll take 30 days for your face to get used to the switch, and maybe that&#x27;s true for a lot of people, but I don&#x27;t think it took that long for me.  Very reasonable price, too.  I should mention I do not have a heavy beard so I can probably get away with this pretty basic model.</li>
            <li> this was the elect. razor i&#x27;ve ever owned. not as close a shave as with a regular bladed razor with shaving gel, but good enough when in a hurry,</li>
            <li> I love this product. It shaves my beard w/ no problems and I never get razor burn! It works perfectly and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001DNE3KQ Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Rechargeable Linear Pivot Action Shaving System, Silver]]  Very impressed with razor. Never used an electric razor before but this one has really impressed me with quality of product and closeness off shave.</li>
            <li> This was probably the best electric razor I&#x27;ve owned until it stopped functioning.  It cut my facial hair very close but never did very well on my neck.  It definitely worked better in the shower than dry, and even better with shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read some other customers&#x27; reviews, and although this is supposed to be \\&quot;waterproof,\\&quot; I believe this is what killed my razor.  At first, the display started to fade and go in and out, and then the razor completely stopped working and the only thing I can think happened is that it got water inside it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope my warranty is still good because it&#x27;s too expensive of a razor to not work after six months.</li>
            <li> works great,  easy clean-up,  clear directions,  light in the hand with good ergonomics,  held the first charge for 8-9 shaves.  liked it a lot</li>
            <li> This is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve had so far.  I&#x27;ve had it for about six months.  It gives me a very close shave, it charges in less than an hour, and the charge lasts more than a week.  The wet/dry feature is useful for cleaning, though I can&#x27;t figure out why anyone would want to actually shave with a wet face.  When I got it, I was perturbed by a remark in the manual saying that, if the charging cord was damaged or lost, then you had to discard the shaver.  However, it turns out that replacement charging cords are in fact available.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After a two and a half years, the battery quit. Out of warranty of course.</li>
            <li> It is a very nice gift.  It works well and very easy to use.  I am happy with the product.  I have not had it for long but so far so good.</li>
            <li> This shaver does shave as close as 4-blade shavers but it takes longer.  I also have 4-blade shaver from panasonic and it definately works better compared to this one.</li>
            <li> This shaver was great initially - close and comfortable shaves. However, after only 6 months the foil and blades already need replacing. The shaver no longer shaves as it did when new, and the foil/blade assembly buzzes so loudly now that it is almost unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took very good care of this unit. I cleaned the foil and blades daily, with soap and warm water (and sometimes rubbing alcohol), and lubricated them with light mineral oil (baby oil). I expected the foil and blades to last much longer than this.  At about $30 a set, replacing the foil and blades for this shaver every 6 months would cost $60 per year. No thanks. Instead I just purchased another model new shaver for less than $30.</li>
            <li> This shaver is lightweight and charges quickly. Waterproof and not too loud.&lt;br /&gt;I replaced the screen and blades after about a year and it is still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;The battery capacity has diminished somewhat since I bought it, but I still get seven or eight shaves between charges.&lt;br /&gt;The sideburn trimmer is handy.&lt;br /&gt;It has a battery charge readout just below the button that is easy to read.&lt;br /&gt;It also shaves closer than other shavers I have owned, although not as close as a blade.</li>
            <li> Cuts really close but does not irritate skin.  Battery charge lasts long time before recharging is required.  Easy to wash clean</li>
            <li> THE RAZOR DOES A FAIRLY GOOD JOB  ON MY CHEEKS AND AROUND MY UPPER &amp; LOWER LIPS BUT IT DOESNT DO A GOOD JOB ALONG MY JAW BONE EDGES, CHIN AND NECK.  TO GET A GOOD SHAVE THERE I HAVE TO GO OVER THOSE PLACES WITH  MY MANUAL RAZOR</li>
            <li> A little over a year ago my Remington electric razor was stolen while on a trip in Las Vegas. I had the razor for several years and it was about time for a new one so I wasn&#x27;t too sad over the lose. For the past year I have been shaving with regular straight razors. I tried several brands from expensive ones to the cheap multipacks you can find at any drug/super store. I could not seem to find any razor that would shave me as close as my old Remington would, especially under the neck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Christmas my wife got me a new razor. I had sent a wish list of several that I was interested in and she settled on the Panasonic ES8103S. It was such a good choice! After charging and shaving with it just one time my skin has never been so smooth and I can tell how much I missed having an electric. This electric is much smaller than my previous razor and it&#x27;s contoured to fit the hand nicely. The trimmer works as expected and it&#x27;s a nice simple design. Upon reading over the manual I was pleasantly surprised this was truly a wet/dry razor, meaning that you can actually use it in the shower and not just get the head wet. It can even be submerged in water but not for long periods of time! I don&#x27;t plan on using it this way but it&#x27;s nice to know that I won&#x27;t damage it with a few drops of water here and there. The cleaning process is pretty simple and taking it apart for cleaning is a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had several electric razors over the years from Norelco and Remington and the Panasonic ES8103S is by far my most favorite that I&#x27;ve owned. For under $100.00 and a host of features I don&#x27;t think this razor can be beat. If you&#x27;ve had other electric razors you might be pleasantly surprised. If you&#x27;ve never used an electric give this a try for at least 30 days and you&#x27;ll probably never go back to a straight razor again!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for our office Christmas party. It was a lightening deal and I got it for a great price.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver mostly for the sideburn trimmer to trim my mustache and around the edges of my beard.  It does that well when it works, and shaves well also, but the sideburn trimmer started giving me trouble and finally got so unreliable I just gave up on this product altogether.  Also the saver is quite noisy.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver because of all the great reviews it received hoping it would be better than my old Norelco. Charging is really quick, and works well dry or wet. While it works great in general large spots on the face, the head on this shaver is so big that I can&#x27;t really get to the harder spots on my neck as easily as my Norelco did. Battery doesn&#x27;t last as long as the box says either. I can get maybe seven or eight really good shaves before the battery dies. I think I&#x27;ll stick with Norelco next time.</li>
            <li> Close shave and easy on the skin. The sideburn trimmer works well also. The noise level was acceptable and the shaver charged quickly.</li>
            <li> The shaver does a good job. A fresh cutter and block delivers a comfortable and effective shave.&lt;br /&gt;When a Panasonic shaver&#x27;s battery stops holding its charge well, it is time to replace the entire shaver instead of replacing just the cutter and block.&lt;br /&gt;At this price point that is economical to do.</li>
            <li> This product is very good. The razor doesn&#x27;t hurt near as bad as others have in the past. Gets a nice clean shave. Good product</li>
            <li> This razor works well... I love the charge.  It lasts for days!  Can shave in morning traffic! Only problem is musty smell from washing and replacing cap to quickly</li>
            <li> I previously owned a Norelco rotary razor.  The shave was mediocre and required a lot of time and a circular motion that was no easy with a beard.  This razor uses a straight, linear motion and provides a fast, close shave.  The battery lasts about three times longer than the Norelco.  The only downside is the cleaning.  The Norelco was a simple pop open and rinse with all parts still attached.  This one is not bad, but requires soaping and dis-assembly into separate parts. The dry time is also longer.  Overall, I would definitely purchase another.  Note: I have only owned it one month, so I do not know anything about the reliability over time.</li>
            <li> Replaced my old Braun with the Panasonic razor based on Amazon reviews.  Met all of my expectations.  Better shave than with my Braun.</li>
            <li> I still await the advent of an electric shaver that will actually shave ALL the hairs. There are always a few that won&#x27;t get cut and need a blade to be shaved. This razor does as good a job as any in my experience.</li>
            <li> the only thing I dont like about this product is that you cannot use it while charging it, my concern is that with time, when the battery starts to wear off I may not be able to use it. This is my second electric shaver, the first I had left my skin irritated during the first week of use. I used this shaver yesterday for the first time and no irritation at all, super close shave, and very powerful motor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shave wet or in the shower, so that&#x27;s not why I purchase this. I bought it because it was reasonably priced, got reasonably good reviews for closeness of shave, and the brand got good reliability ratings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Simple&lt;br /&gt;Easy to hold&lt;br /&gt;Works as well as any electric shaver&lt;br /&gt;Charges quickly&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean (because it can be run under the water)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Noisy (but no more than most others)&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t give as close a shave as real razor (but no electric shaver does)</li>
            <li> My husband has been using Braun shavers for 20+ years but has been dissatisfied recently with their performance.  He says he loves shaving with this razor it glides so smoothly great shave- the only negative is it is very loud!</li>
            <li> I used to have a Phillips shaver but when it died I decided to try this one, based in large part on some of the reviews here. I had come to expect a wet and dry shaver and this does that. It also charges very fast and the indicators are very useful in telling you how much power is left and when it needs a clean. But I have to shave for a while and it seems just good enough on that front... and that&#x27;s the front that really matters. Now I do have a coarse beard, but not a dense one. It&#x27;ll do for a while, but I think I&#x27;ll try swapping back to Phillips when this one is done.</li>
            <li> For the money, this product performs an adequate job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I like:&lt;br /&gt;-Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;-Shape/size&lt;br /&gt;-How close of a shave it can potentially get&lt;br /&gt;-How quickly you can shave if your beard is short (see below)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I don&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;-Does not do well with longer hair. If you don&#x27;t shave for a few days you definitely need to use a regular razor or trim your entire beard before using this. If hairs are too long they will lay flat and not get cut by the razor. This can lead to really long shave times and irritation&lt;br /&gt;-Pretty much have to go over the same area multiple times in different directions to get all hairs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this shaver does a good job. Would recommend if you shave every day, but not if you like to grow your beard long then shave (i.e. once every 4 days)</li>
            <li> Cleaner shave and plenty powerful! This razor gives a shave near as smooth as a straight edge. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The reviews tell a good story, the overwhelming majority of people give this one 4 or 5 stars because that makes sense. If you read through the reviews it will tell you two things: 1. people that got a defective unit complain instead of getting a new one and trying it out with a fair review. 2 No consumer product is perfect and nothing is ever going to make everyone perfectly happy. If you have reasonable shaving expectations from an electric shaver then this product will not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep the battery between %30 and %80 full and you can get many years out of it. Lithium Ion cells like the one used in this shaver do not like being fully charger or fully discharged repeatedly. Do not let this shaver sit on the charger for more than 40 minutes ever. The included charger dumps 5.2volts at 1.2 amps into the handle (fast charging), so you can easily get many shaves out of the unit from 20 minutes of charging. Again keeping the state of charge % between %80 and %30 is the trick to getting super long life out of the battery. By shallow charging and shallow discharging it, you will be rewarded with a battery that lasts and maintains its functional life for more than 10 years. The linear motor used in this shaver will outlast every other component in its assembly. Change the foil every year and the blade every 2 years according to the manufacturer/ and that said you can have many many years of high quality fast electric shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thinner 3 foil (2 blade) unit is better for curved facial surfaces than its 4 foil wide cousins. Stick to this one is you are accustomed to the facial contour following characteristics of a pivoting rotary type electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that this shaver is loud. I have not reviewed many electric shavers, and my old faithful Remington Rotary 460D titanium sounds tame and calm by comparison (and I just changed out the NiMH in that one so it lives on). It has a loud but not unpleasant buzz noise when operated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shaved with it 3 times now and love it :) Well done Panasonic/</li>
            <li> Works great. I have used an electric razor for years and this one works just as well if not better than any other I have used. My last Panasonic lasted about 8 years so I figured i&#x27;d get another. So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  Good product for the money and I find that it shaves extremely well.  Really glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I liked the reviews on this product and have never owned an electric razor before. So, I gave it a try. This thing takes longer than using regular razors and often misses whiskers no mater which direction i drag it. Charging function works well and the trimmer also does well. It&#x27;s just not a close enough shave to justify the price and time spent vs using a regular razor.</li>
            <li> Good and fast shave. Easy cleanup, and it wasn&#x27;t that noisy compared to my 20 year old Norelco HP1122 that died.&lt;br /&gt;However, I researched shavers for at least 3-4 weeks trying to find a quality corded only powered non disposable shaver. I wanted to avoid having a battery that will fail no matter what and own a shaver that might last me 20-30 years if I took really good care of it.&lt;br /&gt;I found one corded only powered shaver made by Norelco for about $30 but I was pretty sure that it was a piece of junk that wouldn&#x27;t last but a couple years so what would be the point. Although many of the shavers I looked at, bought and took back stated they would work corded as well as cordless, they will not work without a functioning battery. So, I think that is false advertising to make one believe a shaver will work without a battery. It won&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I couldn&#x27;t find one quality corded powered only shaver anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;I am really astounded that all the shavers made now are basically disposable. How many shavers hit the landfills around the world every year with the toxic batteries still inside them?&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing to me that we as a civilization are so aware of what kind resources are wasted by making such disposable products but yet we allow this to pass as OK. On top of that, what are the effects of all these toxic batteries going into our environment?&lt;br /&gt;Why then with this knowledge do we allow these companies to get away with making and selling toxic disposable products?&lt;br /&gt;At the very least the manufacturers should be mandated to take back the shavers they sell and remove the toxic battery. An added benefit to this would be that the manufacturer would be able to determine if the razor could be refurbished with a new battery and new parts then sold and used again.&lt;br /&gt;How hard would that be?&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I forgot profits first and the living planet and future generations last is our civilization&#x27;s mantra.&lt;br /&gt;All hail the mighty profit and dividend!&lt;br /&gt;If you think this practice is unacceptable contact the company and or policymakers/lawmakers and tell them to fix it.&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic ES8103S seems to be the best shaver for the price (@$68), Consumer Reports rated them high too,  plus allegedly you can take one to an authorized Panasonic repair shop and have them replace the battery. I assume though that this will cost one about as much as just buying a brand new shaver.  However, at least you&#x27;ll attain peace of mind knowing that your shaver and toxic battery didn&#x27;t end up in the landfill.&lt;br /&gt;All the best.&lt;br /&gt;sw</li>
            <li> My husband loves this one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a couple of weeks now and it is very useful. I have a tough beard, so it does take a little work. Still doesn&#x27;t do the job of a razor though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the shaver for about three weeks and it does a very good job.  I mostly use it with lather, but sometimes without.  It works well either way.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a rotary shaver for years and have been happy.  When the latest of those broke, I followed the reviews and the lower prices and decided on this as the best combination.&lt;br /&gt;It gives a closer shave than my rotaries did, but it seems like I have to shave significantly longer to get that close shave.  I did figure out that going at my face from all angles with this shaver (instead of just up and down) seems to help.  The shave seems to often leave one or two spare whiskers standing.  Easy enough to clip off with the built in clipper.&lt;br /&gt;I like that the shaver is very easy to clean.  For convenience and ease of memory I simply clean it every time it needs to be recharged (I don&#x27;t leave it plugged in all the time).&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I like how quietly this shave hums when it shaves.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews from customers on the product. My experience was the razor does NOT give a close shave. I shaved with this once and by 10am (after a 6am shave) people were asking me if I forgot to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to return this Panasonic for a refund!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyers beware.</li>
            <li> Great shave, very easy to clean without a complicated cleaner and solution - just soap and water</li>
            <li> This shaver fulfills the task for me. I do not sport a heavy beard and simply dry shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend product to someone not wanting to spend large monies to get the task done. It&#x27;s recharging capabilities are excellent and last every bit of the fourteen days.</li>
            <li> The shaver delivers a close shave.  It is easy to clean with just a little liquid soap and and water.  This is important to me because I can&#x27;t carry around one of those cleaning pods especially when traveling out of the country.</li>
            <li> Having used Braun shavers for many years, I was looking for a good shaver with a lithium-ion battery so the shaving speed would remain the same from recharge through discharge.  Consumer Reports rated this Panasonic shaver near the top of its ratings so I gave it a try, and so far, it is the best shaver I have ever used.  The shaver is fast and has a meter indicating the percentage of battery charge remaining.  The price of this shaver from Amazon.com is very good for a shaver with a lithium-ion battery.  Update:  I have stopped using this shaver as the battery will not retain a charge after only 3 years.</li>
            <li> I think in this price range we know what we are getting - not the bottom of the barrel cheap electric shavers that don&#x27;t stand up to the test of time, nor provide a good shave. We are also not geting the premium products that are very good but are quite more costly. We are getting something in between. I&#x27;ve had this shaver for almost 2 years now and have no major complaints. It gets the job done. Nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li> I love this new shaver.  It delivers the the best shave I have ever had with and electric shaver.  It is pretty close to a razor shave without all the prep.&lt;br /&gt;Works far better then my old Norelco shaver.  Cleaning is very easy and charge last about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since July of 2012. It&#x27;s now Feb. 2015. While you cannot use this when plugged in, the battery has lasted all this time, and holds a charge well. Works through my stubble so long as I don&#x27;t let it get too scruffy. When I do get lazy, the sideburn trimmer works decently enough to cut through everything, but there&#x27;s a trick to how you have to angle it. Don&#x27;t go straight at it, but angle the blade a bit and take your time. Then use the foil head to finish everything off.    The best part of this shaver is the cleaning. I&#x27;ve had Braun shavers for years with the cleaning bases, and having to buy the cleaning solution things all the time was really hurting my wallet. Those shavers are a waste. Get something like this that you can just clean off in the shower/sink.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8103s shaver works great.  It gave me a clean shave usint the Dry application.( Have not tried the Wet).&lt;br /&gt;I had purchased it as a replacement for my travel shaver. It size does not work that well for replaceing the one that I had.</li>
            <li> I got 5 PERFECT years out of this unit. I purchased my Panasonic ES8103S right here on Amazon in January 2010 and it has worked excellent up until just yesterday February 19, 2015 when it suddenly stopped taking a charge. You do have to replace the outer foils and inner blades about once a year to keep getting a good smooth shave with no tugging and as of the time of this post you can buy the replacement foil/blade set - Panasonic WES9013PC - for about $34. Been very happy with it and like I said - it worked perfectly for 5 years, held charge well, charged fast, shaved great for cordless electric. I&#x27;m actually kind of surprised that it just suddenly stopped charging yesterday out of the blue. I&#x27;ve dropped it several times over the past 5 years but not recently. Whether you think 5 years is a good run or not is up to individual opinion. For me - for the price of the unit and yearly foil/blade replacement, it sure saved me a ton of money on traditional blades and has been a very convenient / quick part of my daily grooming, so I&#x27;m not too disappointed in the 5 year span I got from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FACE / NECK SHAVING EXPERIENCE - I use this for dry shaving my face and neck with no pre-shave products, and it only took about a week for my skin to get used to it. During the first week of use I did get some minor irritation on my neck area under chin and around adam&#x27;s apple, but after that it was smooth sailing. It gives a smooth shave as close as you can for an electric. Fast, light, and comfortable. Just be sure to replace the foil/blade every 12 months which you can get here on Amazon - kit Panasonic WES9013PC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRIMMER EXPERIENCE - The trimmer on this Panasonic ES8103S is VERY small (but also very sharp) and in my experience easy to make a mistake with. I personally find the trimmer on this too small and awkward for trimming around my beard/mustache. I&#x27;ve resorted to buying a wider cordless trimmer with &amp;#34;guides&amp;#34; to use in addition to this. As a shaverthis unit is great, but for me personally the trimmer on it is placed in too awkward of a spot to trim with because the tiny trimmer sticks out of the side which makes it very hard to see exactly what I&#x27;m trimming with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR BALD HEAD / SKULL SHAVING - I shave my head bald and and from my experience - it&#x27;s great for face, but NOT so great for top of head / skull. Some reviewers here say it works good on their skull so I guess this is subjective to individual skin / hair types. If you want a good cordless shaver for both head and face, check out the Bald Eagle by Skull Shaver here on Amazon. While this Panasonic ES8103S gives a better face / neck shave under the chin, the Skull Shaver Bald Eagle does a better job for skull / entire head (especially for getting around ears and easily reaching around to do back of head and neck). If you do decide to get this Panasonic ES8103S and plan to use it on a bald head, then be prepared to by replacement foils/blades every 6 months because top of head stubble is tough and will dull the Panasonic ES8103S blades quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHARGING and OTHER FEATURES - This thing charges FAST and held the charge well over past 5 years of daily use. The LED indicator is very easy to read and makes it very obvious how much charge you have left. I only have to charge it about once a week and the shave is great all the way down to 10% of battery charge. The unit is very lightweight and the rubber grip is comfortable to hold at all angles. The ability to lock the head or switch it to pivot mode comes in handy for different areas of neck and face. The buttons to pop the foil cover off and dump stubble / rinse the blades are easy to press and make your daily routine quick &amp; simple!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL - You can&#x27;t go wrong with this shaver for fast dry close face/neck shave. It&#x27;s reliable, portable, comfortable, high quality, and super easy to clean / super easy to replace the foil and blade. I will not hesitate to buy another and I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have been using Panasonic wet/dry razors for more than fifteen years. Their only fault is that they do not last forever. I appreciate being able to lather my face and shave smoothly and without enduring the cuts that the most-refined safety razors inflict.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with this product. It doesn&#x27;t shave well.  You have to keep going over and over your face, which results in missed hair and not a very close shave.  It takes forever to get the job done with this shaver.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this shaver. He has skin irritations when shavings. He gets such close shave it helps with this new shaver.</li>
            <li> My primary razor is a Braun Series 7, which I keep at home.  I bought this Panasonic to replace my &amp;#34;travel razor.&amp;#34;  I like the Series 7 somewhat better, it shaves more quickly and feels sturdier -- but my goodness, the Panasonic cost 1/3 as much, and the difference in performance is just not that significant.  The Panasonic is light-years better than the travel razor it is replacing, which was a Braun priced between this one and the Series 7.  The shave is close yet gentle, it holds a long charge, and it is easy to clean.  A truly great razor for the price.</li>
            <li> That is, my husband loves it.  He broke his arm and that&#x27;s just what he needed.  Nice job.</li>
            <li> Replaced an older Panasonic foil shaver. The battery quit after 10 years. This is a very good shaver. It does a great job for me. Also like the pop up trimmer.</li>
            <li> came just as expected</li>
            <li> Not as good as a regular shave, only use it for a fast shave, but have to keep going over until its clean, and uses up all the charge</li>
            <li> Great shaver. Hot creamy shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> Alright, so as a razor this works... decently well.&lt;br /&gt;I have found that I can get a feasibly close shave with a little effort and some patience, but this electric razor just makes the most annoying high pitched whining sound when it is on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features I like:&lt;br /&gt; - Grip&lt;br /&gt; - Mobile head&lt;br /&gt; - Charge indicator&lt;br /&gt; - Personal bag&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features I do not like (or that are missing)&lt;br /&gt; - High pitched sounds&lt;br /&gt; - Can&#x27;t run while plugged in.&lt;br /&gt; - Flimsy in some places&lt;br /&gt; - Expensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, not nearly as troublesome as some razor&#x27;s out there. If the noise (my biggest peeve) is not a problem, definitely a great buy (on sale, NOT worth $100+).</li>
            <li> BATTERY LIFE SOSO.  Doesn&#x27;t cut well on heavy beard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a ok shaver, but save your money and get a Braun instead it&#x27;s just a better product.</li>
            <li> Good clean shave, long charge, no complaints. Wet/dry is handy feature, as is the cleaning method. Would recommend to friends and family. One minor suggestion: the thumb rest should be a non-slip surface.</li>
            <li> I have tried electric razors in the past with no real happiness. I was referred to this model by a friend and boy o boy were they on to something. I love the ability to have a wet shave and easy clean up. This razor is great!</li>
            <li> This was purchased for a man whose illness caused his skin to become very sensitive and any cuts would have been dangerous. He absolutely loves the shaver and can&#x27;t say enough about how much he appreciates it.</li>
            <li> Wanted a shaver that&#x27;s easy on the skin, easy to handle, doesn&#x27;t overheat, doesn&#x27;t burn, and gets the job done decently.  This model met the requirements at a very reasonable price, about the same cost as 36 pivoting razorblades,</li>
            <li> Only been using this thing about a week now but absolutely love it! It gets close to the skin and feels like i just used a razor. I was hesitant about purchasing at first but pulled the trigger and do not regret it, especially when Amazon had a $15 coupon. I have used it with lather and without, I would not recommend with lather. It seem to make the hairs lie down, and made it more of a pain to get them. I had to dry my face thoroughly and then shave again to get a closer shave. All in all, excited about my purchase and still have about 20% of battery life left after a week of use.</li>
            <li> Works very well as a dry or wet shaver. Gives a clean, close shave. Easy to clean. I charge it every three days. Would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several shavers and s;pent a lot of money trying to find a decent shaver for my son.  Even bought a $90 Braun Series 3.  It worked for awhile but the mesh grill got holes in it after a year and having to pay $30 for the snap on head replacement is ridiculous.  I researched on  the internet and came across a website where the guy actually uses every shaver he reviews and writes a blog about his experience and makes videos of him shaving with each shaver.  He liked this one so I did a little more research to make sure and bought this.  My son likes it, it&#x27;s easy to use, well made, shaves very close (which the Braun didn&#x27;t do).  He&#x27;s pleased so I am too.</li>
            <li> Been using the ES8103S for several months now and have had no problems so far.  Purchased this to replace a 6 year old ES8077 shaver which was no longer giving close shaves even with a new cutting block and foil.  It had also gotten really loud (more about that below).  It did however still hold and deliver a full charge - very impressive compared to some Braun shavers I owned in the past.&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the ES8077, and I still have one that I use as a backup (it&#x27;s almost still new).  I had a little concern going from a &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; cutting head to a curved &amp;#34;arc&amp;#34; one.  This has turned out to be a complete none issue for me (everyone&#x27;s face is a little different so your mileage may vary).  The battery in the ES8103S lasts just as long as my old ES8077, and the shaving results are similar compared to a new ES8077.&lt;br /&gt;I have to comment about some reviewers saying this shaver is so loud that it hurts their hearing.  Here is what I measured using an android sound meter app.  Sure, it&#x27;s not scientific but good enough for a quick apples-to-apples comparison.  The new ES8103S measured at 52 dB, my almost new ES8077 measured at 54 dB, and my old, retired ES8077 measured at 75 dB.  I guess when these things get old they get pretty mechanical loose and subsequently very noisy.  I have fairly sensitive hearing, and I can say for certain that the ES8103S is not damaging my hearing.&lt;br /&gt;All in all the ES8103S has turned out to be a good replacement for the ES8077.  Will update this review if any problems develop.</li>
            <li> good price~&lt;br /&gt;good item~</li>
            <li> Had the raiser now for more than 6 months, maybe a year? Still working, also never as good as my previous Panasonic Wet/Dry one, feels a bit clunky and the LED that shows the loading status has given up on me, only two sections lighting up making it rather difficult to read, also you can if you hold it against the light and look very closely. Will get another one once the battery dies on this one. Shaving with a Gillette every day and only use this one for some detail work under the nose, etc. Not good enough to use by itself, but that might just be me as I have that problem with every electric shaver.</li>
            <li> My first bad experience with you guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made a trip to US (only one week) and I was so excited to have this Panasonic shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened this order, a terrible surprise, the original box from my ES8103S was already opened and immediately realize a used product full of (someone) beard on it. Such a great gift, right?!?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I would not have time to return it to you.</li>
            <li> Great Product have used it for several years and always performs well. Does not shave as quickly and close as previous Panasonics I have owned but works better than a Norelco and Remington. For the price it is a good value. blades will last about a year for a good shave. trimmer could be a little better.</li>
            <li> Update Dec 2016: I&#x27;ve been using this razor for nearly 4 years. It still works well. I changed the blade and foil set together a few months ago. I think the battery life has fallen a bit. But everything works. LCD, trimmer etc. Compact and no fuss. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend any more to get a fancier razor. I still recommend the razor.  Original June 2013: I have always used a blade and shaving cream and I continue to use a Gillette Fusion razor. I needed a razor to keep in my laptop bag for those days one gets up too late for a proper shave.  I researched a lot before picking up this razor. Ultimately I wanted something that was cheap to maintain (replacement blades/foils), comfortable and durable. The durability bit is still to be tested, but it is a comfortable razor to hold and it is not too noisy.  Just to get the hang of it, I have been using it everyday and I get results as good as a razor and blade.  That said, if I start with a couple of days of growth (say after a weekend), the razor takes some time to give good results. I have to go over some areas repeatedly to get desired results. Given the time it takes, one is better of using a plain razor and shaving cream.  I would recommend it as a backup shaver. Will update this review after some time (Panasonic mentions 30 days) to see if extended beard growth can be handled more effectively.</li>
            <li> I strongly recomend this! Shave very clean and perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost nothing left after shave. Easy control and even wet shave works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Very pleased. It&#x27;s only con is the inability to function while charging. It shaves some better than the best Braun and trims much better.</li>
            <li> I bought this Panasonic Wet/Dry electric razor last February 2013 to replace my tired Braun 5614 Wet/Dry. The price of replacement blades for the outdated Braun were as much as I paid for the new Panasonic, so no contest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic gives me a much closer shave than the old Braun was capable of and I am now a fan of the Panasonic brand. However there is a downside and therefore a good reason for not giving this unit a 5 star rating. As much as I have come to appreciate this particular razor, it appears that the small digital LCD-info display has given up the ghost; that is to say that the display has become unreadable and therefore unusable after just nine months of service. This is somewhat of a disappointment as the razor continues to deliver a close shave and is otherwise a fine product. But that is what these reviews are for, full disclosure to help other potential consumers make an informed choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE; XMAS day 2013: This is a follow-up to my original 4-star review as shown above. This unit just died today and is now completely unusable. I have not been hard on this razor, using it on average every other day. A few weeks ago the LCD display started acting up and became unreadable; however this did not seem to affect the shaver function, so I continued to use it thinking it would become my travel razor. Then a couple of days ago I went to use it and it was completely dead. I was able to use it plugged in (which I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s suppose to do?), but worked. I then left it to fully charge and later noticed with the bath lights out that the LCD was blinking/flashing and would not stop. This morning when I went to use it was completely dead, so I tried the plug-in routine again and that did not work-nada, nothing, dead! I would be very hesitant to buy another Panasonic w/LCD display or otherwise and must face Xmas day with stubble. Any suggestions for a replacement wet/dry shaver would be welcome.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor.  I&#x27;ve used the Braun and Norelco and love this one the best over the 5 blade systems.</li>
            <li> My son needed his first razor.  This is the best for a young teen with acne.  He uses it after showering, when his stubble is flexible and it does just as described.  Nice close shave.  The other best thing is that it is waterproof.  At 13, he doesn&#x27;t want any help or guidance for instruction of use from a parent.. It was easy for him to use with just a viewing of a YouTube video for instruction.  The /storage/carrying bag is a great perk and the battery holds a good charge for many shaves.  He has quite a bit of growth for a teen and shaves once or twice a week, if we are lucky.</li>
            <li> For over 50 years I have been a confirmed blade shaver, although at various times the nicks and cuts that I experienced led me to try various electric shavers.  They have always disappointed me until now.  I have been using this product for over a week for wet shaving, using shaving cream and already find that it delivers as comfortable and close a shave as I have ever had from a blade.  I don&#x27;t think I will be going back to the risky blade any time soon.</li>
            <li> This shaver has done exactly i hoped, given me that close shave without the burns and irritation i normally got when i used a standard razor. I have used it almost daily since I bought back in Feb this year. Only reason i didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because if your shaving and its been awhile, it tends to miss the longer hairs, i only have this problem on my neck and not a huge deal, just hit with a regular blade, Battery lasts a long time between charges. I also use in and out of shower, but prefer to do it before the shower, seems to work better that way. Overall great product, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Battery charge lasts less than a week when fully charged. Extremely loud when compared to other electric shavers I&#x27;ve used. And I have to spend twice as long shaving than I do with my other razor. I gave it a couple of months thinking maybe it was just taking my face longer to adjust to the new razor, but it never improved. Lots of missed hairs even though I spent more time shaving. I&#x27;ve since gone back to my old Norelco (battery charge lasts a full month). I wasted my money trying this one.</li>
            <li> Takes getting used to, and there&#x27;s not magic to it. It all depends on your expectations--and your whiskers, what quality--tuf, thin, thick, sparse--they are. This is much better for me than blades and water, but I&#x27;ll probably replace my Norelco&#x27;s shaving head and use that machine instead.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item when I was deployed in Afghanistan as a birthday givt to my friend in MN . He didn&#x27;t get and I didnt get my money back.....&lt;br /&gt;I cannot get a hold of the seller so its game on&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t want anybody to pay money for something that they will never get.....</li>
            <li> This Panasonic ES shaver provides a good close shave, however, most importantly, it is easy to clean and maintain.  ted m.</li>
            <li> Got it on sale and am not disappointed. Doesn&#x27;t do well with long hair, but it&#x27;s great if you shave every day. Charges very quickly. Sometimes you end up with hair on your shirt when shaving your face, but cleaning it and shaving regularly prevents this.</li>
            <li> Great: price, quality, brand and product in general. I have this as a gift for my boyfriend and he is super happy!</li>
            <li> i like it.it fits me well.i think i will chooes Panasonic againe.if so i want to change  5-Blade (Arc 5).</li>
            <li> My dad is pleased with this razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very smooth and has a great battery live.  It takes sometime getting used to but it&#x27;s worth it.  Trimmer not good for long beards.</li>
            <li> Charges quicker than my BrAun &amp; Remington that I have now retired , cut closer than a blade with less irritation &amp; the speed at which the cutting blades travel makes the job quicker. I have a Panasonic nose trimmer and I am very satisfied so I decided to try another of their product. One negative is that the battery discharges too quick after a complete head &amp; facial cut.</li>
            <li> flexible and quiet-a good fast shaver with a good trimmer.Easy to clean too. Re-charges fast. An all around good razor.</li>
            <li> why did Panasonic have to change to power plug from an earlier version?  I purchased this as a lightning deal, seeing that it was cheaper than buying replacement blade and foil for my existing shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with both products, but thought that the components would be a little more interchangeable--this new shaver will not recharge in the cleaning/charging station with my first shaver, and even the power tips are different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself works fine (as does my previous one), it is just frustrating that the mfr&#x27;s have to change these things from model to model.</li>
            <li> A great electric rechargeable shaver. Very multiple function shaver. I have purchased Norelco, Phillips, etc.,. Nothing can beat this shaver at the price.</li>
            <li> one of the best shavers i have had. great doing a wet shave&lt;br /&gt;i truly  think this is a great shaver</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my son and he loves it. A close shave. Much better than his previous three head razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks and have foound the razor to cut well, easy to clean and holds a charge for several days.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle and efficient cutting...</li>
            <li> i got it for my dad. i have the 4 blade one which does  a better job at cutting. but this one is ok to get started out on electrical shavers. &#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesnt do a bad job, u just have to work more at it.</li>
            <li> Ideal travel companion. Shaves smootly without much effort. Giving 4 for shaving finish not equivalent to razor. Love this one.</li>
            <li> I got a decent shave but a little noisy. The charge seems to hold well as described. No other issues with this product so far.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who has been wrestling with an expensive brand, self-cleaning electric shaver that started off working well, but quickly went downhill.  He loves this shaver - especially since he can use it dry or in the shower.  He says &amp;#34;its really nice&amp;#34; and I can testify to his smooth, clean-shaven skin.  Hope it keeps working this well!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks. It looks good. Works fine.....corded use w&#x27;d have been good. But it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> My hubby requested an electric razor and after going through many reviews I decided on this one. A main decision factor was that you could use it wet/dry. So far he loves it especially when he needs to get a fast shave in. This shaver gives a close smooth shave all your wives/girlfriends will appreciate! It charges fast and does the job.</li>
            <li> Thisis worse thatn the one I had over 10 years ago. Very hard on face and the chin area is very difficult to get to work. I will say the battery is ok and the thing looks good, but it is not that great of a razor.</li>
            <li> Never tried to shave with a hatchet but this shaver may be as close as I ever come. Not in the same league with triple header shavers.</li>
            <li> Close shave in a quiet razor, lightweight and easy to handle. Replaces my 10 year old panasonic razor that still works,but I couldn&#x27;t pass up the price....</li>
            <li> I ALSO HAVE BOUGHT A RQ1150,COMPLETED WITH IT,8103S IS MORE NOISE,AND 1150 SEEMS TO BE A MORE EXPENSIVE ONE,MORE SUIT TO BE A GIFT.BY THE WAY.I AM CHINESE CONSUMER .SHAVERS ARE TOO EXPENSIVE IN CHINA.ON AMAZON CHINA,RQ1150 WILL COST OVER 200 US$.I BOUGHT 1150 ON BLACK FRIDAY WITH ONLY 55,AND BUY THIS WITH 55.CONCERN ABOUT TAX AND SO ON.I PAID LESS THAN 100$ FOR EACH ONE.VERY NICE.</li>
            <li> Great razor ,great price it does all I want it to do .its wet or dry better than my old Braun</li>
            <li> This has been a pretty good shaver, though I should note that the battery life is less than my old Braun.  I need to shave quickly if I want this battery to last me 5 shaves.</li>
            <li> This is the worst shaver ever I want my money back does not cut at all....guys please trust me do not buy!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My husband used to shave once a week using a razor because he has sensitive skin, but mostly because he just hated shaving.  He expressed some interest in trying an electric razor so I did some research and purchased this one.  My husband LOVES it and now shaves every other day!  It provides a very close shave and leaves the skin very soft.  My husbands sensitive skin shows no signs of irritation.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done.  Who the hell likes to shave?  Not me, but this razor gets it done and admirably.  Nice close shave with minimal touch up with a hand razor.</li>
            <li> Our third ES8103. Replaces an earlier identical gift to a brother who had the battery finally fail on his first Panasonic. Neither of us have found a better shave than we get with the ES8103 (forget the cleaning system, however. It&#x27;s a serous waste of countertop space, to say nothing of the costly cartridges).</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this shaver.  Easy to use and clean.  The battery indicator helps a lot.  Charges quickly and lasts for about 6 shaves on one charge.</li>
            <li> This is my first &amp;#34;foil&amp;#34; electric shaver and I am very happy with it. Before this I had only used those circular blade type electric shavers. The problem I had with those shavers is that if I didn&#x27;t shave every day or every other day then come back to use the electric shaver, the shaver would PULL the hair and not cut it so well. With this shaver I haven&#x27;t had any pulling from it and I also am getting a pretty close shave. It also doesn&#x27;t take very long for me to give a quick once over and it is cool that it can work wet or dry. I would recommend other people who have never tried a foil shaver to definitely give this one a try. I am also pretty sure Panasonic gives refunds if you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading a Consumer&#x27;s Report review, and couldn&#x27;t be happier. This is just one dang fine shaver, holds a charge for weeks, super easy to clean, even in the shower! Very easy to hold in the hand, and has a selectable flex head, or keep it fixed, I like both settings for different parts of my beard. What is not to like?</li>
            <li> use it for shaving everyday,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;trimmer works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;shave not as close as a shaver, but this was expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;works better with a litter water or lather .</li>
            <li> Bought it, tried it and ehhhhhhh... what is the big fuss about this shaver. I have a tough beard and I didnt get a close shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several inexpensive electric razors over the past decade.  This one gives a pretty poor shave.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> So so electric razor. You have to go over the same area several times in order to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> It shaves closer and in less time than my prior older model Panasonic that did good service for many years.</li>
            <li> It really is a wonderful shaver.  It does work either wet or&lt;br /&gt; dry. Great purchased for the price.  I really recommended.</li>
            <li> Not a fancy shaver but gets the job done. The charge is about 1 hr from below 10% to full, which can stand for approximate 20 shavings at least. The shaver is also washable, making it very easy to clean and stay fresh (big plus!).</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver to replace a 5 year old, top of the line, other manufacturer&#x27;s shaver. What an improvement.  The shave is close and comfortable with no irritation.  I love the wet/dry feature and easy clean-up. I&#x27;d recommend this to shaver to anyone.</li>
            <li> What can I say, it is the best shaver I have ever had. I would recommend these to everyone. I sit in my kichen in the morning and eat breakfest while I shave, with no problem.</li>
            <li> when using popup trimmer, shaver blades should be turnoff&lt;br /&gt;only 4 mth from purchase&lt;br /&gt;need to send it back and wait for replacement!</li>
            <li> The Panasonic Arc 3 is a sleek shaving machine. I&#x27;ve tried Norelco, Remington, and Braun over the years, but the Panasonic is king. I like these so much that I&#x27;ve purchased one for each of my sons. For the closest shave, I use the Arc 3 wet with &amp;#34;Kiss My Face&amp;#34; moisture shaving lotion. The speed of shaving and the closeness can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> Dear Customer Service: 14 MAR 2014  8:07 AM EST..I am a little disappointed in the shaver..it takes much to long to shave in the morning....and it is very nosie..Chris Ligor</li>
            <li> This provides a nice, close shave. I am female and this is far better than any electric shaver I have found that is marketed toward women. The battery lasts quite a while, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also recharges pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this both wet and dry. It works well dry. It also works well with shaving cream.  Cleaning is easy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers for decades and this is the first that didn&#x27;t have the option to run off of household current.  I was a little hesitant to rely solely on a rechargeable battery but this Panasonic works as advertised.  I charge it about once each week and rinse it under the hot water faucet about twice a week for the past two years.  I would give it 5 stars but I have yet to own an electric shaver that didn&#x27;t require two passes over my heavy beard to get all the stubble.  Still much more convenient then a safety razor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it in the shower but it is nice being able to wash it off and wet it to shave with. Makes shaving my neck easy too, something I would never have done with my Norelco.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving but unfortunately I am part bear so I need to everyday if I want to avoid looking like a hobo. The reason I hate shaving with a regular blade is it takes so long and I cut myself 95% of the time. When I received this razor for Christmas I was very excited to alleviate these problems. Now instead of cutting my face it becomes irritated causing my neck to break out. It does a terrible job on my neck no matter how many times I go over it. The only real benefits of this razor are it makes less of a mess than regular shaving and can give a decent shave quickly in the morning. A good shave can take a very long time and even then with my neck I&#x27;d need to use a regular razor to truly remove the hair. I clean it more than needed to try to improve performance and go slowly but neither of those show much improvement. A huge disappointment that&#x27;s not worth the price for the slight convenience.</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it and uses it everyday.  It really does give a nice close shave!  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I was sick of buying shavers for my Gillette. The cost for a 12 pack was about the same for this, so I figured it was worth a try. The reviews mainly swayed my purchase. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now, and I have to say it gets a little getting use to. I love the features this has, like the light up LCD screen that shows the battery level and when it&#x27;s time to rinse the blades clean. It also has a trimmer that folds out for precision trimming. It is a wet/dry razor, which is nice if you like to change it up once in a while. I use it for dry shaving only. At first it felt funny and I could feel a little bit of a pull when running across my skin. It did however get pretty darn close to the skin which I was surprised with. The head can be switched to stay in place, or move with you as you shave which I found leaving it in the moving position gave me a closer shave. I have noticed a considerable decrease in razor burn which I am super grateful for, however the first 2 shaves I noticed my skin had to &amp;#34;get used&amp;#34; to the switch. I mean that I had a few bumps, primarily by the throat area, but on my cheeks &amp; chin the shave was great. Once thing I would like to note though is when dry shaving, I noticed that my skin became a lot dryer while shaving.  I just threw on some lotion afterwards and I was good to go! Overall it did a great job, however it had a tougher time on the neck. I learned that shaving towards the hair on the neck seems to get the closest shave though. I think you just need to experiment in different directions until you get the right one for each section of your face. I use up &amp; down on the jaw line, mouth and chin. And I use a diagonal back &amp; forth for the neck and throat areas. I will probably never go back to shaving cream and a blade after this because its so easy, quick and the clean up is SO easy. Just empty the hair clippings, and rinse the blade under running water and it&#x27;s done.</li>
            <li> Among Shavers I bought, this is best.&lt;br /&gt;Low price drive me happy.&lt;br /&gt;..&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Panasonic ES8249 for about one year. It&#x27;s a marvelous shaver deserving the highest rating. ES8249 is a wet/dry washable so I use liquid soap pored into running shaver which provides a delightful shave experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I owned the Panasonic I owned a Braun which I thought was great too but Panasonic is a step above, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have only used this razor 3 times, but so far I like it.  The shaves are close and blade smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used an electric razor for some time and although I am not getting bad irritation, I have gotten shaving bumps.  So for right now I have gotten Shave Secret to see if that helps, at least until my face becomes used to the electric again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last electric razor was a corded Remington, which was a pretty bad razor.  It tended to pull more than cut...possibly due to a slower motor speed.  And I last was using Remington King of Shaves 5 blade razors, which I think were the worst disposable razors I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Charges fast&lt;br /&gt;Easy cleaning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Hard to get parts of neck&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update after I have used it more.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend&#x27;s birthday. After reading reviews, I thought it would be worth the money. Unfortunately this shaver has a very difficult time cutting through my boyfriend&#x27;s beard. I was hoping for a more heavy duty product. I would not recommend this for any men with thick wiry beards.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver..I also bought the wahl shaver which I don&#x27;t use very much because that one is a lot noisier and pulls my 4-5 or 6 day old beard.Which is the reason I started using an electric shaver . A one or two day beard gets done with my razor which is my preferred shave.This panasonic shaver I really love when I let my beard grow too long. It is working out very nice for me when the beard gets too long for my razor. Very rarely does it pull a hair..Howerver I usually follow up after using it with a razor because I don&#x27;t like to continuously go over my face to get the last hair and I really like clean close shave</li>
            <li> The shaver from Pansonic is very quickly, can shave your all hair on your skin. The shaver have a digital led screen can show you how many power remaining so it is convinent. The only discomfort is noise, but you not need use the shave more than 5 minites each time, so it &#x27;s not bad i think.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my teen son with his soft skin, this  thing didnt do the job and started to harm his skin without even shave the small hair in his face. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> Works as well as any I&#x27;ve had - - - - - - - - - - - - - -.</li>
            <li> Years ago when I was college student and later in life, the electric shavers I purchased were unsatisfactory. Why because I was unable to get a close shave due to sensitive skin. After reading the reviews about this shaver, i decided to take another chance with electric razor This razor is stellar as I get close shaves without hurting my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The shaver does not shave as close as the Remington and Braun foils. The battery life is short but that explains the lightweight feel. I have had a Panasonic shaver before and still the same issues. The Remingtons are the best for the money.</li>
            <li> I find this to be a big step up from the Braun I had.  It is quiet, the swivel head is comfortable, and the shave is quick and close.  It goes more than a week on a single charge.  What more could we want, guys?</li>
            <li> I have used electric razors for more than 25 years. I have a dense course beard and sensitive skin and found that using an electric foil razor gave me the closest shave with the least irritation. Prior to this purchase I have exclusively used Braun razors. After my latest Braun&#x27;s battery ceased holding a charge I decided to look at other companies products. I found this Panasonic highly rated and at a good price. I decided to take a chance and bought this ES 8103s. I have now used the razor for almost six months.&lt;br /&gt;I have been very pleasantly surprised. This razor has exceeded my expectations. I am getting the closest most comfortable shave of my lifetime. Minimal irritation and no cuts. By the way, I highly recommend using Afta pre-electric shave lotion if you shave &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;. This razor shaves both wet or dry. I have not tried shaving in the shower or with a shaving cream. As a &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; razor I clean it with liquid soap and rinse it under running water in the sink. No need to pay for more expensive razors and their cleaning systems.&lt;br /&gt;All is not perfect. The razor did not come with a travel case. The hair trimmer is mounted on the rear of the razor and as other reviewers have noted this limits the users ability to clearly visualize where the trimmer will cut. I consider both of these as minor complaints for a razor that superbly performs it&#x27;s primary function.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband for Christmas.  He loves, loves it.  Very close shave without the nicks and burns!  Our son tried it, and guess what, I had to order him one too!  Holds a charge for 6 to 7 shaves and is very lightweight.  The Amazon price was AWESOME!!</li>
            <li> Battery could have lasted a bit longer as it seems to run out of charge much quicker than my old Panasonic charger of 3.5 yrs</li>
            <li> I did not like this razor. it has a bad quality. In the begining, it worked perfectly but 6 months later it stopped working.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it, especially because he can use it wet or dry. The shave is not as close as it gets with a razor, but definitely good enough.</li>
            <li> Nice blade, quiet enough, easy to use, easy to clean. I satisfied completely now. My old blade  &amp;#34;Braun&amp;#34; was much  noiser.</li>
            <li> Never used such an electronic shaver before..easy to use too.. Used other products before, but this is best. Go go go go for it</li>
            <li> I just got this shaver 2 weeks ago after using the same Norelco rotary for over 30 years. Except for replacing the blades the Norelco was great until in the past 2 years it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge and I had to plug it in everytime I used it. So I decided to try this shaver. When I first turned it on the display showed 10% charged so I charged it and a half hour later it still showed 10%. I ran the battery down until it was 0% and charged it again and it charged to 100%. I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard and shave about every 2 or 3 days. The instructions say to use it for 30 days to see best results. It gives me a good shave so far. The only complaint I would have it is very loud. Louder then my 30 year old Norelco. I like the tilting head and travel bag.</li>
            <li> I have a fairly coarse beard, and this shaver just wasn&#x27;t up to the task.  The holes in the foil need to be larger?  Anyway, I&#x27;m going back to the rotary type, It did a much better job for me.</li>
            <li> I had tried several electric shavers every since I started shaving in my teens but until I tried a Panasonic nothing seemed to work well enough. I wasn&#x27;t just trying cheapy brands or models either but certainly not top of the line ones average price was $120 to $200. So I was shopping one day and noticed a Panasonic model on clearance, price was $30 (regularly $70) so i figured why not, panasonic was about the only one I hadn&#x27;t tried. I absolutely loved that shaver, it worked like a charm for over 6 years with only 1 blade change, sadly though the battery would no longer hold a charge long enough for an entire face. I could not find Panasonic in any local stores anymore so I returned to the double edged blades and well, kind of forgot about it for awhile. Came across it a several months later while shopping at amazon and made an impulse buy. Still the best electric shavers I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Have been using electric shavers many years and  for the price  the best buys I it is easy to use easy to clean and easy to use</li>
            <li> Worth of buying. It works for regular shaving. Still want to explore more. As of used trimmer also. Over all good one</li>
            <li> It gives a close shave.  I had a Norelco before and felt like I could cover the areas better, but I may just not be use to the Panasonic yet.  I think I will like it better the more I use it.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is only my second electric razor ever. So far, I love it. It is smooth and very delicate on my skin (which is also very delicate lol). It charges quickly and it has a nice display that tells you how much power it has left. Easy to clean and store. I got it for 50 bucks here on Amazon and it is totally worth my money!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas. He always complains that everyti,e he buys a nice electronic shaver, it pulls on his facial hair. This one got good reviews so I figured we give it a try. He absolutely loves it. It charges ridiculously fast and it gave him a super close shave; almost as if he had used a razor. He liked that it also had a beard trimmer since he has a goatee. The best part is that it does not pull his facial hair at all.</li>
            <li> Close shave. Quick Charge. Light. Floating head or locking head. I recommend it. Easy to Clean. Try it out. A+</li>
            <li> Not at all happy with this razor.  Replacement of blades and screen are required more often than other razors I have owned.  Manufacturer refused to replace the battery unless it was under warranty, even though I offered to pay for it.</li>
            <li> EL PRODUCTO LLEGO OK, TAL Y COMO LO OFRECIERON ESTOY TOTALMENTE SATISFECHO CON EL MISMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMIENDO AL VENDEDOR ES BASTANTE RESPONSABLE</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband he has told me several times how much he loves its and how great it works</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husband for Christmas. So far, no complaints; it operates as described and he gets a close shave. It is still early in the game but hopefully it will continue to be perfect.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in over 35 years. This one shaves me almost as close as a blade without the hassle of shaving cream. Recharges in short order. Very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Not knowing a lot about men&#x27;s shavers, I knew my husband wanted a new one so I bought this particular product due to much research and positive reviews. He LOVES IT! It takes a couple of weeks to begin \\&quot;memorizing\\&quot; each individual man&#x27;s face-as all shavers do- but it gives him a great smooth shave. He raved about the 3 blades and swivel action. He also is impressed with the trimmer. Another great purchase from Amazon!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas.  He really likes it.  It gives him a good shave and is easy to recharge.</li>
            <li> Hat tip to reviewers who said the three blade was better than the four - I&#x27;ve had it for a week and so far it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> What a difference over my old shaver.  Shaves close and without snags.  Have not tried it wet yet, but did a GREAT job dry.  Excellent unit!</li>
            <li> I love this shaver. The fact that it is small and inanimate are the only things that prevent me from making love to this shaver. It has changed my life. I used to look at people on TV and in movies and feel I could never be as cool as they are. Guess what? I was wrong. This shaver has taught me that anyone can achieve their potential, Anyone can unlock the great secrets of the universe. As vast as the universe may be, I exist for a reason. I mean something. I&#x27;m somebody. Thank you, shaver. Thank you. I also love the &amp;#34;Time to clean&amp;#34; alert.</li>
            <li> I am a black male with very stubborn facial hair. After joining the police force, I&#x27;m required to have a clean shave. I started using the razor and found that I was experiencing painful razor bumps and in-grown hair problems. When my facial hair grows in, it comes in fast and wild. My wife surprised me with the Panasonic ES8103S Arc3 after searching the internet and watching multiple videos. After using the electric shaver I stopped using the razor and foud that the in-grown hairs have subsidded and the razor bumps have disappeared, some what. I am still new to using this devise but like the fact that I can shave wet/dry and daily. You must take your time when using this shaver and when you do, you&#x27;ll find that you get a nice clean shave. It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Long battery life (about 10 days), but you have to run the razor from different directions to get a reasonably close shave.</li>
            <li> Like pushing a steel garden rake thru a Berber carpet.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a long time Amazon and Panasonic shaver customer and I&#x27;ve never been so disappointed in a brand name appliance.&lt;br /&gt;No wonder they ask you to try these things out for a month to adjust to your beard.....because most retailers only give you a month to return these things back to them for a full refund.  Time&#x27;s up, you own it.&lt;br /&gt;This review is based on 3 Panasonic shavers in relation to this current product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ES-SA40:&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Real smooth and close shave that was a cheap and light weight work horse.&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Noisy, single blade, heavy vibrate, 8 hour charge and most of all.......no good for two day old shaves.  This unit can&#x27;t cut long hairs like your tri-blade shavers can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ES-8018:&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable, linear tri-blade that shaves close with shorter charging periods.&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Heavy to hold and use.  The trimmer broke off for no apparent reason as it wasn&#x27;t abused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The now ES-8103S:&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Light weight, linear tri-blade that&#x27;s relatively quiet and charges in about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Like pushing a steel garden rake thru a Berber carpet.&lt;br /&gt;I found this shaver painful, particularly in the mustache area when using pre-shave lotion or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;I personally believe that style had priority over performance with this unit.&lt;br /&gt;After using this shaver, mainly for long hairs, I still use my ES-SA40 for a once over to pick up all the missing stubbles that the ES-8013S left behind.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Oh, you&#x27;ll get there with this ES-8103S.....it&#x27;s just that you&#x27;ll feel every irritating scrape/jerk/bump along the way.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be moving to a Braun for my next shaver.</li>
            <li> A while back I ordered a Braun 700-something model. I discovered that a Braun, which I had been using for years and years, is no longer a &amp;#34;Braun&amp;#34; now that the shavers are made in Mexico. A switch on the Braun shaver broke off right out of the box: plastic!  So, I&#x27;ve been using a hand razer and shaving cream for about a year, until I found this Panasonic electric wet/dry shaver. I&#x27;ve been using if regularly for a couple months now and I&#x27;m quite pleased. I&#x27;ll still use the razer/shaving cream about once a week to shave around my beard, but as for the rest of my face, it&#x27;s liking the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> have loved everyone of mine. i keep buying the same one when I need  a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Slow to finish it well on ones face.</li>
            <li> Let me say, this shaver is pretty awesome. Gets really close and I don&#x27;t have to worry about shaving for a couple days. I liked it so much that I gave it to my dad. I could always buy another one.</li>
            <li> So far so good. My husband likes this very much and he says it holds a charge a lot longer than other electric shavers that he has owned.</li>
            <li> This is my first Panasonic electric shaver, since I was using Philip-Norelco shaver for the last 25 years.&lt;br /&gt;In my experience, it is very good but it took a week to get familiar with the new brand shaver.</li>
            <li> I see the first review of this item is from 2011. One may possibly choose a Norelco just because of the reported difference in warranty. This Panasonic razor (ES8103S Arc3 Wet/Dry) and probably all Panasonic&#x27;s now have a 2 year Parts and Labor limited warranty just like the Norelco&#x27;s. I have used both brands and they are pretty much equal. Many Norelco&#x27;s are not advertised as wet/dry. Wet gives a much better shave, meaning in the shower when your skin is very moist. There is a personal preference of using rotary vs. horizontal, now in arc form, blades, and in addition the features, form, and accessories. I am anxious to try this new type which I just received in one day (Prime).</li>
            <li> My husband has always had another type of electric shaver but the power reviews on this one were so good, I bought him this one and he is very happy with it....doesn&#x27;t work very well in the shower, but works well with or without the cord so...Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> This has been a very good razor which shaves closely and comfortably.</li>
            <li> The biggest problem is this shaver does not get most of your stubble and leaves a lot behind even after numerous passes.  On top of that the charge only lasts for about three days of usage and  you can&#x27;t run it off of the cord; it has to be charged.  I am going back to Braun</li>
            <li> I am always testing out products and I utilize the highest standards for quality, speed of delivery, customer service, etc. I can recommend all in regards to this product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in September 2010, after being highly satisfied with previous Panasonic shavers. In less than a year, the digital display failed--so I could no longer monitor the amount of charge remaining in the battery. Since it was still under warranty, I sent it back to Panasonic for repair or replacement. They sent me a replacement. In less than a year, the display on the replacement also began to fail, so I could no longer determine the state of charge. On a positive note, I still have this shaver and it shaves very well. But the unreliable display is a serious inconvenience, and is clearly a problem with this model.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my husband. He loves it.  Close, smooth shave. Not nearly as noisy as his previous shavers.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I should say I love it, since I don&#x27;t shave that much, but it is rather decent, and nothing bad that I can find</li>
            <li> great razor just a overpriced 80 bucks for something that should be going for around 40 other then that its good has a wall charger cord plus on the razor it shows how much percent life it has before it dies its good just the price is kinda overpriced</li>
            <li> I have been using this Panasonic model since January 1st, 2013 and have been pleased with it. I have a heavy beard and find it gives me a close shave. So nice to not have to go through the morning ritual with blades and shaving cream. I would knick or cut myself many mornings and that just wouldn&#x27;t do after being permanently placed on the blood thinner Coumadin.    In the past I have tried Remington and Braun and both left something to be desired. Neither one shaved close enough. Remington was too flimsy, the foil broke not long after replacing it - right in the middle of a shave. It was also very noisy and reached a point where it could not hold a charge very long, even though I religiously followed the recharging directions. The particular Braun and Remington models I used could not be cleaned in water. It was a real pain using one of those little brushes to try to get the shaver half-way clean.    Update: Still working fine as I add this update on August 23, 2014. I replace the foil and blades every six months. Still holds a charge well.</li>
            <li> Didnt get a close shave with this product and it usually left my face feeling irritated, especially if I did a wet shave. Often left razor bumps as well</li>
            <li> my last razor was a panasonic and worked for years.......this is lighter weight and probably less metal than the older versions but it works great and no complaints.</li>
            <li> EUREKA!  EFFICIENT.  QUICK.  CLOSE.  SHAVES THE NECK BETTER THAN ANY OF THE THREE PANASONICS IV&#x27;E TRIED.  GREAT VALUE - WORTH THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> I have used the Panasonic ES8103S for about 3 weeks now and I just can&#x27;t get use to it. It took way to much time to get a clean shave. Today I used my old Norelco and I got a better shave in half the time. So I am returning it and buying new blade&#x27;s for my Norelco.</li>
            <li> My husband thought he was in the future when he saw this razor. He likes it so much and it works great.</li>
            <li> The cover screen for the cutting blades only lasted 6 weeks. Poor material? I use really like this Razor but the parts don&#x27;t last even a short time.</li>
            <li> With almost 1400 reviews of this venerable old-timer already posted on Amazon, there isn&#x27;t much I can add. However, the fact that it constantly runs neck-and-neck with Braun&#x27;s 790cc as the number one seller of foil shavers at Amazon tells me there are two types of electric shaver buyers out there; those who are prepared to lay out the big bucks for what is often heralded as the best shaver money can buy (it isn&#x27;t) and another group who think that about $80 is the proper amount to pay for such an item. Having owned and used both and many others, I&#x27;m starting to think the latter group has it right.(As an aside, this model has been replaced by the LT41-K, which is currently selling here on Amazon for only $6 more than the 8103S. The only difference between the two is that the newer model has a travel lock switch like most Pannys. It&#x27;s also a little sleeker-looking and dressed in black instead of silver.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this shaver. It looks good, feels good in the hand, has good ergonomics and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap at all. Most important, it shaves&lt;br /&gt;very well and gets almost as close as any of the more expensive models,&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic or otherwise. In fact it shaves closer than some I&#x27;ve tried. The battery holds a charge well and it self-cleans easily with the sonic-vibration mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think this shaver is a steal--but if I were buying today I&#x27;d get the updated LT41-K.</li>
            <li> I have used an electric shaver for many years.  The Panasonic shaver does not give me as close of a shave as my previously owned Remington shaver.</li>
            <li> i bought this electric shaver hoping it will give me a close shave since a few people who commented said it did, especially with my sensitive skine, will it did not do any thing for me. i tried a few options, like pushing it down hard towards my face and all it did was turn my face red and no shave. i actually tried it on my hand to see if it will actually shave the hair off my hand and it did not do anything. i would not recommend it at all. spend the extra money on a better shaver.</li>
            <li> Works very well on my face, neck and head.  Easy to clean, keeps its charge a long time and doesn&#x27;t pull or knick my skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaving product and definitely worth buy. This shave is easy and convenient to use. It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> At my age, this shaver works great for shaving in the wrinkles and scars on my face and neck. It has an option wet or dry. For me, the wet works best. I recommend this shaver for older men. Shipping was fine.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.  Works as advertised.  Better for me as a wet shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son and he really likes it. He has been saying he wanted a new shaver and when Amazon had this on the deal of the day I bought it for him. It is much easier to use and shaves a lot closer than his old Norelco.  He says it shaves as close as the blade he sometimes used because he wasn&#x27;t happy with the Norelco.</li>
            <li> Husband really likes electric razor. Shave smooth and close.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I gave this a good month to come to this, I wanted to like it after i spent 140 on it, unfortunately it works to the same extent as I remember these 15 years ago, not 100% efficient and not worth the time. I still have neck hair after 10 minutes of shaving w/ and w/o water/gel.  I never leave reviews but for this one I hope this saves someone money and decides to stick with shaving until something better comes out.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give a closed shave</li>
            <li> Got it on discount when it was $55. Awesome price for this shaver!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and looks great.</li>
            <li> Bought this on a whim and wow am I glad. Over the years I&#x27;ve used the Mach 3, Hydro 3, Edwin Jagger safety with a variation of razors, but have never tried an electric thinking they were just a shortcut and would shave like one. Now after using this for a week, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever be going back to non-electrics.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of facial hair, I&#x27;m in my mid 20s and it&#x27;s still coming in, but the closest shaves I&#x27;ve had -- with the safety razor after doing numerous passes in various directions spending like 20 minutes over a sink with shaving cream everywhere -- can&#x27;t hold a candle to this. The razors always left my skin a bit raw and the prep work felt like a choir. Even with a good shave, when I would run my hand against the grain, I could feel the stubble. The very first shave I did with this unit, it took me a couple of minutes dry and my face was smooth in any direction, I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone. It&#x27;s fairly easy to clean, the battery lasts about 5 shaves, and so far I haven&#x27;t nicked myself or had any irritation.  The best way to shave with it is to use it every other day at most. If you let the beard grow any longer than that, this shaver will start missing hairs and require more passes. I tried a wet shave with it but unfortunately I didn&#x27;t care for it, it was still better than any other razor, but the dry shave is just superb.</li>
            <li> Sturdy Construction, packaged well, works better than any Razor I&#x27;ve ever purchased. The price was under $90 with shipping. I do not normally purchase Panasonic items, however the previous reviews and cost convinced me to try this. I only wish I&#x27;d purchased two.</li>
            <li> I liked the first razor so much I bought another one for my house upstate. Works equally well in wet or dry conditions and I have a heavy beard, so I typically use this during the week, and use a normal blade razor when going out. Nice quality and re-charges quickly. It is also not very noisy so doesn&#x27;t wake the missus in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have always been a Norelo guy but the new models don&#x27;t have the pop up trimmer anymore.  I was not sure about foil but it actually shaves my neck a lot closer and the pop up trimmer is right on the back.  I hate the ones where its not attached and you have to pop it on and off</li>
            <li> This is the second one of this model that we have had and we bought it again because we like it so much. Our first one lasted 4+ years and then the electronics went out, so we had to replace it. It gives a very close wet shave and a dry shave is good with a couple of passes. Really like the way it tells you how much charge is left and when you have to clean it. Excellent and comfortable to use. The pop-up trimmer is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t cut your skin if you use a light touch.</li>
            <li> I can not speak to the long lasting effects of the razor and I will follow up after I&#x27;ve had it for awhile.  I own the Panasonic Body Groom and thought I would stay in the same family of razors.  I straight-blade my face.  However, I wanted this for my head.  I have moles on my head that a straight blade opens up and they bleed horrible.  I usually need a trained medical staff to stop the bleeding and a couple units of blood before it&#x27;s all done.  So as I bald, I don&#x27;t want to hang on to any amount of my hair. I like the way I look bald and allowing it to grow makes people think I want to keep it or I&#x27;m \\&quot;holding on\\&quot;.  I am not.  I pulled this out of the box, charged it for one hour, and then went to it.  It worked WONDERFUL!  I would say as close to blade close as humanly possible with an electric razor.  I have used Norelco products, but only on my face.  I did not use this razor wet and I&#x27;m still out on whether or not to do that. I have the face soap that I use with my straight blade and I may give that a try.  However, dry, it worked great.  It was quick and easy.  Clean-up was a snap.  I missed on spot on the back shaving without a mirror.  I was able to kinda go all around after I thought I had gotten it all and it caused no irritation.  I usually get irritation on my head and face from electric razors.  For the head this baby is perfect!  I did use it on my face and like all electric razors that I have desperately tried to like, it fell short.  But it was better than any other I have used.  It will work in a pinch in the morning, if I forget to shave the night before.  My biggest issue with my face is the neck area!  This just is an area that in order to get every hair I have to go over and over my neck and pretty soon it gets red and irritated.  I didn&#x27;t go over and over, but it shaved that area the best of any electric razor I&#x27;ve ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for what I want...this is perfect.  Great for the HEAD!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful gift, easy to use, great price and easy to put together and keep clean. Has a great wet to dry option. Over all my man loves it.</li>
            <li> This razor is so much better than my old piece of crap Remington triple head razor its not funny. The Panasonic gives a very close,quick (2 minutes if I shave daily) irritation free shave and so far I&#x27;m getting 10 shaves a charge. I&#x27;ve twice tortured test the Panasonic by going 5 days between shaves. The old Remington I would 1st have to charge for 15 minutes (did not hold a charge with beans) then use my Philips Norelco Bodygroom Shaver to make the whiskers short enough for the Remington to cut or else it would just skate over the top of my beard about after 15 minutes of shaving and loads of razor burn I&#x27;d be done. The Panasonic razor no problem in 5 minutes my 5 day beard is gone with a almost razor close shave with zero irritation. This razor is so much better than my old Remington I honestly regret not replacing that piece of trash a year go and at 70.00 this razor is a steal. Just get it the Panasonic is 5 star product. BTW its nice to just wash it after every shave there no need of the more expensive models with their pricey washing systems and I can use it in the shower too (rarely) also I find I get the best shave by locking the razor head so it doesn&#x27;t pivot side to side. Its just freaking amazing how this is the best razor I&#x27;ve owned and I&#x27;ve used electric razors over thirty years,</li>
            <li> i had an older model of this razor, which i bought a few years ago, and it suddenly stopped working one day (it hums with no blade movement). took a few years to break, but i was disappointed, as i really enjoyed the product. i don&#x27;t enjoy shaving with a blade because it irritates my skin, especially under the jawline. the Panasonic was a very acceptable alternative, not quite as close as a wet shave, but very comfortable and way, way better than a Braun i received as a gift before that. battery lasted forever, and it worked wet and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyway, this newer model is about the same in terms of shave quality. however, it is much lighter and thus feels a bit cheaper; not saying that&#x27;s the case, but we&#x27;ll see how long this one lasts. my only real complaint is with the trimmer. the previous trimmer was as about as wide as the head of the razor, and slid up to use. it was awesome for buzzing down facial hair - i often don&#x27;t shave clean but just do the stubbly look, and the very wide trimmer made that easy. this model has a ridiculous flip-up trimmer that is only about as wide as your sideburns. i suppose it would be ok at trimming that, but it&#x27;s much more difficult to use for buzzing your whole face, and because it flips up instead of sliding up, you have to prop it up with your thumb to really use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the overall impression i got was of a cheaper build. but really, something being lighter is not necessarily indicative of lower quality and might be a good thing to you, i personally enjoy a certain heft. the actual shaver head is basically identical, and works great - thus the 4 stars. battery life seems about the same, as does wet performance. really wish they had just left the trimmer alone. if i could find the older one, i&#x27;d definitely buy that instead. this is a perfectly reasonable product and price, however.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and very coarse hair. Not a great combo. So I naturally turned my back on electric shavers long ago as I figured if I couldn&#x27;t get a close enough shave with a razor then how on earth would i get one with an electric... Well I was wrong. After running the gauntlet of razors with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 freaking blades and messing with various shaving creams I finally decided to give this a try. And I&#x27;m extremely happy with the way things turned out. Basically now all I have to do is shave with this thing in the shower every day for a minute or two and I get very close to the same smoothness I received before MINUS the razor burn, irritation, and ingrown hairs. This razor is extremely easy to clean and use too! And Panasonic really seems to have hit a home run at balancing the size for this shaver. It&#x27;s just big enough that you don&#x27;t have to go over too much ground, and yet it&#x27;s small enough to comfortably maneuver around the cut of your chin and under your mustache. Best of all, this ins&#x27;t even that expensive in the realm of electric shavers!</li>
            <li> Smooth shaves with little heating and face soreness.  Does not pull hairs as easily as other razors I have used.</li>
            <li> Love this razor...it works well, with minimum effort. I have sensitive skin and it leaves less rash then a high end Gillette 4 blade razor did...The charge lasts for about a weeks worth of shaves ( once a day) and charges quickly ( an hour or 2 tops)&lt;br /&gt;Ive used it in the hower with no issues, though I prefer the dry shave as opposed to wet with this razor..I seem to get a better shave.  It does shave really close...In my experience with electric razors, none of them shave as close as a blade, none of them!!&lt;br /&gt;a few have come close, but only after dragging it over my face repeatedly while pressing hard, the resulting rash made this pointless...that said this razor does shave really close with just a couple few passes, and I do have coarse hair of facial hair, with an average amount</li>
            <li> Fantastic electric shaver! Took my skin a couple of weeks to completely get used to it, but after that it was smooth sailing. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for 2 weeks now and the battery still shows 50%. I however, only have upper-lip and chin hair, so it only takes ~2 minutes per shave. I wasn&#x27;t expecting this much battery life after reading some reviews saying it lasts about 3-5 shaves. I guess it depends on how long your shaves are really.</li>
            <li> i am only 15 but recently, my facial hair started to grow like crazy. My dad had shown me how to use a regular razor. I didn&#x27;t mind the shave but still i wanted to see how my skin would react to an electric razor. it would be cheaper to use an electric razor. i was told the the shave is never as good as i can get with a regular razor but i still gave it a try...&lt;br /&gt;about the battery... the papers that came with it say that a 100% charge is the same as 14 shaves at 3 minutes each... the grip is nicely made and the head can be locked so it doesn&#x27;t move or unlocked...&lt;br /&gt;the seller i got the razor from sent it with a little travel baggie... the shaver can be used wet or dry and the screen shows how much battery is left...&lt;br /&gt;the shave is not as good as a regular razor but i dont mind this one...&lt;br /&gt;i think its a keeper... but keep in mind... ive only shaved with it a few times....</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver as a gift for my boyfriend on his birthday and when it arrived I thought it would be the perfect gift. Had great expectations about this product. The shaver doesnt shave well. Totally ineffective You have to pass it over and over.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly I can not return it cause I bought on amazon when I was in the states but i dont live there. Seriously, I dont understand why it has so many good comments. TOTALLY dissapointed, dont waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> This one is especially easy to clean (can use hand soap even).  Like most electrics, it definitely gives a better shave on me when not in the shower (does work if that&#x27;s what you are in to).  Shave is close and I have had no problems with irritation at all.  Way to go Panasonic!</li>
            <li> I hate when somebody loosely applies a title like &amp;#34;diva&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;phenom&amp;#34; to any product. But this is the best razor, bladed or electric that I&#x27;ve used...phenomenal.</li>
            <li> At the beggining when i first used it, i was a little shocked because it cut my skin in my neck area, but it was because I press it too hard against my skin, and it needs to get use to it before I do that, so after that i continued using it and till now is working and doing its job just fine.</li>
            <li> I have used a Braun razor for 10+ years, but am tired of how long it takes to shave.  I have tried several Norelcos, but they seem to snag my hair after about a month of use.  So, I read some reviews on consumer reports, and took a chance with this one.  Excellent shave + excellent timing!  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I got this for my 21 year old son.  He recently got a great job that required him to be clean shaven every day.  Up till now he has had a very nicely manicured beard, which he just used a trimmer on.  He loves this razor.  He is very happy with the closeness of the shave and has only needed to use it dry.  I told him the reviews said a wet shave will be a closer shave, but he said he is perfectly happy with the dry shave.  I am glad I went with this razor.</li>
            <li> Used a couple of Norelco shavers for years and was happy, but this shaver gives a much closer shave.  It also runs a top speed, even with just 10% left in charge.</li>
            <li> I used this for about 60 days and the foil screen tore. I checked the price of a new one and it was almost the same as a new razor. I threw it in the garbage.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for a picky shaver and he loves the smoothness this product delivers.  It works great as a wet or dry shaver.</li>
            <li> I replaced a Panasonic ES8092 that lasted over 15 years. And I&#x27;m hoping to get the same from this one. By the way, I left it on the charger 24/7 and never had a problem with staying charged long enough to shave my head and my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read reviews stating that there are other shavers out there that are better. For a much higher cost mind you. And this is more of a backup/last minute device as I usually use a [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor]]. I purchased this one because of the longevity of my last one and expecting this new razor to be as good as my old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just FYI, I do not have a tough beard and only need to shave every other day or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the facts:&lt;br /&gt;1. This new razor is 5db more quiet than my old one. And THAT is a significant difference.&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s lighter in weight.&lt;br /&gt;3. Replacement blades for the new razer are cheaper than my old razer.&lt;br /&gt;4. Used in conjunction with [[ASIN:B0038JKYAQ Kyoku for Men Electric Pre Shave Optimizer, 1.7 Fluid Ounce]] I got a shave pretty much equal to what I get with my double edge safety razor!&lt;br /&gt;5. I am aware the new razor has new foil and blade but my old razor with new foil and blades never got this close.&lt;br /&gt;6. In the last 6 months it&#x27;s sold here twice for less than $55.00, yes you read that right. And it&#x27;s still worth it in the $70.00 range.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for days and delivers a really close shave wet or dry.  I could not be happier with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I used Consumer Reports to select a replacement for my current working razor. The Panasonic gives me a closer shave although the sideburn trimmer is a little smaller. In part the closer shave is because the shaver head pivots to the contour of one&#x27;s face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If one likes a foil shaver, then this is the one to buy.</li>
            <li> I totally love this razor I can&#x27;t say enough about it it does exactly what it says it can do.</li>
            <li> Terrible shaver and foil.  It&#x27;s the worst shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned over the past 36 years, especially compared to the Braun shavers I owned before Gillette bought them out, jacked up prices and added Chinese parts.  Even after replacing the foil three times the blades continue to hit the new foil and in the past they quickly broke through and resulted in cutting my face.  The trimmer is poor and extremely abrasive.  The battery doesn&#x27;t have a long charge.  This a low quality and unreliable product from China, which is obviously the source of the problems.  I&#x27;ve got to try something else.</li>
            <li> Shaves very tight and I don&#x27;t have to go over the same spots more than twice.  I love how it&#x27;s waterproof and I can shave in the shower and clean it under water.</li>
            <li> After thoroughly evaluating many reviews here and elsewhere, I picked this Shaver out for a Christmas gift my wife could put under the tree for me.  My now 5 year old Braun 9565 was beginning to fall apart and was always very loud. I&#x27;d replaced the blade/foil assy annually at $35.00-40.00 each and it was time.  I was initially impressed with this Panasonic ES8103S for its low price and very good reviews. My wife ordered it on Amazon and I received it at Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right away I was happy with the fact that it was perhaps half as loud as the Braun was, and had a much more tolerable tone.  I try to maintain things so they tend to last longer, which means in most cases I take the head apart and brush clean all the blades and foils.  Again, when disassembling for the first time I was impressed with the simplicity of the design and the ease of cleaning and reassembly.  Much easier than my Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could stop there and say this Shaver lives up to its other reviews, but it simply doesn&#x27;t shave close enough and requires many passes over the same area to get an acceptable cut.  But even then, it seems to cut exactly at the surface and seemingly lacks the \\&quot;lift and pull\\&quot; technology in use by almost every other manufacturer, which cuts the whisker below the surface. This simple and rather old tech gives you a shave that for an average growth person such as myself, will still look decent going out after a day at the office. With the Panasonic ES8103S, I&#x27;m back to the Flintstone&#x27;s days of the old 5:00 shadow, only it&#x27;s apparent by 3pm.  No getting away with skipping a day now and then like I could do with my Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t determine whether I maybe got a defective unit or not, but I&#x27;m back looking at Shavers again as I&#x27;ll be sending this one back for a refund.  Too bad, it really seemed like a bargain based on its reviews.</li>
            <li> This is a great linear electric razor for the money!  It recharges fully in a matter of 45 minutes. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Came quickly and works great.  Smoother shave than the less expensive model I had been using.  I would definitely recomment it.</li>
            <li> This shaver is powerful and gives an excellent, close shave.  The power monitor is helpful, and it is very easy to clean under running water.  From my perspective it&#x27;s certainly much better than rotaries I&#x27;ve owned, and my only small complaint is that it seems to need recharging a little more frequently than some others.  I generally need to recharge every 10 days vs. 14 days with my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> Pathetic. This was bought as a replacement for a solidly-built Panasonic which gave 10 years of service, but the new razor, unlike the one it replaces, has such a weak motor that I thought it was some kind of mislabeled toy.</li>
            <li> The cutting area is too small so it takes a long time to shave. I had to re shave the same spot over and over to get a smooth shave. It did seem to work better in the water with shaving cream but it still took a long time. The foil got a hole in it only after 3 weeks. Could have bought 2 cheaper shavers that work just as well for the same price.</li>
            <li> Having used electric shavers for 40 years, this is the smoothest, most comfortable and clean shaving shaver. This is the finest one I&#x27;ve ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to all my friends.&lt;br /&gt;It is far better than my many Brauns, Norelcos, erc.</li>
            <li> This shaver is a big improvement over my old electric shaver.  Gives a quick and close shave.  Easy to clean.  Can use wet or dry.  Good battery life.</li>
            <li> I replaced a 3 year old philips rotary shaver with this model.  It shaves much closer and is not much louder. The sideburn trimmer works really well compared to my old unit.  The battery lasts about 8 days before needing to be recharged which is less than the 2 weeks with the older philips model.  Agree with other reviewer it would be nice to have a stand so it is not lying in a puddle on the sink to dry.  The cost of the new Panasonic shaver was just a few dollars more than the replacement head for my old Philips so that is why I bought it and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Faster and closer than Norelco and an older Braun. Only time will tell but I do not , at this time see any real faults.</li>
            <li> this is the best shaver i ever got, this helps me shave around aera that i can not get to.&lt;br /&gt;I have no bad points about this iteam&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all i am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> It looks nice, works great, and I&#x27;ve had it for a while and still haven&#x27;t had to recharge the battery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had numerous other shavers, but I have not had a closer shave with any of the shavers. It&#x27;s much quieter does not vibrate, and charges quickly. Will definitely buy another.</li>
            <li> I choose the product due to the RPM. I was tired of cheaper, lower RPM electric razors pulling on my skin when shaving. I was also intrigued by the wet / dry feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got the product, I would have rated it a 4.8 out of 5. I got a closer shave with this razor than I have ever had with an electric and it charged quickly. The only negative is with this type of open face razor, you need to be bending over a sink because it does not capture all the shaved hair (be careful if wearing a shirt) so its a little messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My disappointment came about two weeks after initial use. I used every other day due to its initial effectiveness. Then I started to notice in the second week that I could go over the same spot and miss hair repeatedly and not getting nearly as close of a shave anymore (req&#x27;d shaving daily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I cleaned it (more thoroughly than just empting the captured hair), I tried unlocking the pivot head and shaving, shaving right after hot shower, razor fully charged, different angles to shave the hair, etc. Nothing helped. Its just an average razor in two weeks time. I am very disappointed, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No report on the wet / dry feature, I have yet to try it. Good luck.</li>
            <li> I have used this razor for approximately three months. It has exceeded my expectations! Dry shaving with the Panasonic ES8103S gives me a &amp;#34;safety-razor-like&amp;#34; smooth shave. It is recommended by Consumer Reports. Very reasonably priced on Amazon. I recharge it once-a-week.</li>
            <li> works ok, not so good on neck.  needs several passes on face.</li>
            <li> Bought to replace a 15 year old Panasonic that still functions but won&#x27;t hold a charge.  This model is made in China, not Japan like earlier models.  Still, it shaves well overall and is quiet.  Percent charge remaining is nice as is the sonic setting used for cleaning.  Battery life is good and it charges in an hour.  Would have been nice to include some type of stand to use while charging (my old mode charged inductively).  Only negative is the pop up trimmer.  Because it is perpendicular to the shaving head, it can be hard to see what you&#x27;re doing.  Also, the rounded head shape itself can make it difficult if you need to shave very precisely.  Satisfied overall for the money, but I don&#x27;t think the Panasonic shavers areas good as they used to be.  A little too much style over function.</li>
            <li> Chose this over rotary razor.  Shaves my head well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shaver for 2 years, and find it to be a vast improvement over the Norelcos (lift and cut) that I used to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is not at all irritated by this shaver, and the smoothness of the shave feels as close to a real razor as I&#x27;ve ever felt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this shaver over anything else out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s provably the only shaver that can handle Chuck Norris&#x27; beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one con....battery life, I can get three shaves out of this before recharging...hence why I lopped off a star from the rating.  For many, this may be no issue, but my shave locations tend to be adventurous and unpredictable...right.</li>
            <li> I tried this shaver twice!&lt;br /&gt;this is my result:&lt;br /&gt;pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Shaves like a razor in the face area!&lt;br /&gt;- quick charging&lt;br /&gt;- indicator of how much battery left in the shaver and If u need to wash it or not!&lt;br /&gt;- easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;- easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;- It took my half an hour to shave with (more time than disposal razors).&lt;br /&gt;- does not give a close shave in the neck area. (I have a thick middle eastern hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am not sure If this is the right product for me! but the experiences were somehow ok yet!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a &#x27;rotary&#x27; style shaver for many years... Panasonic and Remington have always served me well and replacements have never been because of failure of the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife came across this saver, on sale, and great reviews, so I gave it a try, and all I can say is WOW.  I used to dread the pain of trying to shave 3 days worth of scruff.... well... no more.  The blades are so sharp, so fast, and the design so good it&#x27;s pain free.  In fact I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve &#x27;pulled a hair&#x27; yet in the 30+ days I&#x27;ve been using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I experienced very little (new shaver) skin irritation, and wet/dry ability allows thorough and easy cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving has never been so good!</li>
            <li> Terrible shaver, it misses a lot of hairs and you have to go over the same spot numerous times. I had many cheap shavers do a way better job. Its supposed to be a wet/dry shaver and is even worse when wet.</li>
            <li> Quite efficient. No problems after 1 year of purchase</li>
            <li> Quick close shave! Love it!</li>
            <li> This is my third Panasonic razor.  It provides a nice close shave with no skin rash, etc.  This series of razor is dependable and well priced.</li>
            <li> After using Norelco rotary razors for more than 30 years, I decided to try something different when replacement time arrived this time. I considered several razors, but selected the Panasonic ES8103S -- and I am delighted that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After giving it an initial charge, which only required an hour, I tried using it. I prefer a dry shave and used it in that fashion. After a moment or two of getting accustomed to the different grip and different shaving motion required, I found that it was both comfortable and highly effective. The Norelco razors always gave a decent shave, but this Panasonic comes extremely close to the results obtainable with a blade. I have never experienced as close a shave with any previous electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m extremely pleased and would recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
            <li> great buy on this electric razor. the most i&#x27;ve ever paid for one and the battery life is good for about 10 shaves (1 per day) but thats just me.</li>
            <li> not a very smooth shave easy to use and lightweight but not sure why it was so expensive</li>
            <li> I have had various Braun shavers for years (most recently a 5885 model). The most recent Braun never seemed to shave well, even with a new replacement shaver head.  After 2-3 years, I decided to look for something better. When I saw a review of this Panasonic ES8103S Arc3 I was skeptical but hopeful.  IT IS AMAZING. It shaves fast, close, and comfortable, almost like a blade shave, and has an LCD displays that always gives &amp;#34;percentage remaining&amp;#34; for the battery.  Not sure what happened to Braun, but there is no reason to even consider it as long as Panasonic is making shavers like this.</li>
            <li> The shave is terrible especially for shaving the hairs under the jaw line and on the neck. It doesn&#x27;t get the hairs within any contours and even the hair on flat surfaces where the skin can be stretched the shaver requires many passes. Despite passing over some areas multiple times it doesn&#x27;t even touch the hairs. Even if you do get all of the hairs it absolutely destroys my skin even after the 30 days it suggests you take to get used to it. Past the 30 days of use it makes my skin raw, red, and painful. It requires all kinds of lotions and creams and after shave balms just to feel fine and hopefully get rid of the redness. Shaving also now takes like double or triple the time it used to. I just spend it going up and down and side to side over the same areas with little to no progress beyond the first sweep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know much about other electric razors but this was my first and will be my last. I&#x27;d rather just buy the blades, get it done right the first time without red, raw, painful skin, and a short shave that is successful the very first time.</li>
            <li> This razor started out strong, but the high quality shave started to deteriorate after 2-3 months, even though I was following the suggested cleaning protocol (and even though the foil and blades were supposed to last two and one years, respectively).  Around six or seven months, the LCD screen all but went blank (you could sort of read the numbers at a sharp angle if you squinted).  Now, at fifteen months, the razor is completely dead, and will not even turn on after a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had grown frustrated with Norleco wet/dry shavers, and had high hopes for this one, but this breakdown is totally unacceptable.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend and it works great! He gets a great shave in minutes! I love it because he stays smooth much longer and more often. If he spends a lot of time shaving then he gets a super close shave, but even spending 5 minutes he gets a good shave. He says that he likes the fact that it has a battery light indicator so he knows when it needs to charge. We recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for over a month now an unfortunatly its not as good as my previous shaver, Norelco triple head. I read the reviews in Consumer Reports and they mentioned this is a good buy so I purchased it. Problem, it takes me twice as long to shave and it dosent seem to pick up all the stuble. Yes the Noreloc cost more but shaving is so much easier.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic razor does not give a close shave. In fact, it is difficult&lt;br /&gt;  to shave off certain hairs on my chin.I have had electric razors in the&lt;br /&gt;  past and they shaved much better. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> works great for the cost of the razor.. would buy another one ..... gives a nice close shave and a trimer works well</li>
            <li> Excellent product and shipped very fast.  This electric shaver has been great in getting a close shave and reducing ingrown hairs.  It has a quick charge function and is easy to clean and would recommend this product to those looking for a good electric razor.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this style of shaver but I wasn&#x27;t sure what sort of quality Panasonic would have in this product. I think that it is a good deal because it has some great features and it isn&#x27;t as expensive as the bigger name competitors.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric razors for most of my life. The Panasonic ES8103S is the best razor that I have ever used. I used all of them but this one gives me the closest shave that I have ever received. No razor burn, pulling or tugging. Cleaning and charging is a breeze. Panasonic is my razor company from now on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product. It works well and the battery lasts for 3-4 shavings. Easy to use and to wash. It definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> The wet/dry experience is new for my father(83y/o). He could not believe the ease of use. Clean-up is a snap. He still wants to lubricate it before each us. THANKS.</li>
            <li> After reading dozens of reviews about each of the electric shavers under $100 (and some over) I decided to give this one a chance. Now, after two weeks of use, I&#x27;m ready to report in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone with sensitive skin, I was excited to see how this would work. The head has a switch on the side which locks the blade or allows it move as you shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Locked or unlocked mode is great for sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;Easy cleaning!&lt;br /&gt;Battery life seems pretty good so far. I&#x27;ll update if that changes over time&lt;br /&gt;No issues of redness or difficulty adjusting at least for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The noise! I know people mentioned that it was loud, but this high pitched buzz is difficult to muffle in the morning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone looking to upgrade their electric razor, as I was, this was a great choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1/10/13: Battery life still seems to be holding up (couple of hours with each charge) and the razor is still cutting the same. I&#x27;m sure I will have to replace the blades soon, but for now they are still getting the job done. But that buzzing is still loud...</li>
            <li> The Panasoinc ES8103s is the best electric razor I have used in 50+ year&#x27;s of shaving. It is a prodect I will rec[[ASIN:B001DNE3KQ Panasonic ES8103S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Silver]]comend.</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for awhile now. (Almost 3 years) It still keeps its charge surprising well, unlike a lot of other electric razors I have used in the past. (which may get only 2-3 uses before needing to be charged after 2 years)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic product. This is by far the best electric razor I have ever used and is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in many years and I was curious to try a newer model.  The wet/dry feature sounded like what I was looking for and it does work as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s apparent that no electric will provide a shave as close as a blade.  The Panasonic is good for a quick light shave or a touch up but it doesn&#x27;t compare to a traditional razor.</li>
            <li> This shaver was selected from several choices on line.  Due to movement disorder, husband had to give up other type razors.  This is the 3rd electric razor this year.  This one works really well.  It is a good hand fit and easy to move around his face.  The percentage charge indicator is helpful.  He is pleased with it and shaves more frequently than before.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver and beat my old Braun 7 series hands down. The outer foil is much thinner and allow for a closer shave. Also the 14000 RPM makes the whole shaving experience faster and much more pleasant as it eliminates the pulling of stubborn hairs. Not to mention the waterproof feature which allows for dry and wet shaving. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this shaver. Especially compared to my old Braun. I wish I had just paid for new blades for the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the wet/dry feature but the head is so flimsy when I tried to take it off to shake out the cuttings, the screen fell out, with thin plastic ends, etc. It took almost an hour to refit it delicately. I may never remove the head for cleaning again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave Quality is only adequate. I don&#x27;t expect a long life for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had electric shavers before, but this one is by far the best. Things have definately changed in the electric world. Was tired of cutting my face up with regular razor, so figured even if it wasn&#x27;t a great shave, I&#x27;d try one of the newer model electrics out there.  LOVE being able to use this in the shower - just soap up and shave. VERY close shave and pivoting head makes it a snap.  Unexpected benefit is that since I&#x27;m not running a blade agains my skin any more, my skin is much smoother than with the razor. Shaving with a razor blade is a thing of the past - time to move on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All these machines claim like two weeks between charges - can&#x27;t imagine where they get that concept, I get like five shaves between charges. But, charges up within an hour, so no big deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only owned it 6 weeks or so, but so far it&#x27;s the best, closest shaving electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned--and I&#x27;m 70 years old. If you&#x27;re new to electric razors, give it a few weeks for your facial skin to become accustomed to it.  Also, I purchased a shaving gel which really helps the razor shave closer.  With the razor/gel combo my shaves are as good as a blade.  I&#x27;ve never been able to say that about an electric shaver before.</li>
            <li> i bought it as a present for my husband .this shaver made in CHINA. ONCE i switched it i was shocked by its noisy.dispointed ,my husband also dislike it,too noisy</li>
            <li> I love this razor, it is my every day (or two) go to shaving mechanism. The battery is great. The shave is great. Easy to clean. The only problem I have is that the plastic cover on top is pretty fragile, and if you drop it 4 or 5 feet, you better be praying that murphy&#x27;s law doesn&#x27;t land it on that spot that makes it crack and break. Having said that, I am on my second razor of the exact same kind and would not trade it for anything. Just be careful with the piece that comes off when you want to clean it.</li>
            <li> I have found the Panasonic Razor to be fast charging, quiet, reliable, and easy to clean after shaving. I would buy another one of these high quality shavers.</li>
            <li> Of course it will not get you the &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; shave that a straight edge will give you but it gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt; It is fairly quiet, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> pretty sooth shave. it took a few weeks to 2 months for my face to get used to it. does not snag and pull like rotary blades. cleans very easy. its not as loud as my panasonic rotary shaver. i have shaved wet with shaving cream and dry. trimmer works well. the charge lasts forever for me... overall well worth the cost and a great product.</li>
            <li> After trying several different electric razors, I finally found one that actually works and works well.  No issues at all.</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost. A very smooth shavers.</li>
            <li> Shaves well and is very quiet.  I bought one for every member of our household and they agree.  I would definitely recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> Gave this to husband for gift and he is really enjoying it.  He says it is a bit of a trick to shave the chin and neck but he&#x27;s getting the hang of it.  I like it because his early morning shaves are quiet!</li>
            <li> What an outstanding shaver!!! I was using a Safety Razor with Feather blades and was very happy for some time but my disabilities/age began to make it difficult to stand erect at the sink for the time it took. I just couldn&#x27;t shave the same way I used to. I suspected an electric would help. Before I ordered the Panasonic though, I pulled out an old ( but still in fine shape) Norelco/Phillips triple head that I used to use. I stopped using it some time ago due to the difficulty with my sensitive skin--particularly on my neck. Lots of red marks. I read recently where a foil was easier on the skin. Not only has the Panasonic not left mark one on me, the closeness of the shave is very, very similar to the safety razor. Just depends on the time you spend. Bottom line, I can lean over on my elbows or sit down when I get tired. Shaves just as well. No fooling around with blades, shave cream, sink full of water, etc. What a fine shave and under $80.00!  I recommend this with no hesitation !!!!    Three week later update-----still no skin irritation at all. I am taking my time while shaving and have to say I am now getting just as close a shave as I did with my safety razor and Feather blades. No problem going against the grain. Just making sure to use a light touch and a little extra time. Amazing!!!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a flat face, &amp; I typically shave every 2 or 3 days. The razor is pretty far from anything I&#x27;d recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STRIKE 1: It takes 15-20 passes on my neck to get anywhere near done. Wet, dry, angle, sweet-talk ... doesn&#x27;t matter. I end up using a disposable razor to get the hairs the Panasonic missed, after wearing the battery &amp; my face down by 30% just trying to get the last few hairs. It works a little better with daily use but still not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STRIKE 2: If you have areas where you let the hair grow (goatee, mutton chops etc), the razor pulls the longer hairs when you try to shave near them. It hurts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STRIKE 3: It&#x27;s loud. Except in SonicClean mode, which I&#x27;m not convinced really does much. Can the cheap plastic vibration link really transmit sufficient ultrasonic energy through to the razor head to the point where it actually cleans, rather than just buzzing weakly? I&#x27;m not so sure. Can some ultrasonic engineering theorist-types weigh in on this?</li>
            <li> Nice product.  Does not shave as close as a blade.</li>
            <li> I like this razor as a quick get up and go shaver. I have yet to use it wet due to  reviews I&#x27;ve read of the display shorting out. but if you catch it on a good sale I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a head shaver, and frequently use this for a daily shaver.  When I&#x27;m not being lazy and make time to share every day, this is a lot quicker than a razor because I can shave my entire face, clean it, half my head, clean it, and then finish up, whereas a bladed razor needs to be cleaned after every stroke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers on this, however, are completely awful.  Too slow and not sharp at all.  They feel more like tweezers or a band-aid than clippers.  If I let my hair, beard, and mustache grow out for a week, I need to use my Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System to trim back down to an easily shavable length.</li>
            <li> This shaver does a good shave but not as good as an older Panasonic I have had for many years. The battery in this one is small and doesn&#x27;t last long. I can use it half up getting one good shave whereas my older heavier one will last a week and do a better job. Seems they&#x27;re just lightening and cheapening them up and charging more for less these days. I like it ok but it just isn&#x27;t as good as they&#x27;ve been in the past for the same money.</li>
            <li> Easy and comfortable to use.  Seems fairly sensitive to direction of motion on different parts of the face.  Significantly better shaving wet.  Rather quiet</li>
            <li> I got this for my bf&#x27;s birthday present because his old one was eating his face. He said he absolutely loved it. Kept a good charge really easy to clean and gave him a really close shave.</li>
            <li> i got this after i check the reviews on amazon and so far so good. i use it to shave my head and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> If you want a good shave this is not the razor for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is poor.  I don&#x27;t care about any other features.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was extremely hesitant to try an electric razor as I always felt they didn&#x27;t get all the hair or shave close enough. This razor does the trick although it does take some getting used to. It took me about 3 weeks to get the hang of getting some of the spots like under my neck but after that it has been a joy to use and much easier on my face than a regular razor.</li>
            <li> This was very highly rated in Consumer Reports Mag.  I purchased this as a black Friday sale.  Been using for about a month.  Definitely living up to expectations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands and this one I really like.  Does what it says it will do.  Quiet, fast, close enough and easy to clean.  All pulses for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for probably 40 years, and I&#x27;ve tried most brands.  Overall, I&#x27;m a Remington man.  The Remingtons do the best job shaving my fairly heavy beard, and their trimmers are nice and wide for a bit of a trim around the ears.  Unfortunately, my favorite model is out of production, so I tried Panasonic for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this razor is that it&#x27;s really quiet and the battery lasts a long time on a single charge.  Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t do that great a job shaving my face, especially the long hairs on my neck and those high on my cheeks.  I use a disposable razor to clean up what the Panasonic misses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for something like 2-3 months now.  It replaced an older Braun that I was finding more difficulty getting replacement blades/foil for (tells you how long I had it around).  The Panasonic cuts well.  It is extremely light and ergonomically sets well in my hand.  The rapid charge is a pleasant change from my old shaver that took all night.  Cleaning is a snap-just rinse under a sink.&lt;br /&gt;Downsides; the beard/moustache trim feature is all but useless in its location.  They engineered this to fit along the back of the shaver and is tiny.  When engaged, it is not readily visible making any trim work blind.  I can&#x27;t see what I&#x27;m cutting....not good.  I&#x27;ve since  purchased a separate trim shaver adding to the clutter of my bathroom closet.  Minor annoyance is the sound it produces; a high pitched whine similar to a lawn trimmer.  All things considered a reasonable basic shaver that performs the basic function of removing whiskers well.  As a trimmer, well, what may sound like one is not always one....</li>
            <li> The shaver is good for a morning or evening touch ups but doesn&#x27;t get as close as a razor especially on the neck area.</li>
            <li> takes about 2 weeks for your skin to get used to an electric shaver but works great would recommend it</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I have tried any of the other shavers in this price range so I had to rely on reviews and testimonials. I researched this thoroughly and am well pleased with the product. I use it sporadically when I don&#x27;t feel like wet shaving or when I am going out and do not want to risk a bloody face. It works very well and quite fast and I believe it to be of professional quality. I find that it works the best when my beard is no more than one day old although it will handle longer stubble. I personally don&#x27;t think it is as good as a wet shave but it is perfectly acceptable. Overall I am quite happy with it and would certainly buy it again. I have had it about a year with no issues and find the battery to be excellent.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my 25 year old son who has a heavy beard.  He was spending a lot on blades and thought he would give it a try.  He followed the directions of conditioning and used it for almost a month before giving up on it.  Would not recommend it at all.  It was an expensive lesson in electric razors.  My husband uses an electric razor, same brand. different model and he is satisfied with his.  His beard is not so heavy though.  Did not return it, but should have!</li>
            <li> I bought this to speed up my shaving time. In actuality it doesn&#x27;t save any time because it is maddeningly difficult to get a clean shave without any missed hairs in the area below the jaw line. Maybe I have wrong expectations or was just doing it wrong but I gave it a month trial and sent it back. On the positive side Amazon returns are a breeze!</li>
            <li> I grew up with Brauns and the occasional Norelco/Philips. I came across Panasonic wet shavers about a decade ago. I have no interest in looking elsewhere. And don&#x27;t bother getting models with the separate cleaning apparatus. You don&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great shaver, the only complaint I have is it have to go over my neck beard multiple times for a clean shave, works great on the face! Easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ever buy anything form The Nerds. I&#x27;ve had many Panasonic shavers, they all worked great, but this one stopped working after a few shaves. It&#x27;s a piece of junk. And I can&#x27;t even get a return email from the seller - The Nerds. Horrible customer service by them and Amazon. Very disappointed. Will have to contact Panasonic. Let&#x27;s hope their customer service is better than The Nerds. Don&#x27;t ever buy anything from them.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver because I read a review from someone who said it was a good head shaver.  It is a great head shaver!  I have tried electrics for head shaving before and was not impressed.  This thing does a great job on my head and face.</li>
            <li> Gives a very, very close and comfortable shave, closer than a blade FOR SURE. It also goes a long time between charges.</li>
            <li> I admit that I have not tried to use an electric shaver in fifty years, and just hoped that they had improved in all those years, It doesn&#x27;t even come close to what I had hoped for. I only regret that it didn&#x27;t come with a money-back guarantee. (Can&#x27;t rate the replacement blades, as I never had a chance to use them).&lt;br /&gt;If anyone there can recommend a shaver that is guaranteed, I would appreciate hearing about it.&lt;br /&gt;Aubrey Denney</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd Panny shaver I&#x27;ve bought in the last 10 yrs. They do a good job of shaving close to the skin. BUT... be careful if you have any moles or bumps on your skin. This shaver can cut you. The high speed cutting action is that fast it can burn you, I&#x27;ve done it once or twice over the yrs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works best if you go with the grain for the 1st cut, to get the high stuff out of the way. Then go against the grain for a smooth, baby face cut. Yes, it will take a little bit longer, but your face will thank you for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave this model 3 stars because they are being made cheaper with each one I buy over the yrs. This one has a plastic head where the outer blades are located. My last Panny, which was very similar to this one, was encased in aluminium. Also, you CAN NOT use this plugged in, as a previous person wrote in their extensive review. It will not turn on when it is charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the LED that tells you how much charge is left. It goes in increments of 10, from10% to 100%. This is a cool feature. With only 10% remaining on the charge, I was able to do a complete shave. It charges from 0 to 100% rather quickly. So if your charge is low, you can give it a quick charge to 20% in about 5 mins. Way more than enough to get a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;When charged to 100%, I get about 5 or 6 shaves before it needs a recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, its a pretty good shaver. I do think the price is too high. It shouldn&#x27;t sell for any more than $50. But, Panny shavers have served me well over the yrs. They are dependable.</li>
            <li> I have owed many different electric shavers in my 83 years! This one is the absolute best! Good shave, easy to clean and fits my small hands, perfectly!</li>
            <li> I just bought this through best buy and wanted to provide my input here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the money, it&#x27;s a good razor.  Cuts well without tearing up my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern with it is that it doesn&#x27;t work with the power chord plugged in, it operates on battery only.  This is kind of a big negative because that was the only reason I was able to use my Braun razor for over 12 years.  I imagine I will be shopping for a razor again when the battery dies on this one in a couple years.</li>
            <li> No burn.  Cuts close, especially with lotions or shaving soap.  Charges quickly.  Easy to clean and cleans up very well.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.  Just as described.  Arrived in the time specified!  Pleased with this purchase and would suggest it to anyone else!</li>
            <li> I used this shaver it doesn&#x27;t shave properly especially it tough to shave  underneath your chin and near neck region,though the trimmer to the side is good. Its better to use the regular stick instead of shaving with this. I would not recommend for one who are expecting clean shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those guys who shaves with regular razors and gets cuts and really red/sore neck.  Over the years I&#x27;ve had all the Mach 3&#x27;s, Hydro&#x27;s, etc. and nothing ever helped.  Blades were also so expensive and hard to find for my favorite Hydro 3 (Schick).  I heard that electric shavers help with the skin sensitivity issue and found this one with a great price so decided to try it.  Holy cow, I will never go back.  I still am keeping my Hydro 3 and the blades I&#x27;ve been able to find, but just for a backup.  Of course, I don&#x27;t get as close of a shave and I may have to use it every day (instead of every other) in order to not look too rough, but I just don&#x27;t mind!  Shaving doesn&#x27;t hurt and I don&#x27;t have to take a hot shower to soften up my beard like I used to.  I use between 10 and 20% of the battery in one shave so normally just charge it on the weekend.  It takes maybe an hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for a few months now and my neck has never looked better.  I use it dry so it is also very convenient.  I know this will end up paying for itself in no time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that this is the worst razor in existence. I&#x27;ve used it 4 times now. I don&#x27;t have a lot of money and I saved up for this so that I could have an easy, long-lasting way to shave; which is why I used it 4 times, &#x27;cause I don&#x27;t want to waste it. But my god. I can&#x27;t do it. I just can&#x27;t do it anymore. This razor was created by Lucifer himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters, the razor&#x27;s back side has a tool that allows you to simply shave off hair, like you would with a shaving knife. The problem is, the razor can barely do this. Instead, the razor prefers to pull and rip your hairs on your face out, leaving you bloody. The first time I shaved with this razor, I did so with a full beard. Next 3 times, I cut down my beard as much as I could with scissors and tried shaving. Just finished shaving the 4th time. Face is a bloody mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, this doesn&#x27;t even shave well, even for all its sadistic marauding. After I&#x27;m done carving away my face with the back razor, I switch to the main one: The razor you see in the picture, on top. This would allow me to get closer to the skin and shave off everything the other razor couldn&#x27;t. Or maybe the other razor is supposed to also be able to get close to your skin, but as a result of it being a part of this wretched machine, can&#x27;t. Regardless, whatever razor I use, I&#x27;m always left with stubble and shadow. It&#x27;s ridiculous. Not only can I not shave my face without experiencing excruciating pain and left a bloody mess, but I can&#x27;t even fully shave my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally broke the damn thing. The pain of it ripping out hairs on my face actually left me in tears and I got so frustrated I threw it at at my bathroom wall. When I bought this devil&#x27;s toy, it was around $80. That really put a dent in my wallet. Never buying from Panasonic again for what they created and what they&#x27;ve done to me.</li>
            <li> My old Braun was worn out. Kept cutting me. I really dislike when that happens.&lt;br /&gt;So I researched Panasonic. Got a great price at amazon, so took the leap.&lt;br /&gt;This is a fantastic machine. I cannot even feel the shaving!&lt;br /&gt;Gets really smooth, and my 71 year old face can use it!&lt;br /&gt;Have used it a week and it is still half charged.</li>
            <li> The shaver only works as a touch up after regular shaves. If you have a tough beard don&#x27;t buy one.</li>
            <li> I read a review saying this shaver was best for those with light or medium stubble. Well i realized that I am not in that category. I have to go over the same spot several times to get a smooth shave. I live on the road so that&#x27;s why I carry an electric razor. I can&#x27;t say I reget the purchase because it works well, charges fast and has stuck with me for a while, but it&#x27;s not the best electric shaver out there. I&#x27;ve had and once I get my value out of it, I&#x27;m not gonna buy the same type again.</li>
            <li> Razor is a good value.&lt;br /&gt;Works better as a trimmer according to my son.&lt;br /&gt;6 more words required.  2 more</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband.  He is very picky about razors.  He is very pleased with the product. It is easy to use and very effective.</li>
            <li> This shaver is by far the best I have ever owned. I had the last one for almost six years and experimented with a like model in Braun and Norelco. None of them beat the Panasonic especially if you are prone to in-grone hairs. . .</li>
            <li> I got this at a great price because of a special at Amazon.I&#x27;ve been amazed at what a good shave it gives. I have a tough beard and shaver gets reasonably close (not as good as a blade) to give the appearance of close shave. The overall value cost plus results make this razor a winner. Oh yes, incredibly easy to clean, rinse and let dry and you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item on Amazon for 53.99 and I am very happy to have made the switch from Remington to Panasonic! I was a little skeptical at first due to the &amp;#34;different&#x27; shape of the shaver compared to my old school Remington MS2-390 but, now couldn&#x27;t be happier. Had major problems with the Remington MS2-390 as the motor would rev up and down while plugged in and shaving corded! The switch was a major hassle too as you had to push it 10 times and hope it stayed on once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The motor on this shaver is far superior to the Remington and you can rinse it clean under running water. It gives a close, clean shave and is a pleasure to use. The battery fully charges in under an hour and you can get 4-5 shaves before it needs recharging. There&#x27;s a countdown LED on the shaver that tells what percentage of battery life is left. The unit cannot be turned on while charging so, it&#x27;s cordless only. If you are going back and forth through reviews, consider this very good shaver and by all means trust that Panasonic doesn&#x27;t just make cameras. They&#x27;ve done their homework here and it shows every time I shave. I&#x27;ll never go back!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about 5 months ago about switching to an electric razor, but I trusted the reviews on Amazon and spurred by my need for a more efficient and time saving shaving solution, I decided to purchase this Panasonic. Five months into it, I don&#x27;t regret it! The initial break in period was the hardest since my beard grows back very fast. It took about 2 weeks to get used to the motion and to get a technique going. Now, I run it on my face dry twice every week when the stubble is pretty thick, and it works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip:&lt;br /&gt;- For thick stubbles try a wet shave with foam and warm water. It is a great shave!&lt;br /&gt;- Do not expect it to work smoothly right away if you&#x27;re switching from the blade. Give it at least 2-4 weeks, just like the instructions and videos say.</li>
            <li> really quiet - works good - recharges quickly - comfortable - blades last long time -some nice extra features onit.</li>
            <li> Does not cut as close as a Norelco Rotary.  Must make several sweeps over the same areas to secure a close shave..  Disappointed</li>
            <li> Great product; shaves tough beard without skin rash from blade shavers.</li>
            <li> I have probably tried three dozen electric shavers over the past 45+ years and never liked a single one of them.&lt;br /&gt;I received this Panasonic model over a year ago as a gift. Never even opened the box............until last week.&lt;br /&gt;This razor works great!! If you slowly go over your face and make sure to rinse the blades every so often, the shave is quite remarkable. And not having my face turn into a bloody mess is a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very impressed with this razor and have no problem recommending it.</li>
            <li> I have used electric shavers for a while now and I recently purchased the Panasonic ES8103S. The shaver is identical to the ES8109, which has the drying dock. The ES8109S is great, if you are willing to spend the extra $50 - $70 for the drying dock, but not a necessity. I believe this shaver is far better than any other on the market due to its 30 degree blade and all other manufacturers use a 45 - 90 degree blade which requires multiple passes. (I&#x27;m an internet shopping junkie; hence I do a lot of research on details about products). It was definitely the right choice to get the ES8103S.</li>
            <li> The shaver requires going over my face many times, may need new blades already? BB</li>
            <li> This actually DOES shave close and comfortable and recharges real quick.</li>
            <li> Best electric shave I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve tried Braun, Norelco, Remington, pretty much all the top ones and this razor cuts the closest and gives me the least irritation. $ stars due to the battery draining really fast.</li>
            <li> Years ago I tried an electric razor, different brand, and using it felt like rubbing my face with rough sandpaper.  How the technology has improved!  This one gives a smooth, close shave quickly and easily.  It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to recharge.  And believe me, my beard is as tough as an old boar&#x27;s bristles.  Why did I wait so long before getting this one?</li>
            <li> This is my second Panasonic electric shaver.  I don&#x27;t have any experience with other electric shavers but can say that I really like this one.  A nice clean and comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have to shave everyday as I am retired. I probably have heavier growth than most men. Sometimes I don&#x27;t shave for 4-5 days (when staying at home and no one coming by) and it works well on short or longer stubble.  I have a mustache and have used the trimmer feature to trim that and it works very well.  I have not used it wet.  It charges rather quickly. It is very easy to clean. The only con I can think of is the placement of the on-off switch - because of the way I hold the shaver I will sometimes inadvertently turn it off while shaving - not a big deal but for me it happens.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I had been using Norelco shavers for years.  Amazon users rated this shaver as one of the best shavers.  The price is great.  Follow the directions and give the shaver a month to set the pattern in your beard.  With the Norelco, it took forever to shave and, within a couple of hours, you look like you have never shaved.  Shaving with this Panasonic is quick and easy.  In fact, I have found that if you shave morning and night, it takes about three minutes.  I would reccomend this shaver to anyone.</li>
            <li> Took a little time to get used to this razor as I was using a rotery for many years. But now that I am used to it I love it. Best shave ever.</li>
            <li> this Electric Shaver is easy for use.But it was made in China&amp;I&#x27;m now in China- -!But why the price here is much higher than it on the Amazon.All of the above,This Shaver is a nice thing.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend and he claims that this shaver is the best one he has tried out by far! It comes with a trimmer on the opposite side and he really likes it so far and as do I!  It does its job and a very clean job at it.</li>
            <li> Gives a comfortable shave and does an OK job but, it takes more repetitive strokes and still  lacks in closeness or ability to get into the small areas</li>
            <li> I&#x27; ve been using this razor for a few months now and really like it. Gives me a close shave even when using it dry. It has a lithium battery and last long between charges. The only negative thing I can say is its kinda loud.</li>
            <li> Been using electric razors most of my adult life and this one has by far been the best. The battery lasts a long time and it is simple to clean. I never use it wet, so I can&#x27;t attest to how well it works in that regard. Also, being a &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; razor, you cannot use it while it is charging.</li>
            <li> I have used Panasonic wet and dry shavers ever since I first saw one in a hardware store maybe forty or more years ago. I have had at least a dozen and a half or various models. My single biggest complaint has been the overpriced replacement head and screens. My second complaint has been the ni-cad and NiMH batteries that never seem to last. My third complaint has been the screens that fail to pick up the stray fine hairs that seem to sprout around the lower neck area.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver (ES8103S) scores with a lithium battery and has a slotted head that gets at the finer hairs. One complaint is that it does not shave as close as my cheap AA battery powered shaver I bought for ten dollars. I will keep searching for the perfect Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this shaver. I used another shaver years ago and it did not do as a good job as this one.&lt;br /&gt;Very close shave.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric shavers since 1949, and this one is the champ. Smooth and fast. It puts out a sound that seems to be of a higher pitch but not louder than other shavers I have had, and is not annoying.&lt;br /&gt;  Feb 2014 UPDATE: I was of a mind to downgrade to 4-star because the power monitor drops about 10% for each shave, implying that it is good for 10 shaves, so you must pack a charger for a two-week trip. Recently I decided to see how long it would run after the monitor showed 10%-RECHARGE. What do you know---it gave another 10 shaves before stopping,more than ample for the two-week trip. Also, running it down to zero at home is no great inconvenience; if it stalls in mid-shave just a few minutes on charge will let you finish. I have learned to better appreciate the \\&quot;clean me\\&quot; message also. If the power monitor were more accurate this shaver would deserve a 6-star rating.</li>
            <li> Reading several of the reviews, you&#x27;ll notice a trend that the screen starts having issues but the shaver will still work. I noticed that fairly soon after purchasing it. In terms of battery life, I get about a week&#x27;s worth of shaves out of it before it dies, invariably in the middle of shaving on Monday morning. Then I have to wait until it recharges enough for me to finish my shave since the genius designers decided not to let it be used while charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does give a very nice shave, it may take a couple extra passes in areas where the hair doesn&#x27;t grow in a uniform direction but that&#x27;s true with every shaver I&#x27;ve tried thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest gripe is with the trimmer. It flat out sucks. It folds down when attempting to use it and really takes a lot of work to get it to actually cut anything. So if you don&#x27;t shave for a couple days and have some longer hairs that are being stubborn about going down into the foil to get cut... good luck using the trimmer on them. You can completely forget using it on sideburns, mustache edges, or take down any amount of beard. It won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always hated the dry/rough feel of electric shaves, so I dreaded the thought of using an electric razor. But I&#x27;m on blood thinner now, so I needed an electric razor.  I had my son do an internet search of various types, and read all the reviews. I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks now, and I really love the smooth shave. The really nice thing is that I can use it with shaving cream. Based on my experiments the gel works better than the foamy. It runs for an entire week without recharging. I usually make one pass carefully shaving all the nooks and crannies; then another pass where I run my hand over my face to find the missed stubble. It works great, and I&#x27;m really pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joe</li>
            <li> Nice convenient, but i sure hope this is NOT the best. I can use it to take down some stubble, but still need straight edge for that super date!</li>
            <li> I used an electric razor early on...but then switched to a safety razor @~30. Now...30 years later...decide to try electric again. Electric is quicker &amp; easier to use, and this razor does provide a close shave..almost as close as the safety razor.</li>
            <li> I got this for my eighty eight year old father who has only ever used a safety razor except for maybe once. He said they made his face sore so wouldn&#x27;t switch to electric razor.  It has been a good switch, he hasn&#x27;t had any skin problem. I think the wet shave has made the difference.</li>
            <li> The shaves are great, even on wet/very dry skin. I recommend it as it is easy to handle and battery lasts for about 5 days using it 3 times in that period of time.</li>
            <li> Better than my razor ever was. No nicks and a quicker and closer shave,</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver! I would definitely buy it again and recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;This replaced my Braun shaver for a lot less and I&#x27;m glad I made the switch!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned it for almost two years now, and I&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Fast charge that last all week.  Easy cleanup.  Does a decent job, can quickly look decent in couple of minutes.  Hard to get a close shave on the neck.  Leaves some area no matter how hard you try.  The clipper on the back is great..  Good quality product that will last.</li>
            <li> This machine is very satisfying, I use it generally when I drive to office in a car. I keep it in my car so I am saving more time when I leave from home. During the shave in a car little bit beard dropping on my shirt but it is kind of dust so you can clean it with one hand motion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SKIN TAG&lt;br /&gt;  One of the reason I bought it, I have a skin tag on my neck, so when I use blade I cut it and trying to stop bleeding each time. If you have a king tag on your face or neck and have to shave smooth every day, that is what you have to use exactly. I give it 4 stars because trim side it not enough strong, you can only make small changes on your beard. If you have a long beard it will not cut properly but shaving part result almost as classic blade. I am not using since 6 months classic blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BATTERY&lt;br /&gt;I am also satisfying about the battery I use it in my cars and its battery good enough whole week.</li>
            <li> really good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic ES8103S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Silver (Health and Beauty)&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic</li>
            <li> I had a Braun prior to this razor.  I could buy 3 of these for what it cost me to own one Braun.  Even if this only lasts for a year or two, it gives a great shave and for the price, I can always buy another one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used electric razors and this is by far the best one that I&#x27;ve used. The swivel head is great. The battery display is handy. It looks great, too, not that that really matters to most guys. The timmer works just fine. The wet/dry ability is nice, too. Only complaint is that it can&#x27;t operate while charging; it must be unplugged. That said, the batter life is VERY good and when it&#x27;s down to 10% it lasts much longer than you would expect. Overall, this is a great item, and it made shaving SOOO much less of a unpleasant chore to accomplish.</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift and it has been given rave reviews! Quick shipment and great product. Well done. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Gives a nice smooth shave, but can cut you if you have pimple. Just started using electric shavers, maybe it will be fine once the technique is mastered.</li>
            <li> The ES8103S is an excellent razor.  It was acquired to replace an aging Norelco 8240XL, a Braun 1775 and the side cutters on a Panasonic ES4000.  The aging razors provide my base for comparison.  I would first comment that the ES8103S does a good job of shaving both fast and close.  It does not hug the face and particularly the chin area as well as the Norelco, but it seems to cut a little closer.  With its original screen and cutter, I liked the Braun 1775 a little better as a shaver.  Unfortunately, Braun&#x27;s replacement screen for the 1775 has a slightly different pattern and does not seem to cut as quickly or as closely.  It is funny how a manufacturer &amp;#34;improves&amp;#34; a product and makes it worse.  The side cutter on the ES8103S is good and better than the Braun or the Norelco.  It is not as good as the side cutter on the Panasonic ES4000 because it is mounted on the side of the razor body whereas the ES4000 cutter extends beyond the head of the razor and can better access areas around the ears and dangling nose hairs.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this shaver&#x27;s ability to actually give me a shave.  It takes twice as long to shave as the Braun that I retired and, frankly, I&#x27;ll soon by another Braun.  I just don&#x27;t have the time to waste.</li>
            <li> My son bought one of these and loved it.  Then my other son kept borrowing the razor so I purchased another.  Really a great product and still working great a few months later.</li>
            <li> New to wet shaving and I like it in the shower. Hope it wears well but it is too soon to tell</li>
            <li> Very quite, very close shave, long lasting battery life and the shaver is extremely light weight. Highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> I purchased this given the recommendation from The Sweet Home.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of facial hair, nor does it grow terribly fast, so the top recommendation from The Sweet Home seemed overkill.  The Arc3 is a good size and has good features, including a sideburn trimmer, so I can get rid of another battery-operated device on my bathroom counter.  The Arc3 is my first electric shaver; I&#x27;ve been sticking it out with a Gillette Sensor Excel but wanted a change in my shaving routine.  The Arc3 is okay so far.  I need multiple passes, particularly over my lip, but it does the job.  The repeated passes means skin irritation, so I put on moisturizer or coconut oil right after the shave.  For the money, it&#x27;s not a bad product.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this replacing my Gillette Fusion but the quality of the shave is a lot worse with the Panasonic.  OK for travelling but it took an age to get a decent shave with this and I found that I was shaving again prior to going out to dinner.</li>
            <li> This was a present for my son in law, though I have the exact same model. Cuts close without irritation (dry) and, if you have really sensitive skin, you can use shaving cream. The battery life is great - plus it has a battery status display - so there are no surprises.&lt;br /&gt;I have found that you need to replace the blades/screen each year or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a month.  I tried every technique I could think of (wet, dry, soap, no soap, lock on, lock off, at the sink, in the shower).  No matter what I tried, it took me over ten minutes to get even a poor shave.  This IS NOT a useful alternative to a razor. It is absolutely the worst electric shaver I have ever owned!</li>
            <li> Fits my hand perfectly and gives a great shave.  Easy to clean and the percentage of charge remaining window is nice</li>
            <li> The shaver sacrifices closeness for comfort will not pull hairs or irritate your face makes it a cinch to go over spots. One will need to perfect their technique since all razors are different but pulling the facial hair against the grain will make it easier for the blades to bite. Big advantage is comfort and less irritation.</li>
            <li> This product just doesn&#x27;t work. It would shave maybe 90% of my facial hair. What about the other 10%??? That needs to be shaved too! I had to keep going over the same spots to try and get the hair, eventually ending up with a rash and facial hair still uncut. If you have peach fuzz on your face, this product probably works great. I was so disappointed by this product that I would never even consider an electric shaver by Panasonic ever again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR: Don&#x27;t buy this, it doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I used it about eight times.  It takes some getting used to. The shaver comes in handy for a quick shave but it&#x27;s  not a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Electric razors have gotten slightly better since the last time I used one which was in the early 1960&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> After using Norelco for many years, decided to try something else.  Panasonic was a big disappointment and not just because I was accustomed to Norelco.  Shaving took twice as long to get the same closeness, because it move only in one direction and then has to be turned to another direction, to cut against the grain.  Norleco is round and can move in any, multi-directional.  Also, immediately noticed it was LOUD, who wants LOUD when just waking up in the morning (or anytime), next to my ears.  Also, compared to Norelco it was much larger in the hand and overall and much heavier. It didn&#x27;t give any closer shave, with a difference.  On my upper lip it got so close, my skin hurt, that&#x27;s too close.  When finished with Norleco, just pop the top and blow out the shaving \\&quot;dust\\&quot;, then put it back in the charging cradle until tomorrow.  How easy and so quiet, fast, light (Already mentioned, Panasonic is much heavier and larger).  Panasonic was like a Power Mower on my face, with no measurable difference it results.  Keep trying shaver makers, maybe some day a product better than Norelco will emerge.  When It does I will buy and use it. Purchased and returned at Amazon.  Amazon is always a positive experience.  Only \\&quot;complaint\\&quot;, is that Amazon makes is too easy to buy.</li>
            <li> Clean shaven every day.  Awesome cordless razor</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this shaver but he doesn&#x27;t love it.  The only reason he doesn&#x27;t love it is because it doesn&#x27;t have a stand to place it while it dries.  His old shaver had a little stand that also recharged it but this one just has the cord that you plug in directly to the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than not having a stand, he thinks it is an awesome shaver.</li>
            <li> Ladies, if you&#x27;re looking for a great father&#x27;s day gift for the dad in your life, consider a water proof electric razor! Not only can they shave in and out of the shower, but when you grab all the dirty clothes off the counter by said shower and throw them in the washing machine, said razor has a very good chance of surviving the endeavor AND coming out squeaky clean! It&#x27;s a win win that&#x27;s worth investing in!</li>
            <li> i was very pleasantly surprised with this product.  mainly i got it since the charger works from 110v to 240v, but it was also nice that this is a sealed shaver that can work in the shower.  even better is that it actually cuts through my clark kent-like facial hair and gives me a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> fair and not what I expected for a closer shave, and does not hold the charge for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li> I have two problems when it comes to shaving:&lt;br /&gt;1. I don&#x27;t shave every day.&lt;br /&gt;2. I have sensitive skin and some weird curves in my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I shave everyday and don&#x27;t miss any spots I don&#x27;t generally have many problems. Unfortunately I might miss a day or two (busy, tired, want to go for that rugged, unkempt look, etc.,) and this razor has a bit of difficulty in compensating for even one missed day of growth.&lt;br /&gt;Even if I shave every day there are some areas on my face that require a repeat performance and, even under wet conditions, this causes my face to react. My neck is especially troublesome, but I&#x27;ve learned how to angle the blade properly to get those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good razor and it performs better than the flatter-faced Norelco I was using before, but it does take a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd electric shaver I&#x27;ve purchased in my life and my first was about 10 years ago.  I strayed away from that as it was tugging my hair.  But as my neckline was getting irritated and based on a sale and generally positive reviews I bought this and have been trying it for 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good:&lt;br /&gt;- looks nice&lt;br /&gt;- hold a good charge&lt;br /&gt;- portable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad:&lt;br /&gt;- not a close shave at all.  Tried after one and two days of no shaving&lt;br /&gt;- cleaning is a little annoying&lt;br /&gt;- no case, just a bag&lt;br /&gt;- sideburn trimmer not attached and also a little annoying to put on and off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that&#x27;s my review.  I haven&#x27;t bought another electric razor and don&#x27;t know if I want to waste my money as you can&#x27;t exactly re sell a used razor like other products.  I hope this deters other people like me from wasting their money.  FYI I also read articles and watched videos on shaving and tried different methods to no avail.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco buy was never satisfied with the pinching I got, I&#x27;ve used the the Gillette 5 blades and 4 and their 3 and 2. I&#x27;ve been recently using single blades because I&#x27;ve been getting terrible raw and painful shaves. I shave dry long hair or short and I get what my wife calls &amp;#34;baby soft&amp;#34; skin and NO burning</li>
            <li> Honestly, I gave it a try knowing that I have never had luck with the electric razors. This one takes the cake, broke the camels back, trash and garbage. It won&#x27;t even shave the hair of ones arm. Would not recommend it to anyone. It is junk.</li>
            <li> I really thought after reading the reviews that electric razors had come a long way but they are still slow compared to a standard razor. Kind of a pain to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 87 year old father for Christmas.  He&#x27;s had numerous shavers over his lifetime.  After using for a few days now, he has commented that this is the best shaver he&#x27;s ever had.  That says a lot for the quality and functionality of this shaver.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I was sad when my old Panasonic wet/dry shaver finally died. The sculptural shape of the razor was beautiful (about the closest thing to an Apple product) and I loved the way it naturally fit in my hand.  In replacing it I opted for an update to the ES8103S because I like the linear drive, wet/dry and plug-in capabilities. While I miss the sensuous design of the old razor, I have to admit that the quality of the shave with the floating head is significantly better than old model. It&#x27;s just a shame that they could not have incorporated the original design.</li>
            <li> I think this razor is a great value. I&#x27;ve only ever used Panasonic wet/dry shavers, so I have no other manufacturer to compare to, but I find these razors to be a perfect blend of the closeness gained from traditional wet shaving with the general lack of skin irritation associated with electrics. Combine this with a nice cream - not foam - shaving product (like Cremo) and you are in business! Looking back at my purchases, it seems this razor lasts me about 3 years while shaving a heavy beard 25 of 30 days of the month. I replace the the foil and blades - regardless of foil health/appearance - every 6 months using Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save feature.</li>
            <li> Frankly, I would not buy this (or any electric razor) to use instead of blades. The results are just too patchy no matter how many passes you make or what kind of technique you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; What I use this for is to prepare my face or scalp (I shave my head too) for shaving with the blade by using it on areas that it works well on. I find it works very well in the back of my head (this area is difficult to shave with a Mach 3 because of frequent clogging). It also works well on the mustache area, the chin and the mid and upper cheeks (these areas are sensitive and get irritated easily when I use a blade so I&#x27;m happy to get any relief I can in those areas).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This unit does not work well at all on the neck area. You might as well not even bother unless you want to spend 20 minutes going over and over it and still having to finish it with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It may not sound like it but I&#x27;m satisfied with this shaver because I have owned several foil shavers in the past and I knew not to expect to be able to use it exclusively. I had a Braun many years ago and I loved it for the mustache area because I have a hard time shaving this area without pulling and pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The real advantages of this shaver are...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Wet or dry. This is great. Not necessarily for shaving wet. I don&#x27;t find it works significantly better wet but it&#x27;s nice to just be able to wash the heads. Sometimes I do like to take it in the shower with me and shave the back of my head and neck with the water running on it to instantly wash away the stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The battery technology is much improved over older shavers. The battery charges in an hour and holds a good charge for a while. If you don&#x27;t use it every day, you still don&#x27;t have to charge it every time you use it. The battery meter looks nice and it&#x27;s nice to know exactly how much juice you have. The shaver also doesn&#x27;t slow down and stall when it starts to run low on power. The battery features alone areworth at least half the price of the shaver. Just to not have to worry about any hassle. About the only thing I can think of that would make this aspect of it better would be if there was a very easy way to replace the battery with a reasonably priced replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion - If there are people who use these shavers every day without finishing off with a blade, I don&#x27;t know how they do it. This shaver is easy on your skin if you don&#x27;t make too many passes but it can still cause irritation if you push it. I don&#x27;t see too many men walking around with patchy shaves so I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s up with that. Maybe I&#x27;m just spoiled with the smoothness of the shave I get with the Mach 3 on my neck area. Also, it should be noted I don&#x27;t shave every day so maybe if you don&#x27;t let your stubble grow much it will do better. But I still find it doesn&#x27;t do a flawless job even on short stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have had this shaver for about 3 years (I think) and I don&#x27;t regret buying it. The battery shows no obvious signs of weakness so far and I haven&#x27;t even replaced the foil and cutters yet. Though I would say I probably should have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s especially nice to prep my scalp for shaving by going over those pesky areas that are hard to get at with the blade. I&#x27;d make a guess that anyone who shaves their head regularly would be glad to have this. If you know head shaving, you know it&#x27;s a process and you tend to need a variety of tools to get a good result.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the shave the Panasonic gives, but very disappointed in the battery life.  It only gives you about 8 shaves per charge.  Manufactures make better batteries.</li>
            <li> Replaces Norelco rotary whose battery died. Based on reviews (and cost difference), decided to give this a try. I find that it shaves almost as well as rotary, though takes longer, hence less skin-friendly. Seems to perform better &amp;#34;wet,&amp;#34; although using it in this manner is not environmentally friendly, as consuming oceans of water if used while showering. Not so dissatisfied that I would return it, but it&#x27;s no bell-ringer. IMO, shave from rotary is superior.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my purchase, one for me and one for my Dad.  Never going to find perfection, didn&#x27;t feel like investing hours researching, trusted brand and happy with the product.  Its a bit different than my 25 year old Braun which served me very well - no complaints there.  I&#x27;d buy it again, I feel this model is a sweet spot for value and performance and the price was awesome at $54.99</li>
            <li> it is good for me&lt;br /&gt;and it is very convenient in the morning compare with other razors.&lt;br /&gt;anyway it is good.</li>
            <li> does close shaving, wet or dry.  I do recommend buying this panasonic shaver for shaving without shaving cream or foam.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for a while and I am extremely happy with it! I bought this after I got frustrated with the rotating heads on my Remington continuing to pop out. After a bunch of research, I settled on this Panasonic. It has been great. Zero issues. I use it dry and wet, on my face and on my head, and have never had a single issue with it. I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> A gift for my son, his first shaver. Uses it all the time. Very smooth and easy to use, portable and reliable. For the price and the named brand he is happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I am sure that it is much better than PHILIPS shaver nice cutting, able to use during taking a shower, price etc.</li>
            <li> charges quick and last a long time. Easy to clean and was a great price. I highly recommend this razor</li>
            <li> Not good to sensitive skin at all. I&#x27;ve got red skin sometimes got blood. Don&#x27;t understand this had a good reviews.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor! I put it on my wish list and my daughter bought it for me for CHRISTMAS.&lt;br /&gt;My last razor was a Norelco. It often tugged at my face. It never did well under my nose.&lt;br /&gt;This ARC 3 does a great job everywhere. I love it!</li>
            <li> This razor gives a close shave, and is easy to use. Plus it can be cleaned at the same time you&#x27;re shaving in the shower!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the 3,4,and 5 blade disposables for yr&#x27;s and the Panasonic is just as good.. I use it in the shower with shaving cream and it works great.. Cleaning the razor is also very simple, a drop of Dawn and turn it on until it soaps up and rinse.</li>
            <li> I had another model from Panasonic for about five years, when the motor died on my.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading tons of reviews I decided to buy this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;O M G ! It is light years ahead of my older Panasonic shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the best shaver I ever bought.</li>
            <li> I had a braun for years. i hated the exspensive cleaning solution and big charging station. after two weeks my face is smoother and less red</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, the shaver gives a very close shave and the pivot motion is useful.  The battery life is very long, lasting about 2 weeks for me between charges.  It charges very fast, typically an hour from 10% to 100% full, and the digital battery indicator helps me decide if I need to charge prior to taking it on long trips.&lt;br /&gt;The reason for 2 stars is the trimmer which I use for sideburns broke after only 20 months of use. There is a tiny plastic gear nub (for lack of a better description) that vibrates the trimmer blade, and the nub either wore down or broke.  Therefore it does not trim any longer.  Mind you I use the trimmer only every other day on average.  The shaving part still works great.  I tried to find a replacement part however could not find one; I would have to disassemble the unit to replace the plastic gear.  I gave it to my wife who can use it for her legs but I&#x27;ll have to buy another shaver/trimmer now.</li>
            <li> Razor work great. I get a very close shave and it gets the difficults places like under the chin very well. Also, the handle grip is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver.  I resisted the switch from manual razors for 15 years.  Even when my wife gifted me one - I love gadgets - so she thought it would be a great birthday gift - within the first few years our marriage.  But, I promptly returned it without even opening. These days she doesn&#x27;t bother buying any electronics for me.  So, I end up gifting myself on my birthdays.  And I continued to fill the bank accounts of Gillette, religiously buying their sensor excel cartridges.  But in the last 3-4 years, I haven&#x27;t been satisfied with my shaves.  It is not as close - and the blades seem to lose their edge soon - only after ~4 shaves.  This time when it was due to buy new blades I did a quick math and realized that for the money I spend on the replacement cartridges, I can buy a new electric shave every year.  I am all about saving money - so I decided it give it a try.  Worst case, I can go back to manual, after a year.  So, after the ritual of reading and re-reading the reviews of electric shavers at Amazon, I finally settled on this one.  Firstly the cost - there was also a $15 off special - and the great reviews.  First Experience: As I got this shaver out of the well packaged box, it felt quite good in my hand - I liked the ergonomics.  It was not too heavy or too big.  Seemed just right.  Switching from manual shaver, I wanted a dry/wet shaver, which is why I chose this one.  Looking back, I realize I don&#x27;t really need the wet shave feature.  Yes, the first time I tried with shaving cream, it was quite messy.  With the foam on, I could not see which parts I missed.  I finally ended up washing it all off and going over the missed parts again.  Felt much better now.  After 2 weeks: After first use, I started doing dry shave, and just love the result.  It is very good and I agree with the other reviewers. I get a really close shave and really quick &amp;#60;5 minutes (as opposed to ~10 minutes with manual shave).  I clean it by rinsing off in the faucet, shaking the water and leaving it on the counter to dry.  The trimmer is a nice feature - very useful for the sideburns, as I do grow sideburns.  The surprise was that the battery lasted for whole two weeks - that is 6 shaves - before it got down to 10% and the charge indicator started blinking.  CONS: IT IS NOISY - yes, particularly when you do your cheeks/sideburns - it is like a bee is buzzing around your head.  One day my wife came upstairs wondering if there was a bee inside our house.  I seriously considered using ear plugs - but didn&#x27;t want to look at a goofy self image every time I shaved and so decided against it - at least for now.  Hopefully I grow out of this noise, as this is a wonderful little shaver, except for the noise.  I will come back after a few months and add comments about how the battery holds up.  But, honestly, if this lasts for 2 years - I would have got more than my money&#x27;s worth and would gladly buy another one.  Update (July 2017): After 3 years of continuous usage - 3 times a week - it is going strong, except I had to replace the Outer Foil around 18 months, as it wore out and started scratching my face.  The battery still holds up quite well - around 10% per shave.  So, I recharge once in two weeks or so.  I recently bought another one of the same, when the price went down - just to have as a backup.  Yes, it is noisy; but I am okay putting up with it for 10 minutes every other day.</li>
            <li> easy to carry and very easy to recharge.  it has weight&lt;br /&gt;, style and attractiveness. one might even call it sexy.</li>
            <li> This is not even close to &amp;#34;one-pass shaving&amp;#34; or whatever they claim.  I have pretty sparse facial hair that doesn&#x27;t grow too rapidly and isn&#x27;t very coarse, but I still have to go over and over most spots to get a *relatively* smooth shave.  When shaving I can *see* spots of hair that the shaver is missing, but going over those spots again and again still doesn&#x27;t remove them.  It&#x27;s just not that powerful of a shaver, I guess.  I tried replacing the blade and that didn&#x27;t improve anything.  So I would recommend not wasting your money on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, my girlfriend bought the slightly better Panasonic ES8249S model -- I think it&#x27;s no longer sold, but it has 4 blades and 13,000 RPM and it works MUCH better (yes, she uses it on her legs but I use it on my face too).  It&#x27;s not perfect either (I&#x27;d give it 4 stars) but works well enough with the convenience factor that yesterday (Feb 17, 2014) I bought the current version ES8243A for $80 on a lightning deal.  It was time for me to replace the blade on this ES8103S anyway, and since I really don&#x27;t care for it, I decided to just put that money towards a new shaver that I know works better (the one I bought has basically the same specs as the ES8249S model that we also own, so I expect it to work similarly).  So I would spend the extra money -- when the shaver goes on sale (and these Panasonic ones often do here on Amazon) -- on a 4-blade model.  The new shaver should be here tomorrow, I&#x27;ll review it after I have a little time to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, don&#x27;t bother buying the &amp;#34;Vortex cleaning system&amp;#34; with that base thing that you plug the shaver into.  These shavers all have a built-in &amp;#34;cleaning mode&amp;#34; and we don&#x27;t ever use the base cleaning system or whatever.  It&#x27;s just an extra gimmick IMO to raise the price.  Just buy the shaver alone.</li>
            <li> Very nice and lives up to all the ratings provided by other reviewers.  Have had it for quite a while.  Probably time to start looking for new blades and screen.  Should be easy to do through Amazon!!</li>
            <li> This is my second Panasonic Arc3 razor and I still enjoy it as much as the first.  I wore the first one out and bought the second one and it is still in use</li>
            <li> This is my second Panasonic shaver. I have dense, thick facial hair and very very sensitive skin which bleeds under normal blade conditions. I had a top of the line braun which gave a mediocre shave and irritated my skin after about 6 months of use. The Panasonic is less expensive, and provides the closest shave of any electric ever tried before, with ZERO (yes ZERO) irritation. I Can use this thing once a day without a problem. I prefer dry with a bit of LECTRIC SHAVE oil which makes all the difference in the world. I have purchased this for friends and recommended it to colleagues. If you are in the market for an electric shaver, give Panasonic a try , you will not be disappointed. Battery lasts just about all week, and I rarely replace the foil and blade more frequently than once per 12-16 months. My last one lasted for over 5 years and was going strong, I simply wanted the &amp;#34;latest and greatest&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor to go along with my Norelco.  It does a very good job in getting a clean and smooth shave. I read some reviews as to where some folks complained it to be too loud ...I disagree! My Norelco is quieter, however, that is because of it having ROTARY cutting blades.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and it does it&#x27;s job done. My son is very satisfied and happy with it.</li>
            <li> Cuts pretty close.  Long hairs were a problem with other razors but this one does a good job with them.  So far only downfall is this razor seems rougher than other electrics.  My skin feels rough after I am done.  Might just take more time for my face to get used to this one?</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave as claimed. I need to go over my face at least 3 times and still don&#x27;t get a good shave. If I go out in the evening I need to shave again so&#x27;s the stubble is not too severe? If Amazon would take this back it would be gone in a heartbeat?</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to buy this razor as an open box item for $45 (yay me) and I am very, very pleased with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d previously been using a cheapo, generic foil shaver and I was only able to use it dry.&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t a particulary close shave (and resulted in terrible burn afterwards), but I&#x27;ve never had much luck with razors (I irritate very easily), so it was pretty much my only affordable (less than $90) option, &#x27;till I found this lovely little piece of technology that is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first charged this baby up and shaved with it, I was pretty impressed (very impressed actually).&lt;br /&gt;I had ZERO irritation, ZERO burn (after getting used to it, which only took about 5 days, otherwise very minimal burn the 1st time), and ZERO ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;My face was smooth and I could go out in public without looking like I landed face-first in a patch of poison ivy.&lt;br /&gt;Being that this is a machine, it&#x27;s not gonna be quite as close as a razor, but truthfully, the difference is so minimal that the trade-off is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave itself is very, very nice.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that it doesn&#x27;t quite shave the neck area as well as I&#x27;d like it to, and as such, I can&#x27;t give the machine 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worked very well for me along my jaw and for the majority of the cheeks, but just shy of the mustache, no matter how much I maneuver it, it always misses the same 3 or 4 hairs. I have to use the trimmer to get them.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer also does a wonderful job of shaping my sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the machine both wet and dry.&lt;br /&gt;I usually go dry for the convenience (shave in 3-4 minutes), but I&#x27;ve noticed that, in my case at least, wet shaving yields slightly better results, particularly in the way of less missed hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I also highly suspect that wet shaving will keep the blades from dulling as fast as they would when dry shaving, being that wet hair is easier for the blades to cut through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether I have bad luck or not,I can&#x27;t say, but after only 6 months of using the machine (daily basis), it seems I have to replace the inner blades already. It&#x27;s not cutting quite as nicely as the 1st time I used it. I can no longer shave dry and achieve the same smoothness I once did. I shave wet now to achieve the results I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used the machine on my legs and it does a pretty dandy job.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t stick a blade to my upper leg, due to the sensitivity of my skin, but the ES8103S achieves wonderful results without my needing to resort to a blade. Of course, it takes much longer to shave than with a blade (40 minutes or so for me), but I&#x27;m more than happy with the results I&#x27;ve achieved. Near-perfect smoothness with no irritation, redness, or bumps.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that I get the best shave by using very, very light pressure on the initial passes while keeping the machine perpendicular to the area being shaved, and then gradually pressing just a bit harder while varying the angle of the shaving head. Always against the grain of hair growth at first. I usually follow-up with passes that are half across the grain, and half against the grain (45 degrees) to ensure a uniform shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the machine is a breeze. I just put a little soap on the foil, switch it to turbo mode while it&#x27;s under hot water, let it run and then I&#x27;m done (yeah, that rhymed).&lt;br /&gt;I usually run the machine in alcohol afterwards, then I let it air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros of this machine most definitely outweigh the cons.&lt;br /&gt;For those who have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use razors, I highly recommend this machine, or the ES-LA63-S (for those with a slightly higher budget).&lt;br /&gt;The zero-irritation factor is something that I just can&#x27;t speak highly enough of.&lt;br /&gt;Add convenience into the mix and that makes this machine a true godsend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 7 months of use, my LCD has half-started to fade, so instead of seeing 50%, I&#x27;ll just see a 5. I can still at least tell when my machine needs to be charged, though. The problem seems to be intermittent. It&#x27;s curious.&lt;br /&gt;I would still definitely recommend giving this machine a shot, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Score:&lt;br /&gt;The Shave: 8/10 (since it&#x27;s not as close as a razor and missed a few hairs which I have to get with the trimmer. The fact that there&#x27;s zero irritation, though. HUGE plus, so I don&#x27;t mind giving up a little bit more closeness for that)&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning: 9/10 (stupidly easy to clean. soap, water, alcohol, air dry. I don&#x27;t give perfect scores hence the 9/10)&lt;br /&gt;Durability: 6/10 (LCD display starting to glitch after 6 months of use is a bummer. Needing to replace my inner blades after 6 months of use is also a bit of a drag.)&lt;br /&gt;Maneuverability: 7/10 (the machine itself has little problem reaching any tricky spots, but the trimmer is very limited. If often closes itself on me, so I have to put my thumb under it to stop that from happening, which results in quite a bit of awkwardness when it comes to maneuvering it around my face. This machine isn&#x27;t particularly cooperative when it comes to styling your facial hair, but I prefer to be clean shaven anyways, so it&#x27;s not a problem for me)&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 7/10 (The shave itself is great as far as machines go, but the fact that it misses a few hairs and doesn&#x27;t do my neck as well as I&#x27;d like lowers the rating a bit. Other cons include the lack of maneuverability, particularly in the case of the trimmer, and the faulty LCD display.)</li>
            <li> very good~~ Panasonic ES8103S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shave...&lt;br /&gt; i hope saw this product next time.&lt;br /&gt;i love it~~</li>
            <li> Eletric shavers are never perfect. But this is the best I have used.-  I am done with plastic razors for good.</li>
            <li> Nice price good quality&lt;br /&gt;I like it!</li>
            <li> A great shaver. I bought a second one in case the first ever wears out or breaks.</li>
            <li> This electric shaver provides a close shave.  I really like the pivoting head; it makes it easier to hold the blades at the optimum shaving angle when shaving my neck.  I&#x27;ve used other electric shaves and have always had to clean up problem areas with a regular razor.  Since using this I haven&#x27;t had to do this.  I was a little surprised with how high the hum of the motor is but it&#x27;s understandable concerting how fast it is moving.  There is only one design flaw.  The charging cable has a sideways orientation (perpendicular to the tongs) and will not fit into the outlets in my bathroom because they are between two cabinets.  Every other rechargeable device I have had a vertical orientation or one that rotates to allow for small spaces that many bathrooms have.  I really like the shaver so I&#x27;ll just continue to charge it in another room.</li>
            <li> Shaves beard well without burn.  Fairly quick.  Easy to clean.  Fairly quick charge.  I&#x27;ve had mine for about 2 years without a problem.</li>
            <li> It is taking a while Io get used to this shaver.  It is very well made, solid and sounds like a quality shaver because it is....  My first Panasonic brand and I have high hopes</li>
            <li> This product is very good. Though the power drop down by 10% after using for 2 or 3 times, it can charge itself quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old Panasonic razor, which had given me more than a decade of good shaves but now needed a new battery, foil, blade and trimmer blade (All were original, and had performed above and beyond the call of duty). I was hoping this one would be as good; but it is even better! A closer, comfortable shave, and quieter to boot! My face is happy, and so am I.</li>
            <li> I got this for my Dad, who is 85, and has never used anything but a razor blade to shave.  He went on blood thinners a few weeks ago and shaving with a razor is completely out for him.  He really likes this and feels like he gets a good shave, much better than he was expecting.  And it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor as a birthday present for my fiance. His skin is very sensitive so I was relieved to find that the razor blades were hypoallergenic. Whenever he uses it, I find that his face feels smooth and always has a close shave. Clean up is a snap. Pertaining to the noise level, it&#x27;s a masculine razor. There&#x27;s supposed to be a hum. The razor has good power behind it. Five days of using it and the battery power is 40%. I would recommend this razor to anyone!!</li>
            <li> I had one of these several years ago and when it wore out, I downgraded to a less expensive model.  Mistake.  I so like this razor, close shave, lasts all week.  I use it in the shower with shaving cream for the best results.  When it wears out, I&#x27;ll be replacing it with the same unit.  Expect about three years service life.</li>
            <li> I am not keen on the use of this shaver; I purchased it for the shaving of my bikini area, armpits, and occasionally my legs. I am not sure how it works on the tough facial hair that men have, but I do not recommend using this shaver if you are a woman.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for over 2 years and I have to say I will always prefer this over traditional razors. It cuts close without nicks, it has a precision trimmer on top and you will never need to bother with expensive razor blades ever again.</li>
            <li> This is a very well-designed product.  I have had it for 2 years now, and the battery still holds a charge for well over a week of consistent use before needing to be recharged.</li>
            <li> Is ok product but for the price I expected it to get a closer shave it really is just hit and mis you have to go over the same spot multiply times in multiply directions to get a half way descent shave other then not shaving really close battery power good cleaning unit is very easy</li>
            <li> Shaver does very well on short hair however on beards it is painful.</li>
            <li> Four and a half years later, and it&#x27;s still going strong (bought in May 2010).  It&#x27;ll still last through a four-week business trip without recharging.  It also recharges really quickly, so if you&#x27;ve forgotten to charge it just before a week-long trip, half an hour will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t felt the need to change the blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a lot of electric razors (Norelco, Braun), and this is as good as any of them.  No electric razor is as good as a blade, but at 2.5 bucks a blade (geeez!), this baby has paid for itself at least three times over (and more like four).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used it to shave my scalp for awhile, and it worked just as well there as on my face.</li>
            <li> Very surprised at the quality.  I have owned 12 or more shavers in the last 20 years, and this is one of the better ones, very close shave, I think closer than Braun&#x27;s big one I also have.  Braun&#x27;s has a cleaning cradle and some nice touches, but actually this one became my favorite after one day&#x27;s use.  The super high speed must be a good answer to the shaving problem.  It is pretty fast as compared to using the Braun, and is quiet enough as well.  NOTE the charger is a bit clunky by comparison to Braun. No coil-cord and old fashioned looking plug-charger.  One the plus side, one long shave seem to only use 10% of my first charge.  The % battery left indicator is great, better than competitors I think.  The price is among the lowest too.  So for value I give this 5 stars, it is a very good shaver at a very good price.  I will probably by another, when I find something good, they usually quit making it or &amp;#34;improve&amp;#34; it (not).  Best to get two of anything you like, next year&#x27;s models are not always (if ever) quite as good.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I was excited that electric razors might finally be worth using.  But no one mentioned the smell of burning hair, not a smell I can endure daily.</li>
            <li> Great, The shaver is beautiful, the price is acceptable. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> what can i say?  A GREAT shave</li>
            <li> Really good shaver. Charges quickly, and I love that I can see how much charge is left so it doesn&#x27;t die on me half way through shaving.</li>
            <li> Takes time to get used to this. Now I use both my Gillette razor and this electric shaver to get a closer shave. Shave against the grain. If stub is &amp;#62;1 day then hard to get it off with this. Battery life is good and the cleaning is no problem.  However, my razor stays.</li>
            <li> Until my purchase of this electric razor I have used a combination of blades and a trusty Braun 7000 Series that was adequate for a second shave if needed in the evening (fast growth) but was too much work to use as a primary shaver. It still operates strongly after eight years however which speaks highly of the brand. \\&quot;If\\&quot; money was no object I would have purchased the new high-end Braun that is rated as the best overall unit in Consumer Reports but at 1/4 the cost this Panasonic is a fantastic alternative and excellent value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pnanasonic Strengths:&lt;br /&gt;*Very fast charge to 100%; better than advertised.&lt;br /&gt;*Lightweight and comfortable grip&lt;br /&gt;*Shave quality on a two-day beard was EXCELLENT and required no multiple passes except on neck&lt;br /&gt;*Absolutely no burn or irritation and I used no shave cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weakness:&lt;br /&gt;* The ONLY drawback to this unit is the horrific high-pitched SCREAM of the motor! If the quality of the shave was not so strong this one thing would be enough to cause a return. Instead I will gladly live with it as the total shave time was only 3 minutes. We all put up with lot&#x27;s worse for less results so this shaver is absolutely a keeper and at this price I am thinking that it will make a great present for others. Am ordering two more today.</li>
            <li> It is the close shave I ever have with a electric shaver. I&#x27;m very happy with this product. After using the norelco latest shaver wich is nothing compare to this great purchase. It fells just as close shave as a razor, buy this pruduct and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This shaver really does the job! Its soft a doesnt hurt the skin, at least its no my case. I recommend u this one, u wont regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This its my second shaver, the first one was a remington but its doesnt even close to this panasonic!</li>
            <li> Awesome product and it works really well.  I was told I might have a little razor burn at first, but it never happened.  The transition from a straight razor was seamless.  Good work Panasonic</li>
            <li> I have been using Electronic shavers for 30+ years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am most impressed with the quality of shaving and my skin is so smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality of shaving&lt;br /&gt;Good pricing ($70)&lt;br /&gt;Quick (1 hour) charging&lt;br /&gt;Wet/dry feature for easy cleaning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made me smile to give 5 stars!</li>
            <li> This shaver packs some power! Just what we were looking for!</li>
            <li> This is possibly worst shaver I have ever had. First it is very noisy with  excessive vibration。 Your hand feels the pain after using it for several minutes. Second the battery is short lived. You have to recharge after using 3-4 times. It does not worth the price at all.</li>
            <li> Used this multiple times to shave my head. Fast and reliable. I&#x27;ll get about 2-3 shave before having to recharge it again.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd one we have purchased and is a terrific shaver.</li>
            <li> I have been buying Panasonic razors over the years. Each is an improvement over the previous older razor.  But, this one is a quantum leap better!  I congratulate the engineers at Panasonic for their ongoing efforts to improve their razors.  The ES81035 shaves quietly, quickly, and closely, and stays sharp much longer than the older Panasonic razors I have had.  I bought this one six months ago, and it is still as sharp as then.  It is easy to clean up, with a little Comet spray bathroom cleaner  and a rinse under the tap.  I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Lasted 3 years, just got a replacement this is like the 5th Panasonic wet and dry I have bought. On days I want an impeccable shave I do have to touch with a conventional razor. I have never replaced the foils on any of my shavers but might start doing that</li>
            <li> Not as good as the Norelco. Does not give a very close shave. I have used my Norelco rotary with 3-year-old blades to clean up stubble left over from a shave with the brand new Panasonic. The battery life is also lacking compared to my aging Norelco 7810XL.  The Panasonic seems to require frequent recharging whereas the Norelco goes on and on. I also don&#x27;t like the high whine of the Panasonic motor and much prefer the lower pitch of the Norelco when shaving. For these reasons, I can&#x27;t recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> Shaves well but like to kick out some stubble dust.  Not much but enough that I&#x27;d rather not have to wipe down the sink when I&#x27;m pressed for time.  Overall, its a good razor.</li>
            <li> I used to be a Norelco man. Not anymore. This razor does a wonderful job on my sensitive skin. It is easy to clean and not as loud as I thought it would be. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> For the price, it is a great shaver.  Though higher priced made in Japan shavers (ES8103S is made in China) are better in quality and performance, this shaver is no slouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However and having used several of these in the last 16 years, I wish they use metal instead of plastic for certain parts that are visible.  One plastic part that invariably breaks after two to three years use, is the one that moves the center blade.  If it were made of metal, the shaver should last for another couple of years.  Three of the shavers used in the past had this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully Panasonic people check these comments.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my 10+ year old Braun 5414 electric shaver.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of facial hair but I like a close shave.  I feel like I get a closer shave with the Panasonic electric shaver than with a manual razor blade (but without the razor cuts and burn).  I&#x27;ve only used it twice but am very pleased with the purchase.  It&#x27;s lightweight, charges quickly, display battery power and have a turbo cleaning mode.  Only possible con that I can think of is durability.  Time will tell.</li>
            <li> I was excited that I was finally going to allow myself to spend more than the $49.99 I paid for my previous shaver, the Remington MS290 (I think that was it). Too bad that excitement didn&#x27;t transfer to the model I selected. The ES8103S is a quality looking, feeling and sounding device. I just have had no success with the shaving part. The areas that were more difficult to shave, especially under the neck and along the jaw line back my ears take forever to come smooth It requires many, many, many passes over and over the same area in different directions (even upside down) pulling my skin this way and that. I have relatively light growth, but it seems to work much better after say, three days of not shaving. I have still to use it wet in the shower as many have said provides a closer shave since I can&#x27;t fathom wasting that much water. I did try a shaving talc and that seemed to help but it is still not as good as my old dead Remington. I must say the Remington was definitely a rougher experience and would \\&quot;burn\\&quot; if I was a little too aggressive which the ES8103S does not do. It also needed more than one shot at certain areas, but that was what I was hoping to avoid. Oh well, next time a Braun?</li>
            <li> I bought an electric shaver a couple years ago for the same price as this one (around $60).  I wish I could remember the brand and model, as it would certainly help with the comparison I am about to do.  But, I threw that one away after using this one for the first time, and I will tell you why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used this shaver twice, but I couldn&#x27;t be more impressed.  I will usually use a manual razor in the shower, then use my electric to pick up anything I missed.  However, if it has only been a day or two since my last shave, I will just use the elctric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got this shaver, I plugged it in to charge, which it did within a couple hours from 20% to 100%.  After using it twice, it is still at 100%, which the convenient LCD screen will tell you.  My old one had no such indicator, and you only knew how much charge was left by the motor slowing down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the quality of the shave is obviously the most important aspect of the product.  This product delivers in a big way.  It has been very hot here in the Pittsburgh, PA area, as many are probably aware, since ti has been pretty hot all over the US.  As such, I would often be a bit sweaty, after taking a hot shower and drying off in a bathroom with little ventilation.  My former shaver was very difficult to use under these conditions, and there were times I wouldn&#x27;t even bother because I knew it would be too difficult to move around on my skin, which would cause irritation.  This one, hwoever, has performed flawlessly, even under those conditions.  It does not stick and jump around, as I move it over my face, even when it reaches a \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; spot from the sweat.  The closeness of the shave is also excellent, which, again, is the key to a good shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost went for the expensive shavers that are sold by other brands, such as the SensoTouch.  However, after reading the lackluster reviews on those, I couldn&#x27;t justify spending the money.  Now, I&#x27;m really glad I didn&#x27;t, asI don&#x27;t believe for one second that this shaver is lacking in any way over the more expensive models out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should point out there is one thing to be aware of.  The noise this thing makes is pretty loud.  When I was using it on Sunday, I kept thinking that it sounds like a weed whacker.  Now, that&#x27;s an exaggeration, but the somewhat high-pitched noise at a decently high volume is something to be aware of, as some people are sensitive to such things.  My hearing is better than most peoples&#x27;, and it didn&#x27;t bother me.  If someone was asleep in the next room, I suspect this would probably wake them up.  That wasn&#x27;t enough of a reason to justify me giving this product any lower of a rating because, like I said, it doesn&#x27;t bother me a bit.  All in all, if you&#x27;re comparing this to the $150-$250 shavers out there, I recommend saving your money and giving this one a try.  I&#x27;m not at all sorry that I did.</li>
            <li> This was an anniversary gift for my husband.  He loves it.  He said that it works really well.  He has yet to recharge the battery, and he&#x27;s been using it every day for the past three weeks.  I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product. He&#x27;s asking himself why has he waited so long to use a good product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He enjoys the shaver because of the shave close to the skin without cutting him or pulling.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Panasonic ES8103 after going through a number of razors in the previous ten years. I had tried all the major brands and was generally unhappy with them. This razor was amazing! It shaved my sensitive skin without irritation and redness and it got every hair. Plus it didn&#x27;t take but a few minutes to do it. The battery easily lasted two weeks between charging and cleaning was a cinch. That was when it was new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After nearly two years of use, this razor is still kicking it. Short shaving times, long-lasting battery, no irritation, and it&#x27;s still easy to clean. I am so impressed I just bought replacement blades which I never do because of the cost vs a new razor. This one is a keeper. Hands down, the best razor I have ever used. I would, and have, recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Not the top of the line but it works just fine and the battery lasts for a week without going for a charge, You should think twice about buying the top of the line, save $$$ and get this model.</li>
            <li> Great shaver and great price.  This razor replaced the older model #8103.  Used that one for too many years without replacing the foil and blades.  I&#x27;ve learned my lesson and will change them more often.  The new razor seems to shave better and with less noise for a good clean shave.  I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard.  The only thing that I think they could improve on is the flip up trimmer.  I think it would be nice if it was a bit wider.  Yes I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought the Panasonic ES8103S Arc 3 razor this last weekend. It appears to be well made and light but it does not cut nearly as close as my old basic Braun. I like to try different brands to see what truth there is in the hype. I find it hard to believe some of these reviews that think this razor cuts real close. It is about as good as the old Remington I had 30 years ago. Not bad but definitely not great.</li>
            <li> I live in Viet nam and had my friend buy this for me. I receive it today. It looks nice and works well to me. I own several electric shavers, one old-type SHARP, one Braun (bought last month) and this Panasonic. Comparing these 3, the Panasonic is the best one for me as I have lots of neck hairs that were very difficult to be shaved with the SHARP or even with the Braun shaver. I usually had to use razor additionally for this area.&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic cuts well and close, I feel that the motor runs faster than the other 2. Though someones commented that it is noisy but for me the noise is OK (I tried it in my office for several times but no one seemed to be affected with that noise).&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s the innitial feeling I can tell you and I will continue updating with durability of this product. At this time, I highly recommended this shaver to those who have many side burns and neck hairs like me.</li>
            <li> I was pretty underwhelmed with this razor. Don&#x27;t get me wrong... It does the job. Shaves are pretty close and smooth. But, it takes longer than a standard shave. It takes significantly longer if you wait more than a couple days between shaves. I also end up using a standard razor anyway to clean up whiskers that the Panasonic misses. With stubble going, I need to use the trimmer to cut everything down to a shorter length before using the shaver. Again, this is time consuming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside the shave quality and duration, the razor seems relatively well made. No mechanical issues after half a year of use. The razor has to be taken apart after every shave and left to dry, otherwise it will develop a bit of a funk (smell). I have been diligent with rinsing and keeping it clean (hot water + dish soap, as the instructions suggest), but if I don&#x27;t disassemble the unit to dry. It smells. The battery is pretty solid, a full charge gets me at least 4 shaves or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had high hopes for replacing my standard razor with this Panasonic, but after about half a year I am probably going to switch back to the old-fashioned approach. The time and work just aren&#x27;t worth it to me.</li>
            <li> This shaver has a good design, it&#x27;s quitter than others and shaves very close. 1st Panasonic for me. I am very please with it</li>
            <li> Pro:&lt;br /&gt;battery life&lt;br /&gt;easy wash/ clean up&lt;br /&gt;light and durable&lt;br /&gt;good shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons (in depth):&lt;br /&gt;Takes about six to ten usages to &amp;#34;break in&amp;#34;.  The first few shaves were inconsistent and not very smooth but after using it for a short while, the shave becomes quicker, less tugging, and does its job as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Emits an odor sometimes, like metal heating/burning up or something.  I do not use it on wet hair just becomes I find it difficult to shave.  With that being said, it doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; the hair up.  Around the mouth and chin, it does a fine job but along the jaw and the neck areas, arent as effective.&lt;br /&gt;Also the compartment that stores the hair doesnt really work all that well.  I noticed during my shave, most of it lands in the sink and not caught in the storage head contraption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it because of its price, easy clean up, battery life and quickness.</li>
            <li> I used this shaver regularly for 6 years before finally retiring it. It shaved as well as other electric razors that I have used. It was used wet for the entire span and had only one problem - the battery display fogged over and became unreadable. You could still tell when it needed to be charged however because it blinks when it gets down to 2 percent. The battery life was still very good despite the age of the device but I was careful to nearly discharge it every time and occasionally fully discharge it as suggested for this kind of battery. I received a different brand/model as a gift otherwise I would have considered getting the newest version of the wet/dry Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Had it for a few weeks now and I really enjoy it. Quick to shave and gets all the hair on my face fairly easily. No tugging at my face required, but a few passes may be needed. Plan on re-rating to 5 stars if it holds up over the next few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Favorite part: You only have to replace the outer foil once a year and the inner blades once every two years. (About $36 for a pack of both)</li>
            <li> Eventually any type of wetness will mess with the device.  The display stopped working after awhile, and it was impossible to tell if it was charged or not because of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it was a decent razor.</li>
            <li> In general, will do with it, there is no handy in hope， you can use a single charge BY A week</li>
            <li> Panasonic had best reviews so I order it and it performs as well as all the other reviewers said it would. It shaves better than my prior twenty year old Remington electric shaver. Panasonic products always seem to perform better than expected.</li>
            <li> Bought as gift for my boyfriend. He says it works great and leaves a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for over a year now...........absolutely the best electric I have ever owned!  I must add that I&#x27;m 78 years old.</li>
            <li> This might work good on most people but it did not do good on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;But it did good on face .&lt;br /&gt;And in all fairness i have yet to find an electric razor that does, hoping this was the one but it was not.</li>
            <li> Very good . No problems</li>
            <li> Very good product. I&#x27;ve used multiple brands of Electric Shavers and this one is by far the most comfortable and battery efficient. Granted that I have still not found any electric shaver that cuts perfectly like a razor but this comes very close and leaves maybe 2-3 spots lightly haired. But that is also because my beard grows awkward and not all hair grow in same direction. Very satisfied with this and I purchased 3 so far. One for my dad (who is also happy with this product), one for me, and one I purchased 3 years ago which is still running. Another one I just purchased as a spare since I love this shaver so much! :-)</li>
            <li> I really love this shaver but after just a few months it&#x27;s not working well.  Now taking forever to shave &amp; the blades &amp; foil needing replacing.  For that price I may as well buy a whole new one.  Plan on it being a short term disposable razor.  So disappointing, now I don&#x27;t know what to buy</li>
            <li> not as close as a razor but is the best I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Best electric Razor I ever owned.  This is my second one. First one is used almost daily and is still going strong after almost 3 years. years.  Even the battery still is in great condition.</li>
            <li> Had trouble with foil heads</li>
            <li> good gift for my friends.</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver.  I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver for more than 10 years, as I pretty much hated them.  This with shaving cream is fantastic!  Cleaning it is easy!  The whole process is so much faster than using a blade, its great.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Delighted with shave... Perfect for shaving my head to a bald perfection!</li>
            <li> At more than twice the price of the now discontinued Remington Titanium MS2 series shavers, I was hoping that this product could compete--at least match the level of closeness and efficiency (i.e., how long it takes from shaving start to finish). Although the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; shave feature is a nice novelty, neither it, nor the standard dry shave experience even cones close the the Remington MS2 series. Shaves take more than teice as long as aren&#x27;t very close even with extra time spent going over the arrea. Disappointning.</li>
            <li> It takes more time then I would like to spend shaving to get a close shave. Other shavers I have used in the past gave a closer shave in less time.</li>
            <li> use it all the time but not in the shower.  I have a hard time justifing wasting all the water a shower produces just to shave.  all you need is preshave and works like a champ.</li>
            <li> Purchased Christmas 2013...it&#x27;s been 10 months and husband says it&#x27;s &amp;#34;great&amp;#34;. He dry shaves only (never used for wet shave).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uses every day, battery is &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; (according to him): says he charges it every 3 days.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> Great value for a shaver!</li>
            <li> arrived in 2 days. it took almost 2 weeks for my face to get use to, but now gives the best shave, smooth and easy.</li>
            <li> My favorite shaver! A bit pricey, but performs very well. The battery life leaves something to be desired, but right now, it works very well.</li>
            <li> I have used a much much cheaper Braun shaver (similar to this one except for the LCD) for a few years. When it was time to change the blade, I threw it away and bought this one (50% off). It looks and works good. However, it generates much more noise than the previous one I had. I usually use it for less than one minute, so no big deal. However, for a shaver at this price, I&#x27;d expect that it would be more quiet.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade against the grain, but I can use this every day without hacking my neck to pieces.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8103S is ok.  It gets the job done but I prefer a closer shave than what is possible with this Panasonic model</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my husband. He has tried many of the more expensive razors and he is always complaining that they don&#x27;t do a very good job.  He thinks this one is great and likes that he can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant before buying this product, but realized that my hesitation was a waste of time after a few days of using this shaver. I first notice how nice it feels to hold the shaver, so hats of to Panasonic for designing such a good grip feel. The shave is not bad - a very close shave but I think it could&#x27;ve gone even closer. The flex head is nice as it contours around your face. I liked the LCD screen showing how much battery is left. Perhaps the cleaning part if the most \\&quot;annoying\\&quot;. Now I get that you don&#x27;t have to clean it every day and you could just rinse it under water. But I like to clean mine everyday so it usually takes me an extra 1 minute to put soap it, put it in sonic clean mode, and rinse it out. Not too difficult, of course, but time consuming for me personally. I am looking into buying just the Hydraclean machine so I could just stick it in to self-clean. Overall, I would definitely recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> but no better.  It seemed like I could go a day without shaving and nobody would notice when I was using my Norelco 8140.  Unfortunately with the Panasonic I feel stubbly the very next day. Also in comparison, the battery doesn&#x27;t last as long as the rotary did. I get 10-15 shaves out of a charge.  The rotary was good for at least 20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this shaver after I lost the power cord for my rotary shaver. I was durned if I was gonna pay that kind of outrageous price for a power cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new shaver has performed well, and with several swipes, produces a shave that feels almost blade-like. The only downside is that my short-hairedness doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as with a blade.</li>
            <li> First off: I&#x27;m 17 so i don&#x27;t have the 5 o&#x27;clock forest yet, however, this razer gets very close, much closer than my old $20 Norelco (of course it was 3x more) It is easy to clean and most of the stubble shavings stay inside the razer so they don&#x27;t end up all over the place. I have tried it wet and dry and wet definately gives a closer shave, however it is harder to get everywhere in the shower. It hasn&#x27;t gotten the hair on my neck well at all, but that could probably be attributed to my relative inexperience and acne bumps. Excellent battery life; you could probably shave for 30 mins straight on a full charge and the 5 min charge is excellent. Also, once you charge the battery, it stays charged. I&#x27;ve left it nearly a week unplugged and it was still 100%    The only real con i have noticed is its trouble with neck hair. I have had to use the rear trimmer to get my neck almost every time, as the main blades miss 55% of that area      All in all, I probably could&#x27;ve given it a 4, but I&#x27;m happy with it. I hope it will fix itself as I get older and more experienced</li>
            <li> It is definitely a good product, but I am gonna review it somehow different! I generally use panasonic, and I am happy with it, this year, I was surprised by the $30 discount and rushed to buy it for $66 (padded it with other panasonic eligible products to be able to use $99+ discount). I handed it to my bro a fewe days later since he liked it, so I wanted to get one for myself! surprise, surprise! the price is now $96 (you have to pad it again with something to over $110 to get the discount). So the true question is for Amazon: When you raise the price for $30, what does $30 discount mean?! While I originally bought it for $66, newegg had it for $70. I truly didn&#x27;t expect Amazon does that</li>
            <li> Works great, holds the charge for a long while &amp; for the pric you cannot beat it. cannot beat it</li>
            <li> Re: ES8103S : I have had MANY Panasonic razors, originally because they were the only one that would do a wet shave. I don&#x27;t buy into the &amp;#34;have to buy one made in Japan&amp;#34; to get quality. Nonsense. This is not a Japanese made device. At 1 year and 2 weeks the display failed. Little lamps would be more reliable than a LCD display, now i wait for it to die before plugging it in. Sorry. Now it is time for blades at ***serious*** dollars and I&#x27;m thinking as they are almost half the price of a new one should I go there? Don&#x27;t think so. I think it is time to move to another camp. Since the early eighties the quality and life expectancy has gone down hill. Wish I could have kept my first one, would have, but the parts were discontinued I was told by the service center after sending it in. Bye, bye Panasonic, just another corporate game of engineered life span. But hell! Give &#x27;em credit it made it past the warranty period. :(</li>
            <li> thank you for this perfect shaving utensil. it works wonders on my face leaving me with no scratches or irritation</li>
            <li> As soon as I get the new shaver, I was happy to see that it finally came, but at the same time nervous as hell to use it. I opened the packet and thoroughly read the instructions. Once I felt comfortable and got to know the shaver, I developed enough confidence to use it. Let me say, it was a good feeling after using it. My face felt as smooth as a baby bottom A$$.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when I opened the box to inspect the razor. I understand I purchased a used razor from Amazon&#x27;s Warehouse Deals, but I would expect the item to have been at least cleaned if it was in fact used by someone else! The description lead me to believe that it was marked used because the box may have been damaged. THIS WAS ACTUALLY USED by someone! There was someone else&#x27;s little shavings and dried skin ALL OVER the inside! DISGUSTING!!! Save the money and buy NEW!</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver. I have used Braun, Norelco, and Remington in the past and this is by far the best I have used.  And it is just as good in the shower as it is driving to work or standing at the mirror in the bathroom.  I would have to say the only downfall I have experienced is that occasionally I have had to do some touch-up with a manual razor.  But all in all I am very pleased with this purchase.  Hopefully, I can give the same glowing review in 2 or 3 years.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried  to find an electric shaver that was at least as good as an old fashioned blade.  So I mostly used a blade.  But with the Panasonic ES8103S Arc3 Electric Shaver Wet/Dry, I have found real perfection.  It&#x27;s better than a blade,  I guess the difference is mainly the nanotechnology.  Whatever, I have finally found the perfect shaver at a really good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best shaves has been wet.  I used a cheap foam, purchased from the Dollar Tree Store.  With my old turkey neck, it would be impossible to get a closer or more comfortable shave. I easily get 10 shaves per one charge if I want, but in the future I plan to charge all my electronics on Sundays.  If I forget, a 5 minute charge would give me one full shave  This is one electric shaver that will not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 6/11/15:&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted to add that I stopped using shaving foam and started using a Dollar Tree Store  hand and body lotion.  Wash your face first or not, it&#x27;s so smooth.</li>
            <li> Three plusses: I am very pleased with the shave. It recharges very quickly. It can be cleaned easily with running water. Three nits to pick:  It comes with no stand. It does not work when plugged in to charge. It keeps its charge for a far shorter time than my Norelco.</li>
            <li> I get the closest shave from a blade but, in my haste each morning, would nick myself. I tried a Norelco and a Remington. Neither shaved or held up well, despite the specific models getting good reviews/ratings here and in \\&quot;a well known consumer magazine\\&quot;. I finally decided to dump those brands after reading that Panasonic and Braun were superior. After wasting a lot of money on the other shavers, I spent a lot of time researching before settling on this shaver. After a couple of months, I can safely conclude that it does provide a close shave. I like the automatic \\&quot;clean\\&quot; icon and the sonic cleaning mode, which make it the easiest shaver to clean that I&#x27;ve owned. I find this shaver is less forgiving than my previous shavers if you don&#x27;t pull the skin taut as you shave; for my skin and beard, anyway, that&#x27;s mandatory. One aspect that I don&#x27;t like is that the shaver will not operate when the cord is plugged in. This is strictly a cordless shaver, and the cord is only for re-charging. I have no buyer&#x27;s remorse with this shaver, which is a first for me.</li>
            <li> This is the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I don&#x27;t have any complaints about the razor. It&#x27;s a close shave and clean up is beyond easy. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to anybody looking for a new electric razor.</li>
            <li> Razor is lightweight, ergonomic, and seems to be well built.&lt;br /&gt;I must say though that my $40.00 triple foil Remington shaved much faster and easier.&lt;br /&gt;The third cutter probably helped on the old one, but this shaver labors through my beard where the old one glided.&lt;br /&gt;Battery only lasts about 6 or 7 shaves also. Old shaver lasted twice as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Would buy again in a triple foil if the battery lasted longer.  Will have to give this one to my teenage son for his peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> While not a great shaver, it is a lot quieter and vibrates less than a Remington electric shaver I bought a few years ago.  It also charges fast.  Numerous websites gave this Panasonic model a good review for a value shaver.  So far I agree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a light beard and this shaver doesn&#x27;t just cut right through.  If it did, I&#x27;d give it more stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, this is one of the best shavers at it&#x27;s price point.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for approaching two years now.  I previously had a Norelco that worked fairly well, but never really gave me a close shave and I was constantly missing hairs.  With the Panasonic I get a good, clean, close shave every time.  It does struggle with some of the longer hairs, but it&#x27;s a pretty infrequent problem.  On one charge the razor lasts me between 10 and 14 days, give or take.  It generally only takes a shade over an hour to charge fully, and the battery life doesn&#x27;t seem to have decreased at all since I first purchased it.  It&#x27;s easy to clean and empty.  I have pretty sensitive skin, and this razor is very gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only cons in my experience are the noise and the debris.  It&#x27;s pretty loud as far as electric razors go, but doesn&#x27;t really bother me too much.  It also seems to drop a lot of debris, so it can be a bit messy.  Again, not a huge issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it has been a great razor and I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.  I would recommend it to anyone in the market.</li>
            <li> My Panasonic ES8103S razor does a very good job.  I have a 40 minute ride to work so I use it in my car to save some time.  It holds a charge well and shaves very close.  I had a Norelco before and it didn&#x27;t do as good of a job.  I have only dried shaved so far and may try it in the shower soon.  I would gladly purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor now for FIVE YEARS. I&#x27;ve used electrics mostly for convenience of not having the mess of cream and also not getting cut. I am mostly dry shaving. It dry shaves great. ZERO IRRITATION unlike some other foil razors I&#x27;ve tried. Must shave against the grain with electric shavers. This shaves better than Norelcos but they&#x27;re pretty good too..This is far superior to expensive Brauns I&#x27;ve tried that actualy caused ingrown hairs. I tried wet shaving with this razor using &#x27;king of shaves&#x27;. I found it got kind of gummy. I fouund a great gel that works superb with this razor. &amp;#34;Nivea sensitive skin shave gel&amp;#34;. It really lubricates and keeps the blade cool and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.. The shave is really close wet or dry. I can&#x27;t see more blade cutters like on the more expensive model helping much. According to CR and my own expierence, foil shavers shave a little closer, Norelcos are a bit more comfortable. It&#x27;s a tradeoff.irritate but result in the closest electric shave you&#x27;ve ever had. Proably someday will buy the one with the third foil just to cut time. They wash out great with bar soap. I&#x27;ve given up on the wet shaving. It&#x27;s not really any closer at this point for me. Updated the review to five stars.</li>
            <li> I bought this Panasonic shaver to replace an old Remington DA-307 shaver. I wasn&#x27;t unhappy with the Remington, I just couldn&#x27;t get replacement blades/foils any more (they changed the design). The Panasonic is a decent shaver, a much more high-tech and precise instrument compared to the Remington. The Panasonic works well, is easy to use, and gives a close shave. It&#x27;s not particularly fast, though - it takes me a while and I have to go over some areas multiple times to get the closest shave. The shaver head is easy to clean, but sometimes the foil falls out when you remove the head - the tabs to release the foil are in the same location as the tabs to remove the head. The pop-up trimmer works very well. I originally thought the numeric display was overkill, but it turns out to be a handy way to tell how many more shaves you can get before recharging (approximately, it shows percent charge remaining). This is important, because you can&#x27;t leave the shaver plugged into an electric outlet all the time. The shaver will not work if the charger is plugged into AC. So after recharging, you must unplug the charger, and then you might as well put the charger away, due to its ugly and inelegant non-coiled cord. Before you buy any shaver, check out the price/availability of replacement blades/foils, because for some shavers, these parts are way too expensive. The parts for this Panasonic aren&#x27;t too expensive, and I bought a full set with the shaver just to have them on hand.</li>
            <li> Great shaver for the money. Its quiet compared to my last Panasonic shaver. It shaves a lot closer too. Its a keeper!</li>
            <li> I have trouble shaving every day due to my neck area breaking out.  I&#x27;ve tried all the sensitive skin shaving gels and after shave lotions.  With the Panasonic electric shaver, I am able to shave every day with not irritation to my neck at all.  I shave dry with no shaving gel or anything.  It&#x27;s definitely not as close a shave as a razor, but after you get used to it, you can get a rather smooth shave.  It&#x27;s really worked well for me.  I highly recommend this product if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed after reading reviews from a leading consumer magazine giving this product such a high rating. This razor does not \\&quot;glide\\&quot; over ones face, difficult to maneuever around your neck, and the trim feature is at a difficult angle. I&#x27;d like my money back.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic shaver was better than I had expected. It is quiet and gives a closer shave than my single head Braun.&lt;br /&gt;The pop-up trimmer is a bit inconvenient to use since it tends to block my view of what I am trimming.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shaver for a couple of weeks.  From the first shave it gave me a very comfortable close shave.  I would say that the shave I am getting is pretty close to what I would expect from a razor blade.  I bought this to replace my older Braun 5000 series razor and never got the closeness and comfort from the Braun that I am getting from the Panasonic.  I know that electric razors are very dependent on each individual&#x27;s beard type.  I highly recommend giving this razor a try because if it works for you I think you will love it.</li>
            <li> Just received this shaver yesterday and used it for the first time today. I previously have been using a Braun 8595 shaver. First impression of the Panasonic is the sound. Much quieter than the Braun. The shaver head is much different than the Braun and will have to adjust. It did a nice job on my face and a decent job on my neck. I have a very thick, stubbly face and really didn&#x27;t expect the shaver to perform a great job on my neck. I think it may improve as my face adjusts to the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;My normal routine is to shave with the electric and pass back with cream and a straight razor. With the Panasonic, I felt it provied a close enough shave that I didn&#x27;t need to use my straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning feature is nice &amp; appears to do a nice job.&lt;br /&gt;Tomorrow I may try the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; shave and will report back my assessment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;Still have not tried the wet shave yet but will do so over the coming weekend.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for about a week now. I do have to make multiple passes to get a close enough shave on both my face and neck. It does not shave close enough on my neck but it is better than the Braun I had. I apply a bit more pressure and I find it does a better job.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it to shave my head. It does a great job but again have to make multiple passes. It is taking me approx 18 min to shave my face and head.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I am satisfied. I wish I had spend the extra $40 and gotten the 8243a.</li>
            <li> After a weeks use I have found this Wet/Dry shaver to work nothing short of excellent.  It replaces my razor blade, and the cuts that went with it.  I have only used it wet with Nivea shaving gel and like the closeness of the shave.  I bided my time and waited for it to drop in price, which it eventually did on Amazon (~$59).</li>
            <li> Panasonic ES8103S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) .This razor is comfortable and shave very closely. It is very portable. The only bad thing is that you can&#x27;t use it while charging so you better keep it charge . Overall, I love it.</li>
            <li> This produce really works. When you now get started, you will have to be accustomed to it before you learn how to use effectively. It shaves the face and neck clean, don&#x27;t worry but other body parts you will have to use the little shaver on the side that pops out. I don&#x27;t find the top of it can shave any where other than the face and neck effectively.</li>
            <li> I recently got a new job where I had to shave everyday.  I had a 15 year old Braun which worked, but wasn&#x27;t particularly fast or comfortable.  I bought this Panasonic based on user reviews and am very happy with the purchase.  The shave is quality is excellent - almost as good as a razor, and the experience is fast, smooth and comfortable.  Cleanup is easy - just rinse under the faucet.  I have not tried the $200+ Brauns, but I find it hard to believe they could be worth the price premium over this shaver.</li>
            <li> I have always used a blade. I didn&#x27;t think electric shavers gave as good a shave. I was wrong. This shaver gives me almost as close a shave as I get with a blade and when traveling it is much more convenient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good reghargeable electric shaver for some time. I really like this Panasonic. Its comfortable to hold while you are shaving and gives a good shave. I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Finally, a razor that does what it&#x27;s supposed to do!  My husband&#x27;s shave has never been so close.  No missed hairs here and there, as with his old razor, easy to clean and moderately priced too! Before selecting this razor, I made a point to read the Amazon customer reviews, and it has performed in keeping with those positive&lt;br /&gt; reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for just over a month, and I must say that I&#x27;m very pleased with it. After my face got used to the new shaver, I found that I am consistently getting a much better dry shave than with my previous rotary blade shaver. I haven&#x27;t tried to use it in the shower because there is no real need to. The only criticism I have (and it is slight) is that it doesn&#x27;t cut longer hairs well. If I&#x27;ve missed a neck area for 2-3 days, I have to use the trimmer blade before the shaver will cut those longer coarse hairs cleanly.</li>
            <li> Have used this shaver for about a month.  It gives a shave as smooth as a blade.  I haven&#x27;t used it wet but dry it is the best!  It charges fast and is very easy to clean.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for more than a year now and I am still very happy! With past electric razors, I have HAD to ensure that I shave daily in order to prevent having my beard yanked out while shaving on the 2nd day. That is not the case with this razor. I will admit that I have never gone more than 2 days but I have not encountered any pulling while shaving after a missed day.</li>
            <li> Too noise. ..  I am really sad about it. Also not good shave as phillips equipment. I can&#x27;t send back as I used it.</li>
            <li> Good solid feel.  The noise is a little sharp and noisy.  I don&#x27;t shave much so it&#x27;s okay.  The charge last me about 1 month.  I only shave twice a week</li>
            <li> I have had for over a year and love it. Quiet and charges FAST! I Recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> This was on sale a week or so back for $44.00, and I&#x27;ve always been using Norelco all my life, and was just tired of it snagging my beard, etc., I am completely stunned by how good this unit gets your whiskers off, much closer than Norelco and I did not even go the amount of time they suggest to get a good shave. This was not a cheap shaver to begin with. I think it is close to double in price now at Amazon. I am a Panasonic diehard fan now forever. Great work from them on being so competitive</li>
            <li> I have bought and eventually returned/discarded so many electric razors over the years that I had given up on them.  Now that I have reached the 7th decade of life, really turned off with the mess of shaving cream and bladed razors so I thought I would try one more time.  Bought this based on other Amazon reviews and after a month of use I am very impressed with this razor.  Shaves close without irritation, easy to clean, quick recharge...all plusses.  Recommend this to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a quick update....to get the best possible shave I try to keep the charge at 70% or above and remove the shaving head and brush beard remnants from around the cutters once a week.  No big effort required but seems to perform at it&#x27;s max. when I do this.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my dad because he wanted to switch to an electric razor.  He uses it with soap and water (no shaving cream) and absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with an electric shaver for over 65 years and have tried every brand possible. I must tell you that the Panasonic shaver is miles above all of the rest for comfort and shaving ability. I always use a lubricant preshave and that is all that is needed. All other shavers burned my face and I always had to use an after-shave product to stop the burning. Not so with the Panasonic. This is one of the best products that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Great shaver...bought this for my elderly father with very sensitive skin and it&#x27;s what he uses and feel comfortable for him.&lt;br /&gt;would recommend it highly, gives a nice close shave...he doesn&#x27;t have a really heavy beard so not sure what the performance would be with that...but this is a great product.  You should give it 30 days to train your beardand not go back to shaving with a razor for the best results...</li>
            <li> I bought my ES8103 in 2009. It&#x27;s still going strong, takes a full charge, and gives a good shave. However, it has become unpleasantly loud in the past six months. No idea what the problem is. Still, six years is a pretty good run, and no complaints. I was thinking about upgrading to a 4-blade Panasonic, but the blades and foil for those models can get expensive. The consumables for the ES8103 are at least reasonable (especially when on sale at the brand&#x27;s online shop, hint hint). Panasonic recommends replacing the outer foil once a year and the blades once every two years. I generally split the difference and replace everything at 18 months. When shopping for a razor don&#x27;t forget the recurring costs. The ES8103 has some of the lowest running costs. Great razor.</li>
            <li> PROS&lt;br /&gt;- The shaver gives a close shave, with no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;- It is easy to clean and maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;- None so far.</li>
            <li> Loved this , shaved like a razor.  Only one  thing wrong doesn&#x27;t have a stand to hold it, for the price it should.</li>
            <li> As described, Came on time...would order again.</li>
            <li> I have tried several electric razors and they each leave my face feeling a bit burned.  When I bought this one, I figured that I had a month break-in time where my face is broken into the punishment of the razor.  Not so, first shave was painless, no redness, and surprisingly smooth.</li>
            <li> I just upgraded from an old Braun 7570, circa late 90&#x27;s. At first I thought the Panasonic was a toy. Then I was catapulted into the present and was amazed at how quiet and effective this electric razor is. It literally is like using a hot knife to cut butter.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different shavers lately, and this is one of the best.  I am now a fan of the Panasonic linear motor shavers.  I have not found an equal.  I found I prefer the Arc 4 models, as I get a slightly faster shave with them.  This is still a great shaver for the price, and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I recently went electric for the first time in 18 years and this is better than expected. It does not rip out hairs, but you may need several passes to get a close shave.  It&#x27;s easy to clean and charge. Please do stick with if converting from the old fashioned shave. It took about a week of shaving everyday to not have any razor burn or problems. I&#x27;m already thinking about upgrading to a 4 blade.</li>
            <li> My husband was not crazy about this shaver.  He through it in a drawer and bought one for 10 dollars and when it wears out, he throws it out and gets a new one.</li>
            <li> I have used 3 head rotary razors before,Remington.Norolco and shaving cream and blades. I will have to say this gives me the most comfortable closest shave of them all. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have owned these razor&#x27;s previously and i am very satisfied with the shave i receive daily  from this electric razor .</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace an 8-year old Panasonic after the last one died. Boy does this beat shaving with a blade -- no need for water or shaving cream. This guy works like a dream. Quick and clean. The reason I give it four instead of five stars is that I can&#x27;t stand it up on the counter like my last one.</li>
            <li> 5 years and still running strong! I bought the shaver after breaking my right hand. I was a \\&quot;blade\\&quot; shaver before that. Top of the line Remington foil and Norelco rotary razors relegated to the linen closet after abysmal performances from previous years. I was always a little curious about the \\&quot;wet and dry\\&quot; from Panasonic but, hesitant to waste any more $ on a closet relic. Breaking my hand was the perfect excuse to be adventurous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never looked back. A week after receiving the ES8103S the other razors ended up in the trash. The shave was closer than I was getting from the blade (dry shaving). I did not notice an improvement, and perhaps the wet shaving isn&#x27;t as close for me. I don&#x27;t have the coarsest beard, but it grows every which way. It takes me a lot longer than 2 minutes to shave. I would call the battery life extraordinary. Normally about a week on a charge for my 4-5 minute shaves. Amazing performance after almost 5 years. Did I say closer than a blade for me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing feels good in the hand. The trimmer works well. The noise is not deafening or overly \\&quot;whiney.\\&quot; Cleaning is a breeze. Don&#x27;t waste your money on all those \\&quot;gimmicky\\&quot; cleaning stations. Not unless you&#x27;re inviting people into your bath to \\&quot;show off\\&quot; (I&#x27;m thinking Braun snob). I only clean mine before recharge cycles. A little liquid shower soap on the foil, run it under a hot faucet after removing the foil/cover, done. It&#x27;s never received any more attention than that. No lubrication, no nothing. There is no build-up of \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I came across the original receipt and operators manual. Purchased from Amazon in 2009 @ $92. That&#x27;s about  $1.50/mnth. It looks almost like new; I HAVE NOT CHANGED THE FOIL OR THE BLADE IN THAT TIME! I&#x27;m not easily impressed and think that&#x27;s pretty incredible. I can remember my Remington foil reminding me when it was time for a foil change (let there be blood).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking: better purchase a replacement foil/blades. Panasonic recommends: foil - yearly, blade - every 2 years. Cost on Amazon &#x3D; $30+. Battery? Don&#x27;t see replacements on Amazon. Probably; no user replaceable internal parts recommended by Panasonic. As a technician, I could probably crack it open, obtain the correct lithium ion battery and perform the replacement. But, that&#x27;s a lot of time and money to invest in a 5 year old razor. So, I thought I&#x27;d check on the price of a new one: $75 Amazon prime + $20 clip and save coupon. Cha Ching! I&#x27;m ordering two. Actually click and save coupon only good on one. So, I&#x27;m ordering one and my wife is ordering one.</li>
            <li> when i use it,it makes big noises!i wonder if it has been broken?not my best choice !ah~~~~&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s so noisy!!</li>
            <li> This razor will leave longer hairs and does minimal shaving all around.  It requires a lot of pressure to shave closely.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic electric razor is comfortable to use, recharges quickly, and is very easy to clean.  I am reasonably satisfied.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from Turkey&lt;br /&gt;In-shaving machine is good, speed is high and the linear motor is ideal for those who are hard to be the best part of my beard hair is very oily skin but it also becomes a little difficulty in the study do not need to shave a good product, I highly recommend the property.&lt;br /&gt;panasonic travel bag to use as a rag-bag against external impacts ridiculous the situation is more stylish and good imiş a box would have been better though.&lt;br /&gt;inverter-charger plug adapter for the U.S. will use the current turkey must take&lt;br /&gt;state-machine charge is not trivial rather cheap does not shave habit of the previous machine was doing was being charged more beautiful bustled tried ..&lt;br /&gt;35 tl for turkey (varies according to the exchange rate), and you give comes as soon as six days rather expecting it pretty quickly I was amazed.&lt;br /&gt;For under $ 100, but to me that worn-customs iparcell came in the mail from abroad, says five-tana have a right to purchase following our progress with tc etc etc etc with no identity ....&lt;br /&gt;-machine made ​​in china&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-as a result, do not need to go into much detail you want to get shaver&#x27;ll have a pretty good choice would be something better than this I do not think he mentioned, panasonic shaver is a leading company in the industry</li>
            <li> I switched to an electric shaver because I&#x27;m on blood thinners and needed to avoid nicking my face. After comparison shopping and reviewing ratings, I bought this Panasonic. I&#x27;ve been very happy with it as It shaves as close as a regular razor and leaves my face very smooth. I especially like using it with shaving cream and get approximately 5-6 uses before recharging it. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone especially if you&#x27;re changing from a regular razor to an electric.</li>
            <li> the shaving head is too narrow.&lt;br /&gt;Takes more time to shave&lt;br /&gt;short battery life&lt;br /&gt;i hate it.&lt;br /&gt;hate it&lt;br /&gt;hate it</li>
            <li> Switching to a new shaver takes some getting used to, but after a few weeks it is an awesome shaver</li>
            <li> Well, I had a Braun 7000 series and wanted a new one that offer wet or dry shave. This one is better in terms of a closer shave. It does give my face a smoother look without any sign of stubs left behind. Would give it five star if price go lower than $55.</li>
            <li> I have owned several electric shavers and this Panasonic ES8103S is FAIR at best in shaving my skins smooth in a few passes, when used daily..........one has to repeatedly go over the area, even with a gel. Ironically, my first Panasonic, a little battery powered travel unit purchased in 1990 blew my socks off..........this model very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it as a dry shaver and it shaved very close without any irritation.  Will have to try the wet shave to see if it&#x27;s even better.</li>
            <li> Got this electronic shaver as a Deal of the Day for $60 including shipping! Works great!  Feels great! Great deal!</li>
            <li> My Husband just loves this shaver. He said this is the best he&#x27;s ever had. You can shower with it and he leaves it on shower top landing for easy  access. No Problem  with moisture going in it. And shaves close. Rechargeable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using blades for years, and while this shaver does leave a few hairs uncut from time to time, it is smooth, effective, has a long lasting battery, and is really easy to clean!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be able to go back to regular shaving. I was worried at first that it was going to be different but diferentes is good</li>
            <li> Not as close as a razor but I can touch up just about anywhere as needed. Battery life seems great, a dozen or so shaves per charge.</li>
            <li> This shaver replaced a three-headed rotary electric razor that I had owned previously.  Not only has it given me a closer, smoother shave with easy clean-up of the razor between shavings, but its motor is quieter than I had expected and it holds a charge for several weeks.  Thank you, Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I have used electric shavers for 60 years,and Panasonic electric shavers give me the closest shave than any I have used.,but this es8103s that I just purchased from amazon . at first i couldn&#x60;t get the cleaning cycle to work,but it is working perfect now. i have changed my revue from 3 stars .i now give it 5 stars and will continue to use panasonic electric razors,as i have for years.thanks to amazon i recieved it sooner than expected,and will continue to do most all of my business with amazon,a great company.</li>
            <li> I just need to get used to holding it after my previous one. Highly efficent, good recharge holding. Practical. No hesitation from me</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband. He loves it. The only small compliant he had was when he was in the shower he missed just a tiny piece on the curve of his chin even though he said he shaved there. Could have just been user error. But I got him a shower mirror and he&#x27;s all good now. Works great wet and dry. I would recommend this product to friends.</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband and he says it has been &amp;#34;real good&amp;#34;. Lives up to expectations, and a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Pros:  Cuts close, visible charge content, able to alternate between fixed &amp; floating head, good trimmer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Not very good on fine neck hair (need to use trimmer), somewhat noisy, short charge life&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched from a rotary to get a closer shave &amp; this does that so overall I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> This was a great shaver to use while I was in India. It kept a charge for several days and was easy to clean. Gave me a good shave each time.</li>
            <li> It is a gift and my friend likes it very much. It is a good product for its price .</li>
            <li> Bought this razor for a Christmas gift for my teenage son.  He seems to like it.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great razor.  Closest shave I have ever gotten with an electric razor, and I have tried about a dozen makes and models..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had electric shavers for over 40 years and this one is the best by far.  It actually keeps full power until discharged AND let&#x27;s you know exactly how much battery life is left.  The shave is smooth &amp; close and the flex-head bends with the curves.  Versatile use dry or wet and easy to clean.  I highly recommend this excellent product!</li>
            <li> Gives a good shave but have to do multiple passes over my trouble spots.  Still better than the remington I was using.  Does not handle long stubble as well.</li>
            <li> This shaver provides a comfortable and close shave reliably, with very little maintenance.  I haven&#x27;t been nearly as careful with it as I should have; my dog chewed up the charging end, and I&#x27;ve dropped it more times than I&#x27;d care to admit.  Despite this, and having used it daily for three years, it does as well now as it did the day I first used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are only two parts, really: the body (including the blade), and the foil.  With the foil removed, the blade vibrates at a faster speed than normal to facilitate easy cleaning; switching it on under warm running water immediately clears any debris from the blades, and any surrounding mess has a hard time adhering to the plastic beneath.  For this reason, the cleaning add-ons are completely unnecessary.  Charging from 0-100% takes 1-2 hours, and you can&#x27;t use the shaver while it is plugged in.  However, you can get enough charge for a single shave within 5 minutes of plugging it in if you forget to charge it and need to get out the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assuming daily use, Panasonic recommends that you replace the outer foil once a year and the blade every other year.  I am still using the original blade and foil, and do not note any appreciable performance decrease.  My beard is of average thickness but is quite coarse, and I am surprised by this shaver&#x27;s perseverance with such regular use.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS RAZOR.  SHAVES CLOSE  AND FAST.  RECHARGES FAST AND SURE BEATS A REGULAR BLADE.&lt;br /&gt;WILL USE EVERY DAY.</li>
            <li> I gave this as gift to a Norelco user.  He said it shaves very close and is super easy to clean.  Note: must shave daily if not very good on long hairs.  He also said he will never go back to Norelco</li>
            <li> This shaver is smaller than the Norelco I used before, so it is easier to hold.  I like that it charges in only an hour, as opposed to eight hours on other shavers I have used.  It shaves well on most parts of my face except in the lower part of the neck. No matter how many times I pass over certain areas of my neck, this shaver just does not pick up the hairs.  So, to finish the job I use a Braun PocketGo shaver.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my fiancé, when it arrived we notice the packing seemed a little off, as if it was opened and re-taped!&lt;br /&gt;Took the razor out of the packaging and it was clearly used!!! There was little bits of hair on it! It was so gross!&lt;br /&gt;Called amazon they shipped another one and we have to ship this one back to them, what a hassle.  It ruins the point of shopping online! Amazon staff was friendly, however we were not offered anything as compensation for our troubles.  I mean I wasn&#x27;t looking for discounts or free things, despite the fact they&#x27;ve sent me a faulty product, it just would of been nice to feel they appreciate my business.</li>
            <li> This shaver is better then others I&#x27;ve used.  There are still the usual spots on my neck I have to turn the shaver in circles to get but not the shavers fault as the other three previous shavers I&#x27;ve used were the same way.  This one cuts better and with less discomfort.  It is easy to clean, just run the blades under faucet and rinse the foils.  It also charges quickly and the charge lasts a week and a half.</li>
            <li> This razor works wonderfully and does as good a job as some that cost as much as $190 (which I think is a ridiculous price for a razor).  It gives a nice close shave with very little effort and holds a charge for a reasonable amount of time.  It can be used either wet or dry and cleans easily with cold water when done shaving.  I would buy this product again and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> First off, before this I was using a $20 trimmer. As it shortest it left me with an 8 o&#x27;clock shadow forget 5 o&#x27;clock. But this Panasonic is as close to a real shave as an electric can get (in my humble opinion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: FAST, perfect shave in less than 3 min (including goatee trimming)&lt;br /&gt;  Cheap, but not cheaply made.&lt;br /&gt;  Use it in the shower, or in your car right before a date or interview&lt;br /&gt;  1 charge last me a week(full charge takes 1hour)&lt;br /&gt;  It really does get close!&lt;br /&gt;  Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like a traditional razor, no need for shaving gel(but you can use it if you want).&lt;br /&gt;  Shaved hairs fall into the remove able head, just rinse it out with water when your done and that&#x27;s that, no hairs left around the sink for the girlfriend to get mad about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None, I&#x27;ve had this for 4 months and I seriously couldn&#x27;t expect anymore from a razor, electric or not. I would buy this again if it broke tomorrow.</li>
            <li> Husband has gone through several electric razors over the past 50 years.  This is the best according to him.  Wet/dry.....both good results.  He&#x27;s a happy man.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a lower model Norelco and I am no impressed. The shaver worked great at first however the blades dulled quickly. My last Braun greatly outperformed this razor and the blades lasted almost a year.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband of whom has very sensitive skin. I am hoping the reviews I read are correct and that he will love this product. Time will tell!</li>
            <li> Would not shave neck hairs, would have to bring razor side ways across neck to pick up and cut hairs.</li>
            <li> Works great, long lasting battery, clean, smooth shave every time. Bought one for my Dad, He loves it also ... Buy it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> Great product! This was my first electric shaver I have ever purchased. It was an awesome price and works great. The best part is it works dry or wet, you can use it with or without shaving cream as well. The panasonic shaver is also waterproof so it does great in the shower. Cleanup is simple and easy and the charge on the device lasts a long time. It only takes about an hour to fully charge it. The only downside is it does not give as close of a shave as a razor but it is pretty darn close. I definitely recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> I purchased ES8103S from Amazon and have been using for longer than 1 year. Shavers are very personal and each person will have very personal experience - it is for referecen only but not really a thing to argue with. Here is MY experience;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally thing this shaves better than the rotary ones (with circle-shape blades). What I meant by better is &amp;#34;more closely&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery holds charges very well and I often forget to re-charge it. I shave every morning and I just recharged it this morning when I saw 0% on the screen - I do not remember when was the last time I charged it. The battery does hold charge very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the subject indicates, my experience in the wet condition was not as you can see it in the TV commercial. When you use it in a shower with some shaving foam, the foam gets stuck inside of the chamber and the blade movements are disturbed. Unless you find very light foam somehow, I found it more useful use it on dry skins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the wet function becomes very useful - after each use, you can actually clean it under running water! Or you can even use soap to clean it thoroughly! This is worse paying extra for the wet function I think unless you want to use dirty blade shaving your skin every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last tip for the first-time electrical shaver users - for the smooth shaving, make your skin very dry or very wet. Somewhat-wet does not work too well....</li>
            <li> Gave it away. Not close enough. A standard Gillette Mach 3/4/5/6/726 whatever works better, is cheaper, blades cost less, and can be used dry or wet without a recharge.</li>
            <li> All the reviews I&#x27;ve read and even the booklet that came with this shaver said, &amp;#34;give it 30 days&amp;#34; before judging.  It has not been 30 days but so far, it works well but not as close as a blade razor.  More to follow.</li>
            <li> This is my fifth panasonic shaver, the first one made in China, and I have stubble four hours after I shave. I cannot understand all the good reviews, unless some of these are good and some are not. I&#x27;m back to using my es8807, closer shave and the motor sounds more powerful.</li>
            <li> Had a Remington that wore out. Bought this after reading reviews, but it just does not shave like it should. Should have spent the money on another Remington or Braun</li>
            <li> While it may not look as fancy as many other electric razors it is easy to handle and provides a close shave without irritating the skin.&lt;br /&gt;A single charge lasts for over a week and the razor is very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;I use it in the shower with a bit of shaving gel and in few weeks that I have been using it my scin got noticeably smoother and free from razor burns and bumps.</li>
            <li> Great! I love this! Super shipping speed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seller is so kind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, it works with a little big noise.</li>
            <li> Great razor! This does an excellent job at shaving. The razor shaves close to the skin and is very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes for this shaver after reading other reviews.  Hoped it would work well enough so that I wouldn&#x27;t need to use a razor, as that tends to irritate my face.  Worked ok around the chin and under the nose, but did an awful job under my chin and on my neck.  What&#x27;s more, it still irritated my skin a bit.</li>
            <li> I find this to be perhaps the best electric shaver I have used.  It does an excellent job providing a close shave in about 3 minutes shaving time.  It provides a much smoother glide over my face and does not draw at the skin as much as other multi-head foil shavers I have tried recently.  I did try two other brands of similar shavers and another model from Panasonic.  This one was the &amp;#34;keeper&amp;#34; without a doubt.  I like the balance and feel of the shaver when I am using it.  I like the design and the way the parts fit together.  I think the smoothness of the shave is the result of Panasonic&#x27;s use of narrower foils than other models so there is not as much metal contact with the skin.  Also, the slight arc in the foils and the central long hair cutter probably reduces the amount of metal to skin contact and aids in shaving comfort.  My reason for giving only four stars instead of five is because I have not experience using it during the summer when humidity levels are higher than now in February.  Also I think the travel bag which comes with the shaver should contain a provision for storing the cord along with the shaver.  However, if anyone asks I will not hesitate to recommend that they try this model before making a decision on purchasing an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I love my new razor.  Big difference from the Norelco floating head razor I spent a lot more money to buy!  I&#x27;d recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have used Remington and Braun prior and this is the best!.  Very close shave.  Like all razors, under the chin and neck take multiple passes, but very smooth with no skin irritation</li>
            <li> I get irritated very easily on my neck (where the hair starts) when I shave. This razor eliminated that problem completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this 5 stars because it is a great buy for the money, but there are some cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. You can not use it plugged in.  This means that eventually, this thing will be worthless when the battery won&#x27;t hold a charge.&lt;br /&gt;2. It takes a long time to shave. I do not have a \\&quot;tough beard\\&quot; and this thing takes awhile to shave.  I get about 7 shaves from one full charge.  So every weekend I recharge it.  No big deal.&lt;br /&gt;3. Takes to long to shave with it to be able to shave in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Gives me a nice, clean shave with no irritation (eventually).&lt;br /&gt;2. Looks nice&lt;br /&gt;3. Price was pretty good&lt;br /&gt;4. Clean up is easy&lt;br /&gt;5. Sounds o.k. (loud, but not too loud) Can&#x27;t hear it in the shower over the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, not a bad purchase, and I would do it again.  If I upgrade, I will upgrade with this same brand of razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver about 2 months ago, and it is only average in my opinion.  On the plus side, it does recharge quickly, and keeps shaving for a couple of weeks before it needs another charge.  My only gripe about the charging system is that the display has three digits, but the amount of charge displayed is by increments of 10%, so it only needs one digit.&lt;br /&gt;The razor is quite noisy, compared to my old Norelcos, and doesn&#x27;t shave as close.  Also, since a man&#x27;s beard doesn&#x27;t grow in only one direction, it is difficult if not impossible to get all the hairs lined up with the one directional slots.  It never could shave all of my sideburn on one side, so I had to touch it up with a safety razor every couple of days.  I finally bought some replacement parts for my old Norelco, and am back to using that now.</li>
            <li> My first ever electric shaver (I&#x27;ve been shaving for nearly 30 years with a manual razor up to now) and I was impressed. No redness noticed and each shave seems to be better than the last one, can now properly shave areas that I couldn&#x27;t at first. Not quite as close a shave as a razor blade and hair grows back quicker, still more enjoyable and conveinent than a razor as no need for shaving gel or water, thus can shave anywhere, even while watching tv!. Only other issue, it is a little on the noisy side.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Close shave, very comfortable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Loud&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a decent portable shaver with average battery life. Sort of loud, so I have to leave my tent if I don&#x27;t want to wake anyone else up as I shave.</li>
            <li> Its the best razor I have ever owned. It contours every feature of my face. I love it immensely. Yes</li>
            <li> This is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve used. One charge lasts a really long time, and it shaves pretty close and I don&#x27;t have to trim before I start the real shaving. With my other shavers I have to trim. Also, being wet/dry is another huge plus.</li>
            <li> I switched from norelco wet/dry for a few years and used Gillette in the interim. Now I decided to shave every day once more and of course wet/dry is what I wanted as my skin is sensitive to drag. I also never had foil shaver so decided to try this Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got great deal with free shipping and coupon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously the most important thing is how it shaves: No complains here. I can easily say that it provides closer shave than Gillette ever did. I have a fairly heavy beard but even so it can handle up to about 5 days worth of growth. Easy to clean as well as you just take the outer foil and run it under water. There is also an option to use hand soap. You should expect the charge to last for about 10 days. It is also much slimmer than Norelco rotary shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few bad things but not enough to take away a star:&lt;br /&gt;Pop-up trimmer lever is placed in the worst possible spot and often pops up. There is also an explicit mention in the manual to place your thumb i the spot between the outer foil and the power button lest you accidentally turn on cleaning more and injure yourself. Never happened yet but still is concerning.&lt;br /&gt;The glass cap that comes with the product is useless and actually makes things worse by preventing evaporation, I just don&#x27;t use it as the shaver is inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;The power cord is not a standard one. Would have to buy overpriced replacement from Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall those are nitpicks though. I can heartily recommend this shaver to anyone who&#x27;s looking to get a clean shave daily on a small budget. The only question now is how long will this gizmo last.</li>
            <li> The best I have ever owned over 50 + years. Good grip. Cuts close. EASY to clean. All in all, I love it.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver for my needs, would buy one for my father too.&lt;br /&gt;Powerful and quiet, one charge last for three weeks of everyday usage.</li>
            <li> This is the second Panasonic I have had and love it.  Battery life could be a little longer, but other than that, I does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
            <li> Finally, we found an electric razor that gives a close, smooth shave and doesn&#x27;t irritate!  My husband is VERY happy with this razor!</li>
            <li> I seem to have been saying this a lot lately, but this was priced well and it works well. I&#x27;m sure there are better ones out there, but the battery is strong and it gives me a pretty nice, clean, close shave with a couple of passes. No complaints so far!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used it for a month. I only dry shave without any lotion or foam which I did with my norelco and its a closer shave but its a different pattern of motion but it does better coming close to my chin beard.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 22 months. This is obviously the best shaver I have ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before ES8103S, I had a Braun 7 series shaver which I think was one of the most expensive shavers at that time and cost twice as much as ES8103S. However, it broke in two years; the ON/OFF switch came off and finally stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the Braun 7, my ES8103S has never showed an issue and is much more reliable. It is closer, the motor is faster, and the battery lasts much longer - one charge lasts more than two weeks even after use of almost two years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I like my ES8103S very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there are two complaints. First, it&#x27;s a bit loud. Fortunately, it does not bother anybody in my house, so it&#x27;s OK. Second, it is not easy to judge whether the head outer blade part is completely put on the body, and therefore the outer blade is easily damaged due to the incomplete installation. Since I wash the blades every time, I always take off the head part after shaving. One time I did not completely put it back on the body, which made a small hole on the outer blade. It&#x27;s my mistake, but I couldn&#x27;t figure out how I broke it. I didn&#x27;t even notice that the head part was not correctly installed. Though it turned out to be my failure later, you should be careful. Even a single small hole on an outer blade scratches your face.</li>
            <li> Great Razor ,better than expected close shave. Quick charging and holds a charge longer than any razor I have owned. And the led readout of the charge left in the battery, is a great feature also. For the small price this Razor costs compared to others costing twice as much, you can&#x27;t go wrong buying it.</li>
            <li> Got the closest shave ever with this shaver!  I only use it dry.&lt;br /&gt;I especially like the visual show of what percent of charge is left</li>
            <li> My husband is crazy about his new razor and goes around rubbing his face saying how amazing the quality of his shave is now.</li>
            <li> I got this shaver a few weeks ago and can tell you it is one of the best shavers I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I would not recomend this product because it does not shave the beard. It leaves a lot of hair. I tried it both ways in the shower and the dry way neither works. It does have a nice way to clean out the stubbles from the blades. But what good is that if it doesn&#x27;t shave the beard.</li>
            <li> The last time I tried an electric shaver was about 15 years ago. I didn&#x27;t have much success, and I vastly preferred a razor blade. Technology has obviously improved a lot since then, so I figured it was about time to try an electric again. After much research on Amazon, I finally decided that this model was the best bang for the buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always been impressed with the build quality of Panasonic products, and this shaver is no exception. I was very happy with the design and ergonomics. Overall, it felt very good in the hand, and seemed to be of a durable construction that would last a long time. The fact that they encourage you to use it wet speaks volumes about how confident Panasonic is in this product, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t manage to get a satisfactory shave. It does a GREAT job on the flat surfaces of my face- super smooth. But I just couldn&#x27;t get it to shave closely in the more difficult areas, such as around my jaw line. I&#x27;m still giving it three stars, because I feel that it&#x27;s well built, a good value, and that others with easier beards might have better luck than me.</li>
            <li> This shaver is by far the best shaver I have ever owned.  It charges fast, and it does provide a very close shave as promised.  Very glad I got it.</li>
            <li> I have been a Norelco rotary guy for 25+ years. When my latest started having problems I began the search for a replacement. Foil was new to me and I was a bit cautious. However, the reviews convinced me to take a chance. I am not dissappointed. It is a solid product. It shaves closer than my rotary ever did. It also takes less time. Cleanup is very simple and charging is very quick. I love the LCD display of battery percent remaining. You can complete a full shave with less than 10% of the battery used. I am very pleased and would recommend this to anyone looking to kick the rotary habit. There is maybe one con--it is louder than my rotary, but that has not been an issue for me.</li>
            <li> The shaver works very well, by far the best shaving method I ever used but does leave some rough areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At half off I definitely recommend this product as it should work much better than other conventional shaving methods but do not expect a 100% perfect shave after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy if price is over $150, there are better reviewed shavers at that price out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7.5/10</li>
            <li> this is my third Panasonic shaver, the first one is over 12 years old and still works. the second one I use&lt;br /&gt;when I travel but the battery is getting weak but the new ES8103s is the best ever.</li>
            <li> Great shaver, someone recommended this shaver on another page when I was looking at remington products. Used remington shavers for 15 years but not anymore. This shaver is quieter with a cleaner shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had every brand of shaver over the years.  This one is the best yet.  It shaves much faster and closer than any of my old shavers and doesn&#x27;t chew up my face like the Braun shavers.  I have used it both wet and dry and it seems to shave a little closer wet.  It&#x27;s hard to get used to how fast it is since you hardly feel the whiskers being removed. Face, neck, it gets all the whiskers with no razor rash.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  The battery doesn&#x27;t last for more than about 5 or 6 shaves.  You can&#x27;t use the shaver while it is plugged into the charger.&lt;br /&gt;Neither of these are a deal breaker and if I can ever get over my old habit of shaving for 5 minutes like I did with my old shavers just to get all the whiskers, I should be able to increase my battery life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned or used an electric shaver before, so this was new to me. This thing shaves so close I can&#x27;t believe it, and there is ZERO irritation. My skin is never red after a shave. It is super easy to clean and use. It will save you money from having to buy razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every guy should own one of these!</li>
            <li> I thought the wet shave would be great.  It does feel very smooth when shaving with foam but the results are not so good.  It does a very poor job shaving my neck.  I get the best shaves by shaving dry.  It does not irritate my skin as much as the Norelcos that I have used for many years.</li>
            <li> It works well.  I like the fact that it works in the shower.  It&#x27;s also very light.  Obviously, the charge lasts long as do most new razors.  The only thing that I was dissapointed about was that it doesn&#x27;t shave any closer as my braun [when it was new].</li>
            <li> Used for a few weeks. Skin was left red, raw, and bloody and gave me many ingrown hairs. Shaver does not shave thoroughly and takes 10 minutes or more to get a terrible shave that needs touching up with a razor. Will be returning product.</li>
            <li> A good razor at a great price. I believe it is a good deal. Easy to wash. I do not like that You cannot use it while charging.</li>
            <li> I have used it for 2 years without any problem. don;t even have to change the blade at all; easily chargable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;most important, it looks very elegant</li>
            <li> Gave it to my husband for his Bday. He usually get the shavers with the 3 round blades. He has a very thick n fast growing beard. He used it the other day for the first time n loved it. No scatches at all n no pain. It was a very nice, smooth shave. Only thing, there&#x27;s NO stand to put it in while charging.</li>
            <li> These razors are totally awesome. I originally bought my Panasonic razor, identical to this except the digital display part, in Japan. Bought this as I&#x27;m no longer in Japan to be able to pick up foil and blades. Thought this would be comparable but I was wrong. The biggest difference is that the version from Japan allows you to shave even if plugged in. This one doesn&#x27;t. That is a major negative for me. Wish the description had stated this.</li>
            <li> I have always purchased Remington shavers. But the last two I got were not up to my expectations. So since evrything I have ever bought with a Panasonic label on it was awesome, I decided to try it. It shaves the pants off the Remington. It is light weight and easy on the face. The best thing is, I can run it under hot water to clean it. I used to have to brush my old shaver out, and even go so far as to use a compressor on it to get it clean. This is a joy to clean. I have not tried it, but this shaver can be used wet. Don&#x27;t know if I would like that, but it can be done. All in all, I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Had the shaver 3 month and it&#x27;s performing very well.  Cuts pretty close albeit not like a blade.  Charges much more quickly (30 minutes) than my older Norelco and cleans easily too.  Haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower since I always dry shave. Display allows you to see how much charge you have left.  I get about 20 shaves from a charge</li>
            <li> This shaver gives a close shave, and after several months of use, the charges still last for over a week. I have not tried to use it as a wet shaver though.</li>
            <li> I received the product quickly as usual with amazon,and at an incredible price.Sleek and compact design is very nice to handle. i used it dry first time out and results were great! Very quick and efficient, yes it is a little loud but not in annoying way. cleans simply without costly cartridges like my old braun self cleaner. I highly reccomend this shaver you won&#x27;t be dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Found this recommended on-line.  it was a gift for my father and he is beyond elated.  Never thought he &#x27; get such a smooth shave from an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Panasonic ES8103S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Silver and it is very usefull. I used it daily. It does a close shave.</li>
            <li> Bought for my dad for Christmas. Says it&#x27;s the best shaver he&#x27;s ever had</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this product. As A guy who suffers from razor bumps this is a great product it gives a close shave with hardly any irritation and no razor bumps (if you use it everyday). The problem is it does not last. My first shaver lasted four months before it would no longer hold a charge. I hope this one lasts longer. I took the first shaver apart and it was filled with corrosion trying to keep this one extremely dry even though I&#x27;ts advertised as Wet/Dry.</li>
            <li> I was so impressed with the first one I bought six momths ago; I decided to buy another. I use them with shaving cream--cleaning is no effort.</li>
            <li> Handsome instrument that is comfortable to hold and to use.  Smooth on the face and neck.  It is however a very slow shave needing multiple passes to achieve a close shave and thus takes longer than my previous shavers.  But when the job is completed it has achieved a close and  smooth shave.  The power needed to achieve each shave is at least 20% and can reach 30% of the total stored power.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Delivered in two days with no premium charges. Cuts great!</li>
            <li> After my last electric shaver bit the dust, I tried going back to blade shaving with a new 3-blade Gillette razor.  After a few weeks, I decided to buy a new electric model.  The Consumer Reports reviews pointed to this model as being a \\&quot;Best Buy\\&quot; and it certainly was a best buy for me.  Super quiet and efficient - I can even talk to my wife while shaving.  Highly recommended as having exceeded expectations.  It hasn&#x27;t happened yet, but the only drawback I can see is that if it runs out of charge, you cannot shave while recharging.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric shavers for over 30 years, and tried many different brands. I found that Rule #1 is that electric shavers cannot give as close a shave as a stright blade razor, and Rule #2 is you can&#x27;t change Rule #1. But, Panasonic is getting very close with the ES8103S!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving from a three-head rotary to this shaver did require some changes in the way I shave. You still need to use two hands - one to hold the razor and the other to stretch your skin. Experiment with different strokes beyond straight up and down to include circular and side-to-side motions. It takes a little longer to shave with the Panasonic, but I am getting to most of the hard-to-get whiskers like the ones around the Adam&#x27;s Apple of the throat and the hairs behind the jaw under the ear lobe. I use Remington Shaving Sticks as my preferred skin lubricant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is very comfortable in the hand. It is a bit noisy, but far from irritating. Try to keep the cutter head @90 degrees to your face to get as close as possible. Keep at it! This is a decent shaver.</li>
            <li> I decided to stop using Gillette razors, due to the high price of the replaceable blades and use an electric shaver. My Remington is quite old and decided to purchase the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;The shave is as close as the Gillette! I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This shaver has far exceeded my expectations. The shave is smooth and comfortable. I love the soft setting to get around the nooks and crannies of my neck. The straight edge is efficient for my sideburns. This shaver also recharges super quick. I&#x27;d recommend this to anybody looking for a great value.</li>
            <li> This electric razor is by far more superior than my Norelco rotary razor!  Great close shave!  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> My husband is very satisfied with the Panasonic Electric Shaver he purchased. It gives him a close shave, is handy, and easy to transport when traveling.</li>
            <li> it give a close shave an does not irritate my skin and has a charging indicator and i love it.</li>
            <li> This razor gives as close a shave as with a blade. I have had several electric razors in the past and always ended up going back to a blade.  Not this time !</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any personal experience but my dad says this is the best electric razor he has ever used. In fact, once my brother tried it and liked it so much my mom bought him one.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because I needed a replacement of another brand after about three years. The price was attractive with a five star rating; and the shaver is made with nano technology which is the latest to me. It runs good and has simple-looking features, and can take a little water for cleaning. You can shave with lather, but I haven&#x27;t tried that. (You cannot use it in the shower.) The result is a very smooth shave. The shaver charges quicly to 100% and I use 10% each time. After one month, I haven&#x27;t found anything about it that I disliked, yet. If one is looking for a decent shaver, I recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Gives a close shave in a few minutes. Also, easy to clean unlike the Norelco I own (taking apart and reconstructing blade arrangement is Mickey Mouse). Only complaint I have is that it&#x27;s noisy. Overall excellennt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Norelco and this and have to say that they&#x27;re pretty even.  This shaves pretty fast and I need not go over the same area as often.  It shaves pretty close but it doesn&#x27;t beat a razor.  The battery indicator is such a great feature and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d but another electric shaver without one.  I take this with me to various places and don&#x27;t need a mirror to tell me that this does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The docked it one star because it&#x27;s not easy to clean in a hurry and it&#x27;s cut my upper lip very, very slightly - I had pin-sized areas where blood came out.  Maybe my skin is that sensitive but I never had that happen with my Norelco.</li>
            <li> After reading (somewhere) foil razors shave closer (and are louder) than rotary, I researched up and down on for a great razor for under $100. This was the first one I put in my wish list but I should have just bought it immediately. This razor constantly amazes me. A few days of growth and a rotary razor would hurt like hell. With this, it&#x27;s nothing. I can rub this all over my face like I&#x27;m trying to massage it and no pulling, no pain, no raw feeling. It&#x27;s absolutely perfect for people with sensitive skin. So easy to clean, the wet/dry feature is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate, this is money well spent.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my son and he is happy with it.</li>
            <li> Electric shavers are great for Ladies with sensitive skin issues as well as Men! All I can say is The Panasonic ES81035  3-Arc is a life saver,  and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The breakdown:&lt;br /&gt;Cons: They cost too much! Electric shavers are EXPENSIVE (luckily, this one was on sale, for under $70 (so I went ahead and bought 2) :P, still a bit over the top for a &#x60;shaver&#x27;, but, even on the low end they have been priced at over $150 and on the high end, over $500. people with sensitive skin issues and allergies don&#x27;t have much choice, it&#x27;s either this or waxing which adds up to a lot more over time...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric shavers are larger than disposable shavers, so you will need to prepare for that (the first time you try one is like the difference between trying to manicure your bikini line with hand held disposable shaver or something the size of a small blow-dryer (awkward)...) :P Even though it is hypoallergenic, people with sensitive skin will still get some irritation if used every day, so it&#x27;s still best to use up to only every other day (M W F, Sat), or 3-4 days per week only to avoid skin burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so it says wet-or-dry shave (which I liked, and ordered for that reason), but you definitely get a better/closer shave dry than using it wet or with shave gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It&#x27;s Hypoallergenic, shaves close (only a razor will give you a closer shave, so no complaints here), can be rinsed clean, and unlike disposable shavers, does NOT leave a trail of razor burn/bumps, and it can be used to safely shave your entire body (as well as a man&#x27;s face)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on underarms, bikini line area- - I promise you, only a razor or waxing will get you a closer shave--A funny tip, if you want to use a cream hair remover a few days before you try it such as Nair/Neet/Veet, etc. and then maintain the areas with the shaver, it might make it easier the first time you try it on your bikini or speedo zone (it has this neat little sideburn groomer feature that can also be used to prep/remove those longer personal hair areas before shaving and manicure/shape the outline if you prefer to retain a modesty patch, -- and on the QT, it can even gently remove hair from a lady&#x27;s upper lip) :P ... Best of All, you can dry-shave without fear!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the 3-Arc is waay smaller than the (albeit more powerful) 4 and 5-arc series which makes it literally much easier to handle for women&#x27;s body or/and facial hair issues, or those men with lighter facial and body hair issues in general. Once you get used to the feel of it, it only takes a light hand with only a few passes to manage a clean shave. The electric shaver video tutorials are awesome and give great examples of how to use. The description, also tells you what replacement foil accessories you need, which is very helpful as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, no more underarm rashes and no more shave bumps! It&#x27;s rechargeable. It has a digital read-out that let&#x27;s you know if the power is low, and thus, needs to be charged, which doesn&#x27;t take too long either which is also convenient, so in theory, it is a unit that should last a long time with reasonable care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A general note if you have sensitive skin or allergies:&lt;br /&gt;Even though this model is hypoallergenic, the friction against the skin of day-to-day shaving can still cause some degree of irritation, so again, as previously stated, it is best to adopt a 4-day-to every other day shave regimen (M W Fri Sa), instead of every day. I promise you, allowing your skin to rest a day or two between shaves will make a huge difference in the condition of your skin, especially on those more sensitive areas (face, underarms, swim zone)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Also: on a side note: If it is an issue, Andis has a nickel-free Titanium foil unit out now (also hypoallergenic) that is getting great reviews (at a fraction of the cost): Andis 17010 Professional Profoil Rechargable Shaver (with Titanium Foils).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But,I love it and so will anyone else! The only reason why I won&#x27;t give it a perfect mark is because of the price (I keep thinking of the hand bags I didn&#x27;t buy so I could get this shaver--but, it was well worth the investment) and I think they can make an even smaller, more powerful unit for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, a great product to invest in your personal grooming needs and even worth the price. And you will save money over time...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Grade: B+/A- or  About 4.25 stars!I love it and so will anyone else!

            <li> Everything about this shaver for me has exceeded expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quiet, does a great job (maybe because my old razor was so old and dull by comparison--but this is WONDERFUL), charges quickly, easy to clean, and wet/dry (although I really am a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; guy), and a nice price to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I wish was different is the proprietary plug for the power cord (it&#x27;s a unidirectional (polarized) plug, and is a connector that seems to be &amp;#34;Panasonic only&amp;#34; -- so you have to use a Panasonic cord).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also--you can&#x27;t shave with the shaver connected to the wall (not sure if this is for safety as it&#x27;s a wet/dry unit but it&#x27;d be nice if the battery is run down to be able to plug in and have a &amp;#34;tethered&amp;#34; shave).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small nits though--I&#x27;m really very happy with this shaver so far (knock on wood)!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift and he loves it!</li>
            <li> Great razor.  Was difficult picking a razor for my husband, but this one works perfect.  He gets a nice close shave. He loves it.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this Panasonic wet/dry rechargeable electric razor. It works great, shaves very closely, and I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second Panasonic razor of this type that I&#x27;ve owned. My previous Panasonic razor, model ES8043, which is just an older version of this current razor, also worked great for about 6 years. In fact it still works great, but its rechargeable battery just doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for very long now, so I thought it was time to replace it. So I bought this new Panasonic Model ES8103S and it works great! And I also like the charge percentage indicator as well, and when its turned off, it looks like a matching chrome piece on the razor. PRETTY COOL! But I would highly recommend this to anyone considering buying a new wet/dry rechargeable razor.</li>
            <li> You have to try it yourself to see if your face enjoy more with a Philips (tri-cyclone cutters) or one from Panasonic (parallel movement cutters).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I change an electrical shaver/razor when the battery gets weak, or typically about 2-3 years.  About 8 years ago, my first electrical shaver was a Panasonic, which I think it was easy to use when I found out how handy a electrical shaver could be and amount of time I could save!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my first Panasonic, I changed to a Philips and I realize Philips tri-cyclone style does everything the same but much more comfortable!  So every time when I am shopping for a new electrical shaver, I still will try both Panasonic and Philips units before making my decision; and just in my last two purchase, I do believe the tri-cyclone style shaver works better with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;-Panasonic units feel more powerful than Philips units&lt;br /&gt;-Good to have a battery meter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;-Causing irritation on my face (well, I only have 4 weeks for testing...  too bad because general return policy)&lt;br /&gt;-Loud, too loud in my opinion, that it actually heats up fast (not I push hard against my face)&lt;br /&gt;-Take a bit longer to wash, and requires both hands to take apart before cleaning (most of Philips only requires one click opening up for rinse!!!!!!!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, I hate to spend time on shaving and cleaning the equipment but it is a part of my everyday routine.  That one click for rinsing the unit on Philips saves me time too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips tri-cyclone design actually forms a 3D pocket when laying the shaving surface on my face, unlike the Panasonic&#x27;s lateral (parallel) blade(s) movements that only make minimum contact(s) to the face, and I have to go back to the same area a few more times, or I have to pressure it hard against my face with a Panasonic unit but I ended up getting the irritations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Japanese products but I have to admit Philips shavers beat Japanese shavers byfar.  Hey, I still give Panasonic the opportunity~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing:  The local shopping clubs (ones that require membership to get in, they offers better deals) has better deals because their shavers frequently come with an extra replacement head!  These shaving heads can be pricy!</li>
            <li> Had an earlier model. When it was time to purchase a new one (rechargeable batteries weren&#x27;t holding a charge any more), I was surprised the same model was still available. They&#x27;ve made a few upgrades. 13,000 rpm instead of 10,000 rpm. But it&#x27;s still the same awesome shaver. I&#x27;m not sold on those 4 and 5 blade shavers, they just look too huge. This one works well and if it lasts like the last one did, I should be set for quite a few years.</li>
            <li> Previous model died after a long life and was happy with its performance. But this model is far better wet and dry. It is 95% of the way to achieving the same results as a razor shave.</li>
            <li> Works ok.  but not any thing special</li>
            <li> I bought this a few weeks ago. My previous shaver was a Norelco, which was the best I&#x27;d had until now. However, one infuriating feature of the Norelco was that the battery was soldered in, and due to a disability, I have difficulty soldering. That meant that when the battery went, the shaver was history. I&#x27;m pleased that this isn&#x27;t a problem with the Panasonic.Other than that:&lt;br /&gt;1) It shaves closer than the Norelco, virtually as well as a multi-blade razor.&lt;br /&gt;2) I&#x27;m getting about 10 shaves/charge. This is low, because I&#x27;m at the age where I spend a little time with the trimmer removing hairs from places I&#x27;d rather they didn&#x27;t grow! However, the Norelco was better.&lt;br /&gt;3) The high-speed stubble remover mode doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything. I have to blow on the cutting head anyway to clear it, and it doesn&#x27;t make any difference which speed I use.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly fine for me. Have been using it for almost a year or so and it works as it was new. It really cuts deep and the battery last pretty long.</li>
            <li> Not as good as regular razor. Cannot find an electric that shaves as close as regular razor. It is OK for when we do not go out.</li>
            <li> Great little shaver, which exceeded my expectations. Gives a very close shave. I got the best results using a pre -shave liquid&lt;br /&gt;( Williams Lectric Shave) The instructions state , Do not clean the shaver with Alcohol, so I was concerned about the pre shave&lt;br /&gt;liquid and it&#x27;s contents. I called customer service and was told that the pre shave liquid is safe. You are only applying it to your face and when it dries after a few seconds, it has no bad effects on the shaver. This little gem cleans up great, using water as per the instructions. I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Dennis</li>
            <li> I bought it for my daddy and he said it worked really well and he loved it. I don&#x27;t have much knowledge about electric shave but after comparing many products, I chose this one. It is not a new model with just basic functions but enough for those who have less beard. Just 3 blades but high RPM and very easy to clean. Drop few shampoo and switch on vibration then wash it clean under running water, very convenient and remains a good smell. If my dad says it is comfortable and valuable (also cheaper than higher level model) I would say I like it and recommend to others.</li>
            <li> WOW, great shaver.  I use it every day, I am completely satisfied, both with the price and quality of this shaver.</li>
            <li> Item just doesn&#x27;t shave close enough.  Requires pushing hard and alot more time to shave.  Would not purchase again. Bye</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for almost a year now and it is still giving me great shaves.  I like this razor better than the Remington I used to use.  Great razor.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Best shaver I have ever had and the fastest rpms</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd Panasonic shaver of this style that I&#x27;ve purchased over an almost 20 year span, having been a Norelco user prior to that.  I was happy with my first Panasonic, happier with the 2nd, and this new one surpasses both, each progressing in enhanced usage and performance.  I don&#x27;t get beard pull with these Panasonic&#x27;s that I used to, there&#x27;s no razor burn or skin irritation, and the shave is close and dependable, which is what&#x27;s kept me coming back.  I&#x27;ve been very pleased that these have lasted as long as they have (with periodic blade replacements).  I still use my first (nearly 20 years old) as a travel shaver, now retiring it (though it still works decently).</li>
            <li> I shave with a blade and use this Panasonic to trim and finish everything that the blade cannot get to. Works great, I love it!</li>
            <li> I had this shaver for 3 years now and had no issues to date. I will  be needing new blades soon. I purchased this shaver for my son. No problems from Panasonic. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Best shave from an electric.  This shaver is the fastest shaver that I have used in a long time.  It seems that most shavers today are made in China and are cheaply made.  The last Norelco  I got (AT830) is very slow and doesn&#x27;t shave close enough requiring multiple passes over the same areas taking 3 times longer than it should.  I got a Braun 380s-4 last christmas that did better but still required multiple passes. It has now stopped working completely, it is dead.  Both of these were made in china.  Norelco and Braun products used to be better before they started manufacturing them in China.  This Panasonic shaver is also made in china.  Don&#x27;t know why Panasonic, a Japanese company, wants to use Chinese manufactures instead their own plants, but time will tell if this shaver will continue to perform well.&lt;br /&gt;This Panasonic gives the closest shave I have gotten from an electric, ever.  It requires only 1, 2 or sometimes 3 passes and my shave is done. The only downside with this shaver is that it will nick or burn more easily than the others.  Do not press hard.  Light to moderate light pressure is all that is needed.  I got this shaver because it is a wet/dry shaver as are the Norelco and Braun.  I also use Shave Secret which is a blend of essential oils and recommend it to any one that shaves with water. It greatly reduces drag and allows the shaver to do its job easier.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this shaver to anyone looking to shave with water, but remember to not get too aggressive with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, who always complained about his electric shavers (yet wouldn&#x27;t use a razor blade.) Shavers were always cutting him, not cutting close enough, pulling too hard, or leaving his skin irritated. This shaver doesn&#x27;t have any of those problems. I haven&#x27;t heard a single complaint from him in all the months he&#x27;s been using this!</li>
            <li> Very good. I would expect that it only requires being charged once per month.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband and he is liking it.&lt;br /&gt;So I guess its worth buying.</li>
            <li> I have only had this for a little over 2 weeks, but so far it is a great shaver.  It gives a good close shave and is easy to clean.  I love the read-out that tells what charge the batter is at.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this shaver and used it for approximately 6 months. Unfortunately, in order to get a close shave, wet or dry, one has to shave for quite a long time, to the point where the shaving blades are very warm.</li>
            <li> This razor is the best razor ever. If you use it with the Nivea Gel, the skin is so soft and smooth. In fact, when my brother tried it he absolutely liked it. So our mom decided to buy him one.</li>
            <li> It does not shave as close as a blade, but it doesn&#x27;t cut you either. Sometimes it is necessary to shave twice a day, but I had surgery to my left hand and shaving is a lot easier with the electric than with a blade razor.</li>
            <li> I had been using Braun for years and boy am I glad that I switched.  This is an awesome shaver, feels so smooth on my face.  I really like it; would recommend it.</li>
            <li> A good quick shave. Still not a good as a razor blade, but beats using a blade and shaving cream every day. Like it!</li>
            <li> My 16 year old son and my husband are both very satisfied with this shaver!</li>
            <li> Husband has looked at more expensive ones, but I saw the good housekeeping seal.He is very happy.We would order same brand in future.</li>
            <li> First with the Panasonic electric shaver , formerly Philips products are used after shaving think this product is very fast, the only drawback is shaking too much.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Affordable&lt;br /&gt;2. Waterproof&lt;br /&gt;3. Good battery life.&lt;br /&gt;4. Charges fast&lt;br /&gt;5. Achieves close shaves&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Cannot use it while it charges&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Cheap and easy care&lt;br /&gt;and here again the next time you buy&lt;br /&gt;Shaving is very comfortable, easy care&lt;br /&gt;Very good Shaver</li>
            <li> It is very good and easy to use. Battery is good for a week if fully charge and with indicator showing % left.</li>
            <li> I have send it to my friend as a gift, He is  very like this watch. It has high quality and better style.It is also suit me.</li>
            <li> Unless you like running a shaver over the same spot 30 times from varying angles to keep your neckbeard in check, don&#x27;t buy this turd.</li>
            <li> Great product for the money.  It shaves very close.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised but I was expecting a bit more from Panasonic. You can&#x27;t use it for a quick shave and does not do a complete job.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver and is highly recommended! It&#x27;s nice to buy a product where the company can guarantee its&#x27; quality (for more than 90 days let&#x27;s say, Panasonic puts a 2 year warranty on this). You can&#x27;t let your beard get too long though as it does struggle cutting a 4-5 day old beard. I love being able to shave wet or dry. I use the shave gel for extra comfort on my sensitive skin. To be honest though I still have to use a regular disposable razor blade very quickly to get that last bit of smoothness. But this is an awesome product and is highly recommended. I&#x27;ve tried other electric razors and this one surpasses them all!</li>
            <li> I was given this as a gift from my wife to replace a phillips/norelco brand because I kept using my wife&#x27;s older norelco because it was faster, smoother and not as hard on my skin.  This shaver is billed as a sensitive skin shaver and close shave.  I took much more than 3x the time to shave as with my wife&#x27;s and 1.5x as long as my own norelco.  I was not terrible on my skin, but was still a bit rashy after the shave much like the newer model phillips/norelco.  This was, however, much more expensive than mine, not as expesive as my wife&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m not impressed, it doesn&#x27;t work for me and thought it may be comparable, it&#x27;s not worth the money since it doesn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product over the 30 days requested, and I&#x27;m not blown away, but it does a good job. I am a lifelong blade shaver, and I needed something I could use for travel and convenience. Maybe it isn&#x27;t fair to compare. I think it takes too many passes to achieve a close shave without irritation. I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard, so I was expecting a little more after reading some of the reviews. All in all still a good product.</li>
            <li> this product is truly awesome, i did not expect it to be that good because of the relatively low price so it was a pleasant surprise. I tried it because of the good reviews and the reviews were once more on the money. My previous razor was the panasonic 4 blade and this product is even better. I use it with the billy jealousy shave cream and it is an excellent combo, highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This machine does not shave very close.  Have to go over and over and then not so good.  The trimmer cannot be used next to the ear because of the noise.  Overall not good for shaving and way too noisy.  Plan to donate it.  Got a Phillips Norelco and it works great.  Close shave and quiet.</li>
            <li> i just bought it and i&#x27;m really happy with built quality and performance, it&#x27;s much better than my philips architec for 320$. it shave&#x27;s clean an nice, great resistance to water, and cleaning it&#x27;s very easy.&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Practical, cheap, good built quality&lt;br /&gt;CONS: can&#x27;t use it while charging, it&#x27;s to sad ( with this feature it would be a best electric chawer)</li>
            <li> Got this for my son&#x27;s birthday. Unfortunately, I wish I could send it back. My dad had a shaver that had a receptacle on the unit that collected the shaven hairs. Not so with this amazing shaver, hairs all over my bathroom sink. Not the shavers fault, but, now I get to clean my sink whenever my son shaves. Good unit, not recommended as a gift for someone you share a bathroom with.</li>
            <li> I have owned 2 other electric shavers previous to this one: another Panasonic, and a Remington. The Remington was a higher end foil model and it did well (but to be fair, I used that one when my beard wasn&#x27;t as rough/thick so I can&#x27;t compare), and my old Panasonic was a cheap $20 one that shaved surprisingly well. Anyways, about a year and a half ago I switched to razors. I used Schick hydro 5-blades, and while it cut close against the grain, it severely irritated my skin and caused moderate acne and razor bumps (me being an acne prone 18-year old guy). Then about six months ago, I switched to double edged safety blades. I bought a Merkur handle, feather blades, proraso shave soap, and I even put oil on my face before the soap, basically I had all the equipment I needed to provide me a supposedly superior shave.&lt;br /&gt;Well, let&#x27;s just say I was tempted to go back to Schick quite a few times. I kept trying DE, but in the end I think I had more irritation and nicks than with Schick. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I know some guys respond very well with the double edged (and even straight razor) shaving, but my face is just too sensitive and dry, and my beard too thick, all of which is a bad combination for any razor shaving. So about late February, I remembered my old electric razors and thought maybe a good foil razor would be the answer to my problems. I spent a couple days researching different brands and models and going through all of the \\&quot;verified purchase\\&quot; reviews, and I finally decided on this Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week one: I did it completely dry. I noticed that there was absolutely no drag or irritation, but it did make my skin very flaky and slightly bumpy (I attribute these to having sensitive skin and going through the adjustment stage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week two: I started shaving after my showers and it seemed to not shave as close, not really sure why. But I was getting maybe 90% less flaky skin, and only a few bumps on my jawline and neck when I pressed to hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week three: I am now shaving in the shower (I should mention that every time I wet-shaved, I never used my proraso or anything else on my damp face). My shaves are now as close as they were when I dry shaved, and even more comfortable and smooth thanks to the steam. The shaver also doesn&#x27;t break my skin if I go over any raised acne bumps, which was a huge problem with the manual razors. In fact, I am not getting nearly as much inflamed acne anymore caused by irritation, mostly just hormonal acne now. I&#x27;ve even shaved dry a couple times this week as a quick touch up, or due to time constraints, and no more flaky skin! After shaving, I rinse my face a couple times with warm water and then splash it with some cold water to close the pores and prevent ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t started week 4 yet, but I expect my results to continue getting better. A few more things about the razor:&lt;br /&gt;-After all of my shaves, my stubble still appears to be a little dark, even though it is smooth to the touch. I actually don&#x27;t mind the dark look, it&#x27;s only minimal anyways. And like I said, my face still feels smooth which is what&#x27;s important.&lt;br /&gt;-One full charge lasts me about 6-8 shaves, but I also take longer to shave than what the instructions recommend, which is just 3 minutes. I usually take about 10 minutes to shave in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;-It. Is. So. Loud. Every time I dry shaved, I put cotton balls in my ears because my ears would ring a little after using it. I have no problem with the noise in the shower though.&lt;br /&gt;-I have not had any problems with steam getting under the battery screen even though I&#x27;ve held it completely under water a few times.&lt;br /&gt;-Cleaning is very easy. The head easily pinches off and it just needs a rinse. Use soap every once in awhile to keep it most fresh.&lt;br /&gt;-I find it very annoying that I can&#x27;t use the shaver while it&#x27;s charging, I could with my other electric shavers which is what extended their lives past what they probably should have been.&lt;br /&gt;-I have absolutely no problem shaving on my neck like other reviewers have experienced. I have a pretty protruding adam&#x27;s apple, and not even that gets irritated when I glide over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up giving this shaver 4 stars instead of 5 for a few reasons:&lt;br /&gt;-One, I can&#x27;t shave while it&#x27;s charging.&lt;br /&gt;-Two, it requires multiple passes for me since it doesn&#x27;t seem to lift my hairs. I have to stretch my skin around more than I expected I would, and a couple hairs don&#x27;t get cut at all if they are laying down completely flat. Since I shave every morning, the longer shave time is a slight bother, but only when compared to my old Panasonic. When I was using a safety razor, it would take upwards of 30-40 minutes to shave because of the 3-4 passes + touchups I needed to get close, and the extra slowness I took to minimize irritation.&lt;br /&gt;-Three, the pop-out trimmer is relatively weak compared to my old cheap Panasonic, so I still use that to trim my sideburns every once in awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than these few cons, I am really enjoying this shaver, and my sensitive face is even more thankful that I made the switch!&lt;br /&gt;I plan to update this review in a few months or so after I&#x27;ve spent more time with it, but feel free to make any comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I have now had this razor for a little over 5 months and it is still great. It doesn&#x27;t shave my upper lip/cheeks as close as I&#x27;d like, but it does shave my neck really close. I now only shave dry at night time unless I forget, then I shave in the morning during my shower so my skin doesn&#x27;t get flaky. Overall, I would still recommend this razor highly, but look at other razors to see if you can find a closer cutting one.</li>
            <li> The purchase price and free shipping made this shaver a good value. I like&lt;br /&gt;the light weight device, it is easy to use and does the job.</li>
            <li> After comparing many shavers I decided to go with this one. The price was fair and the replacement blades are not as expensive as many others out there. It is light &amp; does the face well but I have to repeat the the neck a couple times.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little louder than others out there but nothing too bad. I am happy with the overall product and future upkeep cost providing it lasts me a few years.</li>
            <li> like the speed and turbo cleaning with soap,keep&#x27;s the shaver really clean.Does&#x27;nt shave as close as a rotor shave.I use williams lectric shave.I have not tried a wet shave yet!</li>
            <li> Piece of junk. Doesn&#x27;t shave even half as good as my old Remington Microscreen. I have to go over and over again to get a decent shave, I never had to do that with my old Remington and I bought it at a garage sale for $1.00, bought new blades for it and it was good to go. Seriously, this Panasonic is worthless. Maybe it had bad blades in it or something but I really don&#x27;t care, you buy something brand new its supposed to work. I give it a ten thumbs down...if I had ten thumbs that is. At the least, panasonic ought to send me a new set of blades to see if that would help but I doubt they&#x27;d do that.</li>
            <li> Nice razor gives a better cut than my braun but my braun blades are very dull. The only negative thing for me is the NOISE this little razor is LOUD as in humming with its linear motor..very noisy when I use it at 5am.. My Braun was quieter. That said it seems to be working ok after 2 months the shave quality is good with this 3 foil razor with 2 blades. In the future I hear the 3 blade, 4 foils are even smoother.</li>
            <li> Very smooth, and delivers a quality shave each and every time.  Very easy to clean, and also like the pop-up trimmer.</li>
            <li> OK, I did my research and looked through the Amazon reviews for shavers. Somehow got it for $63 from NewEgg, and wow. Holy wow. I had been using Braun products, and had to replace foils, deal w. problems. This shaver is incredible. Even the trimmer works great, which was a pleasant surprise. Home run, win win win here folks. Closest shave I&#x27;ve had with an electric.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t bought an electric razor for 10 years!  Needless to say I don&#x27;t grow too much facial hair, but enough to have to shave every day for work.  I&#x27;ve noticed that this razor does not tug on your whiskers when it is long.  It also stays charged for at least a couple of weeks for me so far.  I think it does a good job and did not cost that much.  I&#x27;m not sure what the wet in wet/dry means...but I keep it away from water.</li>
            <li> This is one of those rare products that truly delivers on the hype.  I chose it because Consumer Reports ranked it near the top and yet the price is fairly modest compared to the very best-ranked models.  The shave is &amp;#34;like a baby&#x27;s butt&amp;#34; according to my girlfriend, and yet the closest possible shave this item can deliver takes only five to seven minutes. I am so happy with it that I am considering buying a second to stash in my office.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband who has very sensitive skin. He loves it, and I am happy to see his skin is now very smooth without redness or bumps. It is not cheap, but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use with no frills. I prefer the ease of dry shaving with electric razors, and this fits the bill. I&#x27;ve used it for a while now and the only shortcoming is that it&#x27;s occasionally lacking in getting a close shave on my neck, requiring just a little effort on my part to ensure I get  every hair. All in all, a good product. Cleanup is easy and it holds a charge through multiple shaves and charges fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> He loves it and uses all the time. Is his first electric razor. I hoped the shape and appearance would be a positive for an old-school kind of guy, but was impressed by the high tech features. Easy to use and effective. I&#x27;m sure he would recommend to anyone. His exceptionally smooth face is a plus for me, too! Bravo Panasonic!</li>
            <li> CAN SHAVE WET OR DRY.&lt;br /&gt;CONSUMERS REPORTS RATES THIS PRODUCT ON THE TOP.&lt;br /&gt;IT IS SELF CLEANING AND CAN BE USED WITH SOAP AS WELL AS DRY</li>
            <li> Best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Wet or dry flexible and this is a plus to me.  Good shave every time.</li>
            <li> My Remington died and I quickly got on Amazon.com and picked this Panasonic brand. I had&lt;br /&gt;never used this brand and I was only taking  a chance.&lt;br /&gt;I am totally satisfied with it. It is quite, runs smooth like a Honda car engine, and shaves very clean.&lt;br /&gt;The Battery level indicator is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;  mclin, Corning, N.Y.</li>
            <li> I tried really hard to like this product. I wanted to get away from expensive razors, but this was not just a satisfactory shave. Tried daily for 2 months and no real improvement. It ended up taking longer than a wet shave with a razor, and was only about 80% of the quality and closeness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 70 years old and had Norelco&#x27;s and could not get the soft grey whiskers to cut.  I tried&lt;br /&gt;this one and had worse results.  I&#x27;m back to the old strait edge razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried elec razors thru the years ( 60 yrs old ) and this the first that shaves well. owned it about a month and I&#x27;m very happy. It keeps charge for days and works in the shower.</li>
            <li> Works great on my coarse beard.</li>
            <li> This is a gem for me.  I don&#x27;t use it often as I prefer a blade, however whenever I need a quick shave to tun out somewhere this provides a nice clean shave. I love that I can pop it open and run it under water to clean it, and I&#x27;ve even used it in the shower a few times and it always gives a great shave,</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve had all smooth, close and comfortable shaves.  Easy to clean too.  I&#x27;ve used it about 10 times.</li>
            <li> clean close shave on my tender face, love that I can run it under the faucet for a better cleaning, recharges very fast, well made.</li>
            <li> This was bought to replace an old norelco electric razor and this one is so much better, it doesn&#x27;t pull your whiskers if they get a little too long.</li>
            <li> Good, but I need a time to adapt this shaver, and a little expensive. I have missed a opportunity to buy a better one with discount, so I suggest if you do not need it in a hurry, you can wait to buy a better one.</li>
            <li> We can still order parts for it and separately not the whole head.  We can order a screen or the cutter... That saves a lot!</li>
            <li> Never has an electric razor given me a truly satisfying shave and this one is no match for my Fusion blades.  It will, however, give me a good-enough-for-the-office shave in about the same amount of time and with less mess. Charges quickly and is fairly easily to clean. Good price.  I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
            <li> I got this because sometimes the electrics work better around the edges of the jaw line, and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint, plus it&#x27;s saved me during some car rides to meetings.</li>
            <li> This is the most I&#x27;ve ever spent on a shaver. It operates at a much higher speed than the Remington&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve had in the past. It does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;This model offers a wet shave option which works great - super close with no irratation. The problem is after you use the wet shaving the dry shaving seem average. Dry shaving seemed fine until I used the wet shave.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver just about as close as my gillette fusion razor. I am surprised and quite pleased.</li>
            <li> they were right, after shaving for about a month I don&#x27;t want to try any other devices, it is the best.</li>
            <li> replaced with my  LA63s  due to the battery dying. it lasted just over two years. seemed to be a good durable razor but the razor didn&#x27;t seem to hold charges as does my LA63s . was just past warranty. has 3 cutting blades as opposed to 4 on my LA63s.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut near as well as my Norelco did</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Panasonic wet/dry shavers for decades. I purchased this one because it was on sale (around $60) and it had decent reviews. As someone who&#x27;s used many different models, I can honestly say that it isn&#x27;t much better than some of the lower-end models I&#x27;ve used. Some details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Three blades, so in theory it does a better job. It doesn&#x27;t do a worse job than other brands or models, but I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s much better.&lt;br /&gt;- It charges VERY quickly. I usually charge when it hits 10 or 20%, and it&#x27;ll charge in under an hour.&lt;br /&gt;- If you forget to charge it, you can use it while it&#x27;s charging. Some models require you to plug it into the wall to charge, so you can&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;- It has a digital display that goes in increments of 10, so you always know how much charge is left.&lt;br /&gt;- Super-easy to clean, as with all wet/dry models. Just open the top, add some soap, run under water, rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s quite loud. It has a very high-pitch noise that my other models never had.&lt;br /&gt;- It doesn&#x27;t shave any closer than my two-blade entry model from Panasonic. In fact, I still have it just in case. I have to shave over the same spot a few times to get a close shave. I&#x27;ve had other similar mid-level models that shaved with one pass, so either they&#x27;re using cheaper blades or it&#x27;s something about this particular model, but it&#x27;s definitely not the closest shave I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;If you want to save money, you can spend less and get a very similar shave. There are entry 3-blade models that are under $50 and two-blade models that are ~$30. There are similarly priced 3-blade models that I think give a closer shave, so I think the retail price on this is very inflated, and I would be hard-pressed to pay more than $50 for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A side note about Panasonic wet/dry razors. For some reason, the battery seems to die just before the 1-year warranty. I&#x27;ve owned many of them and the same thing happens: the battery won&#x27;t hold a charge after 11 or so months. You call the number and they say it&#x27;s covered, you send it in (you pay shipping), they send it back (they pay for return shipping) with a refurb unit. They claim they &amp;#34;fixed&amp;#34; it, but it&#x27;s clear they just gave you a refurb as my units were definitely not mine (they had distinguishing marks). The refurbs will last another 3-4 months, and then the battery dies again, but at that point they won&#x27;t replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like Panasonic razors, and I will continue to use them. I think this was a slight disappointment for me.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice close shave (for me anyways) and charges very fast. Battery life is also very good and I spend about 5/10 minutes most mornings shaving and probably charge 1 time every 7 days. Easy to clean/maintain as well. Hoping it will last a long time and so far I think it will.</li>
            <li> Does a good job, certainly better than the brand I was using previously. Fits my hands nicely (I alternate right and left), and the charge status and fast recharge are very good. Not as close as a razor or &amp;#34;as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom&amp;#34;, but very good - maybe I have very heavy beard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this shaver so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s : Very easy to clean, works when wet, charges quickly , good shave quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s: neck shave as with almost all non manual blades is not the best but still acceptable</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard.  My Braun,  doesn&#x27;t get close enough on my chin or mustache area.  This one gets closer to a razor shave.</li>
            <li> This shaver is awesome and so is the trimmer. What a great buy for anyone looking for a good shave.</li>
            <li> i shave my face neck and head with this, been using it for almost two weeks, it does an ok job. i&#x27;d only recommend using it with shave cream, even the cheap stuff, just to give it a little lubrication and get as close as it can. i&#x27;ve taken up using lectric shave for first pass, then lathering up for second, to get an actual close shave i need to go back over with a razor still though. i&#x27;m keeping it because it lets me get the back and sides of my head without and nicks. maybe the four blade would do a better job? it&#x27;s an ok buy, i&#x27;m happy with battery life, i&#x27;ve never been impressed with electrics anyway so it&#x27;s as good as expected. .</li>
            <li> Had a Braun that died after 10+ years and decided to try this one out.  Excellent shave.  Would definitely buy it again.  Easy to care for; no extra cleaning products needed, just hand soap.  My only complaint is that the trimmer could be a bit stronger/tougher.</li>
            <li> My father had a Remington shaver when I was a child and it lasted for decades.  The Panasonic provides a closer shave , better than I expected.  Cleaning takes 45 seconds.  I&#x27;ve gotten 15 shaves on one charge.  You have to learn how to twist your face to get a close shave under the neck and other spots, but like I mentioned before, I get a closer shave than I expect for under $100 including shipping.  If this product lasts 10 years, its costs is next to nothing. Don&#x27;t shave in the shower in drought area please.</li>
            <li> Price is everything with these.  Great product.  Recommended</li>
            <li> The delivery was just fine, as everything I receive from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I am saving it for my husband&#x27;s birthday on June 17, but I am sure he is going to love it.</li>
            <li> Never used an electric shaver before but I am happy with it. Takes some time to get used to it but end result is good.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his shaver.  He especially likes the Wet/Dry feature.  He also says it is a breeze to care for unlike his last one.</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH AN ELECTRIC RAZOR, AND FOR ALL INTENSIVE PURPOSES I FIND IT A NICE PIECE OF EQUIPMENT.  TRULY IT DOESN&#x27;T PRODUCE THE &amp;#34;CLOSE&amp;#34; SHAVE THAT A SAFETY RAZOR WOULD BUT FOR A RETIREE ON A DAILY BASIS IT&#x27;S CERTAINLY ADEQUATE.</li>
            <li> I got it for my husband and he has been using it since I got it.  He&#x27;s not one to say anything other that it&#x27;s ok.  But for being ok he sure seems to like using it very much, put other one away and has been using this one ever since.  That means to me he likes very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a couple times because I hate shaving in general. But this little thing does an amazing job. Much better than normal razors and the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever tried so far.</li>
            <li> I love this. I bought one for travel, and loved it so much, bought another one for home. It&#x27;s a great shaver and way better than the 3 head rotary shavers that cost so much.</li>
            <li> I got this razor on sale and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. For years I used only the common cartridge razors but got sick of the skin irritation and high cost of refills. This razor gives me an acceptably close shave in a short time with little irritation, even when I shave dry. It&#x27;s easy to rinse out and it seems to be 100% waterproof. The batter lasts for 4-5 shaves and recharges quickly. I&#x27;ve got a pretty heavy beard and this is the first shaving solution I&#x27;ve really been happy with.</li>
            <li> I am old school and use the razor dry. It provides a close shave, is comfortable to hold and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I have no complaints and am glad I chose this model. I am not sure what I could have gained by purchasing a much more expensive razor. Love it!!</li>
            <li> this is a very good product one  of the best on the market if you are looking for a shave</li>
            <li> it was not as close a shave as I expected; otherwise OK.  I wanted a close shave and this I why I didn&#x27;t buy a rotary razor.</li>
            <li> I have always owned Norelco, but my wife bought this Panasonic for Fathers Day (early gift).  I am pleased with the razor both in wet shave and dry shave.  Currently very pleased with the gift.</li>
            <li> Small vibration than I imagined，Work sound is great，Real good-looking than the picture，Packaging is also very good，Some still do not understand icons</li>
            <li> I have hair on my face. After using this product, I don&#x27;t have hair on my face and my face doesn&#x27;t hurt. Very nice!</li>
            <li> Excellent electric shaver for the money.  Quick charge and easy to clean.  Easy to handle.  And very reasonable price...  highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Been using the Panasonic shaving system for over 20 years.  Some have been better than others, but it is always better to shave in the shower.  Looks like this three header will perform very good.</li>
            <li> This shaver is great for people who love shaving their head.  I wanted one for a trip overseas and found this badboy for a great price.  It is great for touchups or the odd missed hair, but really great if you want to get cueball smooth.  I recommend using some sort of shaving cream (the headblade stuff is excellent) as I didn&#x27;t like using it dry or with water alone, but a great product none the less.</li>
            <li> this is not the greatest or even close. it does get the job done. the shave isnt very close and i have to go over my face a few times. it does stay charged for quite some time though</li>
            <li> Like I said in the title, this is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever had. It doesn&#x27;t cause ME any razor bumps on my neck and is still a very close shave. Its more powerful than most electric razors so it takes less time for me to shave than usual and with far better results. If you are looking for a new electric razor, I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Never used an electric razor before so i cant compare to another brand. Feels sturdy in hand and works great for me. So far i am very happy that it gets as close as a bic razor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is because of the type and the rotary blades would have helped me but u need to run this in all the directions. It even peels of the skin at edges and bursts small acne.</li>
            <li> I have tried many more expensive razors and they don&#x27;t do any better. This razor does an amazing job of cleaning up my face! Charges quickly and lasts me several shaves (usually 5 or more).</li>
            <li> I have been using electric shavers for over 50 years and my Remington that I have been using (I have been using Remmington shavers for most of those years) was getting a bit slow and not doing that good of a job and since that model which I liked was no longer being made, I decided to try another brand.  I asked Santa for this shaver for Christmas and WOW.  This is the best shave I have ever had from an electric.  I shave dry and my first shave was quick and close and left my face smooth.  I have a fairly heavy beard and it did not even slow this thing down.  I don&#x27;t know if it will continue to impress me (I am thinking it will), but so far I think that it is a winner.  Even after a full shave the battery is still at 100% (I think it goes down in 10% increments).  The charging was really fast - just a few hours.  I love the power meter.  I will now know how much power is still available so I will know when to charge the shaver before it runs down to nothing, unlike my previous shavers.  Great shaver at a great price and I cannot imagine one of the more expensive ones doing a better job.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor, and at an affordable price. It produces a good shave, is quiet, and simple to maintain.</li>
            <li> I have stubborn Italian hair, and have to shave every day since my hair grows so freaky fast. The shave lasts from morning to night with a great result. I do not get razor burn like with the straight razors, and still have to shave just as often. So the money saving in the long run is great as well. I will buy another after this one burns out. I have had it for 6 months now, and feel I have gotten my moneys worth for how much I shave my legs.</li>
            <li> The husband loved it. It gives him a really close shave!!</li>
            <li> My husband is very happy with his razor.  It gives him a clean shave and is easy to use.  He is looking forward to trying it with shaving cream and thinks it is a real advantage that it can be used wet or dry.</li>
            <li> my husband said it&#x27;s very convenient to use. good1</li>
            <li> I expected a transition period going from a rotary shaver to this one, but still have trouble getting a clean shave. I seem to have to press pretty hard to get the stubble on some areas such as under the jaw bone and on the neck, but it can even be difficult to get a clean shave on flatter areas such as below my sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like that it is cordless and seems to have a good battery life. It can get me through five or six shaves on one charge. And, I like the idea that I could use it in the shower, although I haven&#x27;t yet.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver several months ago and have been using it 3 to 4 times a week and am very impressed with the performance!  My old Panasonic shaver was still going strong after almost ten years of use but decided to purchase this upgraded version and boy and I happy with it!  This shaver will give you a very close, smooth shave and it never burns or chaffs your skin at all.  I only have to charge it up once every 7 or 8 shaves.  Also, the flip up trimmer works great for fine detail work.  It has a nice feel in your hand, lightweight and makes a high pitch wine when turned on, it&#x27;s pretty neat!    Update 9/10/15 - Well after using this shaver for some time now, the one bad thing about this shaver is it throws whiskers all over the place.  The whiskers get all over the shaver and your chest which I don&#x27;t like at all.  Other than that shaver works great!</li>
            <li> Great product, my husband loves it, he said shaving is a lot faster now, thanks!</li>
            <li> Great to use an electric with shavng cream.&lt;br /&gt;Nice close shave. Very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to all.</li>
            <li> I like it.Panasonic ES8103S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade .It is suit for me.much better than other one.de.rserve you to use it,it is good</li>
            <li> First Panasonic! Bought Philips for over 50 years, yes I am that old. Love it and easy to clean and replace parts. Happy customer!</li>
            <li> Does a good job of shaving and beard trimming..recommend it to all who need a shave and don&#x27;t want the bother of lather ,etc</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman, and I wanted something to use on underarms and bikini. This works great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not terribly sensitive (eg. I previously shaved with disposable razors and water without shaving cream), so I don&#x27;t know how well this would do for folks who are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not the world&#x27;s closest shave, but it&#x27;s perfect for me -- I just want the hair not to be visible and not to be prickly; maybe I&#x27;m imagining it, but the little bit of hair that remains seems softer than when I used a disposable. I liked the results so much I started using it on the little blonde hair on my face, too, and am loving the results.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews for many razors I decided to buy this for my boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;If you want a clean shave, especially on your neck, this is not going to work.&lt;br /&gt;We are very disappointed.</li>
            <li> this is a very good shave, shaving is pretty easy and smooth... a bit tight on the tough curves of neck region .. but a couple of extra strokes and it gets the job done... good battery life and LED display. overall a good buy for $60</li>
            <li> my boyfriends got this for christmas and said it is the best razor he has ever had! he used it after not shaving for quite some time and even though he usually has to use a trimmer beforehand he didn&#x27;t with this razor.</li>
            <li> I have had many razors in my life, but this is probably the worst that I have used. It takes forever to get a shave, and even then , it is not a close smooth one... Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Purchase this as a replacement for a very old Norelco shaver. I use almost ever day..good for a fast clean shave. Easy to clean . A fully charged battery lasts about 30 days and recharges take about one hour. Certainly worth the price</li>
            <li> I bought this electric razor for my husbabd&#x27;s birthday and he loves it. Finally!  A convenient rechargable razor that is easy and quick to use with no mess. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric in decades so this is a bit of a change for me and I can only compare it to blade shaving and I&#x27;m quite pleased.  It has taken a little time to get used to it, but now shaving is much easier and quicker.  It recharges quickly.  I recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> Came the next day for  minimal charge and my husband was thrilled. Product works perfectly</li>
            <li> Husband has Alzheimers and because he can&#x27;t remember to clean shavers, he thinks they always need replacement.  Well, I first liked this shaver because it worked good.  However, when we bought the replacement blades, it never seemed up to par of initial purchase.  So now we&#x27;ve switched to Braun Series 3-340s wet/dry electric.  It&#x27;s easier (for me and him) to clean and does a good cut.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with this shaver.  I have used this shaver for over a week and it cuts ok.  My facial hair isn&#x27;t very think nor very long. It cuts close enough at some areas and the charge last a few days.  However, after using it on my face and my head, both my face and head started to have many bumps. My head became very tender because of the bumps resulting from the use of the shaver on my head. My face started having bumps also and I had to stop using this shaver. Can anyone explain if anything can be done to prevent the bumps from using this shaver?</li>
            <li> A good shaver, but replacement blades are very poor quality. I used ~ 10 times, it already dull. The original blades almost sharp as the replacement blades. I do not need shave every day like most guys. I shave once in 3 days. Do not buy replacement blades. It wasted the money.  Big Disappointment of quality of replacement blades. The Panasonic items I can always depend on but not this one!</li>
            <li> Compared lots of shavers at the under $100 price range and picked this one. After about 3 months I am completely satisfied with my purchase. I have had basic Braun shavers in the past and was happy with those shavers at the $40-$50 range. I selected this shaver b/c I wanted a nicer shaver w/o going over $100. I bought this for $69.99 and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Used the product both wet and dry - only did a fair job in removing leg hair - for light surfaces it worked better.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product at the price of US$80+. However, you could buy other advanced model with cleaning system with 80 bucks. Besides, when I placed the order, the website mentioned the origin was Japan, but when I unpacked mine, it showed Made in China. Amazon is misleading. And as at 19 Jan 2013, the website shows &#x27;Origin: Made in USA or Imported&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I gave it as gift to my husand he loves it. It is easy to use and clean. Seems to be a winner!</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8103S is a great electric razor.  I avoided electrics for years because they would cause me to break out.  Initially you will probably have some irritation but as the packaged instructions say, \\&quot;your skin will need time to adjust.\\&quot;  This is absolutely true.  For the first two weeks I shaved wet with shaving gel.  After a month it works wonders and any irritation is gone in an hour.  The water proof feature is excellent.  I run mine under the tap after each shave and let it air dry.  You will get about ten shaves out of this razor before it needs a one hour charge.  My best advice?  If you have sensistive skin give this razor a try for at least a month and then reap the benefits.  One last tip, even if your facial hair grows slow you should still use it once a day.  With all electrics, if you let your stubble get too long it takes longer to shave and you will get more irritation.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver - Best one ever used.  Closer shave than razor, very impressed with performance.  Buying  anything more fancy  would be a total waste  of money.  I can&#x27;t  believe some people write negative reviews on this product, they probably have beards made of  copper wire.  :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. He love the 3-blades and says it&#x27;s very easy to use and the results are great... smooth face.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A WONDERFUL PRODUCT - MY ONLY SURPRISE IS THE LOUDER THAN NORMAL OPERATING VOLUME. MAYBE THE 13,000 rpm HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT. BUT IT&#x27;S THE SMOOTHEST NON-IRRITATINNG SHAVE I&#x27;D HAVE.&lt;br /&gt;BUT THE ICING ON THIS ORDER IS THE GREAT SERVICE FROM AMAZON - ADJUSTMENTS PERMITTED AND SPEEDY DELIVERY! THANKS</li>
            <li> Well I did the right thing and purchased this as a Honey Doo thank you gift for the Husband....he loves this shaver and sings as he shaves....this is a good thing?????? any way voice aside this gift was a winner and he wants another for travel......well see how he does on the next HONEY DOOOO list.</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for a couple of weeks and it works great for a quick morning shave.  Not quite as close of a shave as a manual shaver, but now I don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting up my face.  I would recommend this shaver to everyone.</li>
            <li> I had a Braun razor for about 15 years. The battery no longer held a charge and it was hard to find replacement blades for it. I decided that I needed a new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some investigation, I purchased the Panasonic ES8103S as it was relatively inexpensive and had all the features I needed (battery percent gauge, wet/dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely happy with this razor. It cuts very close and doesn&#x27;t give me razor bumps. It&#x27;s ergonomically built and very light weight. It&#x27;s very easy to clean - no need to get the razors with the cleaning stations where they get you for the cleaning solution. That&#x27;s a total gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this unit and would definitely recommend a Panasonic razor.</li>
            <li> Shaves well over the face but not good over the neck area and bellow the chin. The batery life is great and it charges very quickly and does not make much noise either. But I use a raser to shave my neck bellow the chin area. Cleaning is very easy. Overal, good product and I recommend it</li>
            <li> Gives a close, fast shave.  It does have a problem with the jaw line and neck -- seems to be typical of electric razors; so I use a safety razor for those areas. The advantage of using this method is saving money on blades --- and reducing the likelihood of nicks.</li>
            <li> Quite happy with my purchase. Does a good job shaving with no irritation. Easy to clean. Evidently does not need charging very often.</li>
            <li> this is working awesome. love the battery display and shaves very well.</li>
            <li> The performance-to-price is high, so it is really worth to buy this model. The battery volume is a little small, yet the charging is faster than expected.</li>
            <li> This shaver works very well...The best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  On your first, second, and third shave will give your face a tingling sensation.  About the 4th shave it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about 16 months now.  It shaves at least as close as the similarly priced Braun I had before it and is holding up much better; the Braun had problems with the trimmer after 8 months.  Also cleans up quick and easy without special equipment, the Braun had a bulky cleaning tub that required regular refills of a cleaning fluid.  I&#x27;m happy with it, I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my husband, after his old electric shaver broke. So far, so good.  No complaints.  His skin is very soft and smooth after using this shaver.</li>
            <li> I spent tons of time shaving with this and it seems unable to do anything buy make my face sore and tender.</li>
            <li> I have been using an electric shaver since I started shaving when I was a teenager.  The new Panasonic I bought is clearly the best I have ever used.  I can easily say that it beats any shaver, including a wet blade razor.  In addition, it is faster and doesn&#x27;t require messy cleanups.  I have a mustache and it&#x27;s a lot easier to trim compared to a wet blade.</li>
            <li> The best electric shaver i&#x27;ve ever had.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> The saver is great, battery life is outstanding and it is easy to clean. However, I am very disappointed with the shaver outer foil. The foil that came with razor broke after few months of use. I bought a replacement but it also broke after few months. Without the foil the shaver is useless. Having to replace the outer foil frequently is frustrating.</li>
            <li> I use this shaver everyday and love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long charge, waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you got a face and hair that grows on it, get it.</li>
            <li> Good not great. Very noisy but it up well. Not sure if I would buy again  Cost OK. Charger to big.</li>
            <li> Very good shaver. Almost as close as a blade. It works well with wet shaving cream. I recommend it for anyone who appreciates a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Good item , good seller,thanks</li>
            <li> The Electric Razor does not shave as close as I expected.  I have been trying various different methods from what was on-line.</li>
            <li> i have had mine for over 7 years.&lt;br /&gt;i shave about 5 days/week. i occasionally use a blade, but this has been my mainstay for about 80% of the last 7-8 years.&lt;br /&gt;still have the original blade, it does take a bit longer, but still cuts well.&lt;br /&gt;i am looking to replace it b/c the battery drains after about 5 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;hopefully the new  ones are just as good.</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews and purchased this hoping to finally find an electric razer that would actually work like a straight edge. Unfortunately for me it not cut nearly close enough. It is not even remotely close to a straight edge. I really don&#x27;t even want to waste to much time with this review. I am simply doing this because I would have appreciated someone telling the truth and not just giving good reviews. Do not waste you money on this product. You will be dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Bought this due to all of the great ratings but when my husband tried to shave it did not even shave is stubble.  We were baffled and tried everything but he went back to his warn-out Braun for now.  I do have to say that the return was a piece of cake but would much rather had a great razor with no return!!!!</li>
            <li> I used this thing daily for 5 years.  Each morning it would give my face a nice clean and smooth look.  I replaced the foil and blade on it at one point.  Recently, the poor thing finally gave up the ghost. RIP.  I completely got my money&#x27;s worth, and themsome.</li>
            <li> This is a loud and average quality electric shaver.  After using it for two weeks I am quite displeased with this product. I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have it for more than two weeks when the number display went out.  I think the shaver works well but what a disappointment.</li>
            <li> This thing is great.  I have very thick facial hair which means one whisker could lift a 1940 buick into the air.  Every other electric I have ever tried pulls these facial WIRES and hurts like heck.  This thing cuts without any pain even when I have not shaved for three days.  I use it with shaving gel, like a blade.  It takes many passes to shave clean, but it does shave my beard without pulling or pain.  Only drawback is it does not get into tight places well, like under the nose or close to ears.  Overall...Fantastic.</li>
            <li> Razor works very well, shaves very close with no irritation. I am very pleased with the performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I have a criticism, it&#x27;s that there is no hard case with it. You don&#x27;t want to just toss a foil razor in the drawer, as you could damage the foil and get cut the next time you shave.</li>
            <li> Ease of use, more comfortable when wet.</li>
            <li> Product is worthless.&lt;br /&gt;I ran it over my face and several passes later, my face was still full of hair. It does not shave. The popup trimmer is so narrow, it&#x27;s a joke and does not cut hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to return it for a refund.</li>
            <li> Very good electric razor for the Money.  Soft touch on face and close shave. Good or better than my Braun. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Great shaver, had a three head shaver, this one works much better.</li>
            <li> I bought it based on its reviews -- not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> Update at the 4.5-year mark (April 2017): This same razor is still going strong! I clean it whenever the cleaning light comes on, and I change the blades and foil once a year. It&#x27;s an amazing product! If/when it fails, I will try to buy it or another Panasonic shaver.  Original review from Nov. 20, 2012: I have used electric razors for over 30 years. Early days were with Remington. Last 15 years with Braun. The Braun brand seems to have gone very high-priced and with features I did not want. I read the reviews on this Panasonic and decided to give it a try, since it had a 30-day trial period. I am very pleased with its shaving results. I get a close shave quickly. The only unusual aspect is shaving the moustache area. The shaver seems to struggle a bit and requires multiple passes, but in the end it does a fine job on the moustache area. I really like the longer lifetime of the cutter and foil vs. the Braun. The cleaning is unlike any other I&#x27;ve had. It uses liquid soap and water and cleans itself with a special turbo mode. I am a big fan after using it for only 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> It has been well over a decade since I had a Panasonic razor that I can use in the shower. I have been using a Braun for years, and yes I have put new rotary blades in it, but nothing shaves me as close as this Panasonic Electric Shaver. It is a joy to shave in the shower, when your beard is wet, it works like a charm. It is now ten hours since I shaved with this razor, and my face and neck are still smooth. With my other electric razor, my skin was not this smooth right after the shave, let along ten hours later. Do not hesitate to purchase the Panasonic Electric Razor.</li>
            <li> Seems the older I get, the more easy I get nicks from razors, so decided to go to a shaver.  I have tried the Norelco Shavers a couple of times and they were okay, but I kept going back to the razor for a closer shave.  Caught this one a good price and after a few weeks, I have to say I am very pleased with it.  Shavers take a little longer to shave with than razors, but it does great job.  Easy to clean and I get about ten shaves before I have to recharge.</li>
            <li> Was a Remington foil razor user for many years before trying this razor.  Easy to clean and shaves well and close.</li>
            <li> I bought this thing, it seems forever ago and its still working/shaving to this day. Great for a wet/dry quick shave. Use something better if you have time, but this thing does what I need for my moderate/medium hair growth/coarseness.</li>
            <li> Not as good as my old Norelco rotary.</li>
            <li> Does a great job, but the battery runs out quickly.</li>
            <li> Works great. Love it!</li>
            <li> The BEST Electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned and after 40 years of shaving I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve found it.  The head size is perfect and not over sized like the 4 and 5 blade ones.  GREAT purchase.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work well for me, Braun is 100% better. I returned it.</li>
            <li> Best shaver ever. Does a nice close cut.</li>
            <li> No more shaver&#x27;s bumps with this razor..</li>
            <li> I have been using Panasonic shavers for the last 10 years. This is the best one yet very lightweight, and gives a great shave.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised……cleaning is very effective……..wish it had a charging stand but quality and price rules.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I bought. The first lasted over 5 years. This is a great razor with good features.</li>
            <li> my husband uses it regularly, so i love it!!</li>
            <li> Great shaver. I have had it for over a month now and it works very well. I use it both wet and dry.</li>
            <li> Great shaver. Still works good after several years of use.</li>
            <li> I bought this a couple of months ago. I&#x27;ve had Braun and Norelco shavers, and this one is hands down the best I&#x27;ve owned. It shaves very close and doesn&#x27;t tear up my face (sensitive skin) like my old Braun and Norelco shavers did. The trimmer also works incredibly well. I am very pleased</li>
            <li> This is my second Panasonic shaver to purchase because my first shaver was taken by my husband, who likes it so much he has trashed his other razors. I then bought a second for my own use.</li>
            <li> Great shaver. I use it ll the time.</li>
            <li> BEST SHAVE I&#x27;VE EVER HAD FROM AN ELECTRIC RAZOR</li>
            <li> Ladies, save the planet by using this razor! I use it on my legs and it works just as well as a normal razor, as long as you don&#x27;t go too long between shaves. Think of all the water you can save (or if you pronounce it like Sean Connery, shave!) This is great for vacations, summer camp, music festivals, or just daily green living. I&#x27;ve tried many men&#x27;s razors and this is the only reasonably-priced one that works on the contours of a woman&#x27;s leg. It&#x27;s easy to clean too, and a charge lasts pretty long.</li>
            <li> The shaver worked ok, but doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a razor.&lt;br /&gt;The big problem is the shaver failed (it won&#x27;t turn on) after 23 months, and panasonic support/warranty service cannot be contacted.&lt;br /&gt;The website says to call an 800 number, and the 800 number says to use the website.&lt;br /&gt;If a little less than two years is good enough for you the shaver is ok.</li>
            <li> have not used it but it is the same model I am using now and it,s great</li>
            <li> Just as good or better shave than $300 Braun Shaver I have. Very close shave. Love it!</li>
            <li> Nice clean and close shave. I like that the screen tells me when I need to charge it again. Typical battery life.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor which allows you to shave quickly.</li>
            <li> Close shave, easy to handle.  On time shipping.</li>
            <li> the battary is powerful.</li>
            <li> Nice transaction, fast ship..not sure if my face fits too well with electric shavers.  This is my first. I got it to really just knock down the tree like stubble I get after 2 or 3 days that dulls any razor down to a single use.  This does knock down the stubble well enough I can do a final shave with a good razor without having to throw it out after a single use.  So this should help in that cost down the road and pay for itself in some time.  Would have given 5 stars, but maybe its just my situation...it might give a closer shave for others.</li>
            <li> Awesome, really does shave 99% as close as a blade with zero irritation. I had been using a blade and a rotary razor, this one shaves twice as good and twice as fast. Even gets the jaw line and neck really well</li>
            <li> Read the reviews and purchased as a gift. He loves it.</li>
            <li> Truly amazing shaver. Almost as good as soap and razor. First product I have found that does no leave razor burn. I absolutely  love it and battery life is truly astounding. I highly recommend this product! love it and battery life is truly long.</li>
            <li> I replaced a 10 year old Panasonic that I loved, but whose battery pooped out. Cheaper to buy this than to replace multiple parts including battery. Shave is about the same when used daily, maybe not as good. I do have to go over the same areas several time and I have a very light beard. It works great when I have waited several days to shave. In that case it outperforms my previous model. So far so good. Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> it is easy to use and it is easy to clean, gives a good shave.  have used for a month</li>
            <li> this is evrything I want in an electric razor and the price was much lower than other models that basically did the same thing.</li>
            <li> It works well but not as good as my old Braun 5 series.&lt;br /&gt;It takes longer to get a clean shave and the bulkiness doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> very close shave charges very fast</li>
            <li> Fantastic electric shaved.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love it. It doesn&#x27;t cut my face hair perfectly. I have to pass it and pass it and some times it kinda hurt my face after several passes. Beside that it is not that bad.</li>
            <li> I have been using a cheap rotary Norelco for years.  Never got a close enough save.  Finally got there with this shaver to my satisfaction.  Get only 4 shaves per charge.  It is not cord/cordless.  Should have checked before buying.  That means you are out of luck if the charge runs out until it is charged again.  If the blades don&#x27;t last more than a year, then, I am not sure it is worth paying more than the cheap Norelco.</li>
            <li> Should have been informed the item was not suitable for use in Australia only USA.  Differing power supply and connection</li>
            <li> For the process it gets the job done, but if you are looking for a close shave, this isn&#x27;t the shaver to do it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for years and it works wonderfully. Best, smoothest, most convenient shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned. Very easy to clean. Charges quickly, and holds enough to last all week. Love using it with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave especially if you wet your skin and use shaving cream.  Very little burn.  However, the shave lasts only one day and you will need to use the shaver more frequently than when shaving with a blade.  Best to shave just before jumping into the shower.  I have been using this electric shaver for four months and noticed the blades are getting dulled a bit.  The shave is not quite as good as when it was new.  I usually shave with a blade after several day of growth (weekends) and use the electric shaver on weekday for maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like the ES103S and would not go back to my old Braun.</li>
            <li> I love the shaver. I wish there was a way to lock the outside piece in place, but other than that I have been thoroughly impressed.</li>
            <li> Shaves close and comfortably.  The battery lasts through a weeks worth of shaves and charges on only a few hours.</li>
            <li> Taking longer than other razors to get a clean shave--for an electric.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll see. Although the notion that my beard will &amp;#34;adjust&amp;#34; in time strikes&lt;br /&gt;me as mechanics of hair orientation that doesn&#x27;t exist,&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;How do it know?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My second Panasonic wet/dry razor. Both work fantastically.  I&#x27;ve bought and tried other electrics and hated them all, but somehow these Panasonic machines have been great!</li>
            <li> My youngest son is in college and always looking scruffy because he &#x27;doesn&#x27;t have time shave&#x27;.  So I bought him this.  I bought this model since other razors had comments about the round design heads being difficult to get in between mouth and nose and mouth and chin.  He really likes it and Mr. Scruffy is now Mr. Clean shaved.  He has no problem getting in between nose and mouth and chin.  He did say he has to &#x27;get used to it&#x27; and had to stretch and pull this skin to get a clean shave.  I bought him some pre and after skin treatment and that helped too.  He is happy with it.</li>
            <li> Electric shaves are never going to be able to replace a razor shave and I don&#x27;t expect them too.  What I do expect is for the electric shaver to do an adequate job on off days so I don&#x27;t have to razor shave everyday.  I also want them to hold their charge.  This electric shaver does just that.  Using it 3-4 times a week (and regular shaving on other days) the charge easily lasts 2 weeks (maybe more as I haven&#x27;t really paid that much attention which means it&#x27;s not annoying).  It charges quickly and for those stubborn whiskers that don&#x27;t want to get zapped (the ones beside the throat) you can flip it over and use the side burn trimmer which cuts just as close.  All in all it&#x27;s a very good part time razor for the price.</li>
            <li> Gives my guy a clean soft shave with out the red burn marks that he got from his old shaver</li>
            <li> My previous Panasonic wet/dry electric shaver finally gave up the ghost after many years of good service so I went for Panasonic again. As with most other things Amazon had the best price and service.</li>
            <li> I am a writer and sometimes stay home for days at a time.  I hate shaving with razor blades and lather, so I thought this would be helpful.  But I find it gives me a close enough shave not to look scruffy from a distance, but if I am meeting with people I need to look fully respectable in front of, I need to get out the lather and razor blades.  Too bad.  I do like it that the battery can easily be recharged.  But maybe it&#x27;s just never possible to get a full shave without lathering up.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  First, the shave cuts very close and smooth.  Second, the motor is very quiet and, as is advertised, appears to move very fast, allowing for a pull-free shave.  Third, the charge seems to last for a long time [longer than my recent Braun].  In fact, this shaver is superior to my recently purchased Braun, and is almost half the price.  I returned the Braun, but will keep this one!  [Note: I haven&#x27;t used this shaver in the shower so can&#x27;t rate it on its wet performance].</li>
            <li> Grandson 14 yrs old wanted a shaver for Christmas. After researching them, this was the one that was rated well for him.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually review products unless really impressed. I&#x27;ve been a Braun guy since I was a teenager but when my $$$ Braun gave up the ghost after just 2 years I decided to break ranks and go with Panasonic after reading  pretty favorable reviews.  The thing I&#x27;m most impressed with is the short amount of time needed for an amazingly closer shave with zero irritation to my pretty sensitive face.  Still haven&#x27;t used it in the shower and probably never will - old habits die hard - so can&#x27;t comment there. I travel a lot and so could have used more than a flimsy cloth travel pouch but then again I didn&#x27;t buy a travel pouch...I bought a new razor and as it turns out one I&#x27;m very happy with.  Pretty sure you will be too.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 85 year old father in law and he likes it.  It does a decent job for an electric shaver.  Plus you can always trust Panasonic brand. I would buy this again ifI had too.</li>
            <li> My husband said it is the best and smoothest electric shaver he has every owned.  He loves it.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great razor!  Easy to clean.  Flexible head clings to face and neck contours and shape fits hand comfortably.</li>
            <li> Product very good.&lt;br /&gt;I shave my self and actually it makes a very good work.&lt;br /&gt;I recomend it.&lt;br /&gt;Bbbbb bb</li>
            <li> Below is the original review where I gave the product five stars. The comments below still apply. However, the quality of the product disappoints me. The LCD screen shows how much charge is left [i.e., 90%, 80, 70, etc.] After use, once it goes down to 10%, recharge. Just after one year [when the warranty expired, naturally] the LCD screen started giving me problems. Now, the only way I know it needs a charge is when it goes dead. So, concept 100%, quality 10%. Hence, now a three star review. Would not buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;I had been using a Gillette Fusion for quite a few years. I had become disillusioned with foil shavers [I had a couple Brauns.] I thought I&#x27;d try this one. The price was less than one year&#x27;s worth of Fusion replacement cartridges. With Panasonic&#x27;s 30 day satisfaction guarantee, what could I lose? I used it \\&quot;wet\\&quot; with just a bit of shave gel. It gave me a closer shave than a brand new Fusion cartridge. I had no problem at all shaving around my Van Dyke. The pop up trimmer gave me better results than I could ever achieve with the Fusion. Clean up under running water was very easy and thorough. I&#x27;m exceptionally satisfied.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8103S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) is the best shaver IMO. I shave my face and head and with this one you cannot beat for a smooth shave...A FANTASTIC Shaver!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Braun electric shavers that were three times this price that didn&#x27;t do as good a job, which is why I didn&#x27;t replace my last one for several years and used a regular razor with disposable blades.  The shave from the Panasonic isn&#x27;t as good as a new disposable blade, but it&#x27;s pretty close and is a lot better then an old used blade!  My skin is pretty sensitive and I&#x27;d get ingrown hairs or raw skin if I didn&#x27;t replace my (expensive) disposable blades frequently and the inexpensive ones tore up my face.  The Panasonic on the other hand gives a pretty good shave when dry and if I let my beard grow for a couple of days I just do a wet shave with shaving cream and don&#x27;t have any skin irritation.  If you&#x27;re in the market for an electric razor I highly recommend this model.</li>
            <li> I  owned a panasonic razor before and it was one of the best cutting razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.  This one also uses 15% of the battery per shave . do not buy</li>
            <li> Just OK - I have given it the 30+ days that Panasonic said it takes to get comfortable with it but it just does not cut as close as my old Braun - charge does not seem to last as long, either - will give it another 60 days and, if there is not any perceptible improvement, then perhaps I will go back to Braun -</li>
            <li> What a difference in my shaving. I have Parkinson&#x27;s and still stuck in the life-long habit of being clean shaven. This goes a long way at making me feel better about my shave.</li>
            <li> Husband no longer cuts himself shaving!  Does use manual razor on occasion, but loves the electric.  Has nice recharging ability.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good quality electric razor to shave my legs with. Most I have tried snag at the hair and pinch or give you razor burn. This razor is well worth the money if you are a woman looking for a great razor for your legs!</li>
            <li> Since I lost my last shaver, I used scissors for some time. After receiving this one, I use it immediately and got a good feeling:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Good touch feel, not so light;&lt;br /&gt;2. fast shaving speed with good shaving quality;&lt;br /&gt;3. 10% battery had been used more than 3 times, 1 to 2 times each.</li>
            <li> This gives you a closer shave like using a straight razor. It&#x27;s very loud, like turning on a lawnmower. It also seems to take a really long time to get a complete shave. I was looking for something to give me that stubble look and this definitely wasn&#x27;t it. But for those wanting a close shave, others seem to like it.</li>
            <li> I tried the razor (dry) and it did not give a very good shave.  I still had stubble.  My wife tried it (wet) shaving her legs and had the same problem - lots of stubble.  Can&#x27;t really recommend this at all.</li>
            <li> one of my friends told me there&#x27;s the great deal shaver here.I bought the shaver for myself.It&#x27;s really a great price and the shaver it really works very well,I like it!</li>
            <li> This is my second Panasonic electric razor. The first one was still going strong after 10 years, but I replaced it only because I had the urge. This one works just as good as the old one and hopefully, I&#x27;ll get another 10 years out of it.</li>
            <li> Gift for grandson&#x27;s birthday. He chose it.</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to shave with it.  To get a close shave you need to make multiple passes.  It&#x27;s a well made razor and the battery holds the charge.  I get a closer shave with a rotary shaver.  I will not be buying another foil razor.&lt;br /&gt;I got it because it had good ratings.</li>
            <li> Gets nice close shave in under a minute. Easy to clean. Instructions is unclear on how to get the water faucet icon to light up. Had this a few months now and still can&#x27;t figure it out. Great battery life; been using it a few months and only had to recharge once so far.</li>
            <li> Great razor, shaved my beard off really quickly, but do not leave it in the bag they include, after you rinse it with water, or it will become stinky. That&#x27;s why it only got four stars. I had to spray Fabreeze on it for three days before it stopped smelling. From an old U.S.Marine, oooh rah.</li>
            <li> Was not sure how well my skin would react to having an electric shaver, but for my relatively sparse facial hair, it actually does better than a standard razor which I had been using for a very long time.  Battery lasts about 2 weeks with normal use and only takes about an hour to charge.  I use in the shower and have experienced no problems with it yet.  Very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Shave is not as close as iam used to. But not a bad shaver.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I started using a electric shaver and I should admit that to begin with I was really skeptical about using it.  Alas, I was totally surprised and amazed at this product&#x27;s ability.  Initially I felt a little uncomfortable using it but after couple of times of using it I started understanding the amazing capability of this shaver.  It gives a very close shave, infact better than a manual razor.  Totally recommended!!</li>
            <li> I really like how fast, easy and precise it is. It is very soft on the skin and follows every contour. This is because of its 3D head movement on a pivot. However, it will always leave larger hairs uncut. This is especially true under the chin and neck area. No matter how many times I go over it, or hold it very tight to my skin, it will simply not cut these longer thicker hair/whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s very frustrating given the price. So, its not perfect, but it get the job done 90% of the way. The other 10% (hair uncut) can be trimmed using a regular safety razor.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this razor since it first came out, and just loves it.  He can&#x27;t get a close enough shave with an electric unless he&#x27;s in the shower, and this product is the best wet/dry electric we&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I guess I had to curb my expectations a little when I started using this. I was expecting a close, quick, and stubble-free shave. Essentially I was hoping this would work as efficiently as a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In reality, you won&#x27;t get a very close/stubble-free shave, and you will need multiple passes over the difficult areas, but as an electric shaver it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I didn&#x27;t buy a Braun and I am so glad.  This Panasonic out performed any electronic shaver that I have ever used.  It is very close to a blade shave and it is very easy to clean.  I love this shaver.</li>
            <li> these are great shavers.  closer than braun, smoother than norelco, easier to clean than anything, and even after shaving with a blade it could trim a bit more than the blade could.  A simpler charge indicator that was always on would be nice.  Be careful not to bang or drop the foils</li>
            <li> great item, it has nice design &amp; feel good hold it in hand.  it does the job wonderfully.cut close and well. very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> If your charge runs out, you can&#x27;t just attach the cord &amp; keep shaving, which is dumb. No electric shaves as close as a blade but I&#x27;m a bleeder and this is as good as it gets for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have owned Panasonic electric shavers for almost 20 years.  I have tried other brands like Norelco and Remington, but they just didn&#x27;t work as well for me.  My current Panasonic shaver still works well, but the battery is not holding a charge , so I did some research and put this model on my Amazon wish list and got it for Christmas.  I really like the digital readout showing the battery life, and as I stated it gives a really close shave.  The pop up trimmer is not quite as good as the one I have now, meaning that it is not as effective at trimming my side burns and mustache.  Overall, I am satisfied with the ES8103S.</li>
            <li> Great razor took me some time to get used to it, but now i am completely satasified</li>
            <li> Finally, I have an electric razor that works and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  I&#x27;ve put up with poor imitations for too many years.  This is a really good product that works as advertised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> This provides a very close shave and very easy to use. It does not irritate the skin and is able to reach most of the hard to reach spots. The batter life is adequate (holds about for 9-10 shaves) and charges very quickly.</li>
            <li> This device can&#x27;t be for the whole body cuz is sucks :( Can be use just for littler things :/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used every brand and type of electric shaver. Panasonic&#x27;s hi-end models are my favorite by far. Best shave speed and smoothness, fast recharge, cord/cordless operation. The one I retired before this lasted five solid years before the batteries finally stopped holding a charge.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver!  My husband has had many shavers over the years, from Norelco to Braun; but this one is by far his best.  And what a great value for the price!</li>
            <li> Same one I had 4 years before, so I order this again coz it&#x27;s really good. I like it so much.</li>
            <li> I never like to shave and hate all things that I have used until this unit.  It is so fast and smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave a rash or burn.</li>
            <li> Great products! If i have to do it again, i will get exactly the same one.  I would recommend to any one.  Not just the products itself but Amazon also has excellence service.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor as a present for my 90 year old grandfather&#x27;s 91st birthday. I have the 4 blade razor and just know how much he will appreciate it. After the party I will tell you his reaction.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t always deliver a smooth shave and sometimes have to shave over areas several times to remove hair.  Husband had to get out old faithful razor to remove spots shaver missed.  Not good on hard or heavy beards.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised and better. I like the fact that it is wet or dry. It is not as fast as I would like but it is the best electric shaver I have owned.</li>
            <li> Good waterproof shaver does the job. Only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t shave well under the chin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy to clean. I bought it for my boyfriend as a gift and it won&#x27;t clean properly so now it smells. I&#x27;m shopping around for a new one for him.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it 6 or 7 times and it does a pretty good job. I get a fairly close shave for an electric razor.</li>
            <li> Bought it to replace an older Panasonic shave with a dying battery. I get a much closer shave thanks to the higher blade speed. The only negative is the blade spacing seems to be just such that a lot of dead hair gets trapped between them requiring a more through cleaning than the old one.</li>
            <li> I had been a dedicated user of double-edge razors. But after years of on/off DE shaving, my skin could no longer take the abrasion of a metal blade. I tired many different razors, blades, shave soaps, and post-shave products, but the results were the same. Rough and abrasive shaves that were the cause of razor bumps, ingrown hairs, and raw skin, and these effects increased throughout the day, making my skin extremely sensitive. Enough! I had used this razor years ago and decided to return to it. This Panasonic is an excellent alternative to using a double-edge blade. Shaves are close and smooth. If I use the razor with a freshly whipped lather, the shave is very close; when I use it dry, with the assist of a pre-shave powder (Remington SP-5 Pre-Shave Talc [[ASIN:B002SJ4ADO Remington SP-5 SP5 Face Saver Pre-shaver Powder Stick (6 pack)]] I still get a fine shave, just not as close as a wet shave with this razor, but far better than acceptable. Best of all, my skin feels fine during and after shaving. I get five to six shaves per charge; and the razor performs much like a mild DE razor like Gillette&#x27;s vintage Tech razor; and it shaves closer than Feather&#x27;s AS-D1 razor. This is good razor that delivers day-after-day of DFS to good quality shaves. I found that canned lather Gillette Foamy works about as efficiently as whipped lather that one applies with a brush. In fact, the emollients in some canned lathers deliver more moisture than whipped lather. The only suggestion I would make is be sure to clean the razor thoroughly after each use and it will perform even better than razors selling for three times the cost. I compared this razor with a Norelco 1280X [[ASIN:B006W2SYGM Philips Norelco 1280X/47 SensoTouch 3D Electric Razor  with Jet Clean System, Frustration Free Packaging]], about $240, and the Panasonic outperformed the Norelco for both comfort and overall shave. No electric shaves as close as some of the modern and vintage DE razors; but this electric does a great job and it will not damage your skin.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this razor to replace her old Remington R845. The Panasonic razor does a pretty good job, the shave is almost as good as a manual razor (on legs anyway), but its pretty loud. It charges quick and is easy to hold while using it.</li>
            <li> My husband has a course beard but this razor seems to be quit good at taking it down almost as good a a razor and shave cream.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd Panasonic Men&#x27;s Shaver, and it is by-far my best electric shaver yet!  Fast and smooth shaves in half the time are the norm.  Used with Edge Shaving Gel, it cannot be beat!</li>
            <li> When I purchased this product I did not expect as close a shave as it provides. It takes a little more time but is quite a bit better than I recollect from my last encounter with an electric razor. I have a disability that makes sitting at the sink for any extended period very uncomfortable. I am very happy with the quality of the product and the shave.</li>
            <li> When my older ES8103S was due for a foil and blades, I thought I would just buy a whole new razor, thereby at least getting a new battery and motor in addition to the foil and blades. In trying to pick a razor, it looked like the same model was highly rated, at least for the money.&lt;br /&gt;So I bought exactly the same model to replace my two year old razor. I was disappointed to find no noticable improvement from my older razor, or at least no design improvements. For some reason I was hoping for something drastic to happen. I&#x27;m keeping it, but I consider it slow and mediocre, but at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> This razor can be used in the shower, with shaving cream and doing so it provides as close a shave as a regular razor. Used every day it gets dull in about 12 months.  Occasionally water gets into the mechanism and shortens the life. I generally replace it once a year, which is actually cheaper than buying most razor blades.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using Norelco 3head shavers since he started to shave. (He is now 75)  But after the blades kept coming thru the screen (it&#x27;s dangerous) We decided to try a name brand back an forth blade.  THIS IS FANTASTIC.  He loves it and he is&lt;br /&gt;now a  Panasonic shaver.  Oh it is loud, but at 75 who is going to tell him.</li>
            <li> OK is about as much as I care to contribute now. Nine nine nine nine nine nine nine more words.</li>
            <li> Hands down, the best razor I have ever owned! Shaves great, cleans easily, and it&#x27;s awesome shaving in a steamy shower or with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Love this shaver.  I&#x27;m getting a good, clean shave and the clean-up is easy.  I ordered the replacement Foil and Blade Set just to have on hand, but the foil is not showing any signs of wear so far.  At this point I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> I have been using shaver for about 2 months now and I really l like it. It shaves closer than any electric I have ever had (I&#x27;ve had 2 Brauns and a Remington). I also really like the wet/dry feature. I haven&#x27;t shaved with it wet yet but I like that I can clean it and rinse it with soap under water. That is convenient. I like the remaining battery display. It lasts about 10 shaves per charge for me so far. I replaced a Braun that I had for about 12 years. The battery was wearing out on that so instead of investing in a new foil I decided to get something new, Very happy with it so far!</li>
            <li> I get a really close and comfortable shaves when I use it with gel cream and water. The meter showing battery life is great.</li>
            <li> very simple very good</li>
            <li> I wanted to replace my 10-year-old Remington so I bought this item and was not impressed. It looks and feels like decent quality but overall it did not shave well. I do not think I have a particularly thick beard but this razor could not properly shave my neck. It might be that the foil-microscreen design doesn&#x27;t work that well for me. I will go back to a rotary. Also, it&#x27;s quite loud and my cat freaked out when I turned it on. At least I got a good laugh.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find an Electric razor that shaves well without jamming it into your face, and this one is no different.&lt;br /&gt;I find that I have to go back and forth over each area four or five times to get it to do the job. The good news is that when you do you end up with a decent shave. Decent, not great.</li>
            <li> This razor dosnt do the job and leaves stubble. Thought about returning but it&#x27;s better than cutting face up I guess.</li>
            <li> Excellent !!! Don&#x27;t waste your money on the Braun 7. I bought both and the Panasonic is significantly cheaper, shaves better, and is no where near as noisy as the Braun. It is also much lighter and easier to obtain that close shave.</li>
            <li> Thought I was getting a shaver that was like the one I  was replacing. It was not.</li>
            <li> Use it a fair amount.  Have to go over and over some areas to get it close, but, I have never owned one where that was not the case.  Worth what I paid, and would buy again.</li>
            <li> Finally an electric razor that my husband likes and will use...</li>
            <li> well.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;some... no good condition..</li>
            <li> It looks beautiful,easy to use,Perfect！！</li>
            <li> Got exactly what i expected and does nicely. Does not work when plugged in though.</li>
            <li> Beat the competition hands down. Compared against Norelco and Braun</li>
            <li> A previous model of the Panasonic ES8103 had given me excellent service since August 2008, but it stopped working a few days ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I shopped around, I found an updated version of this model on Amazon.com for about $72.  I like this design as it is quite small compared with the 3-head rotary shavers, and is therefore much more suitable for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver arrived yesterday and is working perfectly just as I expected.</li>
            <li> very nice shaver. 13,000 rpm makes a big difference. one small setback, the re-chargeable battery has to be unpluugged , when at 100%. or it drains the battery. had earlier model, where you didn&#x27;t have to unplug and it wouldn&#x27;t drain battery. you could leave it and forget it. this model it&#x27;s recommended that you unplug it, when at 100%.</li>
            <li> My sons first electric razor &amp; he loves it.</li>
            <li> The razor gives a close shave without irritating the skin.  I like the notice the razor gives when it needs to be cleaned.</li>
            <li> It was recommended in Top 10 Foil style electric shavers.  Top 10 because different site have different reviews, but the ones I saw, this one was in there, within the top.  It works great!  I don&#x27;t have a thick beard, nor do I grow one, but it is way faster than putting cream and using a blade.  Being able to use it in the shower is highly recommended when shopping for a shaver.  So much time saved.  It is quiet too.</li>
            <li> do like the fact that shaver tells you how much battery you have left.  for a low- to medium-priced electric razor it shaves OK.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy that can go a few days between shaves. Not sure why I waited until 40 to try an electric. I like it. It does not seem to shave as close as with a razor, but it&#x27;s close enough and is much easier so I shave more almost every day. You can use it wet or dry, so I can shave any time of the day. You don&#x27;t really need any cream either. The battery life is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HINT: To cheaply, easily clean, I bought Gillette fluid refills for their razor&#x27;s cleaning system. I simply submerge the head of this into that fluid and use the clean mode. Then rinse. It requires very little fluid if you use the protective cap that comes with this razor as the fluid reservoir.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver because i shave my head and read very positive reviews. The shaver exceeded my expectations. It is not only a very reasonable price, but I can comfortably get an extremely close shave which can only be exceeded by a razor.&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;ll take the very minor tradeoff for no cuts.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to clean as well.&lt;br /&gt;Wet/dry feature is very useful if you&#x27;re trying to save a little time by shaving in the shower. I find the dry shave pretty comfortable and it seems to get a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have one question out there for the experts: It says it is a 3 blade system. I only see two. Where&#x27;s the 3rd blade?</li>
            <li> This is the best electric razor I have ever had. Better than the 2 Brauns I have. They have officially been replaced with the Panasonic ES8103S--</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done traditional wet shaving for the last few years and was getting slightly tired of all the time it takes to shave properly. My neck hairs grow at a very close angle to my skin, so I always have some sort of irritation regardless of the shaving method. I decided to give the ES8103S a try and after about six weeks I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with it. The shave isn&#x27;t as close as what you get with wet shaving (as is expected), but I do notice the irritation on my neck has gone down considerably (though I don&#x27;t think it will ever go away totally). I&#x27;ll still have instances where irritation will flair up and I have to wait an extra day to shave again, but other than that the razor has been great. If you have irritation issues with your neck when you shave, consider giving this razor a try.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that I would recomend to anyone. Works great on my head as well as my beard.</li>
            <li> For nearly 30 years I&#x27;ve used electric razors - mostly the Panasonic or Norleco 3 circular blade style.  So I was not prepared for the amazing shave I get from this Arc3 wet/dry shaver.  I&#x27;ve used it for six weeks now and have experienced the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had in my life.  I have both my face and my head and the effect is the same everywhere.  The only con&#x27;s are some initial razor burn that goes away after a couple of weeks and (like other reviews) the battery does not last for more than a week for me.  But those are minor issues considering the amazing shave and smooth skin that results. I&#x27;m committed to this model for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> This model ES8103S shaves better than my old Panasonic model. The battery power lasts one week, and charges fast. It is easy to remove shaving head, which I rinse clean under running water once a week. The sound level is a bit higher in pitch than my old model.</li>
            <li> I saw the reviews on the shaver and  I  figured that I would get it as a gift for my husband. To my surprise he actually liked it :) I would definitely buy products like it. My husband said that the shaver works good and gives him that close shave that he likes.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this purchase. Excellent product, gives a close shave with no irratation. Holds a good charge highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought the same shaver about eight years ago and it&#x27;s still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a new one as a gift for my Dad.  It&#x27;s still the same well built shaver, good quality.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy another Panasonic shaver when it&#x27;s time to replace my old one.</li>
            <li> Lazy man&#x27;s friend.  I don&#x27;t like to shave and this really works very well, holds charge and can be used in the shower when the hair has been softened by the hot water.  I tried one many, many years ago and it pulled the hair out as much as it cut, so it took some time for me to give electric shavers another shot.  I&#x27;m happy with this and would recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> I bought this after several years of using an electric shaver.  This Panasonic cost less than my original shaver and is far superior to it.  I like the way the head moves and glides freely across the face, the easy cleaning method, the directions and the closeness of the shave (I have a heavy beard).</li>
            <li> i used to philips , but it is not so good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so, i change to new one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i saw it, i just take it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is very good</li>
            <li> Nice, smooth, close shave. Charge lasts about a week of shaving at least once per day. Easy to clean in shower.</li>
            <li> This razor is the best. Great foils for a close shave and a nice trimmer to buzz the rough off. If you have a beard or stubble. This ones for you.</li>
            <li> purchased this shaver cause all the good reviews I read.after using for 8 or 9 weeks gave it to goodwill.why? after like 8 shaves found not cutting close to my moustash and had to use a manual blade. noticed all around my chin getting lousy shave so took 3 times longer working the shaver in that area and still a rotten shave .then below my ears had long hairs growing no matter what I did wouldn&#x27;t touch them so again manual blade . shaving taking 3 times longer and still getting a lousy shave.after like 6 wks. pulled apart outer foil blades [following insructions] to clean. thinking a through cleaning would help.now the shave was worse than ever bad enough to buy another electric razor.i&#x27;m retired and have used electric razors since 16 yrs. old.this by far was the worst electric razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This is a gift to my father, my father very like it, great.The next would recommend others to buy it.</li>
            <li> The high pitched whine it gives off is indicative of its effectiveness. A++++++ WOULD SHAVE WITH AGAIN. 3 more words required.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now on a blood thinner, so I had to go to an electric razor.  I haven&#x27;t mastered the razor yet, but expect it to get better.</li>
            <li> This razor works well enough for me as long as I shave every couple of days. If I wait longer than that it leaves patches of hair on my lower chin no matter how many times I go over the area. Even when I shave every couple of days I have to use a razor to make sure I get clean shave. Still it&#x27;s faster and cleaner than shaving with a razor because I can shave in the shower. That&#x27;s a big plus for me. It charges quickly and the battery life is quite good. This is the first electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it too.&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the convenience it affords me. I wish, however, that I got a clean shave without having to use a second razor. This would  probably work well for men who shave every day.</li>
            <li> Always used an electric rotary razor until mine died (fell apart) while visiting my parents. I used my Dad&#x27;s Panasonic ES8103S and liked it so much I bought one. No regrets. Very close shave too.</li>
            <li> Only about three weeks into using this razor but it is hands down better than any of the others I have owned (all other major brands). Provides a very close and smooth shave. I have tried both wet and dry and I am completely satisfied with both. I have had no issues with the power display and charging is quick.</li>
            <li> Great shave! Easy to use and give a close, clean shave. It also is a snap to clean it when needed.</li>
            <li> I bought this almost exactly 2 years ago. It worked well enough, better than my previous shavers. Easy to clean. The charge lasted about a week, which was okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got it I did think it seemed like it was made of cheaper plastic than previous shavers. Finally after 2 years the top piece that fits over the blades, which you remove to clean, broke off and can&#x27;t be reattached. Really, I would expect a better build quality. But everything seems to be pretty much disposable anymore, even the more expensive models. Matter of opinion how much you should spend if they need to be replaced every few years.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic ES8103S shaver is the worst I&#x27;ve ever used of the many I&#x27;ve had now at age 59. I&#x27;ve had shavers at less than half the cost that worked much better. I&#x27;m the type that has very little to shave, only mustache area, chin and neck, couldn&#x27;t grow a beard if I tried, and it couldn&#x27;t even handle that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sound this thing makes is terrible, very unusual, reminds me of some kind of alarm you would hear, nothing like any foil or rotary shaver I&#x27;ve had, very annoying and loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use shavers wet so just used it in dry mode. A very uncomfortable shave, like it&#x27;s grabbing whiskers and very hard to smoothly move across face, like it&#x27;s dull but it didn&#x27;t look used since all package seals were intact. After several passes over one area, it wouldn&#x27;t give a smooth shave, it might eventually but gave up as my old foil shaver worked much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this electric shaver for some time now. Works great in or out of the shower. I  recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is an inferior product. It takes longer than a normal shave and you will have to shave with a normal razor once you are done to get all the random whiskers that this shaver cannot get.</li>
            <li> purchased for husband and he loves the shave he gets. He has thick growth and this makes his face very smooth without any pulling or abrasion.</li>
            <li> NOT FOR MY HUSBANDS BEARD</li>
            <li> I enjoy the fact that this makes it much more convenient to keep my stubble off my face. It shaves (hah) off more than 1/2 of the time off of my previous shaving time, and does it much cleaner and more consistant than my disposable shaver. I get less scratches, now that I reflect I think I was pretty terrible with a disposable. Always had hanging hairs, and I didn&#x27;t like using shaving cream either. Even though the electric is significantly more expensive, the time saved, for the great look and feel, gives me the impression that it&#x27;s worth it in the long run. Seriously, saving time can offset so many things! And you can bring it into the shower. It&#x27;s not good for manscaping (tried it) so don&#x27;t get it if you plan on doing that. Maybe the trimmer extra could do some manscaping.&lt;br /&gt;The battery is amazing for me, I have light amounts of facial hair and I get 2+ weeks with one charge. I usually finish shaving in &lt;3 min, every 2 days. And I have owned this for about one month.</li>
            <li> Have used Electric razors in the past But to get a close shave, I would have to use a blade razor . This Is better than eitherone. Great Razor</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a replacement for a Braun series 5 razor, as the plug stopped working.  Unfortunately, it was a discontinuted plug style, so I wasn&#x27;t able to find a replacement at a reasonable price.  I have used a Braun electric razors for the past 12 years, and have been quite pleased with how they worked.  Unfortunately, I wasn&#x27;t expecting to need a new razor ASAP, and didn&#x27;t have a large amount of money to spend on the replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at the Sensotouch, but as I used the three circular blade arrangement on a Norelco shaver before I moved to Braun, I had found that the razor&#x27;s blade arrangement worked far better for me.  Also, I found a fantastic review someone wrote about the different electrics under Sensotouch &amp; the Arc 4 review section...which is worth a view if you want to go deeper.  Knowing this, and knowing my price points, I started my own research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, I found out that Braun had made some changes and their quality had decreased over the last few years.  This, combined with their top tier pricing, simply made them too expensive of a risk for me to take.  I looked at the new Arc 4 options for Panasonic, and while they have good reviews, I found out that the replacement blades were very expensive, and didn&#x27;t make a large enough difference in the shave to warrant the price.  Therefore, I settled on this version for a very reasonable price and I&#x27;ve been happy so far (been using it about a month).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Efficient - It does the job quickly.  You can tell that the 13,000 RPM motor makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;Quick Charge - I haven&#x27;t watched it extremely closely, but it seems to charge in a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;Build Quality - For the price (I got it with a $15 discount coupon through Amazon), it is a very high quality razor.&lt;br /&gt;Wet/Dry - I like the fact that I can clean it with water, as opposed to the expensive Braun alcohol cleaning system.  I haven&#x27;t used it for actual wet shaving with foam (which may helpwith stragglers, see in Cons), but it&#x27;s still neat relative by my Braun.&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer - While the placement is odd, it works better than any other trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had on an electric razor (including my $200+ previous razor).  It works VERY well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Loud - Yes, it&#x27;s loud, but less loud than my Braun.  For me, it&#x27;s no big deal, but if guys are REALLY that sensitive, this makes some noise.&lt;br /&gt;Charge Doesn&#x27;t Hold - It&#x27;s odd, but it seems like the charge dissipates on it&#x27;s own quite quickly.  Say, maybe about 20% every 3-4 days.  That may not be a big deal for me as I keep it plugged in, and am anal about bringing a charger, but it is strange as my Braun held charges forever.&lt;br /&gt;Not  Heavy Duty - This is a minor irritation for me, but I find that this misses about 5-6 neck hairs each time.  I have to look in the mirror, use the trimmer to shorten them, and then clean it up.  It isn&#x27;t the end of the world, but it is surprising.  I can&#x27;t seem to understand why it can be so great on all the other hairs, but not be able to get those last hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like the shaver, and am pleased with how it has worked for me so far.  If you have very thick strong beard hair like I do, be prepared to check in the mirror for stragglers after a good shave...at least if you shave dry like I do.</li>
            <li> Why I chose this rating:&lt;br /&gt;The title of my review says it all. After 1 month and 5 days of use it stopped recharging. I never had this product in the shower so it cannot be due to water. Also, when shaving with this electric shaver it constantly pulls hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Shaving with this thing is the most painful activity I have ever attempted in my life. ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the sideburn trimmer, it was a neat feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To who would I recommend this&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone, unless you&#x27;re looking for that &#x27;special&#x27; gift to your father in law. Before this shaver I had a $20 Remington that worked for years (it still works, but the blades are so dull it pulls my hairs like this shaver does brand new), which is what compelled me to purchase a more expensive one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion would be to find another electric shaver on amazon.com</li>
            <li> Except a little noisy when I use it, everything else is very wonderful. Charging is very quick. I love it.</li>
            <li> I have replaced another panasonic 8103, which I have had for years. This new one does not give me as close a shave as I would like, even though I have given it 30 days and used only that razor, just panasonic instructed.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic is like a Maserati compared to my old shaver (a dump truck). It&#x27;s very versatile and does a pretty good job, overall.&lt;br /&gt;If you have a tough beard and sensitive skin, you might not be 100% happy. And the trimmer tickles me (yeah, I know)&lt;br /&gt;Quick charging and lots of shaves on one charge (and the display counts down the charge remaining in 10% increments-cool).&lt;br /&gt;Good value overall, I think, and it looks good, too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor for my husband who swore he&#x27;d never use an electric shaver.  He agreed to try it and now it is all he uses.  What more can I say???  His actions say it all!</li>
            <li> It works marginally better than my previous rotatory shaver (Norelco) whose battery charging mechanism did not work well as it failed to retain a charge for very long.  Both fell short of shaving with a razor but with aging skin that has become much more sensitive to nicks and cuts, there is a greater reliance on electric razors.</li>
            <li> I am a young engineer who dresses well, smells good and likes to be clean and trimmed. I am so impressed by the quality and styling of this product and by the smooth shave it gives me. I don&#x27;t like scrubs or a beard and like to have the clean shaved look since it matches with my personality. But the time to shave everyday, the burning feeling and the expensive blades made me think about trying one of these. I remember seeing an ad about this shaver a while ago. But didn&#x27;t quite catch the name. I was about to go with one of those rotary shavers. But I read that foil shavers shave smoother than rotary ones and I read through many reviews. At last I ended up with two options. Remington F5-5800 and Panasonic ES8103S Arc3. I read that this one gives a much smoother shave than Remington, even though Remington works better in the neck area. I went with this one and I am glad I did. The shaver got fully charged in an hour and it says on the manual that it is good for 45 shaves. My face looks just like I had a shave with the Gillet razor minus no burning and not much time spent. It takes some care to shave the neck though. That, I believe I will get better with practice. If you&#x27;re a little lazy, busy and smart like me :), I strongly recommend this product !</li>
            <li> I use my shaver with shaving cream.  Finally an electric shaver I like after 30 years.</li>
            <li> Does what its suppose to do.</li>
            <li> This has been a good shaver for me, a woman, for my legs and arms. I have had several models for women, mostly from Panasonic, but they aren&#x27;t as well made and just do not last as long in my experience as the men&#x27;s. So, I purchased this one and it is still going strong and has a long battery life. The pop-up trimmer is nice for the when the leg hairs are a bit longer than other times, as it whacks them down better in that mode. Then, I finish with the regular head to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully, especially dry. This is the only design of electric razor I have found that does not leave me with horrible razor burn. It still has some trouble around the neck, but my next razor will be a Panasonic for certain.</li>
            <li> This replaces a ES8243A I bought in 2010 that is in need of a cutter, foil and probably a battery.  It costs about the same as changing the parts in my old shaver and works about the same.  It has a narrower head, so it is better and getting into tight places.  I shave my head with it too.</li>
            <li> Its okay didnt shave any better after I bought new blade and screen. I bought this June 2013 and switched to the Remington F-5700 May 2015 and I get a much better shave and it just works better with or without charging cord.</li>
            <li> Havent bought a shaver in years. Saw this on sale so I jumped on it. The 2K+ reviews on it with 4.5 stars cant be ignored. Ive used it once so far and it went great. Not pulling of hairs and it glided like butter. Plan on buying the square trade warranty. Its only $7.99 for 2 years, or $10.99 for 3 years. I think its worth it IMO. Look them up. Theres no deductible or anything.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver I have ever owned. I have only had it about a month so I don&#x27;t know its reliability yet, but it works fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and a beard that grows in many different directions.  The foil makes a blunt perpendicular above surface cut on the whisker where rotary and blades lift and cut at angles.  If you have a tendency for in-growns this doesn&#x27;t help.  It will take a week or 2 for your face to adjust and the lotion will help.  Electric razors in general require daily use over a blade which might let you skip a day depending on your beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer a dry shave and I follow it with lotion that has touch of hyrocortisone in it.  It can be bought over the counter you just have to look for it.  I use Lotrimin HCL -your pharmacist can order it for you or it is easily found on line.  My shave is closer than a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you suffer like me the Arc 3 will help you - The bigger head really reduced shave time to my last Panasonic and it goes a week with out a charge plus being wet dry gives you easy cleaning or the ability of a wet shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy into all the gimmicks - Buy this razor first -it can be bought for under $80 w/ free shipping on Amazon.  If you want more, Panasonic offers a 30 day guarantee and you can try one of their more expensive self cleaning units.  However, if you have sensitive skin I would stray away from the 4 foil.</li>
            <li> This is much better than using a razor.  I always would cut myself the first few times using a razor no matter how careful I was,  Now I can shave anywhere I want and it is safe and comfortable. It is also easy to clean.  It is a little hard to shave around my chin.</li>
            <li> It met my every expectation and surpassed it.  So says my husband that I bought it for.  A very nice smooth shave and works great.</li>
            <li> i was very very pleased with the product.  i would highly reccomend this product to anyone that is interested in an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> This razor does not give near the close shave then our less expensive rotary razor did.  I purchased this based on other reviews and even though it is a well built razor, the closeness of the shave is not very good.  I would recommend a rotary over this one.</li>
            <li> I love it. I could not wait to write a review so with that being said... I hope it lasts long.</li>
            <li> My husband couldn&#x27;t believe what a close shave he got.</li>
            <li> My husband had never liked using an electric razor.  Now that he suffers from dementia I needed to know that I could help him.&lt;br /&gt;I researched using many of the reviews of razors and decided from one particular review by a fellow that compared two shavers in a very lengthy review that this was the best deal for us.&lt;br /&gt;My husband loves it and delights in such an easy and quick way to shave and I know that I could use it on him if it ever comes to that.</li>
            <li> Great product replaces my Braun</li>
            <li> You want the best, then get the best. This shaver really works.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be sorry. You should buy two.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver for the price that I have ever had and I&#x27;m 89 yrs old!!  It shaves closely and smoothly and  it couldn&#x27;t be better. I would definately reccomend this shaver to a friend or anybody else for that matter.  A good buy..</li>
            <li> Gentle on my husband&#x27;s skin, easy to use, and delivers a clean and close shave.</li>
            <li> Believe the reviews. This is the second electric shaver I have used and I can&#x27;t believe how well it works. Works best wet with shaving cream.Can&#x27;t beat the price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Panasonic razor. I usually get a new razor every year (in the past I had terrible issues with losing cords or charge stands). It was always a simple xmas or bday gift to ask for. I also switch back and forth from straight razors to electrics, depending on time and how close I want to shave. Not again. I love this razor. I had been turned off by non-rotary razors due to bad experiences in the past. So glad I took a chance on this one! No pulling of hair. No pain. I shave daily and ask alot of my razor. It may be hard to believe but I actually received a closer shave with this than my normal straight blade, and I wasn&#x27;t even using the wet-shave option. An now, many months later, it works as well as the day I first used it. My fiancee works in an assisted living environment, and I recommended this razor for shaving the residents who complain alot about the ones they use now. I have also recommended this to my friends and family. My only complaint is it can&#x27;t be used while charging, Though with the very quick charge time, it&#x27;s not much to complain about. Don&#x27;t be turned away by the price. It&#x27;s worth every penny. Great product!!</li>
            <li> GIVES A GOOD SHAVE . AS MOST ELECTRIC SHAVERS IT DOES HAVE A PROBLEM UNDER THE CHIN AND ON THE NECK. BUT OTHERWISE IT DOES WELL.</li>
            <li> For one thing, it is very noisy.  I still use my Norelco for the first time around, and the Panasonic to finish the job.  It gives a very close shave, but not as fast as my Norelco.  Unlike my Norelco, once the battery is dead, it will not run when pluged in.&lt;br /&gt;I give it a 9 on a 1 to 10 scale..</li>
            <li> This Panasonic had good reviews - but I find that is takes longer to shave than the cheaper shaver it replaced. It does best if you use daily. A couple days stubble, it seems to miss patches.</li>
            <li> Gives me a nice, close shave without all of the irritation that I usually get from going &amp;#34;against the grain&amp;#34; with a manual razor. I have used it three times so far and have not felt any pulling or irritation while shaving. The one drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t always get every hair. I end up having to make several passes in all different directions, and even then there are a few hairs left behind.</li>
            <li> Reasonably close. Holds charge well.  Fits hand and no scrapes. I think it will last a long time. For the price a very good buy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for ways to mitigate the daily shaving ritual for years. I like blade-close shaves, and electrics never worked for me, generally making my face feel as though it had suffered a bird stampede. This product, though, works reasonably well and is the best blade substitute I&#x27;ve found. It took a week or to to figure out how to make it work at it&#x27;s best, but I now use it more often than a blade.</li>
            <li> I used my Panasonic ES8103 put me not adapted to the type of blade, because my beard is very sawn and difficult to make, in the area next to the nose is also difficult to remove the beard. I&#x27;m going back to my Philips Norelco so I have to buy a new set of blades. The Panasonic ES8103 will try to sell when returning to my home in Brazil.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve owned a wide variety of electric razors.  After using this one awhile, I can say this is unquestionably the best of the bunch.</li>
            <li> this shaver works couldnt stand using a razor anymore so i wanted to try an electric shaver that wasnt crazy expensive and this is the one i got and it is awesome</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE USED ELECTRIC SHAVERS FOR YEARS, AFTER USING THIS ES8103S FOR SOME TIME TO GIVE IT A FAIR CHANCE I WILL GO BACK TO THE 3 HEADED ROUND SHAVER.</li>
            <li> I transitioned to a 3 straight blade foil system. It cuts the hair smoother and doesn&#x27;t chew up the skin on my face. It cleans well and the charge lasts for a long time. The razor also charges fast. I always trust in Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Works very well. this razor replace my Braun model 7526 and i must say I am very impressed</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know where all the negative reviews are coming from but this razor is everything I expected. I charged it to 100% and have shaved 4 times and it still reads 100%. It is not noisy and gives a close shave without irritating my skin, especially on the neck.</li>
            <li> I like my Norelco better, but then again, that cost $80. I bought this at $55, I think it is way overpriced.  You would think this brand new shaver would beat out a 5 year old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The issues....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It takes more than multiple passes to shave. This is usually an issue with most electric shavers, but this one take A LOT of passes. If you just have some stuble, this shaver sucks. You need grow it out a little before it becomes effective. If you are a clean cut guy who does not like the been up for 5 days straight rock star look, then avoid this since you will have to grow it like that for this shaver to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It does not shave that close at all. Of course, this means no irritated skin, which is a good thing. But that means it does not shave close at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The battery seems to go pretty fast. One session of shaving is about 20%-30% of battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. You cannot plug it in and use it at the same time.....Usually it&#x27;s you can plug it in and use it at the same time (but it will not charge will you use it). With this unit, it can only charge when plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. It is pretty dam loud.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over 2 years and it still shaves as well as day one. I would say that the quality of the shave is appropriate to the price level (which is in the middle). A charge lasts several weeks and cleaning the blades is simple since this is a wet/dry shaver.  I own cheaper and more expensive electric shavers but this own has outlasted them all. Sure, there are all sorts of self cleaning shavers out there with plenty of fancy schmancy options but it&#x27;s just hard for me to justify the significant difference in price. I am very happy with this shaver and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good electric shaver at a fair price.</li>
            <li> this Panasonic replaces one I&#x27;ve had for 5 years-with this one I get a closer shave and it&#x27;s twice as quiet , another good feature this razor let&#x27;s you know how much of a charge is left</li>
            <li> Did not do a good job,so sent it back.Sorry!!</li>
            <li> works well close shave with either wet or dry application</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work well for my husband had to send it back</li>
            <li> Shaves close and very easy to clean. Difficult to shave some spots but I&#x27;ve had those problems with all razors.</li>
            <li> sooth cut &amp; soft sound</li>
            <li> After trying several razors, My hubby like this one the best :)</li>
            <li> it sucks. does not shave properly. 20$ shavers perform better. I want my money back.</li>
            <li> Have now used this shaver for close to a year and am very pleased with its performance. Holds a charge well and is really easy to clean. Not as close as shaving with a razor but also not as much of a hassle. even though I recently bought a replacement foil and blades I have not replaced them as I am still getting as good a shave as when I first bought it. LCD screen is really a great feature for letting me know when to recharge instead of it going dead in the middle of shaving. The shaver also has a very fast recharging rate with it receiving a full charge in under 30 to 45 minutes. I am very happy with this shaver and would not hesitate to buy another if necessary.</li>
            <li> I have had for over a year now. Holding up great. Gives a nice shave.</li>
            <li> My husband was so very happy to receive his shaver. He had gone back to a standard razor because his old electric one was just worn out and too old to get replacement parts. He used this one right away (it arrived fully charged) and thought it was great. His brother has an identical one and highly recommended that I buy the same for my husband.</li>
            <li> Good quality razor.  Although, it doesn&#x27;t work that smooth on a wet face.  It&#x27;s nice to be able to rinse it off when done.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my son last year, and also bought a Norelco PT730 for myself. This shaver delivers a nice clean shave, very efficiently, without any pulling or skin burn. I have a light beard and so I only shave twice a week so the stubble is quite long when I shave. This shaver had no problem with the longer stubble. Now, it has some downsides, first of all it&#x27;s LOUD AS HELL compared to the Norelco. Nobody in the house will sleep through your morning shave with this baby. Also, it goes through the battery in a couple shaves. Lastly, it fell of the bathroom countertop once, the trimmer popped open and a little piece of plastic flew out. That was the end of the trimmer. We sent it back and had a replacement in a couple weeks. No problem.&lt;br /&gt;By comparison, the Norelco was whisper quiet, the battery live was 10 times longer despite the fact that with the longer stubble it took the Norelco twice as long to deliver the same shave as the Panasonic. The Norelco had to make numerous passes over the same long stubble to clean it all up, but eventually it got there, and it&#x27;s so quiet that nobody sleeping would care how long you kept at it. Both good shavers, depends what your requirements are.&lt;br /&gt;You need to have a way to charge the Panasonic every couple shaves, whereas the Norelco could get you through a week&#x27;s worth of shaving on one charge easily.</li>
            <li> This is not the best electric shaver I have ever used but it gets the job done. One complaint I have is that it only works in cordless mode. When it&#x27;s plugged in (recharge mode) it doesn&#x27;t work so keep an eye on the battery life light.</li>
            <li> I always used a triple header rotary shaver before this one. I like this much better. It is quicker and shaves closer, I think. The charge lasts a little over a week.</li>
            <li> Nice shaver. I use it almost daily.</li>
            <li> Close and smooth shave. Battery is not as heavy duty as much older units. Charge dissipates quicker.</li>
            <li> The trimmer nestled between the two blades has significantly decreased the amount of time I spend shaving. Previously, on long hairs, I had to trim and then shave. All in one, now! Amazon is recommending I buy this again: I would, but don&#x27;t need to yet because my last Panasonic Wet/Dry shaver lasted 10 years. This one is well on it&#x27;s way to performing the same. Hence why--when it was time to replace--I considered nothing else.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving. There, I said it. Even with trendy retro double-edged safety razors. Trouble is, I can&#x27;t grow a beard to save my life. [PICTURE NOT FOUND]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept looking at electric razors, hoping one would bridge the gap of well-received and not arm-and-leg-expensive. This has been great so far (3 months of every-other-day shaves or so).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I just need to buy a second one for my wife so she stops doing leg-hair touchups with mine.</li>
            <li> Worked well with no problems....  Loved the price</li>
            <li> I assume you all know this, but be sure to plug in and charge first.</li>
            <li> Awesome razor! I have a very thick beard and have always had a hard time getting a close shave. I haven&#x27;t been using the razor long and it seems to working great.</li>
            <li> Great product but it needs a more flexible head. Rather difficult in shaving under the chin area.</li>
            <li> So far it works really well.</li>
            <li> Great buy and great product</li>
            <li> My cheaper shavers work better then this one</li>
            <li> Shaves much better than the Norelco I had.  Plus you can water rinse the head and also runs with cord plugged in.</li>
            <li> Owned this for a couple of years and still has great battery life and provides quick electric shaving dry or wet! Happy with this one. Highly Recommend</li>
            <li> Good close shave and easy to clean.  Much better then my previous Braun shaver.  Like the display that tells you what the charge level is and when it&#x27;s time to clean the shaver.  Highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love it. Close shave and better than my Braun series 3. Very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I love this thing. I use it on my head as well as my face. It makes shaving so easy.</li>
            <li> The only thing I was not impressed by was the closeness of the shave. However I have never shaved with a electric shaver before so this may just be transition from razor to electric shaver.  Overall this is a great product, even the trimmer works surprisingly well which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> Does reasonably good job especially when used with shaving cream.  Improvement over my old rotary. When i need a really close shave, I do use regular razor but for everyday use this works well.  Most days I use it dry</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with a Panasonic ES8066 for the last zillion years and it has served me very well.  Then I thought, maybe  shaver technology has improved since then (duh).  Boy has it.  A lot.  I wish I had made this change sooner.  Stiil, I expect to keep this gem for the next zillion years.  One note, I found this item @ Fry.com for $10 less than Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very nice shaver, very good price on Amazon, very close and comfortable shave. Shaver works very well with the nonotech blades system and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and turn it all red like my old norelco rotary shaver , very satisfied with purchase if the shaver holds up for a couple of years will definitely stick to Panasonic!</li>
            <li> Have been a Braun user for &gt; 15 years (3 series) but wanted to try something different and chose this product based on reviews. I think it&#x27;s better than the Brauns I&#x27;ve used. Like the higher \\&quot;rpm\\&quot; and the general feel and ease of use and cleaning.</li>
            <li> Love this shaver, best I have ever had. This shaver makes trimming around my beard a breeze. The shave is fast and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I have thick, dark hair, and shave my whole head daily.  I use wet shaving techniques: badger brush from Parker Safety, Proraso Green soap, plus Shave Secret as a pre-shave.  As far as a razor, I use my S4 Eclipse headblade, and a Double Edge for my face.  I never get razor burn or bumps from this method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, I began to break out on my face and the sides of my head (non-razor bumps, mainly acne).  Most likely it is related to allergies, but I needed a shaving solution in the mean time.  I research electric razors, and found that most guys had success with the Panasonic Linear series, mainly due to the high speed of the blades.  So I purchased one at a discounted price from a department store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The verdict:  The shave is extremely close.  It is almost... and I mean so very almost as close as shaving with a razor blade against the grain.  In fact, unless you stretch out your skin to feel stubble, you can&#x27;t tell.  The best part is the fact that it does not irritate my skin at all.  My bumps have completely cleared up in the three days I have used it.  It works well with a pre-shave oil, Proraso, and my badger brush, though I would recommend making the lather a tad bit more watery than usual to allow the razor to glide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works good dry as well- I went over my face bumps without lather or water and they did not flare up.  However, this shaver is way better when used wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would urge you to purchase one.  It&#x27;s perfect for head shaving (my scalp hair is thicker than anyone&#x27;s beard I promise), as well as face shaving.  This model is a great price point, and it works fine, though I wouldn&#x27;t go for one that has a speed of less than 13,000 (which is what this model has).  I will be a panasonic user for life and plan on buying a more expensive model when the time comes for replacement.  I am beyond happy.  It is just as amazing as my headblade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 9-18-2012:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still working fine.  I would recommend changing your shaving routine if you are still having problems, or have problems with sensitive skin.  I bought Thayers Lavender Witch Hazel to use as an after shave, and it is possibly the best after shave you can buy.  My allergy bumps have almost 99.99% cleared up, and the few remaining are constantly shrinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I most likely will be using an electric razor on my head for the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used Lab Series Electric Shave enhancer.  If you enjoy a dry shave, it helps a lot.  However, I do not believe that it is better than a pre-shave oil and a shaving cream such as Proraso.</li>
            <li> Incredibly close shave. No pulling of hairs like with the rotary shavers</li>
            <li> I have used many different types and brands of electric razor, and this is the best one I have had.  Gives a close enough shave, and does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas present for my husband and he really loves it ..... It&#x27;s very convenient for his everyday shaving</li>
            <li> wonderful instrument, as advertised</li>
            <li> Although I like the way this razor handles and recharges quickly, bottom line is it does not give as close a shave as my old Norelco. Probably spend at least an extra 2 minutes each day working at it. Also cleaning instructions are confusing.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I have extremely sensitive skin so I have all but given up on razor shaving, it always makes my skin scaly, blotchy and red (a real eyesore and sometimes painful).  So I gave the Braun Series 7 shaver a try about 5 years ago and it gave me razor burn on my neck (gave it 30 days).  I have a fairly light beard but the hairs on my neck/under chin are pretty dense.  I have been using just an electric beard trimmer to \\&quot;shave\\&quot; for the last couple years and obviously it does not get close nor is it intended to.  I had an interview coming up so I decided to try electric again and with the reviews on this device I thought \\&quot;why not?\\&quot;.  After about 2 weeks of use and using only about 3x/week here are my observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;-I don&#x27;t mind the higher pitch hum at all, definitely not noisy enough to complain and I have very sensitive ears.  Lot of reviews on \\&quot;hear\\&quot; indicate that is a problem, it is not IMHO.&lt;br /&gt;-Shaves closer than any other electric I&#x27;ve owned hands down and I&#x27;ve owned several Brauns, several Norelco&#x27;s. ***But see cons.&lt;br /&gt;-Does not give me razor burn or irritation on any part of my face (I use Remington FaceSaver).&lt;br /&gt;-Charges very quick (about 1 hour) or a quick 5 min charge is possible.&lt;br /&gt;-Nice LED display displays % of charge remaining making it easy power management.&lt;br /&gt;-Best cleanup of any shaver out there (Panasonic in general), very cost effective (soap/water) and very quick.&lt;br /&gt;-Wet/Dry is a plus for clean up by I&#x27;m skeptical of using shaving cream to shave with electric.  Nonetheless, wet/dry gives it more versatility than other razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;-takes quite a bit of time to shave, to me the advantage of electric is the ability to shave in under 10 mins.  This typically takes about 10-12 mins for me to shave.&lt;br /&gt;-takes a lot of passings to get a close shave (see above).&lt;br /&gt;-Long(er) hairs are not easy to cut.  If you go without shaving for 2-4 days it has a harder time with that length of hair.  The side trimmer is helpful with longer hairs but does not completely solve the problem.&lt;br /&gt;-Side trimmer is not engineered properly so you can see where you are cutting, creates a \\&quot;blind spot\\&quot; and is a guessing game where you are shaving.&lt;br /&gt;-Does a very good job of shaving under chin but struggles mightily at shaving north/south below side burns.  I end up using a straight razor to get the 2 inches below my sideburns straight and clean every time since this is very poor at shaving in this area in particular.  This creates more time/cleanup time shaving which is what we are all trying to mitigate.&lt;br /&gt;-Because shaves take so long this does not hold enough charge for two weeks of shaves, which it advertises.  More like 1 week&#x27;s worth of shaves (3x/week) which is pretty sub-standard.&lt;br /&gt;-Need to allow corded shaving, this is a must for any good shaver in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think is a slightly above shaver but I am captivated enough to try their Arc IV which adds an additional blade with the hopes it will take less passings to shave.  I will be returning this within 30 days and looking for a Black Friday deal for a Arc IV since the 4th blade adds quite a bit in price (questionable value for 4 blades).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has any tips or best practices for the shaver please let me know (particularly shaving below side burns and creating a straight side-burn end).  As Bill Murray/Harold Ramis once said, I want to be a fan of this shaver \\&quot;but I am willing to learn\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps...th of hair.

            <li> It&#x27;s ugly, I do not like this new faux chrome look mens grooming tools are taking. It fits the hand well enough yet I found my fingers wanting to slide up to the pivoting head. It works well in the shower or with a gel, and the shave is smoother than my rotary triple head - so far.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what all these people are raving about. This machine is not for tough beards that grow in different directions in whirlwind patterns or for beards that are dry and curly (like mine :(...) I tried it on my arm hair and it took it out just fine. I tried it on my face, ugghhh! mission impossible! I gotta do like 5 passes to get it to look at the very least like 5 oclock shadow, and that was with the wet shave! I thought perhaps I got a defective device, but that is not the case because I gave to my dad to try (who has fine straight oily beard, that grows in one direction and isn&#x27;t as thick as mine..... is he my father? lol must&#x27;ve got it from my moms side of the family; not that she has a beard..lol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I give it one star because it didn&#x27;t work for me. So if you have a tough beard like mine, I would not recommend this, stick to shaving with mach 3 or fusion or whatever expensive cartridge blade of your choice. My dad would give this 4 stars, because it worked for him.</li>
            <li> I just bought this and it gives an excellent shave. But the instruction manual (and another&lt;br /&gt;review here) suggests it may be a disposable razor. Specifically,the manual seems to&lt;br /&gt;imply that once the battery dies it can not be replaced. Nor,apparently can the razor&lt;br /&gt;by run directly from the AC outlet then. If this is true,then the item is an expensive&lt;br /&gt;one. I would recommend the manufacturer modify it to allow it to run on 110/220 AC&lt;br /&gt;as well as battery. This option should be included for any battery powered device&lt;br /&gt;(my Waterpik just gave up the ghost-the battery can no longer be recharged,and it&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t work off the wall AC)</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my shaver, it gives me a good shave and I also like the cleaning part. It cleans it self, and can use it with or without shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Have purchased many Panasonic shavers for my guys over the years. This one is no different: they like it, well, as much as they like to shave.</li>
            <li> Works great. Very smooth and battery lasts. Why did I wait</li>
            <li> Having never used an electric razor I was tired of spending my money on blades, shave cream and bandages so I thought I&#x27;d try an electric, the first in my 68 years. I use it in the shower , wet, and just love it</li>
            <li> This is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned. It shaves almost as close as a blade (no electric has ever shaved 100% as close as a blade, but this one comes very close). As I age and my skin changes, I was getting a few nicks and cuts with a blade, so I switched to the Panasonic. I like it better than the Norelco I owned before. Try it, you might switch, too.</li>
            <li> This thing opened my eyes to the 21st century... I HAVENT USED A RAZOR since then.&lt;br /&gt;I am a military member and I suffer the curse of the 9am shadow (i wake up at 4am)&lt;br /&gt;this thing made my morning routine less painful. I really love the quality and closeness of shave.&lt;br /&gt;I dont use it &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; because im afraid i might break it. It does its job just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUPERB!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned two of these razors.  The first lasted four years with no problems but suddenly died.  I replaced it with the same model which lasted 8 months then died suddenly as well.  For the price, this is a good value if it lasts a few years but I&#x27;ve purchased a Braun instead based on reviews of long life and high reliability.</li>
            <li> Gives a great shave.  Always have used a blade but this razor gives a close shave also.  I use it with my shaving cream and makes for a great shave</li>
            <li> I have not bought an electric shaver for 10 years.  The technology has really improved. The Panasonic ES8103S  produces a shave that is very close to that of a razor. It is quicker with no soap or shave cream required. Very quick recharge is a bonus.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver...I ordered one about a year ago and it is does the job...ordered this for a gift.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best price you can get.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver as a replacement for another Panasonic linear shaver. I briefly considered a Norelco and a Braun. For the money, this shaver was the best value. I use it to shave my head as well as my face so I give my shaver a workout. My previous shaver lasted about 4 years. I consider that very good longevity because of the double duty it performed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the performance of this unit as well. Plus it is quieter. I can recommend this unit highly.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver that I think gives a good shave in a reasonable length of time. I have use blades my entire life and have tried several brands and types of electric shavers. Was never satisfied. This one does an excellent job from day one. Like it best wet using shave cream.</li>
            <li> OMG, WHAT A TERRIFIC RAZOR/SHAVER!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;My husband has had a Panasonic for more than a decade +, and I have hunted for the same Brand and type with same I.D. Number to no avail. (Do not make them anymore &amp; blades/screens, w/h/b the same as a cheap one of this Brand).&lt;br /&gt;We couldn&#x27;t afford the (Arc5), I believe it was rated as Best &amp; most expensive. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, these are WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!!  However, you must live within your means in today&#x27;s poor economy.&lt;br /&gt;So I watched a couple weeks before Black Friday, to see what was coming on sale, and Wah-lah, this one came on sale so I could afford it, &amp; I snatched it up quick like too!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Seller, good packaging, quick service in getting here quickly, and most of all it is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the seller &amp; most of all the Panasonic product any day of the week.&lt;br /&gt;It is ALL good!!!!!</li>
            <li> Closest shave to a blade razor I have ever experienced from electric shavers. No biting or pinching and very quiet.</li>
            <li> Very good quality men&#x27;s shaver!</li>
            <li> Great shaver for a great price!</li>
            <li> I never used electric shavers&lt;br /&gt;any time I bought the electric shavers&lt;br /&gt;they would break on me after a while&lt;br /&gt;I bought the panasonic 3 years ago ,&lt;br /&gt;and it still shaves like its new I replaced&lt;br /&gt;the blade once in 3 years .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think its a good product.</li>
            <li> Received this from my wife last Christmas.  I have very sensitive skin but this razor doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate my face like most razors (wet and dry) do.  After a year of use and the blades a still quite sharp and the battery is holding up nicely, I get 4 or 5 shaves on a single charge.  Bought another one for my brother-in-law this Christmas.</li>
            <li> Shaves closely.  Lightweight.  Charges very fast.  Has worked flawlessly for over a year now.  Great product and recommended.  Clear cover useful for travel.</li>
            <li> Works Good.  Not excellent.  Replaced a Norelco with this razor and it is some what better then the Norelco I had.</li>
            <li> Far better than expected.  So glad I switched.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the goods you have ordered.</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t anything wrong with it, electric just doesn&#x27;t seem to do as well as a blade. I tried it out for over 4 weeks, shaving at least 3-4 times/week. I wasn&#x27;t bowled over, so I went back to a blade. I had tried another model before this one, and this one was MUCH easier on my skin, no pinches or nicks which was a plus.</li>
            <li> best shaver I have ever used, fast and comfortable with a close shave.</li>
            <li> I got cancer (and chemotherapy) and was told I could not use a razor blade to shave with.  So, I have used this on my face as well as my head.  It shaves pretty close but obviously not as close as a blade.  Cleaning this thing is amazing...being able to rinse and wash it with water.  Great razor.</li>
            <li> Pretty plan and simple. Razor works great. I have never purchased or used a Panasonic razor and have always purchased the usual Braun or Norelco&#x27;s. I like the Panasonic better than any other razor to date. I would recommend this razor!</li>
            <li> Superior product really close shaves no irritation</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product. While the shave quality was fine for me, the hair trimmer never worked well and the LCD display gave out within 6 months. I hadn&#x27;t noticed any problems with the shaver holding its charge, but after 18 months, it just stopped recharging. This was my second Panasonic shaving product which I purchased because I liked the first one so much (it lasted over 3 years).</li>
            <li> This shaver is excellent. It works very well and shaves as close if not closer than any other electric shaver I have owned.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I had an electric years ago and because of that, I&#x27;ve been a blade man for a long time. This razor surprised me. I&#x27;m still getting used to it, but so far I&#x27;m impressed. It is taking me a little longer to shave than with the blade, but especially above the mouth, the shave is closer than the blade. Easy to clean, and the charge lasts for a week. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great product-gave to youngest son to &amp;#34;learn&amp;#34; to shave.  (Believe oldest son was jealous..)</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Battery display&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer attachment&lt;br /&gt;Gets long hairs pretty well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Does not shave as close as my previous shaver</li>
            <li> I bought this after I read quite a bit of the reviews and I have to say, it works great. I have what is called Folliculitis, which prevents me from using a razor. This gets as close as I&#x27;d ever want a shave to get and am very happy with it. If you read the other reviews you will see that the only detractors are the ones who are expecting a nice razor-like barber-house shave, and that is just ridiculous. If you want a razor close shave then use a razor... don&#x27;t be silly.</li>
            <li> I have used Braun and Norelco for years with varying degrees of success.  This is my first Panasonic and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to shave with it for a week before I wrote my review in case something popped up issue wise that I wanted to write about.  Nothing of real note.  My only negative comment is that you can&#x27;t shave with it while it&#x27;s plugged in.  Other than that, all is great.  Very close and fast shave.</li>
            <li> Razor generally works well, I particularly like the wet/dry option.  Holds charge well, needs only infrequent recharges, and recharges fast.  Marked at 4 because it leaves occasional long hairs.</li>
            <li> HAS GIVEN ME CLOSE SHAVES.NOT YET AS CLOSE AS A BLADE BUT I HAVE ONLY USED IT FOR THREE WEEKS AND HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT AFTER A MONTH IT WILL  IMPROVE AS MY FACE BECOMES ADJUSTED TO THE CHANGE.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how much better this is than my old, noisy, heavy, hard to clean model.  This thing is so much better on all counts.  This does everything right and tells me easily the charge condition, that I think is easy to read anywhere.  I love the time saved cleaning it without needing a brush and disassembly.  NO cons yet.</li>
            <li> I have used electric razors for years, but never had a razor as good as this one.  It shaves as close as a blade, gets long hairs on the neck and is very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that using a brush on a razor dulls the blades.  No brush is needed for this razor.  You simply wash the blade with soap and water.  the display tells you how much charge remains in percentage.  I charge once a week.</li>
            <li> Much less expensive than 5 blade model. This is a travel razor for me and I love it as much as the 5 blade model. Almost the same, good battery status and solid performance.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave well, especially around chin, jaw and neck areas.&lt;br /&gt;You need to run your shaver on the same area at least four or five times.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to shave slower, no improvement.&lt;br /&gt;I used the lock sliding button to lock and unlock the head, no difference.&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, this is not a good shaver.</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for about a year.  After I rinse it, water keeps coming out the bottom of it by the plug -  VERY DANGEROUS!  I follow the instructions on how to clean it; I am afraid to plug it in with this much water.  I have written Panasonic and they do not get back to me.  I have no idea how to complain to Amazon.  Can someone please address this problem?</li>
            <li> Love that my husband isn&#x27;t cutting himself anymore!</li>
            <li> This is a great razor.  Does exactly what it is suppose to, shaves as close or closer than&lt;br /&gt;any other electric I&#x27;ve owned.  Feels comfortable in hand. Not too loud as some have said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically I use this razor and then if I need an extra-close shave I can just&lt;br /&gt;dry shave with a disposable razor in an additional 20 seconds.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and the dry shave was a bit irratating but when I switched to using a shaving gel (Edge) I got a close comfortable shave. Just a minimal amount of gel was required. Shaving time was a little longer than the three (3) minutes given in the adds. Overall satisfied with this shaver as I have only had it a couple of months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used base model Panasonic wet/dry shavers for 15 years and been satisfied. I&#x27;ve tolerated reduced cutting performance of those old style units as the replaceable parts aged because replacement is nearly the cost of new shaver. By contrast, the first shave with this model was amazingly close and the high-speed motor is pleasantly smooth, though the high-pitched sound is reminiscent of a buzzing wasp. After about a month the cutting performance has declined a little, presumably as the fresh edges lose their perfect sharpness. My whiskers are not tough, but they tend to lie along the skin so I&#x27;ve always had trouble getting an electric to pick them up cleanly. The ES8103 does well at this but isn&#x27;t perfect, hence the loss of one star. Charging is very fast. Hope the Li-ion battery lasts 7 to 10 years like the old shavers, but probably NimH batteries are more durable.</li>
            <li> I originally got the one with only 2 foils, but found it didn&#x27;t cut several-day-old stubble.  That didn&#x27;t seem like a problem at first except if I missed a few hairs one day I&#x27;d have major problems the next day. I wound up first using my Norelco to cut the longer hairs and then finishing with the Panasonic for a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 3-blade Panasonic solves the problem with 2 close cut foils with a third long-hair foil sandwiched between. This is by far the closest cutting electric I&#x27;ve ever used.  Unlike some lower-cost models, the battery fully recharges in an hour and will last me 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I really love it! As instructed, you can wash it directly with tap water. This is very convenient for me.</li>
            <li> So after many years of using gillete razors, I thought I would try an electric, as I was getting tired of nicking my self on cold mornings.  I thought an electric would be nice for a quick shave, but boy was I wrong.  It&#x27;s like vacuuming your face.. back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.. when with a normal razor, one swipe and your done.  This also doesn&#x27;t get anywhere near as close as a razor.  I think it may come in handy now and again, but for the most part it just sits there.  I have not tired using it wet.</li>
            <li> I have owned this razor for over a month now and am very pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs:&lt;br /&gt;- Clean smooth shave&lt;br /&gt;- Very easy to clean - just use liquid soap and water&lt;br /&gt;- Very low maintenance - just clean.  No special solution like my previous Braun.  No other maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;- Lasts for about a week of shaving on one charge.&lt;br /&gt;- Very quick to charge - less than an hour.&lt;br /&gt;- Very good ergonomics - fits the hand well and easy to hold&lt;br /&gt;- Fairly quiet, low vibration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:&lt;br /&gt;- Very minor issue.  The foil casing is quite smooth and when it is wet it can be a tad slippery.  I have managed to drop mine twice while cleaning it (luckily without damage).  But it is just something to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great razor.</li>
            <li> My Norelco of many years was getting pretty dull and I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on new shaving heads and I was never really happy with it. I had to keep going over the same area half a dozen times before it felt close enough. I invested in the Panasonic and am very happy with it. It does the job faster and with no irritation. I wash mine under hot water using the regular motor speed then into turbo speed to finish up. Then I use canned air to dry it off and it removes any stray hairs that the water didn&#x27;t get. put it back together and I&#x27;m ready to start shaving the next time. It is noisier that my Norelco, but also it has a speed of 13000 rpm&#x27;s, while the Norelco has only half the speed. Some people don&#x27;t like the extra noise, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.The battery last only about half of the Norelco,but I think it is because of the higher motor speed. I like this shaver very much, and will buy new heads when it needs it.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this product. It is a little more expensive than other, but is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> ...so I was looking for a way to cut some time out of my morning routine. I was a wet blade and shaving cream kinda guy, and decided I could cut out at least 5 minutes with this shaver while in the car.  It can be a tab bit messy, but I&#x27;m not late for work anymore and the BEST thing about it was no razor burn and still felt like a very close shave.</li>
            <li> works better than any electric  i have owned-- cleans itself - holds charge--  close as a blade if used twice a day-- would recommend !</li>
            <li> I have had Brauns for the past 20 years, I went through (3) of them in just the last twelve years. That&#x27;s not too bad of usage, except when you pay a small fortune for them, they should last longer and that isn&#x27;t just changing the screen or the cutters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this Panasonic after reading several reviews and ordered from Amazon. I received the shaver really fast and took less than an hour to charge it as it was already at 50% charge. Having had Brauns I thought I was getting close shaves but this shaver really takes the prize! The shave is so close that a blade couldn&#x27;t get any closer. I also tried several different pre-shaves including shampoo, Xtra Virgin Olive Oil,  etc. but the best I found for myself is the Nivea Shaving Gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no way a Braun can compete with this shaver, also the cleaning is incredibly simple and the shaver is always clean for the next shave. One thing I noticed was I can only get 4-shaves per charge and I sure can&#x27;t shave in 4-5 minutes as some claim, but then everyone is different. On the 4th shave I&#x27;m down to 10% charge but it lasts through the shave and then a quick 1 hour charge and its ready again, no problem. For myself, I think the body is a bit long but then again that&#x27;s just a personal opinion but doesn&#x27;t take away from the shavers performance at all. I was surprised that you cannot shave with this plugged in, can only use when unplugged, that&#x27;s not a big deal for me though. I would rate this at 4.5 overall</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a number of months and am so happy with it. It&#x27;s great to take away on holiday, easy to clean, looks great and is very functional so it&#x27;s so much better than its predecessor which was so expensive and heavier by comparison (a Braun).</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and works better than I expected. This thing holds a good charge, 8-10 shaves before needing to recharge. Shaves fast, very fast. I can&#x27;t believe I lived with a 12 year old shaver that wouldn&#x27;t work unless I plugged it in and waited a few minutes before using.</li>
            <li> I had a Braun shaver forever and thought nothing could ever top it. I have found its replacement. The Panasonic blades are cheaper and it cuts like a brand new 5hp lawn mower after using a push mower to do your yard. The blades move so fast and the trimmer gets the job done. I dont have the thickest hair in the world, but I think its ready for just about any hair type out there. Good luck I hope your experience is as good as mine.</li>
            <li> I have a coarse beard so ingrown hair is a huge issue with me. I mostly use clippers, but they sometimes leave too much hair so I wanted an electric razor for the &amp;#34;final clean up.&amp;#34; This razor cuts WAY too closely, so if you have ingrown hair problems, don&#x27;t get it. But, if you don&#x27;t have ingrown hair issues, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> This is my second Panasonic Shaver. The first one lasted 5 years at which time the battery would not keep a charge. I got my money&#x27;s worth on that shaver. I hope this one lasts as long. Even if it would last two or three years I will be pleased. Compare it to the cost of conventional blades now days and it is more cost efficient for the electric shaver. I will say this to potential buyers when you get it follow the instructions as listed. If you are just starting new to use an electric shaver it will take 3 to 4 weeks for your beard to  get use to an electric shaver. I would recommend using a pre-shave such as &amp;#34;Williams Lectric Shave&amp;#34; or something comparable.</li>
            <li> easy to use and clean. performs well. i can get a weeks shaves from one charge. i won&#x27;t have to take the charger along for short trips.</li>
            <li> This provides a good shave, has a decent battery life and is easy to clean.  However the on/off switch is way to easy to press while in use - Panasonic need to either relocate the switch or make it less easy to press by accident.</li>
            <li> For the price, a very good shaver. There are definitely better shavers out there, but you will be shelling out a BUNDLE to purchase them. This shaver is perfect for the man who razor shaves occasionally, and wants to stay smooth in-between. It&#x27;s pivot (soft) action is great for uneven terrain. A full charge holds for 5-6 FULL shaves.</li>
