            <li>His hair is very nice and never dries, but with this shampoo it did.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get a build up of product because about every 3-4 shampoos, I rinse with vinegar which cleans the hair very nicely.  </li>
            <li>I am thrilled with the results!</li>
            <li>I just love this brand, every product is indeed very good.</li>
            <li>It also smells really good.</li>
            <li>It s a good product to brush curly hair.</li>
            <li>and this was fairly good at managing my hair.  </li>
            <li>performance is good, but YUCK, the smell.  </li>
            <li>The best that I would describe it, is cheap perfume that someone uses to cover up something....</li>
            <li>so I never thought it was a good idea to invest in stuff like this ..</li>
            <li>Loved the smell and the way it conditioned my hair.</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love my shampoo and conditioner deal!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I know prices sort of jump around on Amazon, but the price I bought these at was great, and lower than buying in-store, plus shipping was free.  </li>
            <li>But my hair did look and feel great with Smooth Lock.</li>
            <li>and I liked it.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>It has a very nice fragrance and is especially good for dry hair.</li>
            <li>It has a very strong odor.</li>
            <li>It is definitely more cost effective to purchase thorough Amazon.</li>
            <li>Very smooth</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>My hair became more manageable.    </li>
            <li>Love this shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li>Everything was ok.</li>
            <li>I decided to try one more time after seeing the description of this product.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is very moisturizing and smells great.</li>
            <li>The entire line is the best treat you can give your hair.</li>
            <li>Wheat and Soy are two of the 4 things that many people have allergies to.</li>
            <li>But this one I love.  </li>
            <li>I hope if you buy this product it works better for you.  </li>
            <li>This is the product that my hair stylist used and I really love it.  </li>
            <li>I searched for years for the perfect shampoo and conditioner for my coarse, curly, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>Will purchase this product again love it</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Excellent price and arrived properly packed.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case at all, it&#x27;s not my favorite smelling  </li>
            <li>and I sure haven&#x27;t found another Redken product that comes close.</li>
            <li>I wish the deal for just shampoo was better.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Redken Products for many years now.</li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>My hair is unruly but this product does help more that I thought it would.  </li>
            <li>and it is 100% better.  </li>
            <li>This is good product for the right hair type.</li>
            <li>Love this product...keeps my hair healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li>I love the Smooth lock products.</li>
            <li>Not as huge a fan of the new formula but its still great for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried this product, it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li>originally thought that it smelled OK....</li>
            <li>Love that I can buy this shampoo and conditioner on Amazon for cheaper than in the store or salon and that it comes right to my house!</li>
            <li>I think Redken did us a disservice by changing the formulation of their wonderful Smooth Down shampoo.</li>
            <li>I mistakenly bought Smooth Lock.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel smooth, doesn&#x27;t wash out well,</li>
            <li>This one is like buying some crappy cheap knockoff.</li>
            <li>this is the SMOOTH LOCK shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Smooth lock smells like bug spray and leaves my hair fuzzy.</li>
            <li>for the smell, I read one review  stating that smooth lock smells like floor cleaner</li>
            <li>Smooth Lock STINKS--literally.  </li>
            <li>This smooth lock did nothing but reverse what Smoothdown did.</li>
            <li>I switched everything over to redken and got the liters of smooth lock</li>
            <li>Smooth Lock smells horrendous and my hair is nothing but frizz.</li>
            <li>The Smooth Lock shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>When I received my shipment it contained the Smooth Lock.  </li>
            <li>but I figured I would give it a try since I knew they had discontinued Smooth</li>
            <li>My hair feels feels anything but smooth after using this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I gave Smooth Lock a try, and while I think it performs well, I can&#x27;t handle the scent.</li>
            <li>Smooth Lock destroyed my hair.</li>
            <li>I never realized it was from Smooth Lock.</li>
            <li>I will be throwing away the Smooth Lock Shampoo and Conditioner and finding another product to use.  </li>
            <li>Just as others have stated in these reviews, I too have searched for many years for the right shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>First time using this product and happy with it so far.  </li>
            <li>Works great and leaves my hair less frizzy and more manageable.</li>
            <li>the product was overall good.     </li>
            <li>I am Asian and my hair needs a good conditioner.  </li>
            <li>But to be fair it has almost always done so with no extra product.</li>
            <li>She was just as thrilled as I was and described it as a \\&quot;complete transformation.\\</li>
            <li>Love this product was glad to get them in a big bottle.</li>
            <li>I loved smooth down and was excited to use this,</li>
            <li>PRETTY MANGEABLE, FRIZZ FREE AND  </li>
            <li>After using it for a few months I feel like a model with how beautiful my hair manages and shines.  </li>
            <li>I have used smooth down for years and loved it.</li>
            <li>Been using smooth down for about 5 years now and this is not quite as good.  </li>
            <li>I loved everything about Smooth Down</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t  say enough how much I love them!</li>
            <li>This products is called smooth LOCK for a reason, it activates with heat, so the product won&#x27;t really work if you don&#x27;t apply heat.</li>
            <li>This Smooth Lock combo has really done wonders for my hair.  </li>
            <li>It is the only kind that works well on my hair.</li>
            <li>shampoo (the one that I think smells the best is by Victoria&#x27;s Secret)</li>
            <li>Would be nice to get my money back.</li>
            <li>Almost like chocolate...but old chocolate :).</li>
            <li>So worth the money..</li>
            <li>No shampoo really helps my frizz but smooth down was definitely the best.</li>
            <li>Now Redken Smooth Lock is my new fav!</li>
            <li>I wish I could say it is awesome, but let&#x27;s say it is above average.  </li>
            <li>I never write reviews, but feel so strongly about this I had to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am relieved to see that I am not the only person who thinks smooth lock</li>
            <li>the same time, this offers amazing heat protection and leaves your hair smooth and frizz-free after using heating tools.</li>
            <li>I have color treated hair and it barely faded though I do wish that it was a bit more moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I loved the way Smoth Down worked and now that is gone.  </li>
            <li>Excellent for frizzy or dry hair (due to blow drying, after swimming, etc.).</li>
            <li>Even after I was able to get all of the tangles out, there was absolutely no evidence of a frizz free look.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t use another shampoo, it really helps my hair!</li>
            <li>what people really need to understand!</li>
            <li>The frizz was COMPLETELY gone and my hair felt amazingly smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a college student supporting myself</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t rate it higher.</li>
            <li>I first purchased a gift set of this product from my hairdresser in the fall.</li>
            <li>The Smooth Down is so much better.</li>
            <li>(like lots of you) have been using Redken smooth down conditioner for many years.</li>
            <li>It straightens easily with no other product.  </li>
            <li>The whole day I was fighting static flyaways, and swore then and there to NEVER run out of Redken Smooth Down again...</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner are good and could get 4 stars even, but definitely not a replacement for smooth down.</li>
            <li>Bring back to original product!</li>
            <li>Smooth Lock is great for difficult, frizzy/wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>I am pregnant, so I&#x27;m sure that has a lot to do with my extra sensitivity, but it doesn&#x27;t have a fresh, crisp scent like Smooth Down</li>
            <li>feels like im using cheap regular shampoo, i am sure it has given me a folliculitis pimple never had this problem with smooth down.</li>
            <li>so if your curious if its right for you just find a redken salon in your area and ask a stylist :)</li>
            <li>Perhaps my type of hair is not what this product was intended to treat as I have read some positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I go every other day in the summer and aver 3-4 days in the winter, natural oils are good for your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>AND Redken Smooth Down completely cures the winter static problem.</li>
            <li>Would not trade this product in for the world does wonders for your hair, and the bottles are huge and low priced</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really thought my hair was beyond repair until i used these two products.</li>
            <li>It really takes away the frizzies.</li>
            <li>VERY RESONABLY PRICED.THE SHAMPOO SUDS UP</li>
            <li>VERY WELL</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>I really like this aspect of it.</li>
            <li>Smooth lock is a different product, but it has heat protection  built in.</li>
            <li>My wife really likes this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Smooth lock is not the same as Smoothdown.</li>
            <li>Please bring back Smoothdown and discontinue smooth lock.</li>
            <li>I figured I would give it a shot after hearing how much everyone loves it ..</li>
            <li>What you need to understand about smooth lock is that its for a specific type of hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>Smooth Lock is not the same product.</li>
            <li>and I just hope I can find something else I like as much.</li>
            <li>so I thought I would spread the love over here as well because I really want this new formula to be around for a long time to come.  </li>
            <li>But now I have to shampoo every other day, which of course is going to cause more heat damage.  </li>
            <li>I love this product especially the smooth down shampoo and condition.</li>
            <li>I switched to Smooth Down and from day one, my hair was soft and smooth again.</li>
            <li>My hair is long, fine, and curly.</li>
            <li>I like this shampoo and conditioner very much, but it seems to create a build-up after awhile, becuase my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>I bought these several months ago and they&#x27;re still about 1/3 full.  </li>
            <li>I have used Smooth Down for a long time and I love it.</li>
            <li>My hair was still a bit frizzy the first time I used it because I just let it air dry, BUT, when I straightened, curled or blew-dried it (with a diffuser, SO important for wavy or curly hair, USE A DIFFUSER for frizz-free hair), my hair completely changed.</li>
            <li>so far so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have strange semi curly, semi straight, kind of frizzy hair, which I straighten daily.  </li>
            <li>Shampoo and Conditioner is sooo fantastic for dry, damaged, brittle breaking hair.</li>
            <li>First off, note that the picture for this product when I ordered it was for Smooth Down liters.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After visiting my local salon to buy a bottle of the trusted smooth down, I was told it had been swapped for smooth lock...</li>
            <li>I have thick, wavy, frizzy hair and this seems to tame it the best.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ITEM:  </li>
            <li>highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend that product too.</li>
            <li>Love getting them for a gift as they are a little pricey for the 32.5 oz.</li>
            <li>I alternate between smooth lock, and all soft, and I use a mixture of the smooth lock serum and the extreme before I blow-dry.</li>
            <li>I want the original Smooth Down back!</li>
            <li>I am all about smells too and I won&#x27;t use anything that smells bad;  these smell absolutely wonderful!!!</li>
            <li>Normally I can go 3 days before having to shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li>One squirt applied to my hair after it is dried created a healthy shine.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner is a kind of thick, so if you have thin hair, may not be good for you.  </li>
            <li>feel most people who give it a 1-star rating, only do so because they do not know how to use this line or that it is not the same thing as Smooth Down.</li>
            <li>First time I used it I was surprised on how it didn&#x27;t feel like it did anything to my hair and was not as manageable as when I used smooth down.</li>
            <li>It is super thick and you would think your hair would feel silky smooth considering</li>
            <li>This was switched with a different product It is NOT even the right color for the shampoo?</li>
            <li>I have extensive dried and brittle and damage hair and this product did make it a lot more manageable!  </li>
            <li>I looked high and low for a product and was willing to spend what it took; however, this product ended up my selection after a lot of research.  </li>
            <li>Last winter I ran out of Redken, and used another product -- one of the many half full bottles of shampoos and conditioners stashed in the back of my cabinet.</li>
            <li>I am a new fan of Redken.</li>
            <li>and so I decided to try something new.</li>
            <li>and there are some people over there bashing the new formula</li>
            <li>I am on the lookout for a new shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Redken smooth down for years and was a massive fun so was gutted when Redken decided to discontinue it.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the scent and the bigger bottles last me about 4 months.</li>
            <li>I have really thick, wavy hair that gets dandruff very easily in the winter time</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re having issues with your hie drying out do what I do and alternate between all soft and smooth lock, I also don&#x27;t wash my hair daily</li>
            <li>With the first use I suddenly had hair that appeared healthier.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels soft, silky and is shiny!.  </li>
            <li>my hair has never looked so healthy and shiny and although its more expensive  than what I used to use I use a significantly less amount especially of the conditioner I also strongly recommend the stay sleek and the all soft argon oil by redken ..  </li>
            <li>No comparison to Smooth Down and the vendor insisted they mailed the Smooth Down, they didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a smooth down fan stick with smooth down.  </li>
            <li>I used Smooth Down for years.</li>
            <li>ordered this because Smooth Down is discontinued</li>
            <li>Smooth Down</li>
            <li>Redken Smooth Down</li>
            <li>I also followed up with the smooth down treatment.</li>
            <li>I used Smooth Down</li>
            <li>it is the smooth down, because it is not.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Smooth Down for years</li>
            <li>GET SMOOTH DOWN instead.</li>
            <li>I do not understand why Redken discontinued the Smooth Down and replaced it with this stinky stuff.</li>
            <li>this cause I have been using smooth down for 2 1/2 years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m disappointed they discontinued Smooth Down because it really tamed my frizz and gave incredible moisture to my hair.</li>
            <li>They need to take this line off the market because clearly I&#x27;m not the only one having this issue with Smooth Lock.</li>
            <li>If you want something equivalent to Smooth Down, Redken did release the Diamond Oil and the All Soft line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smooth Down made my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Email me complete return instructions on this &amp; I will be contacting Amazon about this fraud service</li>
            <li>I went to replace my conditioner, and I was surprised to see it was not there.</li>
            <li>My hair stayed straight the entire day, even in humid weather</li>
            <li>so soft</li>
            <li>They do not remotely compre to Smooth Down shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Its ridiculous that Redken can discontinue a product and this new one gets to completely take its place even with the reviews, most of the reviews here are for Smooth Down shampoo and conditioner, which is not the same as this.</li>
            <li>however, I don&#x27;t think that the smell is bad, and it&#x27;s good for my hair, so I use it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m writing this review because of all the negative reviews comparing smooth down to smooth lock.</li>
            <li>The smelling isn&#x27;t too strong which I like, and you only need a little shampoo to make lots of foam.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner smooth my hair down, and gave it back life.</li>
            <li>THIS IS NOT, I REPEAT, NOT the same thing as smooth down.</li>
            <li>Can anyone recommend something similar to Smooth Down?</li>
            <li>This product made my hair dry, brittle and frizzy which is the exact opposite of what it says it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Smooth Down for years after searching for longing than that for a shampoo/conditioner for my dry, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>A diluted vinegar rinse works well to get build up off, just make sure not to go to the gym or sweat around other people because the smell lasts for a few days.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bring back smooth down!!</li>
            <li>After shampooing and conditioning with this duo, I could barely comb through my hair.  </li>
            <li>Could barely comb my hair without pulling like 10,000 strands of hair.</li>
            <li>I could actually wear it natural.</li>
            <li>I could barely wait for her to see the results.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so thick, smooth, and creamy.</li>
            <li>Sorry, just being honest.</li>
            <li>It works very well for my hair type which is coarse and because I color my hair, it can become dry.  </li>
            <li>I live in a dry climate.</li>
            <li>Revlon needs to go back to Smooth Down now!!!</li>
            <li>Come on, Redken...bring back Smooth Down!!!</li>
            <li>Bring back smooth down is all I can say!!!</li>
            <li>It cleans gently but thoroughly and it protects my hair without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>This one delivers -- I can either just blow dry my hair, taming it with a brush, for a more curly casual look, or I can use a flat iron for a silky straight do.</li>
            <li>It made my hair (naturally a bit dry and frizzy)</li>
            <li>I could leave it to dry naturally</li>
            <li>I always have used cheap brands and have long thick hair ..</li>
            <li>I tried Smooth Lock, it&#x27;s not Smooth Down.  </li>
            <li>It does not smooth my hair the way Smooth Down did, and I can no longer take the smell.  </li>
            <li>I had tried other Redken products that I didn&#x27;t care for, but felt like treating myself that day with something new.  </li>
            <li>If anyone can recommend a shampoo and conditioner to replace Smooth down, because Smooth lock is awful, my hair has gone dry and frizzy since using it, it smells like really strong floor cleaner.</li>

            <li> I am thrilled with the results!</li>
            <li> I just love this brand, every product is indeed very good.</li>
            <li> It also smells really good.</li>
            <li> It s a good product to brush curly hair.</li>
            <li> and this was fairly good at managing my hair.  </li>
            <li> performance is good, but YUCK, the smell.  </li>
            <li> The best that I would describe it, is cheap perfume that someone uses to cover up something....</li>
            <li> so I never thought it was a good idea to invest in stuff like this ..</li>
            <li> Loved the smell and the way it conditioned my hair.</li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love my shampoo and conditioner deal!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I know prices sort of jump around on Amazon, but the price I bought these at was great, and lower than buying in-store, plus shipping was free.  </li>
            <li> But my hair did look and feel great with Smooth Lock.</li>
            <li> and I liked it.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice.</li>
            <li> It has a very nice fragrance and is especially good for dry hair.</li>
            <li> It has a very strong odor.</li>
            <li> It is definitely more cost effective to purchase thorough Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very smooth</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> My hair became more manageable.    </li>
            <li> Love this shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li> Everything was ok.</li>
            <li> I decided to try one more time after seeing the description of this product.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is very moisturizing and smells great.</li>
            <li> The entire line is the best treat you can give your hair.</li>
            <li> Wheat and Soy are two of the 4 things that many people have allergies to.</li>
            <li> But this one I love.  </li>
            <li> I hope if you buy this product it works better for you.  </li>
            <li> This is the product that my hair stylist used and I really love it.  </li>
            <li> I searched for years for the perfect shampoo and conditioner for my coarse, curly, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Will purchase this product again love it</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Excellent price and arrived properly packed.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case at all, it&#x27;s not my favorite smelling  </li>
            <li> and I sure haven&#x27;t found another Redken product that comes close.</li>
            <li> I wish the deal for just shampoo was better.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Redken Products for many years now.</li>
            <li> I love them</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> My hair is unruly but this product does help more that I thought it would.  </li>
            <li> and it is 100% better.  </li>
            <li> This is good product for the right hair type.</li>
            <li> Love this product...keeps my hair healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love the Smooth lock products.</li>
            <li> Not as huge a fan of the new formula but its still great for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried this product, it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> originally thought that it smelled OK....</li>
            <li> Love that I can buy this shampoo and conditioner on Amazon for cheaper than in the store or salon and that it comes right to my house!</li>
            <li> I think Redken did us a disservice by changing the formulation of their wonderful Smooth Down shampoo.</li>
            <li> I mistakenly bought Smooth Lock.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel smooth, doesn&#x27;t wash out well,</li>
            <li> This one is like buying some crappy cheap knockoff.</li>
            <li> this is the SMOOTH LOCK shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Smooth lock smells like bug spray and leaves my hair fuzzy.</li>
            <li> for the smell, I read one review  stating that smooth lock smells like floor cleaner</li>
            <li> Smooth Lock STINKS--literally.  </li>
            <li> This smooth lock did nothing but reverse what Smoothdown did.</li>
            <li> I switched everything over to redken and got the liters of smooth lock</li>
            <li> Smooth Lock smells horrendous and my hair is nothing but frizz.</li>
            <li> The Smooth Lock shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> When I received my shipment it contained the Smooth Lock.  </li>
            <li> but I figured I would give it a try since I knew they had discontinued Smooth</li>
            <li> My hair feels feels anything but smooth after using this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I gave Smooth Lock a try, and while I think it performs well, I can&#x27;t handle the scent.</li>
            <li> Smooth Lock destroyed my hair.</li>
            <li> I never realized it was from Smooth Lock.</li>
            <li> I will be throwing away the Smooth Lock Shampoo and Conditioner and finding another product to use.  </li>
            <li> Just as others have stated in these reviews, I too have searched for many years for the right shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> First time using this product and happy with it so far.  </li>
            <li> Works great and leaves my hair less frizzy and more manageable.</li>
            <li> the product was overall good.     </li>
            <li> I am Asian and my hair needs a good conditioner.  </li>
            <li> But to be fair it has almost always done so with no extra product.</li>
            <li> She was just as thrilled as I was and described it as a \\&quot;complete transformation.\\</li>
            <li> Love this product was glad to get them in a big bottle.</li>
            <li> I loved smooth down and was excited to use this,</li>
            <li> PRETTY MANGEABLE, FRIZZ FREE AND  </li>
            <li> After using it for a few months I feel like a model with how beautiful my hair manages and shines.  </li>
            <li> I have used smooth down for years and loved it.</li>
            <li> Been using smooth down for about 5 years now and this is not quite as good.  </li>
            <li> I loved everything about Smooth Down</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t  say enough how much I love them!</li>
            <li> This products is called smooth LOCK for a reason, it activates with heat, so the product won&#x27;t really work if you don&#x27;t apply heat.</li>
            <li> This Smooth Lock combo has really done wonders for my hair.  </li>
            <li> It is the only kind that works well on my hair.</li>
            <li> shampoo (the one that I think smells the best is by Victoria&#x27;s Secret)</li>
            <li> Would be nice to get my money back.</li>
            <li> Almost like chocolate...but old chocolate :).</li>
            <li> So worth the money..</li>
            <li> No shampoo really helps my frizz but smooth down was definitely the best.</li>
            <li> Now Redken Smooth Lock is my new fav!</li>
            <li> I wish I could say it is awesome, but let&#x27;s say it is above average.  </li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but feel so strongly about this I had to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am relieved to see that I am not the only person who thinks smooth lock</li>
            <li> the same time, this offers amazing heat protection and leaves your hair smooth and frizz-free after using heating tools.</li>
            <li> I have color treated hair and it barely faded though I do wish that it was a bit more moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> I loved the way Smoth Down worked and now that is gone.  </li>
            <li> Excellent for frizzy or dry hair (due to blow drying, after swimming, etc.).</li>
            <li> Even after I was able to get all of the tangles out, there was absolutely no evidence of a frizz free look.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast!  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use another shampoo, it really helps my hair!</li>
            <li> what people really need to understand!</li>
            <li> The frizz was COMPLETELY gone and my hair felt amazingly smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a college student supporting myself</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t rate it higher.</li>
            <li> I first purchased a gift set of this product from my hairdresser in the fall.</li>
            <li> The Smooth Down is so much better.</li>
            <li> (like lots of you) have been using Redken smooth down conditioner for many years.</li>
            <li> It straightens easily with no other product.  </li>
            <li> The whole day I was fighting static flyaways, and swore then and there to NEVER run out of Redken Smooth Down again...</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner are good and could get 4 stars even, but definitely not a replacement for smooth down.</li>
            <li> Bring back to original product!</li>
            <li> Smooth Lock is great for difficult, frizzy/wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I am pregnant, so I&#x27;m sure that has a lot to do with my extra sensitivity, but it doesn&#x27;t have a fresh, crisp scent like Smooth Down</li>
            <li> feels like im using cheap regular shampoo, i am sure it has given me a folliculitis pimple never had this problem with smooth down.</li>
            <li> so if your curious if its right for you just find a redken salon in your area and ask a stylist :)</li>
            <li> Perhaps my type of hair is not what this product was intended to treat as I have read some positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I go every other day in the summer and aver 3-4 days in the winter, natural oils are good for your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> AND Redken Smooth Down completely cures the winter static problem.</li>
            <li> Would not trade this product in for the world does wonders for your hair, and the bottles are huge and low priced</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really thought my hair was beyond repair until i used these two products.</li>
            <li> It really takes away the frizzies.</li>
            <li> VERY RESONABLY PRICED.THE SHAMPOO SUDS UP</li>
            <li> VERY WELL</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery</li>
            <li> I really like this aspect of it.</li>
            <li> Smooth lock is a different product, but it has heat protection  built in.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Smooth lock is not the same as Smoothdown.</li>
            <li> Please bring back Smoothdown and discontinue smooth lock.</li>
            <li> I figured I would give it a shot after hearing how much everyone loves it ..</li>
            <li> What you need to understand about smooth lock is that its for a specific type of hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> Smooth Lock is not the same product.</li>
            <li> and I just hope I can find something else I like as much.</li>
            <li> so I thought I would spread the love over here as well because I really want this new formula to be around for a long time to come.  </li>
            <li> But now I have to shampoo every other day, which of course is going to cause more heat damage.  </li>
            <li> I love this product especially the smooth down shampoo and condition.</li>
            <li> I switched to Smooth Down and from day one, my hair was soft and smooth again.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, fine, and curly.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo and conditioner very much, but it seems to create a build-up after awhile, becuase my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> I bought these several months ago and they&#x27;re still about 1/3 full.  </li>
            <li> I have used Smooth Down for a long time and I love it.</li>
            <li> My hair was still a bit frizzy the first time I used it because I just let it air dry, BUT, when I straightened, curled or blew-dried it (with a diffuser, SO important for wavy or curly hair, USE A DIFFUSER for frizz-free hair), my hair completely changed.</li>
            <li> so far so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have strange semi curly, semi straight, kind of frizzy hair, which I straighten daily.  </li>
            <li> Shampoo and Conditioner is sooo fantastic for dry, damaged, brittle breaking hair.</li>
            <li> First off, note that the picture for this product when I ordered it was for Smooth Down liters.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After visiting my local salon to buy a bottle of the trusted smooth down, I was told it had been swapped for smooth lock...</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy, frizzy hair and this seems to tame it the best.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ITEM:  </li>
            <li> highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend that product too.</li>
            <li> Love getting them for a gift as they are a little pricey for the 32.5 oz.</li>
            <li> I alternate between smooth lock, and all soft, and I use a mixture of the smooth lock serum and the extreme before I blow-dry.</li>
            <li> I want the original Smooth Down back!</li>
            <li> I am all about smells too and I won&#x27;t use anything that smells bad;  these smell absolutely wonderful!!!</li>
            <li> Normally I can go 3 days before having to shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li> One squirt applied to my hair after it is dried created a healthy shine.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner is a kind of thick, so if you have thin hair, may not be good for you.  </li>
            <li> feel most people who give it a 1-star rating, only do so because they do not know how to use this line or that it is not the same thing as Smooth Down.</li>
            <li> First time I used it I was surprised on how it didn&#x27;t feel like it did anything to my hair and was not as manageable as when I used smooth down.</li>
            <li> It is super thick and you would think your hair would feel silky smooth considering</li>
            <li> This was switched with a different product It is NOT even the right color for the shampoo?</li>
            <li> I have extensive dried and brittle and damage hair and this product did make it a lot more manageable!  </li>
            <li> I looked high and low for a product and was willing to spend what it took; however, this product ended up my selection after a lot of research.  </li>
            <li> Last winter I ran out of Redken, and used another product -- one of the many half full bottles of shampoos and conditioners stashed in the back of my cabinet.</li>
            <li> I am a new fan of Redken.</li>
            <li> and so I decided to try something new.</li>
            <li> and there are some people over there bashing the new formula</li>
            <li> I am on the lookout for a new shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Redken smooth down for years and was a massive fun so was gutted when Redken decided to discontinue it.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the scent and the bigger bottles last me about 4 months.</li>
            <li> I have really thick, wavy hair that gets dandruff very easily in the winter time</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re having issues with your hie drying out do what I do and alternate between all soft and smooth lock, I also don&#x27;t wash my hair daily</li>
            <li> With the first use I suddenly had hair that appeared healthier.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels soft, silky and is shiny!.  </li>
            <li> my hair has never looked so healthy and shiny and although its more expensive  than what I used to use I use a significantly less amount especially of the conditioner I also strongly recommend the stay sleek and the all soft argon oil by redken ..  </li>
            <li> No comparison to Smooth Down and the vendor insisted they mailed the Smooth Down, they didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a smooth down fan stick with smooth down.  </li>
            <li> I used Smooth Down for years.</li>
            <li> ordered this because Smooth Down is discontinued</li>
            <li> Smooth Down</li>
            <li> Redken Smooth Down</li>
            <li> I also followed up with the smooth down treatment.</li>
            <li> I used Smooth Down</li>
            <li> it is the smooth down, because it is not.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Smooth Down for years</li>
            <li> GET SMOOTH DOWN instead.</li>
            <li> I do not understand why Redken discontinued the Smooth Down and replaced it with this stinky stuff.</li>
            <li> this cause I have been using smooth down for 2 1/2 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed they discontinued Smooth Down because it really tamed my frizz and gave incredible moisture to my hair.</li>
            <li> They need to take this line off the market because clearly I&#x27;m not the only one having this issue with Smooth Lock.</li>
            <li> If you want something equivalent to Smooth Down, Redken did release the Diamond Oil and the All Soft line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smooth Down made my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Email me complete return instructions on this &amp; I will be contacting Amazon about this fraud service</li>
            <li> I went to replace my conditioner, and I was surprised to see it was not there.</li>
            <li> My hair stayed straight the entire day, even in humid weather</li>
            <li> so soft</li>
            <li> They do not remotely compre to Smooth Down shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Its ridiculous that Redken can discontinue a product and this new one gets to completely take its place even with the reviews, most of the reviews here are for Smooth Down shampoo and conditioner, which is not the same as this.</li>
            <li> however, I don&#x27;t think that the smell is bad, and it&#x27;s good for my hair, so I use it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review because of all the negative reviews comparing smooth down to smooth lock.</li>
            <li> The smelling isn&#x27;t too strong which I like, and you only need a little shampoo to make lots of foam.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner smooth my hair down, and gave it back life.</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT, I REPEAT, NOT the same thing as smooth down.</li>
            <li> Can anyone recommend something similar to Smooth Down?</li>
            <li> This product made my hair dry, brittle and frizzy which is the exact opposite of what it says it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Smooth Down for years after searching for longing than that for a shampoo/conditioner for my dry, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> A diluted vinegar rinse works well to get build up off, just make sure not to go to the gym or sweat around other people because the smell lasts for a few days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bring back smooth down!!</li>
            <li> After shampooing and conditioning with this duo, I could barely comb through my hair.  </li>
            <li> Could barely comb my hair without pulling like 10,000 strands of hair.</li>
            <li> I could actually wear it natural.</li>
            <li> I could barely wait for her to see the results.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so thick, smooth, and creamy.</li>
            <li> Sorry, just being honest.</li>
            <li> It works very well for my hair type which is coarse and because I color my hair, it can become dry.  </li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate.</li>
            <li> Revlon needs to go back to Smooth Down now!!!</li>
            <li> Come on, Redken...bring back Smooth Down!!!</li>
            <li> Bring back smooth down is all I can say!!!</li>
            <li> It cleans gently but thoroughly and it protects my hair without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> This one delivers -- I can either just blow dry my hair, taming it with a brush, for a more curly casual look, or I can use a flat iron for a silky straight do.</li>
            <li> It made my hair (naturally a bit dry and frizzy)</li>
            <li> I could leave it to dry naturally</li>
            <li> I always have used cheap brands and have long thick hair ..</li>
            <li> I tried Smooth Lock, it&#x27;s not Smooth Down.  </li>
            <li> It does not smooth my hair the way Smooth Down did, and I can no longer take the smell.  </li>
            <li> I had tried other Redken products that I didn&#x27;t care for, but felt like treating myself that day with something new.  </li>
            <li> If anyone can recommend a shampoo and conditioner to replace Smooth down, because Smooth lock is awful, my hair has gone dry and frizzy since using it, it smells like really strong floor cleaner.</li>
            <li> only reason I give this product a four star is that it is very confusing for people that this has nearly the same name as Smooth Down, as it is NOT the same product at ALL and does not work in the same way.</li>
            <li> I loved Smooth Down and this replacement is horrible.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Smooth Down for at least ten years</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how many high end brands ive used, only to end up disappointed.</li>
            <li> I use a flat iron to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> I do not need to use my flat iron when I use this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> This works miracles with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> It left my hair so dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> I have rather coarse and dry hair, so I needed something that would provide some moisture and control.  </li>
            <li> My hair gets fluffy, tangled and is much harder to make it go straight.</li>
            <li> I have flat, dry, flyaway hair.</li>
            <li> First I noticed that my hair got dirty much faster.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, it started to tangle.    </li>
            <li> I now have conditioner to avery long time.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> and it lasted long.</li>
            <li> after I wash, I closed the bottles up and returned to rite aid because I refuse to pay &amp;40 for a shampoo and conditioner that left my hair smelling like almonds for weeks after I stopped using it</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> I do believe this protects my hair from flatiron and blow dry damage.</li>
            <li> Smoothlock made my hair dry, unmanageable, brittle, and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely switching shampoos and pouring the rest of th bottles I have (bought 4 in bulk) down the drain.</li>
            <li> It made my mixed and very thick above shoulder hair grow to the middle of my back.</li>
            <li> This product has my hair looking so normal its unbelievable!</li>
            <li> My hair feels so tangled and dry, it takes ages to comb out the knots!</li>
            <li> My hair started falling out by the handfuls and it was brittle and dry!  </li>
            <li> I actually gave away my liters of shampoo and conditioner after using about half of the bottles.</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit of shampoo for it to foam.</li>
            <li> Also, you only need a little bit of conditioner for medium-length hair.</li>
            <li> Over the years, hundreds of dollars spent in frustration ended with my discovery of this product.</li>
            <li> Such a waste.</li>
            <li> But if you have thick hair that does whatever it wants, this sort of helps to tame it I guess.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely thick,coarse,curly and frizzy.</li>
            <li> Other than the fact that the shampoo itself is super-expensive...</li>
            <li> I even tried some of the other Redken conditioners but nothing compares to this.</li>
            <li> Typical solid transaction and experience from Amazon as usual.  </li>
            <li> Bought smooth lock on the assumption that it would be a similar if not better product and am soooooo disappointed.</li>
            <li> Down, think twice before buying it.</li>
            <li> Pouring it down the drain... &amp;#34;literally&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Down anyway.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely no complaints will buy again!!</li>
            <li> Weeks went by and my hair continued to appear less damaged.  </li>
            <li> Also, I am a bit disappointed that they discontinued Smooth Down.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it not only did NOTHING helpful for my hair; it made it worse.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, again it&#x27;s not Smooth Down!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought I could take it at least until the bottle was empty, but I can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> and this keeps my hair tame even in humid weather.</li>
            <li> This stuff not only smells bad, but it also left my hair a tangled mess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely less expensive than buying it from the local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> It feels horrible and stiff when it&#x27;s dried, nothing like how it felt with smooth down</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed but able to return with no issues.</li>
            <li> Maybe I received a bad batch because this is really unacceptable for such an expensive brand of hair products.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what all of the fuss is about...</li>
            <li> Extremely dissappointed to say the least !</li>
            <li> I usually get it from Walgreens online</li>
            <li> I am actually going to take the time to write a review because if you are anything like me, you are desperately looking for something to tame your hair.  </li>
            <li> So dull and straggly.</li>
            <li> The Smooth Lock is the worst product for my hair</li>
            <li> read some reviews about Smooth Lock smelling horrible....</li>
            <li> it is so thick.  </li>
            <li> Unbelievable!  </li>
            <li> this is my fav shampoo and conditioner and sometimes hard to find!  </li>
            <li> Much less expensive than salon prices!</li>
            <li> One of the caps was broken upon arrival.</li>
            <li> My hair hasn&#x27;t dried out or had any bad effects from this shampoo at all.  </li>
            <li> if you are sad that they stopped making that product.</li>
            <li> ... s&amp;h must have made something wrong though.</li>
            <li> So frustrating!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this company for making such an awful product!</li>
            <li> The tangles were impossible.  </li>
            <li> It has a really bad smell.  </li>
            <li> I shocked when I Smelled it while washing my hair</li>
            <li> and I am so disappointed with this &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m SO disappointed it has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> Well, I am completely disappointed as when I condition (and I use a lot of conditioner), my hair feels like hay.  </li>
            <li> Really disappointed about</li>
            <li> I have very crazy hair</li>
            <li> , I was disgusted, it REALLY STINKS, even my husband curled his nose, and then I went to wash my hair again with something else</li>
            <li> and I never throw products away because I hate to be wasteful</li>
            <li> I HATE IT!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hate this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It dries your hair very badly.</li>
            <li> WRONG!!!</li>
            <li> IT IS AWFUL!!!  </li>
            <li> This one smells awful and drying out my hair, If I could give it 0 stars  </li>
            <li> I tried it three times over the course of the days and each time it was a miserable experience.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s  horrible for your hair.</li>
            <li> and it smells awful!!</li>
            <li> The shampoo is tolerable, but the conditioner is awful.</li>
            <li> this is the worst smelling shampoo EVER!</li>
            <li> Awful!</li>
            <li> I almost cut off 4 inches of my hair because the ends looked horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Love it. Works great and leaves my hair less frizzy and more manageable. I&#x27;m glad I tried this product, it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Smooth Down for years after searching for longing than that for a shampoo/conditioner for my dry, frizzy hair.  I mistakenly bought Smooth Lock.  IT IS AWFUL!!!  Doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel smooth, doesn&#x27;t wash out well, leaving it feeling even drier than before.  Revlon needs to go back to Smooth Down now!!!</li>
            <li> This was switched with a different product It is NOT even the right color for the shampoo? Email me complete return instructions on this &amp; I will be contacting Amazon about this fraud service</li>
            <li> I used Smooth Down for years. There is nothing else that even compares. I went to replace my conditioner, and I was surprised to see it was not there. The lady at the salon said this was the same...WRONG!!! This stuff not only smells bad, but it also left my hair a tangled mess. Come on, Redken...bring back Smooth Down!!!</li>
            <li> the product was overall good.     I started using this after years of using supermarket brands. It improved my hair. My hair became more manageable.    After a couple of years using it I&#x27;ve stopped using it. It didn&#x27;t give me the same results. My hair is long, it started to tangle.    Bottom line: use it! This is good product for the right hair type.</li>
            <li> Great service!! Only took a week to get here. Whoever packaged it did a great job!! Absolutely no complaints will buy again!!</li>
            <li> ordered this because Smooth Down is discontinued</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo &amp; conditioner. It is the only kind that works well on my hair. I have thick, wavy, frizzy hair and this seems to tame it the best. I think it&#x27;s because of the almond oil. I enjoy the scent and the bigger bottles last me about 4 months.</li>
            <li> Everything was ok. Thanks</li>
            <li> I love this product especially the smooth down shampoo and condition. Works miracles on my hair its has a great lather and has my hair managble .. I fully recommended this product anytime.. been using it for 5 years.. BUY IT.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast!  this is my fav shampoo and conditioner and sometimes hard to find!  Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have used this product on and off for years.  I am Asian and my hair needs a good conditioner.  I like this shampoo and conditioner very much, but it seems to create a build-up after awhile, becuase my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as soft and silky.  A diluted vinegar rinse works well to get build up off, just make sure not to go to the gym or sweat around other people because the smell lasts for a few days.</li>
            <li> Just as others have stated in these reviews, I too have searched for many years for the right shampoo and conditioner. I cannot tell you how many high end brands ive used, only to end up disappointed. I used redken once before and it was no miracle. I decided to try one more time after seeing the description of this product. My hair is extremely thick,coarse,curly and frizzy. This product has my hair looking so normal its unbelievable! I am thrilled with the results! This product is a great buy!!!!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and makes my hair feel great.  I have been using it as a daily use shampoo and conditioner and so far so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have strange semi curly, semi straight, kind of frizzy hair, which I straighten daily.  My hair hasn&#x27;t dried out or had any bad effects from this shampoo at all.  It straightens easily with no other product.  But to be fair it has almost always done so with no extra product.</li>
            <li> Typical solid transaction and experience from Amazon as usual.  Other than the fact that the shampoo itself is super-expensive... it&#x27;s shampoo, what else is there to say?!?</li>
            <li> I always get either this either the blond collection from redken. I just love this brand, every product is indeed very good. My hair does look different now</li>
            <li> Bring back to original product! This one smells awful and drying out my hair, If I could give it 0 stars  I would!  Smooth Down was 100% better and smelled nice! This one is like buying some crappy cheap knockoff. Very disappointed in this company for making such an awful product!</li>
            <li> Redken Smooth Down Shampoo and Conditioner is sooo fantastic for dry, damaged, brittle breaking hair. I really thought my hair was beyond repair until i used these two products. The shampoo is very moisturizing and smells great. The conditioner smooth my hair down, and gave it back life. It really takes away the frizzies. I am a new fan of Redken. I also followed up with the smooth down treatment. The entire line is the best treat you can give your hair.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo I have ever used. Have curly/frizzy hair. This tames and shines it.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ITEM:  MAKES YOUR HAIR FEEL LIKE SILK AND SHINY. PRETTY MANGEABLE, FRIZZ FREE AND  VERY RESONABLY PRICED.THE SHAMPOO SUDS UP AND THE CREME RINSE RINSES OUT VERY WELL WITH OUT LEAVING YOUR HAIR GREASY.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo, conditioner and leave-in cream for about 2 years and I can&#x27;t  say enough how much I love them! Even my husband tried them  and he  is using them too (all but the leave- in smoothing cream, whatever it is called...). I am all about smells too and I won&#x27;t use anything that smells bad;  these smell absolutely wonderful!!! I won&#x27;t use another shampoo, it really helps my hair!</li>
            <li> Great price. Fast delivery.  Pleasure to deal with</li>
            <li> When Redken changed the name from Smoothdown to Smoothlock, they also changed the formula.  First I noticed that my hair got dirty much faster. Normally I can go 3 days before having to shampoo.  I use a flat iron to straighten my hair. The Smoothlock is supposed to protect against heat damage. But now I have to shampoo every other day, which of course is going to cause more heat damage.  I also noticed that my scalp itched something fierce. They now have wheat and soy in the formula.  Wheat and Soy are two of the 4 things that many people have allergies to. The four are diary, wheat, soy and nuts.</li>
            <li> I have used countless brands and formulas of shampoos and conditioners.  This is The Best I have ever used.  And wouldn&#x27;t you know, Redken is changing their formula yet again.  I used Smooth Down and I liked it.  But this one I love.  I&#x27;m going to stock up.  I do not need to use my flat iron when I use this shampoo and conditioner.  My hair is in the best condition it&#x27;s ever been in.  My beautician is amazed.</li>
            <li> I am actually going to take the time to write a review because if you are anything like me, you are desperately looking for something to tame your hair.  I looked high and low for a product and was willing to spend what it took; however, this product ended up my selection after a lot of research.  Unfortunately, it not only did NOTHING helpful for my hair; it made it worse.  After shampooing and conditioning with this duo, I could barely comb through my hair.  The tangles were impossible.  I tried it three times over the course of the days and each time it was a miserable experience.  Even after I was able to get all of the tangles out, there was absolutely no evidence of a frizz free look.  My hair was curlier and frizzier than ever.  Perhaps my type of hair is not what this product was intended to treat as I have read some positive reviews. My hair is long, fine, and curly. Very dissapointed. I hope if you buy this product it works better for you.  Back to the drawing board.</li>
            <li> I know prices sort of jump around on Amazon, but the price I bought these at was great, and lower than buying in-store, plus shipping was free.  Smooth Lock is great for difficult, frizzy/wavy hair.  Use with the Stay Sleek Lotion for best results.</li>
            <li> Love this product was glad to get them in a big bottle. I will look for this again &amp; recommend to friends</li>
            <li> This is the product that my hair stylist used and I really love it.  It is definitely more cost effective to purchase thorough Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great product.. Fast delivery</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the products and will buy from here again!</li>
            <li> Smells AMAZING!!! It&#x27;s so thick, smooth, and creamy. My daughter and I love it!</li>
            <li> Great value for your money. Smells nice. You only need a little bit of shampoo for it to foam. Also, you only need a little bit of conditioner for medium-length hair.</li>
            <li> I searched for years for the perfect shampoo and conditioner for my coarse, curly, frizzy hair. Over the years, hundreds of dollars spent in frustration ended with my discovery of this product. I will never buy another brand again. This one delivers -- I can either just blow dry my hair, taming it with a brush, for a more curly casual look, or I can use a flat iron for a silky straight do. Even in humid weather my hair doesn&#x27;t do the frizzy thing. AND Redken Smooth Down completely cures the winter static problem. Last winter I ran out of Redken, and used another product -- one of the many half full bottles of shampoos and conditioners stashed in the back of my cabinet. The whole day I was fighting static flyaways, and swore then and there to NEVER run out of Redken Smooth Down again...and I never have!</li>
            <li> Love this product...keeps my hair healthy and smooth. It last me about 3 months. Will purchase this product again love it</li>
            <li> I have extensive dried and brittle and damage hair and this product did make it a lot more manageable!  highly recommend</li>
            <li> If you find this thinking it&#x27;s the Sooth Down, think twice before buying it. It dries your hair very badly. My husband uses any shampoo, so he agreed to use this because I couldn&#x27;t. Even he said it dries your hair. His hair is very nice and never dries, but with this shampoo it did. I think Redken did us a disservice by changing the formulation of their wonderful Smooth Down shampoo.</li>
            <li> It works very well for my hair type which is coarse and because I color my hair, it can become dry.  I have tried more expensive products like Aveda, but they do not work as well for me.  I don&#x27;t get a build up of product because about every 3-4 shampoos, I rinse with vinegar which cleans the hair very nicely.  I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I bought these several months ago and they&#x27;re still about 1/3 full.  Granted I&#x27;m a guy with relatively short hair, but unless you are Fabio these definitely will last you a while.  The smelling isn&#x27;t too strong which I like, and you only need a little shampoo to make lots of foam.  Worth the extra money.  The conditioner is a kind of thick, so if you have thin hair, may not be good for you.  But if you have thick hair that does whatever it wants, this sort of helps to tame it I guess.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate. My hair is dry and brittle. My hair dresser suggested this product and I love it. I used to use Moroccan Oil shampoo and conditioner. Now Redken Smooth Lock is my new fav!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Both me &amp; my hubby use it!!</li>
            <li> This is the only Shampoo &amp; Conditioner that I use. It&#x27;s definitely less expensive than buying it from the local beauty supply store. Amazon is my go-to for this purchase, for sure!</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried! I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year now. Love it!</li>
            <li> Would not trade this product in for the world does wonders for your hair, and the bottles are huge and low priced I really like this aspect of it.</li>
            <li> I have flat, dry, flyaway hair. This shampoo and conditioner did a great job of adding moisture and lustre to my hair. It also smells really good.</li>
            <li> Excellent price and arrived properly packed. It s a good product to brush curly hair.</li>
            <li> Not sure what all of the fuss is about...this is the SMOOTH LOCK shampoo and conditioner.  It works perfectly, smells great, and is exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t purchase this thinking it is the smooth down, because it is not.  Contact Redkin if you are sad that they stopped making that product.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feel like rubber. They do not remotely compre to Smooth Down shampoo and conditioner. Very disappointed! I&#x27;m definitely switching shampoos and pouring the rest of th bottles I have (bought 4 in bulk) down the drain. Such a waste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed they discontinued Smooth Down because it really tamed my frizz and gave incredible moisture to my hair. This product does not feel the same. First time I used it I was surprised on how it didn&#x27;t feel like it did anything to my hair and was not as manageable as when I used smooth down. what people really need to understand! BIG THING! THIS IS NOT, I REPEAT, NOT the same thing as smooth down. This products is called smooth LOCK for a reason, it activates with heat, so the product won&#x27;t really work if you don&#x27;t apply heat. My hair was still a bit frizzy the first time I used it because I just let it air dry, BUT, when I straightened, curled or blew-dried it (with a diffuser, SO important for wavy or curly hair, USE A DIFFUSER for frizz-free hair), my hair completely changed. The frizz was COMPLETELY gone and my hair felt amazingly smooth. This product IS for people who use a lot of heat on their hair (like straightening, curling or blow drying their hair everyday)&lt;br /&gt;I feel most people who give it a 1-star rating, only do so because they do not know how to use this line or that it is not the same thing as Smooth Down. If you want something equivalent to Smooth Down, Redken did release the Diamond Oil and the All Soft line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I give this product a four star is that it is very confusing for people that this has nearly the same name as Smooth Down, as it is NOT the same product at ALL and does not work in the same way. Also, I am a bit disappointed that they discontinued Smooth Down.&lt;br /&gt;At the same time, this offers amazing heat protection and leaves your hair smooth and frizz-free after using heating tools. It also gives great hold! My hair stayed straight the entire day, even in humid weather</li>
            <li> Smooth lock smells like bug spray and leaves my hair fuzzy. I loved the way Smoth Down worked and now that is gone.  Shame on Redken.</li>
            <li> Love my shampoo and conditioner deal! Much less expensive than salon prices!</li>
            <li> ... s&amp;h must have made something wrong though. One of the caps was broken upon arrival. Didn&#x27;t leak though.</li>
            <li> I have really thick, wavy hair that gets dandruff very easily in the winter time and this was fairly good at managing my hair.  I have color treated hair and it barely faded though I do wish that it was a bit more moisturizing.  Not as huge a fan of the new formula but its still great for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review because of all the negative reviews comparing smooth down to smooth lock. Smooth lock is a different product, but it has heat protection  built in. I alternate between smooth lock, and all soft, and I use a mixture of the smooth lock serum and the extreme before I blow-dry. I love the Smooth lock products. My hair is in the best condition it&#x27;s been in, in years that&#x27;s to redkin heat protectant products. if you&#x27;re having issues with your hie drying out do what I do and alternate between all soft and smooth lock, I also don&#x27;t wash my hair daily I go every other day in the summer and aver 3-4 days in the winter, natural oils are good for your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the smell, I read one review  stating that smooth lock smells like floor cleaner, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case at all, it&#x27;s not my favorite smelling  shampoo (the one that I think smells the best is by Victoria&#x27;s Secret) however, I don&#x27;t think that the smell is bad, and it&#x27;s good for my hair, so I use it! I find that the shampoos that smell the best are often the worst for your hair, Herbal Essences smells great, but you couldn&#x27;t py me to use that crap, it&#x27;s  horrible for your hair.</li>
            <li> Smooth Lock STINKS--literally.  It has a really bad smell.  I will never buy it again.</li>
            <li> The Smooth Lock is the worst product for my hair I&#x27;ve ever purchased. It left my hair so dry and brittle. Could barely comb my hair without pulling like 10,000 strands of hair. The Smooth Down is so much better. Would be nice to get my money back. Extremely dissappointed to say the least !</li>
            <li> Perfect Gift. My daughter uses this product all the time. Love getting them for a gift as they are a little pricey for the 32.5 oz.</li>
            <li> I tried Smooth Lock, it&#x27;s not Smooth Down.  There is a big difference between the two products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read some reviews about Smooth Lock smelling horrible....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally thought that it smelled OK....BUT after trying it a second time, I smelled what everyone is complaining about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The performance is good, but YUCK, the smell.  The best that I would describe it, is cheap perfume that someone uses to cover up something....I could go on, but it would be obnoxious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, again it&#x27;s not Smooth Down!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time I try it, I will try to use a second rinse with another conditioner....maybe that will help??</li>
            <li> I have very crazy hair and this keeps my hair tame even in humid weather.</li>
            <li> I do believe this protects my hair from flatiron and blow dry damage. The smell?? Almost like chocolate...but old chocolate :).</li>
            <li> I have frizzy hair. This works miracles with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this shampoo and conditioner. It has a very nice fragrance and is especially good for dry hair.</li>
            <li> Smooth lock is not the same as Smoothdown. After over 8 years redken Smoothdown made me a believer. It made my mixed and very thick above shoulder hair grow to the middle of my back. I could actually wear it natural. This smooth lock did nothing but reverse what Smoothdown did. Smoothlock made my hair dry, unmanageable, brittle, and no shine. I even spoke to some of the beauty stores that also do hair for clients and they have had to change products. Please bring back Smoothdown and discontinue smooth lock.</li>
            <li> I always have used cheap brands and have long thick hair .. I&#x27;m a college student supporting myself so I never thought it was a good idea to invest in stuff like this .. I started working at a salon that is all redken and since I got a discount I figured I would give it a shot after hearing how much everyone loves it .. I switched everything over to redken and got the liters of smooth lock and I am beyond impressed .. So worth the money.. discount or not I would spend the money on it now my hair has never looked so healthy and shiny and although its more expensive  than what I used to use I use a significantly less amount especially of the conditioner I also strongly recommend the stay sleek and the all soft argon oil by redken ..  What you need to understand about smooth lock is that its for a specific type of hair so if your curious if its right for you just find a redken salon in your area and ask a stylist :)</li>
            <li> Its ridiculous that Redken can discontinue a product and this new one gets to completely take its place even with the reviews, most of the reviews here are for Smooth Down shampoo and conditioner, which is not the same as this. I thought I was going to be washing my hair with the same shampoo just a different name, boy was I shocked when I Smelled it while washing my hair, I was disgusted, it REALLY STINKS, even my husband curled his nose, and then I went to wash my hair again with something else, I have no idea why redken decided to wreck a perfect product!</li>
            <li> If I could rate this product a ZERO, I would. Smooth Down made my hair soft and manageable. Smooth Lock smells horrendous and my hair is nothing but frizz. Can anyone recommend something similar to Smooth Down? I need a replacement and I sure haven&#x27;t found another Redken product that comes close.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling smooth and smells very good.  Excellent for frizzy or dry hair (due to blow drying, after swimming, etc.).</li>
            <li> I got this shampoo and conditioner as a sample from my salon. Used it this stuff worked for me, smells great. I will be ordering this again</li>
            <li> Loved the smell and the way it conditioned my hair.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair dry, brittle and frizzy which is the exact opposite of what it says it&#x27;s supposed to do. I&#x27;m throwing it away and I never throw products away because I hate to be wasteful but I CANNOT continue to use this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Great deal on a great product.  I wish the deal for just shampoo was better.  I now have conditioner to avery long time.</li>
            <li> I have been using Redken Products for many years now. I love them and so I decided to try something new. The Smooth Lock shampoo and conditioner and it smells awful!! It has a very strong odor. It makes me nauseous. Complete waste of money. Sorry, just being honest. Pouring it down the drain... &amp;#34;literally&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> These are great Redken products! They last forever and ever. I still am using them and am very happy with them.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but feel so strongly about this I had to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am relieved to see that I am not the only person who thinks smooth lock is awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I (like lots of you) have been using Redken smooth down conditioner for many years. I couldn&#x27;t rate it higher. It made my hair (naturally a bit dry and frizzy) so soft I could leave it to dry naturally and it felt lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After visiting my local salon to buy a bottle of the trusted smooth down, I was told it had been swapped for smooth lock...I thought it would be the same but NO...after three washes I&#x27;m throwing it in the bin. My hair feels so tangled and dry, it takes ages to comb out the knots! It feels horrible and stiff when it&#x27;s dried, nothing like how it felt with smooth down conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks like I will be on the hunt for a good conditioner again now! Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring back smooth down!!</li>
            <li> This Smooth Lock combo has really done wonders for my hair.  I usually get it from Walgreens online and there are some people over there bashing the new formula so I thought I would spread the love over here as well because I really want this new formula to be around for a long time to come.  It cleans gently but thoroughly and it protects my hair without weighing it down.  After using it for a few months I feel like a model with how beautiful my hair manages and shines.  Won&#x27;t use anything else.  I even tried some of the other Redken conditioners but nothing compares to this.</li>
            <li> Love that I can buy this shampoo and conditioner on Amazon for cheaper than in the store or salon and that it comes right to my house!</li>
            <li> I first purchased a gift set of this product from my hairdresser in the fall. I had tried other Redken products that I didn&#x27;t care for, but felt like treating myself that day with something new.  I am so glad I did.  With the first use I suddenly had hair that appeared healthier.  Weeks went by and my hair continued to appear less damaged.  The frizz was gone.  Six weeks later I&#x27;m at my hairdresser.  I could barely wait for her to see the results.  She was just as thrilled as I was and described it as a \\&quot;complete transformation.\\&quot;  My hair finally looks like the hair on the models that you see in the magazines.  It&#x27;s absolutely beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  I also used a second product called Argan-6 (Redken).  One squirt applied to my hair after it is dried created a healthy shine.  I highly recommend that product too.</li>
            <li> If anyone can recommend a shampoo and conditioner to replace Smooth down, because Smooth lock is awful, my hair has gone dry and frizzy since using it, it smells like really strong floor cleaner. I HATE IT!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Smooth Down for at least ten years and I can&#x27;t believe they could swap it for something so rubbish and pretend they&#x27;ve improved it. I would give this no stars at all if I could.</li>
            <li> First time using this product and happy with it so far.  Nice scent and good results.</li>
            <li> My hair is unruly but this product does help more that I thought it would.  I wish I could say it is awesome, but let&#x27;s say it is above average.  thank you</li>
            <li> No comparison to Smooth Down and the vendor insisted they mailed the Smooth Down, they didn&#x27;t.  I was very disappointed but able to return with no issues.</li>
            <li> My time is up for writing reviews. I bought this for a friend in South Africa. I am not using it.</li>
            <li> Love it! Great for all types of hair.</li>
            <li> First off, note that the picture for this product when I ordered it was for Smooth Down liters.  When I received my shipment it contained the Smooth Lock.  I should have returned it at the time but I figured I would give it a try since I knew they had discontinued Smooth Down anyway.  I hate this stuff.  The shampoo is tolerable, but the conditioner is awful. It is super thick and you would think your hair would feel silky smooth considering it is so thick.  In fact it&#x27;s just the opposite. My hair feels feels anything but smooth after using this stuff.  I have been using Smooth Down for years and I am so disappointed with this &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; formula.  Now I have these liter bottles to use, which will take me 3-4 months.  I would like to throw them away but that&#x27;s a lot of money to throw away.  So frustrating!</li>
            <li> I have used smooth down for years and loved it. Smooth Lock is not the same product. My hair started falling out by the handfuls and it was brittle and dry!  I am on the lookout for a new shampoo. I want the original Smooth Down back!</li>
            <li> It is working perfectly</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a smooth down fan stick with smooth down.  The shampoo and conditioner are good and could get 4 stars even, but definitely not a replacement for smooth down. I notice a difference. Been using smooth down for about 5 years now and this is not quite as good.  No shampoo really helps my frizz but smooth down was definitely the best.</li>
            <li> I have used Smooth Down for a long time and I love it. I&#x27;m SO disappointed it has been discontinued. I gave Smooth Lock a try, and while I think it performs well, I can&#x27;t handle the scent. I actually gave away my liters of shampoo and conditioner after using about half of the bottles. I am pregnant, so I&#x27;m sure that has a lot to do with my extra sensitivity, but it doesn&#x27;t have a fresh, crisp scent like Smooth Down did. I loved everything about Smooth Down and I just hope I can find something else I like as much. But my hair did look and feel great with Smooth Lock. Very smooth and it lasted long.</li>
            <li> this is the worst smelling shampoo EVER! I loved smooth down and was excited to use this, after I wash, I closed the bottles up and returned to rite aid because I refuse to pay &amp;40 for a shampoo and conditioner that left my hair smelling like almonds for weeks after I stopped using it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Redken smooth down for years and was a massive fun so was gutted when Redken decided to discontinue it. Bought smooth lock on the assumption that it would be a similar if not better product and am soooooo disappointed. My hair gets fluffy, tangled and is much harder to make it go straight. Bring back smooth down is all I can say!!!</li>
            <li> Awful! Would give zero starts if I could. GET SMOOTH DOWN instead. Smooth Lock destroyed my hair. My hair was like straw. So dull and straggly. I never realized it was from Smooth Lock. I almost cut off 4 inches of my hair because the ends looked horrible. I switched to Smooth Down and from day one, my hair was soft and smooth again. They need to take this line off the market because clearly I&#x27;m not the only one having this issue with Smooth Lock.</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner/shampoo because of the brand name and reviews.  I have rather coarse and dry hair, so I needed something that would provide some moisture and control.  Well, I am completely disappointed as when I condition (and I use a lot of conditioner), my hair feels like hay.  I can&#x27;t believe it.  Maybe I received a bad batch because this is really unacceptable for such an expensive brand of hair products.  I will give this away or throw in the trash.  I went to Target and bought Suave Humectant Moisture and it is 100% better.  My hair feels soft, silky and is shiny!.  And, for the same size as this Redken product, it only cost $2.50!!  Unbelievable!  I wish I could get my money back from this junk!  Try to get a sample before buying!  I wish I had!</li>
            <li> I loved Smooth Down and this replacement is horrible.  It does not smooth my hair the way Smooth Down did, and I can no longer take the smell.  I thought I could take it at least until the bottle was empty, but I can&#x27;t.  I will be throwing away the Smooth Lock Shampoo and Conditioner and finding another product to use.  I do not understand why Redken discontinued the Smooth Down and replaced it with this stinky stuff.</li>
            <li> I would give this 0 if I could. Smells like repugnant aniseed and leaves a greasy residue in your hair feels like im using cheap regular shampoo, i am sure it has given me a folliculitis pimple never had this problem with smooth down. Really disappointed about this cause I have been using smooth down for 2 1/2 years. I will never buy any redken shampoo or conditioner ever again, kerastase for me!</li>
