    <ol>
            <li>Fits well on my razor and works great!</li>
            <li>Very happy with product.</li>
            <li>Perfect product,just as described.</li>
            <li>This is the PERFECT length buzzer for me!</li>
            <li>It will be nice if you came up with a 2 inch comb too!!  </li>
            <li>Any hope you improve more overtime!!</li>
            <li>ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE ON HAND</li>
            <li>Clipper comb works good.  </li>
            <li>Additional .5 inches of hair to enjoy :D</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Over all it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>LOVE this!</li>
            <li>Able to do own hair care when ever I want!</li>
            <li>The fewer tines don&#x27;t lift up your hair nearly as effectively.</li>
            <li>Husband grew a goatee and found he liked the 1 1/2 length.</li>
            <li>So this will trim his Goatee up nicely.</li>
            <li>I spend plenty of time on it to ensure that a nice job is done.</li>
            <li>I am not a barber but have cut my own hair for many years using scissors and guides I created.</li>
            <li>Love there clippers</li>
            <li>I look devastatingly handsome now.</li>
            <li>i hope this help you :-)</li>
            <li>11/2\\&quot; on top (\\&quot;crown\\&quot;), the \\&quot;rim\\&quot; is 11/4\\&quot; and</li>
            <li>I hope they&#x27;d perfect this before long.</li>
            <li>Happy so far.  </li>
            <li>Sturdy, accurate, easy to use, Super!</li>
            <li>But overall this is a pretty awesome</li>
            <li>I was happy to see wahl actually had a comb that size!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light plastic and the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; of the attachment tend to spread apart or move together if you apply just a bit too much pressure.</li>
            <li>Will need to cut my hair more to really know.</li>
            <li>My hair regrew and everyone loved it very short</li>
            <li>i was able to buy from Walh website directly and they didnt charge for shipping.</li>
            <li>Shaving my own hair has saved a ton of time and money, the only downside is that you&#x27;re stuck with the 1 inch guide (max) that comes with the clippers...</li>
            <li>success with the 11/2\\</li>
            <li>Cuts hair at just the right lenght when 1 in.</li>
            <li>On the downside, this buzzer takes a while to get all of the hair and many areas have be gone over multiple times, but that is an inherent problem with this length, not the product itself.</li>
            <li>Even my soft fine hair stands up straight.</li>
            <li>Also, the attachment didn&#x27;t snap on very securely; it would rattle around a bit loosely.</li>
            <li>They seem to bend sideways so much that it feels like they might collapse.</li>
            <li>It flexes too much....</li>
            <li>Very soon, perhaps.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair, spray the product in it and use a stylist&#x27;s pick to make the hair stand straight up from my head.</li>
            <li>Does not work very well.</li>
            <li>I find that the 1&amp;#34; is too short, but this is just right!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised that they would approve such a poor product given the excellent quality of their clippers.</li>
            <li>The other Wahl attachments work just fine.</li>
            <li>And, yeah, its flimsy but I can live with it.</li>
            <li>Clipper was ok, but it feel soft and wanting to break, I been using it a few time now</li>
            <li>It should work fine, as I have several other sizes, but haven&#x27;t use this particular item  yet.</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical on how 1 1/2 inches would work with my Wahl clipper, but it works great!</li>
            <li>Garbage Whale product soft rubber can not be used.</li>
            <li>I wish I could have bought this from Wahl direct.</li>
            <li>It could probably use at least 2 more pines and stronger plastic to make it sturdier.</li>
            <li>If the hair is soft textured the problem is compounded.</li>
            <li>Does not catch hairs like the shorter, more common lengths.</li>
            <li>When I use it, it barely cuts any hair, but when I use the 1-1/4\\&quot; attachment it works like a charm.</li>

            <li> If you don&#x27;t push down too hard while using it with your clippers it works fine.</li>
            <li> Moreover, the tines are far less rigid than on the smaller combs.</li>
            <li> This is especially problematic because the cut is so long.</li>
            <li> I expected this attachment to be very similar to the ones that came with the clipper, but it&#x27;s rather different.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, these tend to bend if you apply too much force, giving you an uneven shave.</li>
            <li> This makes a bigger difference in performance than I expected.</li>
            <li> this will cut hair 2 inches long</li>
            <li> 2 inches at the salon is too long.</li>
            <li> I read other preview and everyone complaints about the same situation!!</li>
            <li> I have tried using the 1-1/2\\&quot; attachment several times now and have decided to just put it aside due to its incompetence.</li>
            <li> I allow it to dry.</li>
            <li> I was able to fix that myself by carefully heating the base of the retaining tab over a candle and gently bending it in a little.</li>
            <li> The only down fall is that the teeth of the comb is not sturdy like the others</li>
            <li> so an extra half inch is a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> is just a little to short.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve got to be careful.</li>
            <li> The longer the hair becomes, the harder it is to use a guide because the hair drapes away from the clipper.</li>
            <li> I even ran it thru slowly to give the pines a chance to raise my 3\\&quot; long hair to cut, but to no avail.</li>
            <li> They are a little flexible, but they do the job</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little flimsy.</li>
            <li> real issue here is not the quality of Wahl&#x27;s product but the physics of cutting the hair with a guide and clipper.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not easy to attach to your clippers (gotta manhandle it).</li>
            <li> I am pretty disappointed but what can you expect for less than five bucks?</li>
            <li> &quot; guide I owe to using Tresemme Dramatic Volume Blow Dry Lotion.</li>
            <li> this thing is unbelievable</li>
            <li> it sort of bents slightly from side to side  as you run it thru the hair!!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s probably due to the thin and fewer pines.</li>
            <li> Soft and malleable, giving you an uneven shave :(</li>
            <li> so I guess it must be made by Wahl or at least by a manufacturer that they have approved.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t complaint</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beyond ridiculous.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit flimsy which can lead to cutting hair shorter than expected.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am rather disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> but this is just sad.</li>
            <li> As of now, it&#x27;s practically useless.</li>
            <li> It helps make my cutting hair time shorter and faster!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> LOVE this! Cuts hair at just the right lenght when 1 in. is just a little to short. Fits well on my razor and works great!</li>
            <li> Garbage Whale product soft rubber can not be used.Love there clippers but this is just sad.</li>
            <li> it works for me. My wife cuts my hair once a month with it and then uses ear trimmer pieces to finish me off. I look devastatingly handsome now.</li>
            <li> this thing is unbelievable</li>
            <li> i was able to buy from Walh website directly and they didnt charge for shipping. i used my paypal acc to pay for 2 clipper attachments.  i hope this help you :-)</li>
            <li> I expected this attachment to be very similar to the ones that came with the clipper, but it&#x27;s rather different. It only has 5 tines whereas the standard ones have 7. This makes a bigger difference in performance than I expected. The fewer tines don&#x27;t lift up your hair nearly as effectively. This is especially problematic because the cut is so long. Moreover, the tines are far less rigid than on the smaller combs. They seem to bend sideways so much that it feels like they might collapse. Also, the attachment didn&#x27;t snap on very securely; it would rattle around a bit loosely. I was able to fix that myself by carefully heating the base of the retaining tab over a candle and gently bending it in a little. I do things like that a lot, but it might not be something you would want to try if you haven&#x27;t done things like that before. There&#x27;s a risk of ruining it.       Overall, I am rather disappointed with this product. It does have the Wahl brand name on it so I guess it must be made by Wahl or at least by a manufacturer that they have approved. I&#x27;m surprised that they would approve such a poor product given the excellent quality of their clippers. Then again, it does work so I gave it two stars instead of one.</li>
            <li> I was happy to see wahl actually had a comb that size!! It helps make my cutting hair time shorter and faster!! It will be nice if you came up with a 2 inch comb too!!  The only down fall is that the teeth of the comb is not sturdy like the others so it sort of bents slightly from side to side  as you run it thru the hair!! I read other preview and everyone complaints about the same situation!! Any hope you improve more overtime!!</li>
            <li> ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE ON HAND</li>
            <li> Clips on to Wahl clipper, clips off the hair! Sturdy, accurate, easy to use, Super!</li>
            <li> Clipper comb works good.  Very happy with product.</li>
            <li> Shaving my own hair has saved a ton of time and money, the only downside is that you&#x27;re stuck with the 1 inch guide (max) that comes with the clippers... so an extra half inch is a noticeable difference. On the other hand, these tend to bend if you apply too much force, giving you an uneven shave. But overall this is a pretty awesome product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO: Additional .5 inches of hair to enjoy :D&lt;br /&gt;CON: Soft and malleable, giving you an uneven shave :(</li>
            <li> Happy so far.  Will need to cut my hair more to really know.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use! It flexes too much....</li>
            <li> Doers what it&#x27;s supposed to do no problems</li>
            <li> 3 and 1/2 stars. The clipper attachment is bigger than it looks. And it&#x27;s not easy to attach to your clippers (gotta manhandle it). And, yeah, its flimsy but I can live with it. It does it&#x27;s job. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;That aside..  $8.80 for shipping?!!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;$4.99 for the product, $8.80 for shipping... so buyer beware. It&#x27;s beyond ridiculous. I wish I could have bought this from Wahl direct.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good. I needed a longer length. But they should have made it stiffer. It&#x27;s very light plastic and the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; of the attachment tend to spread apart or move together if you apply just a bit too much pressure. You&#x27;ve got to be careful.</li>
            <li> Too flimsy to cut longer hair. I am pretty disappointed but what can you expect for less than five bucks?</li>
            <li> It should work fine, as I have several other sizes, but haven&#x27;t use this particular item  yet. Very soon, perhaps.</li>
            <li> I bought this product 4 years ago and still does the job every time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISLIKES&lt;br /&gt;-nothing i dislike about this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LIKES&lt;br /&gt;-tapers accurately&lt;br /&gt;-fits onto a standard buzzer&lt;br /&gt;-sturdy&lt;br /&gt;-affordable/reasonable price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 star rated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;any questions post below!</li>
            <li> Wish I could buy an even bigger one</li>
            <li> Husband grew a goatee and found he liked the 1 1/2 length. So this will trim his Goatee up nicely.</li>
            <li> Able to do own hair care when ever I want! Saves alot of money  &amp; trips to the beauty shop.Fits well on my clippers.</li>
            <li> I have tried using the 1-1/2\\&quot; attachment several times now and have decided to just put it aside due to its incompetence. It doesn&#x27;t cut my hair to 1-1/2\\&quot; length. I&#x27;ve tried running it thru my hair from various directions but it still wouldn&#x27;t work. I even ran it thru slowly to give the pines a chance to raise my 3\\&quot; long hair to cut, but to no avail. I think it&#x27;s probably due to the thin and fewer pines. It could probably use at least 2 more pines and stronger plastic to make it sturdier. As of now, it&#x27;s practically useless. When I use it, it barely cuts any hair, but when I use the 1-1/4\\&quot; attachment it works like a charm. The difference between the two is 1/4\\&quot;!! I hope they&#x27;d perfect this before long. The other Wahl attachments work just fine.</li>
            <li> this will cut hair 2 inches long</li>
            <li> Clipper was ok, but it feel soft and wanting to break, I been using it a few time now and it does do it&#x27;s job so I can&#x27;t complaint</li>
            <li> Not as sturdy as shorter guides, but still functional.</li>
            <li> I am not a barber but have cut my own hair for many years using scissors and guides I created. When I was diagnosed with breast cancer I couldn&#x27;t even imagine anyone else shearing my hair off but me prior to chemo. I bought the Wahl 24 piece clipper set, the 11/4\\&quot; and 11/2\\&quot; guides and Wahl&#x27;s DVD on cutting hair which shows you how to cut your own hair. I knew my hair would regrow, so teaching myself how to cut my hair allowed me to shorten it gradually and finally prepare for wearing a wig. My hair regrew and everyone loved it very short so that is how I cut it: 11/2\\&quot; on top (\\&quot;crown\\&quot;), the \\&quot;rim\\&quot; is 11/4\\&quot; and nape is 1\\&quot; and I use a guide I created from a plastic file folder along with scissors to shape the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My success with the 11/2\\&quot; guide I owe to using Tresemme Dramatic Volume Blow Dry Lotion.I wash my hair, spray the product in it and use a stylist&#x27;s pick to make the hair stand straight up from my head. I allow it to dry. Even my soft fine hair stands up straight. I go over my head with the 11/2\\&quot; guide on the clipper and \\&quot;assist\\&quot; the hair into guide. I repeatedly go over my head with the guide from multiple different directions. I spend plenty of time on it to ensure that a nice job is done.Then I change to the 11/4\\&quot; to do the \\&quot;rim\\&quot; (the sides and back) and 1\\&quot; for the nape. You taper between guide lengths by rocking the clipper backwards as you approach the area of longer hair. You can use any product the stiffens the hair but leaves it comb-able.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real issue here is not the quality of Wahl&#x27;s product but the physics of cutting the hair with a guide and clipper. The longer the hair becomes, the harder it is to use a guide because the hair drapes away from the clipper. If the hair is soft textured the problem is compounded. Don&#x27;t be discouraged trying to save money doing this. Try stiffening the hair and see if your guide doesn&#x27;t become \\&quot;5 star\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may be retiring in several years and am contemplating returning to school to reinvent myself as - you guessed it - a barber!invent myself as - you guessed it - a barber!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit flimsy which can lead to cutting hair shorter than expected.</li>
            <li> They are a little flexible, but they do the job</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical on how 1 1/2 inches would work with my Wahl clipper, but it works great! 1 inch is too short and 2 inches at the salon is too long.</li>
            <li> Perfect product,just as described.</li>
            <li> This is the PERFECT length buzzer for me! I find that the 1&amp;#34; is too short, but this is just right! On the downside, this buzzer takes a while to get all of the hair and many areas have be gone over multiple times, but that is an inherent problem with this length, not the product itself.</li>
            <li> Does not work very well. Does not catch hairs like the shorter, more common lengths.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little flimsy. If you don&#x27;t push down too hard while using it with your clippers it works fine. Over all it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
