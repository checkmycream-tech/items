            <li>Love the scent of this cologne!</li>
            <li>Honestly, this is one of my favorite colognes ever!</li>
            <li>This cologne smells amazing</li>
            <li>Amazing silage and amazing longevity.</li>
            <li>They both smell amazing.</li>
            <li>I saw Givenchy at Macy&#x27;s and really liked the smell.</li>
            <li>I would reccomend that if you are buying ANY kind of perfume of calone do it in stores by a registered seller of the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many comments on how good I smell.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite sents and my wife always makes a good comment when I</li>
            <li>so I already knew I liked the scent but wanted to find a cheaper option.     </li>
            <li>I own Rochas men as well.</li>
            <li>I bought this cologne after reading about it in a popular mens magazine.</li>
            <li>is very mild and pleasant.</li>
            <li>Great fragrance, arrived quickly...</li>
            <li>This cologne came quickly and in great shape.</li>
            <li>pretty good!</li>
            <li>and this is the best for a young man.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great scent that is mainly sweet and somewhat floral with undertones that are more spiced and manly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smell good but is not the original .</li>
            <li>it can be used daytime just fine!</li>
            <li>, it is a very cheap knock off...</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s light and inoffensive, which gives it credence as a sweet, happy smell that won&#x27;t bother people.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite cologne and thought the price was probably too good to be true.</li>
            <li>Good rate too on Amazon and shipped quickly..</li>
            <li>women love it</li>
            <li>I love it and it is my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>I found it, I bought it, and what can I say I love it.</li>
            <li>and then the scent will linger close to the skin and mellow, making it really enjoyable to smell your wrist during the day.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>The scent is more along the sweeter side.</li>
            <li>This turned out to be everything I hoped it would be and more.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Amazon continues to offer world class service and gladly worked with me to resolve the issue.</li>
            <li>and I fear this is how many others receive theirs as well.   </li>
            <li>We spent a lot of time talking about what kind of ingredients were in each cologne and what occasions each was best suited for.</li>
            <li>on top of that i can tell this is diluted with water and rubbing alcohol, it burns the skin when its sprayed...</li>
            <li>I used to get this at a dept. store for almost $30 more</li>
            <li>but I love this</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this cologne.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I decided to take the chance and am glad I did.</li>
            <li>It is also my favorite at the moment.  </li>
            <li>I use this one the most.  </li>
            <li>I used it like two years ago or more.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t why I still love it</li>
            <li>I love when my husband wears it.</li>
            <li>Love the smell...</li>
            <li>This is an excellent cologne and use it as my daily scent.</li>
            <li>It brought back wonderful memories :-)</li>
            <li>However, I can 100% confirm that I got an authentic bottle from Amazon (not marketplace), but I DO believe it when people say they didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I disagree with the assertion that this is more a nighttime scent-</li>
            <li>Many say it goes arm&#x27;s length-</li>
            <li>If it projected more, it would be much better.</li>
            <li>i just recieve this perfume and also 3 more</li>
            <li>I will for sure use this company again everything came in with out a hitch.</li>
            <li>and i recieve many compliments when wearing this cologne .</li>
            <li>you will get compliments from the ladies for sure.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite cologne and my lady loves it.</li>
            <li>This is a really great cologne and I like the bottle form factor a lot since it makes traveling with it much easier.</li>
            <li>This is the one I like the smell of the most as well that he owns.  </li>
            <li>I have had more women ask me what this fragrance is than anything else I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Too many.</li>
            <li>80% of the time I receive an authentic fragrance.</li>
            <li>Fragrance was just ok.</li>
            <li>Really pleased with what I purchased.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>It is perhaps more of a \\&quot;going</li>
            <li>Much better price than Macys.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>I bought this solely off of reputation and reviews and I&#x27;m fully satisfied.</li>
            <li>HOPE THAT HELPS GUYS :)  -Brian C.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not on the TOP SHELF</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s lovely though.</li>
            <li>and I must say the cologne was spot on, the ladies love the smell</li>
            <li>and I could ask for a better cologne.</li>
            <li>Over the years I tried different brands you name it , This is the best of all .</li>
            <li>More like something to wear to school or work.</li>
            <li>Great cologne, for a decent price.</li>
            <li>I purchased my original bottle from Macy&#x27;s and absolutely loved its rich sweet warm scent that lasted</li>
            <li>While I am aware that the cologne has been reformulated and the bottle has been changed, I would like to mention that the bottle I received did not match the one in the picture, as the bottle in the picture shows the pre-formulated (supposedly superior) fragrance.  </li>
            <li>First time I see this product at Macys and found good  price at Amazon.</li>
            <li>Original fake&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay !&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;40 dollar of the original product dilute !</li>
            <li>Easy to remember because of its sexual connotation.</li>
            <li>It smells soft and women seem to love it lol.</li>
            <li>The notes i smell remind me of that good coffee smell, Mixed with a good summer day.</li>
            <li>It has kind of a sweet smell not too strong.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking to try a new scent, You&#x27;ll love it!!</li>
            <li>It has such a unique wonderful scent.</li>
            <li>It has such a unique wonderful scent.  </li>
            <li>This is very true to the scent we smelled on ship.</li>
            <li>If you like colognes with a sweet scent this will likely be perfect for you.  </li>
            <li>This product was  gift, but I think I enjoy smelling it more than he does.  </li>
            <li>I just received my bottle today, and it&#x27;s that same brilliant stuff.</li>
            <li>like the product and will continue to use it, however I honestly don&#x27;t think it was worth the all money, and would have preferred to have an updated image shown of the product...</li>
            <li>is good because i really like the smell and</li>
            <li>and you are good to go for the whole day.  </li>
            <li>The other &amp;#34;Play&amp;#34; is great too!</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t a lot of excess bulk plus the flatter design allows for easy transport in my shaving bag.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this perfume at Macys for $81.00 its a very unique smell</li>
            <li>I have over 60 bottles of cologne and this is definitely right there close to the top, ladies love it</li>
            <li>I was able to receive a full refund.</li>
            <li>I think this is the best smelling cologne hands down.  </li>
            <li>Lasts long , attractive and refreshing .&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is an excellent, and pleasant spicy and somewhat sweet and a long lasting people please.</li>
            <li>When I first smelled it before spraying, I thought it smelled very strong and pungent.</li>
            <li>I really like it and it combines well with my own scent.</li>
            <li>Really enjoy this cologne.</li>
            <li>Bought on Amazon, I saved a great amount and it is the same scent I got turned on to through a retailer....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m comfortable with.</li>
            <li>and then it&#x27;d be more rare, but I just can&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s my primary perfume.</li>
            <li>I use this for Friday nights when I&#x27;m going out to the local pub always gotten great compliments on it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that Amazon has a great price on this compared to the going to the mall or a specific fragrance shop.</li>
            <li>It is a good, masculine fragrance.</li>
            <li>The only real way to describe this scent is delicious..</li>
            <li>Its got a good fragrance..really fresh and classy !!!</li>
            <li>It makes you want to order a martini and impress the woman you&#x27;re sitting next to with your unique brand of charming and witty banter.</li>
            <li>Glad I got it from Amazon (I used my other, non-reviewing account lol).</li>
            <li>The scent is very nice and very addictive.  </li>
            <li>Decent price.. Could always be better though:)</li>
            <li>Such a great price for it and it ships quickly.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for any occasion but is usually recommended for evening use.</li>
            <li>My original review, which you can find below, is glowing.</li>
            <li>Original Review</li>
            <li>It looks like this product isn&#x27;t original.</li>
            <li>well that&#x27;s what many have told me ;)</li>
            <li>Nothing at all like the original.  </li>
            <li>I usually use Issey Miyake, but Play is definitely best for night time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The box was thinner than the original.</li>
            <li>The box edges that get tugged in when you close the box were shorter than the original.</li>
            <li>With that said however, buying perfume online is a risky business with so many fakes, if this is your first time you might want to buy it retail.</li>
            <li>I guess I got a original one, it came all sealed</li>
            <li>It smells very fresh, sweet, and almost feminine in a way.</li>
            <li>(bought him a new bottle kindly).  </li>
            <li>Musky and clean all at once.</li>
            <li>great; just as i expected.</li>
            <li>Not too sweet, not too musky</li>
            <li>Givenchy Play Intense by Givenchy for Men is my favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li>Longer lasting good smell.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Givenchy Play Intense.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Givenchy Play Intense.  </li>
            <li>So sweet</li>
            <li>It also projects very well, so no need to spray more than 3-4 times on your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is only for men that want good comments.</li>
            <li>It is on the sweet side</li>
            <li>longevity is good 8 hrs and projection is solid.</li>
            <li>a sweet, sport and sensual scent</li>
            <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Givenchy&#x27;s Play intense is a sexy fragrance.</li>
            <li>This was not the authentic play intense by givenchy.  </li>
            <li>the bottle is really cool looking</li>
            <li>One of whom purchased a sweet smelling car scent because she stated it smelt like me.</li>
            <li>shipped so fast &amp; exactly what was pictured!!!</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend that you first go to a department store and see how you like the smell.</li>
            <li>Smell is strong, intense, and romancing as it should be!</li>
            <li>clean and  fresh...</li>
            <li>Quick delivery</li>
            <li>This is definitely one of my favorite scents, I get many compliments from women when I wear it.  </li>
            <li>and she claims it better than her dads cologne which is sayin something since her dads was her favorite scent (key word WAS)!</li>
            <li>Smells great, obviously i wouldn&#x27;t buy a cologne without trying it first, but this was the cheapest place i can find it and know that it&#x27;s legit (not a fake).</li>
            <li>The lasting time is pretty good-- one spray will continue projecting for about 4 hours</li>
            <li>Usually givenchy lasts for good 6-8 hrs!</li>
            <li>With just 3 sprays Givenchy Play Intense projects a sweet masculine oriental-gourmand with hints of vanilla, coffee, and warm spicy qualities that continue on for 7-12 hours on the dry-down.</li>
            <li>The new bottle design is much more attractive without the mp3 player cheese, but it is still plain.</li>
            <li>It is exatly the same amazing smell that I tried in Sephora.</li>
            <li>This cologne is AMAZING, if you&#x27;re looking to leave a lasting impression on anyone you encounter, go with this.</li>
            <li>She rarely says anything about cologne</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bought this direct from Amazon LLC (i make it a point to buy most if not</li>
            <li>This cologne is worth having in every man&#x27;s collection.  </li>
            <li>When I first took the cap off and smelled it, I&#x27;ll admit that I didn&#x27;t enjoy the scent at first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always opted for the more aquatic and masculine colognes, so this was a radical departure for me.</li>
            <li>; The ladies LOVE this scent as I get comments from nearly everyone I am in contact with.</li>
            <li>I own about 30 different bottles.</li>
            <li>or a rare case miss.</li>
            <li>It had white particles (kind of like tissue paper particles) inside the box when I opened it.</li>
            <li>I get stopped daily and told I smell nice and what am I wearing.</li>
            <li>Every female that has smelled this has liked it and I agree.</li>
            <li>This cologne far exceeded my expectations, I personally love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>I have appropriately 90 different men&#x27;s colognes ranging from Bond 9 to good old Eternity and can&#x27;t forget Cool Water.  </li>
            <li>Givenchy Play Intense is Superior due to its unique scent.  </li>
            <li>bottle looks very close to the original.</li>
            <li>, it is right in between.</li>
            <li>Price is right too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Givenchy Play was the right choice for me.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell like right</li>
            <li>DO!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now hesitant to buy colognes or scents from Amazon because of this, ALTHOUGH customer service was great and I will still hold Amazon in high regards and continue to be a customer though this incident made an otherwise great relationship between me and Amazon a little sour.</li>

            <li>These two fragrances fall under the same category of Sweet coffee/ sexy gourmand</li>
            <li>and he asks what perfume lol its nothing compared to the crazy nice smell i got from givenchy blue label its nice to have on</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was quite excited when I first got this in the mail, as reviews said it was a longevity and sillage monster, however, it was rather light and only lasted about 4 hours before becoming a skin close scent, while for comparison, I sampled this and got about 8 hours ~ longevity and a much heavier scent.  </li>
            <li>It took me a long time to find a scent I liked.</li>
            <li>it is very manly yet soft and subtle very nice to wear out for dinner wearing nice suit or dress up shirt.</li>
            <li>Actually stole this from a friend because I liked it so much</li>
            <li>Amazon customer service was extremely professional and easy to work with.  </li>
            <li>BRAND NEW, SEALED &amp; LEGIT FROM AMAZON.COM LLC!!!</li>
            <li>Smells like STRONG , STRONG ALCOHOL SMELL when first sprayed then dies down to something that smells like one of those cheap &amp;#34;Cigar&amp;#34; (Cuba) colognes or a very feint &amp;#34;Ferrari Black&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I came back and the fragrance lasted for more than 8 hours.</li>
            <li>It is overall ok product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never purchased a cologne before without having smelled it first.  </li>
            <li>So much cheaper online!</li>
            <li>Great long lasting scent.</li>
            <li>No, instead the smell is much more alcohol-like and does not last at all.</li>
            <li>The cologne I received on this order would not be able to elicit a female response even thirty minutes after I had sprayed it.</li>
            <li>When I buy this cologne again, it will most likely be through Amazon.</li>
            <li>When I buy this cologne again, it will most likely be through Amazon.    </li>
            <li>this was my first time buying a fregrance from amazon.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not the exact scent I was looking for.</li>
            <li>After I sprayed it on my skin though, it&#x27;s like it became a completely different (and enjoyable) scent.</li>
            <li>Big bottle, scent lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li>Smells great and is long lasting.  </li>
            <li>women love it, can&#x27;t say enough.</li>
            <li>Also it did not last more than 1 hour on my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overpowering so they would need to stand pretty close to smell it, but hey, works for me.  </li>
            <li>Would suggest to anyone who is interested</li>
            <li>It smells exactly like what a $92.00 cologne SHOULD smell like.</li>
            <li>First time buyer from this seller</li>
            <li>But i think for most people this one could last 6 to 10 hours.</li>
            <li>When i first smelled it the first thing that came to mind was brut aftershave.</li>
            <li>out\\&quot; cologne rather than an everyday smell good cologne, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>Applying a second spray later in the day will boost it up and make other people notice when you&#x27;re out.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a wonderful slightly sweet scent that will give you and others hours of pleasure.</li>
            <li>After a while it will dull and become very warm.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this cologne right when it came out from my local mall for $92.00, and it was well worth it...</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a certain lingering undertone to this cologne that just puts me in a better mood, while making me feel like a man at the same time.  </li>
            <li>Not sure what else to say - smells great, plenty of compliments on it - highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Great subtle scent....</li>
            <li>And because of the price I couldn&#x60;t help but buy it:)  The shipping was fast enough.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t quite feel the coffee notes as strongly as people are saying, but once the high-notes drop down you kind of get a creamy light coffee fragrance buried in the tonka bean and other goodies.</li>
            <li>Product was exactly what I wanted and arrived very timely.  </li>
            <li>It is really strong when you spray it but fades ever so slightly to that comfortable &amp;#34;I can smell it but not overpowering&amp;#34; spot.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;d received such strong recommendations, and the reviews here were so positive, that I took a gamble.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price was great, fast delivery, actually faster than all the other items I ordered.</li>
            <li>Its fairly strong so you only need 3 to 4 sprays.</li>
            <li>ok its cologne, this smells cirtus like with a strong man smell on delicate undertones of some some flowers.  </li>
            <li>Throughout the midnotes, it becomes more pleasant and less bitter, however I do not think it is worth it for the initial repulsion.</li>
            <li>I have tried over 50 different types, and I am still coming back for more!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to buy the play intense version.</li>
            <li>It arrived very soon.</li>
            <li>Purchased for my husband; he really likes it.</li>
            <li>it self has no rewind or fast forward &amp;#60;&amp;#60; &amp;#62;&amp;#62; on the sides nor does it display it on the front</li>
            <li>Found this price to be reasonable.</li>
            <li>Givenchy Play Intense.</li>
            <li>Intense...</li>
            <li>, I would say try Play before trying Intense...</li>
            <li>both are absolute winners, Givenchy has made me a newfound fragrance addict,</li>
            <li>I spray this givenchy play intense</li>
            <li>Found it here on amazon and a much cheaper price so decided to buy it...</li>
            <li>really recommend it.</li>
            <li>Some guy really knew his stuff and</li>
            <li>This was given as a gift for nephew, he loves the smell, not too over powering,  he really likes it a lot</li>
            <li>It lasts all day and you don&#x27;t need to spray a whole lot...</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Intense.</li>
            <li>Play Intense tops all those in my eyes.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend can not get over how much she loves the smell</li>
            <li>I really like this one.</li>
            <li>I really like the way this smells</li>
            <li>It is real and there&#x27;s a website you can check the dates with the serial number on the bottom</li>
            <li>Very masculine smelling and a long time favorite of my husbands.</li>
            <li>Has a nice sweet undertone with a little bit of spice mixed in.</li>
            <li>The smell is not rich and warm as it would normally be described.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s had more compliments on it than any other cologne he has ever worn.</li>
            <li>I must admit I was excited to receive this cologne initially.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been reading some of the other comments that say the cologne they received wasn&#x27;t authentic...</li>
            <li>It is fairly strong and sharp at first.</li>
            <li>I needed a cologne to match all the new cloths I bought since i&#x27;ve never bought and wore a cologne of my own, usually just whatever my friends use and are willing to give me a sprits of.</li>
            <li>Its the real thing, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I received several complements specially from girls.</li>
            <li>Its more watered down version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The box was authentic with black interior packaging as well as a serial number which matched on both the box and the bottle.</li>
            <li>This scent is on the stronger side, so less is more.</li>
            <li>It still smells the exact same as it did when i first got it.</li>
            <li>It took me a while to find this cologne at a decent price at the department stores.  </li>
            <li>The smell comes off as somewhat of a somewhat bitter, somewhat pungent, slightly sweet scent at first.</li>
            <li>But the women absolutely love it, I am definitely getting longer hugs and constantly being asked; &amp;#34;what fragrance is</li>
            <li>It comes in a decently sized bottle as well.</li>
            <li>Intense is better if you want to have a long lasting perfume.</li>
            <li>It does last long enough to make some good impressions though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The real magic is after you&#x27;ve sprayed it on your skin and let it dry for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I work as an IT Technician for a high school</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very sophisticated scent with a subtle sweetness.</li>
            <li>I bought this blind after seeing great reviews on this one.</li>
            <li>Bought on amazon and just delivered today, I probably should wait a few days and use it some more till I make a review, but already it has me hooked.</li>
            <li>but seriously, something tells me that over time, it is going to take first, and very happy I chose the large spray instead of the small, wish I would have done the same with Play.</li>
            <li>but I give the smell itself a strong 3/5 (average).</li>
            <li>in all, this cologne wasn&#x27;t what I expected, but I&#x27;m definitely not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Everyone do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t purchase a new cologne or perfume unless it&#x27;s in person</li>
            <li>but now I think this is gonna be my new hit.</li>
            <li>It has a very classy scent to it.  </li>
            <li>and I never fail to get compliments and female friends standing very near me.</li>
            <li>While, I do like others, from other designers and even the regular \\&quot;Play\\&quot;, this happens to be my top choice.  </li>
            <li>bottle has no NO RUBBER SIDING, there are also NO &amp;#60;&amp;#60;RRWD  FFWD&amp;#62;&amp;#62;  on the upper sides of the bottle and the bottom front of the bottle has a flat surface not the &amp;#34;square&amp;#34; like design on a real Givenchy Play Intense!</li>
            <li>(original one has black).</li>
            <li>With the clear bottle.</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase of Givenchy Play Intense</li>
            <li>Makes you look into having your teeth professionally whitened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The sprayer appeared intact and the bottle had all marketing markings which my old bottle has.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cologne for nearly 5 years</li>
            <li>One thing I noted in my research is that although this item is marked as &amp;#34;sold&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;fulfilled&amp;#34; by Amazon, it is not wholly the case.</li>
            <li>A telltale sign of this is that the box is not packaged with Amazon&#x27;s identifiable tape.</li>
            <li>I have since worn this cologne nearly every day</li>
            <li>ALL my Amazon purchases directly from Amazon!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>did not want to write a negative review of Amazon LLC, but I feel obligated as a consumer to  either warn others or in many cases praise items in which I purchased!&lt;br</li>
            <li>did not want to write a negative review of Amazon LLC, but I feel obligated as a consumer to  either warn others or in many cases praise items in which I purchased!&lt;br</li>
            <li>looking for one to compete with it, this I think will take a very close second, though...</li>
            <li>was completely sealed.</li>
            <li>Givenchy brand looks promising, likely to purchase another within the brand in the coming months!</li>
            <li>My old fave was Givenchy Pi</li>
            <li>Over the course of about a year, I completely used up the contents of the bottle.</li>
            <li>Boy, let me tell you, I couldn&#x27;t click the \\&quot;Add to Cart\\&quot; button fast enough.</li>
            <li>WILD, I HAVE.</li>
            <li>cheap imitation!!</li>
            <li>stuff smells pretty similar, but not the same.</li>
            <li>My body tends to absorb colognes quickly because i don&#x27;t drink enough water and for those that don&#x27;t dehydration makes your skin absorb moisture so fragrances won&#x27;t last as long on your skin.</li>
            <li>As the name says, it is intense and lasts all day long!</li>
            <li>Overall I recommend this for guys trying to find a new scent or for the women trying to find a scent they&#x27;d like on a man.</li>
            <li>At least, not until this month  The most recent order I received checked out in every way.</li>
            <li>Just be aware of the hidden costs.</li>
            <li>My other colognes are YSL Intense, and John Varvatos Vintage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a kind of a freak original perfume person.</li>
            <li>, I absolutely love this scent, I get an extremely pleasant tonka bean and pink pepper dry down with a hint of coffee, but it just seemed lighter and watered down compared to what I&#x27;ve heard, leading me to believe the cologne was reformulated or I received a fake...  </li>
            <li>Many online sellers have old products where the smell has faded or changed, or the product is fake all together.</li>
            <li>i love givenchy brand perfumes i use to be addicted to givenchy blue label</li>
            <li>the package was exactly the same, it was as if it was watered down..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got other colognes from them, so they&#x27;re really the only one&#x27;s I trust.  </li>
            <li>The first time I smelled this cologne was actually a few years back inside of a maxim magazine I believe.</li>
            <li>I was a little bit doubt about the quality because the price was really decent!  </li>
            <li>Opened package, and sprayed cologne , it smells like pure alcohol , with a little resemblance of cologne in the background, and this is the 3rd item of the same purchased from amazon</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Honestly, this is one of my favorite colognes ever!</li>
            <li> This cologne smells amazing</li>
            <li> Amazing silage and amazing longevity.</li>
            <li> They both smell amazing.</li>
            <li> I saw Givenchy at Macy&#x27;s and really liked the smell.</li>
            <li> I would reccomend that if you are buying ANY kind of perfume of calone do it in stores by a registered seller of the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many comments on how good I smell.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite sents and my wife always makes a good comment when I</li>
            <li> so I already knew I liked the scent but wanted to find a cheaper option.     </li>
            <li> I own Rochas men as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne after reading about it in a popular mens magazine.</li>
            <li> is very mild and pleasant.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance, arrived quickly...</li>
            <li> This cologne came quickly and in great shape.</li>
            <li> pretty good!</li>
            <li> and this is the best for a young man.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great scent that is mainly sweet and somewhat floral with undertones that are more spiced and manly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smell good but is not the original .</li>
            <li> it can be used daytime just fine!</li>
            <li> , it is a very cheap knock off...</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s light and inoffensive, which gives it credence as a sweet, happy smell that won&#x27;t bother people.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne and thought the price was probably too good to be true.</li>
            <li> Good rate too on Amazon and shipped quickly..</li>
            <li> women love it</li>
            <li> I love it and it is my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> I found it, I bought it, and what can I say I love it.</li>
            <li> and then the scent will linger close to the skin and mellow, making it really enjoyable to smell your wrist during the day.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> The scent is more along the sweeter side.</li>
            <li> This turned out to be everything I hoped it would be and more.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Amazon continues to offer world class service and gladly worked with me to resolve the issue.</li>
            <li> and I fear this is how many others receive theirs as well.   </li>
            <li> We spent a lot of time talking about what kind of ingredients were in each cologne and what occasions each was best suited for.</li>
            <li> on top of that i can tell this is diluted with water and rubbing alcohol, it burns the skin when its sprayed...</li>
            <li> I used to get this at a dept. store for almost $30 more</li>
            <li> but I love this</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cologne.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I decided to take the chance and am glad I did.</li>
            <li> It is also my favorite at the moment.  </li>
            <li> I use this one the most.  </li>
            <li> I used it like two years ago or more.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t why I still love it</li>
            <li> I love when my husband wears it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell...</li>
            <li> This is an excellent cologne and use it as my daily scent.</li>
            <li> It brought back wonderful memories :-)</li>
            <li> However, I can 100% confirm that I got an authentic bottle from Amazon (not marketplace), but I DO believe it when people say they didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I disagree with the assertion that this is more a nighttime scent-</li>
            <li> Many say it goes arm&#x27;s length-</li>
            <li> If it projected more, it would be much better.</li>
            <li> i just recieve this perfume and also 3 more</li>
            <li> I will for sure use this company again everything came in with out a hitch.</li>
            <li> and i recieve many compliments when wearing this cologne .</li>
            <li> you will get compliments from the ladies for sure.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne and my lady loves it.</li>
            <li> This is a really great cologne and I like the bottle form factor a lot since it makes traveling with it much easier.</li>
            <li> This is the one I like the smell of the most as well that he owns.  </li>
            <li> I have had more women ask me what this fragrance is than anything else I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Too many.</li>
            <li> 80% of the time I receive an authentic fragrance.</li>
            <li> Fragrance was just ok.</li>
            <li> Really pleased with what I purchased.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> It is perhaps more of a \\&quot;going</li>
            <li> Much better price than Macys.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this solely off of reputation and reviews and I&#x27;m fully satisfied.</li>
            <li> HOPE THAT HELPS GUYS :)  -Brian C.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not on the TOP SHELF</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s lovely though.</li>
            <li> and I must say the cologne was spot on, the ladies love the smell</li>
            <li> and I could ask for a better cologne.</li>
            <li> Over the years I tried different brands you name it , This is the best of all .</li>
            <li> More like something to wear to school or work.</li>
            <li> Great cologne, for a decent price.</li>
            <li> I purchased my original bottle from Macy&#x27;s and absolutely loved its rich sweet warm scent that lasted</li>
            <li> While I am aware that the cologne has been reformulated and the bottle has been changed, I would like to mention that the bottle I received did not match the one in the picture, as the bottle in the picture shows the pre-formulated (supposedly superior) fragrance.  </li>
            <li> First time I see this product at Macys and found good  price at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Original fake&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay !&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;40 dollar of the original product dilute !</li>
            <li> Easy to remember because of its sexual connotation.</li>
            <li> It smells soft and women seem to love it lol.</li>
            <li> The notes i smell remind me of that good coffee smell, Mixed with a good summer day.</li>
            <li> It has kind of a sweet smell not too strong.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone looking to try a new scent, You&#x27;ll love it!!</li>
            <li> It has such a unique wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> It has such a unique wonderful scent.  </li>
            <li> This is very true to the scent we smelled on ship.</li>
            <li> If you like colognes with a sweet scent this will likely be perfect for you.  </li>
            <li> This product was  gift, but I think I enjoy smelling it more than he does.  </li>
            <li> I just received my bottle today, and it&#x27;s that same brilliant stuff.</li>
            <li> like the product and will continue to use it, however I honestly don&#x27;t think it was worth the all money, and would have preferred to have an updated image shown of the product...</li>
            <li> is good because i really like the smell and</li>
            <li> and you are good to go for the whole day.  </li>
            <li> The other &amp;#34;Play&amp;#34; is great too!</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a lot of excess bulk plus the flatter design allows for easy transport in my shaving bag.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this perfume at Macys for $81.00 its a very unique smell</li>
            <li> I have over 60 bottles of cologne and this is definitely right there close to the top, ladies love it</li>
            <li> I was able to receive a full refund.</li>
            <li> I think this is the best smelling cologne hands down.  </li>
            <li> Lasts long , attractive and refreshing .&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is an excellent, and pleasant spicy and somewhat sweet and a long lasting people please.</li>
            <li> When I first smelled it before spraying, I thought it smelled very strong and pungent.</li>
            <li> I really like it and it combines well with my own scent.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy this cologne.</li>
            <li> Bought on Amazon, I saved a great amount and it is the same scent I got turned on to through a retailer....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m comfortable with.</li>
            <li> and then it&#x27;d be more rare, but I just can&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s my primary perfume.</li>
            <li> I use this for Friday nights when I&#x27;m going out to the local pub always gotten great compliments on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that Amazon has a great price on this compared to the going to the mall or a specific fragrance shop.</li>
            <li> It is a good, masculine fragrance.</li>
            <li> The only real way to describe this scent is delicious..</li>
            <li> Its got a good fragrance..really fresh and classy !!!</li>
            <li> It makes you want to order a martini and impress the woman you&#x27;re sitting next to with your unique brand of charming and witty banter.</li>
            <li> Glad I got it from Amazon (I used my other, non-reviewing account lol).</li>
            <li> The scent is very nice and very addictive.  </li>
            <li> Decent price.. Could always be better though:)</li>
            <li> Such a great price for it and it ships quickly.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for any occasion but is usually recommended for evening use.</li>
            <li> My original review, which you can find below, is glowing.</li>
            <li> Original Review</li>
            <li> It looks like this product isn&#x27;t original.</li>
            <li> well that&#x27;s what many have told me ;)</li>
            <li> Nothing at all like the original.  </li>
            <li> I usually use Issey Miyake, but Play is definitely best for night time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The box was thinner than the original.</li>
            <li> The box edges that get tugged in when you close the box were shorter than the original.</li>
            <li> With that said however, buying perfume online is a risky business with so many fakes, if this is your first time you might want to buy it retail.</li>
            <li> I guess I got a original one, it came all sealed</li>
            <li> It smells very fresh, sweet, and almost feminine in a way.</li>
            <li> (bought him a new bottle kindly).  </li>
            <li> Musky and clean all at once.</li>
            <li> great; just as i expected.</li>
            <li> Not too sweet, not too musky</li>
            <li> Givenchy Play Intense by Givenchy for Men is my favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li> Longer lasting good smell.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Givenchy Play Intense.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Givenchy Play Intense.  </li>
            <li> So sweet</li>
            <li> It also projects very well, so no need to spray more than 3-4 times on your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is only for men that want good comments.</li>
            <li> It is on the sweet side</li>
            <li> longevity is good 8 hrs and projection is solid.</li>
            <li> a sweet, sport and sensual scent</li>
            <li> one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Givenchy&#x27;s Play intense is a sexy fragrance.</li>
            <li> This was not the authentic play intense by givenchy.  </li>
            <li> the bottle is really cool looking</li>
            <li> One of whom purchased a sweet smelling car scent because she stated it smelt like me.</li>
            <li> shipped so fast &amp; exactly what was pictured!!!</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend that you first go to a department store and see how you like the smell.</li>
            <li> Smell is strong, intense, and romancing as it should be!</li>
            <li> clean and  fresh...</li>
            <li> Quick delivery</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of my favorite scents, I get many compliments from women when I wear it.  </li>
            <li> and she claims it better than her dads cologne which is sayin something since her dads was her favorite scent (key word WAS)!</li>
            <li> Smells great, obviously i wouldn&#x27;t buy a cologne without trying it first, but this was the cheapest place i can find it and know that it&#x27;s legit (not a fake).</li>
            <li> The lasting time is pretty good-- one spray will continue projecting for about 4 hours</li>
            <li> Usually givenchy lasts for good 6-8 hrs!</li>
            <li> With just 3 sprays Givenchy Play Intense projects a sweet masculine oriental-gourmand with hints of vanilla, coffee, and warm spicy qualities that continue on for 7-12 hours on the dry-down.</li>
            <li> The new bottle design is much more attractive without the mp3 player cheese, but it is still plain.</li>
            <li> It is exatly the same amazing smell that I tried in Sephora.</li>
            <li> This cologne is AMAZING, if you&#x27;re looking to leave a lasting impression on anyone you encounter, go with this.</li>
            <li> She rarely says anything about cologne</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bought this direct from Amazon LLC (i make it a point to buy most if not</li>
            <li> This cologne is worth having in every man&#x27;s collection.  </li>
            <li> When I first took the cap off and smelled it, I&#x27;ll admit that I didn&#x27;t enjoy the scent at first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always opted for the more aquatic and masculine colognes, so this was a radical departure for me.</li>
            <li> ; The ladies LOVE this scent as I get comments from nearly everyone I am in contact with.</li>
            <li> I own about 30 different bottles.</li>
            <li> or a rare case miss.</li>
            <li> It had white particles (kind of like tissue paper particles) inside the box when I opened it.</li>
            <li> I get stopped daily and told I smell nice and what am I wearing.</li>
            <li> Every female that has smelled this has liked it and I agree.</li>
            <li> This cologne far exceeded my expectations, I personally love the way it smells.</li>
            <li> I have appropriately 90 different men&#x27;s colognes ranging from Bond 9 to good old Eternity and can&#x27;t forget Cool Water.  </li>
            <li> Givenchy Play Intense is Superior due to its unique scent.  </li>
            <li> bottle looks very close to the original.</li>
            <li> , it is right in between.</li>
            <li> Price is right too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Givenchy Play was the right choice for me.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like right</li>
            <li> DO!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now hesitant to buy colognes or scents from Amazon because of this, ALTHOUGH customer service was great and I will still hold Amazon in high regards and continue to be a customer though this incident made an otherwise great relationship between me and Amazon a little sour.</li>

            <li> These two fragrances fall under the same category of Sweet coffee/ sexy gourmand</li>
            <li> and he asks what perfume lol its nothing compared to the crazy nice smell i got from givenchy blue label its nice to have on</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was quite excited when I first got this in the mail, as reviews said it was a longevity and sillage monster, however, it was rather light and only lasted about 4 hours before becoming a skin close scent, while for comparison, I sampled this and got about 8 hours ~ longevity and a much heavier scent.  </li>
            <li> It took me a long time to find a scent I liked.</li>
            <li> it is very manly yet soft and subtle very nice to wear out for dinner wearing nice suit or dress up shirt.</li>
            <li> Actually stole this from a friend because I liked it so much</li>
            <li> Amazon customer service was extremely professional and easy to work with.  </li>
            <li> BRAND NEW, SEALED &amp; LEGIT FROM AMAZON.COM LLC!!!</li>
            <li> Smells like STRONG , STRONG ALCOHOL SMELL when first sprayed then dies down to something that smells like one of those cheap &amp;#34;Cigar&amp;#34; (Cuba) colognes or a very feint &amp;#34;Ferrari Black&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I came back and the fragrance lasted for more than 8 hours.</li>
            <li> It is overall ok product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never purchased a cologne before without having smelled it first.  </li>
            <li> So much cheaper online!</li>
            <li> Great long lasting scent.</li>
            <li> No, instead the smell is much more alcohol-like and does not last at all.</li>
            <li> The cologne I received on this order would not be able to elicit a female response even thirty minutes after I had sprayed it.</li>
            <li> When I buy this cologne again, it will most likely be through Amazon.</li>
            <li> When I buy this cologne again, it will most likely be through Amazon.    </li>
            <li> this was my first time buying a fregrance from amazon.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not the exact scent I was looking for.</li>
            <li> After I sprayed it on my skin though, it&#x27;s like it became a completely different (and enjoyable) scent.</li>
            <li> Big bottle, scent lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li> Smells great and is long lasting.  </li>
            <li> women love it, can&#x27;t say enough.</li>
            <li> Also it did not last more than 1 hour on my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overpowering so they would need to stand pretty close to smell it, but hey, works for me.  </li>
            <li> Would suggest to anyone who is interested</li>
            <li> It smells exactly like what a $92.00 cologne SHOULD smell like.</li>
            <li> First time buyer from this seller</li>
            <li> But i think for most people this one could last 6 to 10 hours.</li>
            <li> When i first smelled it the first thing that came to mind was brut aftershave.</li>
            <li> out\\&quot; cologne rather than an everyday smell good cologne, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> Applying a second spray later in the day will boost it up and make other people notice when you&#x27;re out.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a wonderful slightly sweet scent that will give you and others hours of pleasure.</li>
            <li> After a while it will dull and become very warm.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this cologne right when it came out from my local mall for $92.00, and it was well worth it...</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a certain lingering undertone to this cologne that just puts me in a better mood, while making me feel like a man at the same time.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what else to say - smells great, plenty of compliments on it - highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great subtle scent....</li>
            <li> And because of the price I couldn&#x60;t help but buy it:)  The shipping was fast enough.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t quite feel the coffee notes as strongly as people are saying, but once the high-notes drop down you kind of get a creamy light coffee fragrance buried in the tonka bean and other goodies.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I wanted and arrived very timely.  </li>
            <li> It is really strong when you spray it but fades ever so slightly to that comfortable &amp;#34;I can smell it but not overpowering&amp;#34; spot.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;d received such strong recommendations, and the reviews here were so positive, that I took a gamble.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price was great, fast delivery, actually faster than all the other items I ordered.</li>
            <li> Its fairly strong so you only need 3 to 4 sprays.</li>
            <li> ok its cologne, this smells cirtus like with a strong man smell on delicate undertones of some some flowers.  </li>
            <li> Throughout the midnotes, it becomes more pleasant and less bitter, however I do not think it is worth it for the initial repulsion.</li>
            <li> I have tried over 50 different types, and I am still coming back for more!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to buy the play intense version.</li>
            <li> It arrived very soon.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my husband; he really likes it.</li>
            <li> it self has no rewind or fast forward &amp;#60;&amp;#60; &amp;#62;&amp;#62; on the sides nor does it display it on the front</li>
            <li> Found this price to be reasonable.</li>
            <li> Givenchy Play Intense.</li>
            <li> Intense...</li>
            <li> , I would say try Play before trying Intense...</li>
            <li> both are absolute winners, Givenchy has made me a newfound fragrance addict,</li>
            <li> I spray this givenchy play intense</li>
            <li> Found it here on amazon and a much cheaper price so decided to buy it...</li>
            <li> really recommend it.</li>
            <li> Some guy really knew his stuff and</li>
            <li> This was given as a gift for nephew, he loves the smell, not too over powering,  he really likes it a lot</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and you don&#x27;t need to spray a whole lot...</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Intense.</li>
            <li> Play Intense tops all those in my eyes.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend can not get over how much she loves the smell</li>
            <li> I really like this one.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this smells</li>
            <li> It is real and there&#x27;s a website you can check the dates with the serial number on the bottom</li>
            <li> Very masculine smelling and a long time favorite of my husbands.</li>
            <li> Has a nice sweet undertone with a little bit of spice mixed in.</li>
            <li> The smell is not rich and warm as it would normally be described.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s had more compliments on it than any other cologne he has ever worn.</li>
            <li> I must admit I was excited to receive this cologne initially.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been reading some of the other comments that say the cologne they received wasn&#x27;t authentic...</li>
            <li> It is fairly strong and sharp at first.</li>
            <li> I needed a cologne to match all the new cloths I bought since i&#x27;ve never bought and wore a cologne of my own, usually just whatever my friends use and are willing to give me a sprits of.</li>
            <li> Its the real thing, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I received several complements specially from girls.</li>
            <li> Its more watered down version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The box was authentic with black interior packaging as well as a serial number which matched on both the box and the bottle.</li>
            <li> This scent is on the stronger side, so less is more.</li>
            <li> It still smells the exact same as it did when i first got it.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to find this cologne at a decent price at the department stores.  </li>
            <li> The smell comes off as somewhat of a somewhat bitter, somewhat pungent, slightly sweet scent at first.</li>
            <li> But the women absolutely love it, I am definitely getting longer hugs and constantly being asked; &amp;#34;what fragrance is</li>
            <li> It comes in a decently sized bottle as well.</li>
            <li> Intense is better if you want to have a long lasting perfume.</li>
            <li> It does last long enough to make some good impressions though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The real magic is after you&#x27;ve sprayed it on your skin and let it dry for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I work as an IT Technician for a high school</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very sophisticated scent with a subtle sweetness.</li>
            <li> I bought this blind after seeing great reviews on this one.</li>
            <li> Bought on amazon and just delivered today, I probably should wait a few days and use it some more till I make a review, but already it has me hooked.</li>
            <li> but seriously, something tells me that over time, it is going to take first, and very happy I chose the large spray instead of the small, wish I would have done the same with Play.</li>
            <li> but I give the smell itself a strong 3/5 (average).</li>
            <li> in all, this cologne wasn&#x27;t what I expected, but I&#x27;m definitely not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Everyone do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t purchase a new cologne or perfume unless it&#x27;s in person</li>
            <li> but now I think this is gonna be my new hit.</li>
            <li> It has a very classy scent to it.  </li>
            <li> and I never fail to get compliments and female friends standing very near me.</li>
            <li> While, I do like others, from other designers and even the regular \\&quot;Play\\&quot;, this happens to be my top choice.  </li>
            <li> bottle has no NO RUBBER SIDING, there are also NO &amp;#60;&amp;#60;RRWD  FFWD&amp;#62;&amp;#62;  on the upper sides of the bottle and the bottom front of the bottle has a flat surface not the &amp;#34;square&amp;#34; like design on a real Givenchy Play Intense!</li>
            <li> (original one has black).</li>
            <li> With the clear bottle.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of Givenchy Play Intense</li>
            <li> Makes you look into having your teeth professionally whitened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The sprayer appeared intact and the bottle had all marketing markings which my old bottle has.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cologne for nearly 5 years</li>
            <li> One thing I noted in my research is that although this item is marked as &amp;#34;sold&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;fulfilled&amp;#34; by Amazon, it is not wholly the case.</li>
            <li> A telltale sign of this is that the box is not packaged with Amazon&#x27;s identifiable tape.</li>
            <li> I have since worn this cologne nearly every day</li>
            <li> ALL my Amazon purchases directly from Amazon!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> did not want to write a negative review of Amazon LLC, but I feel obligated as a consumer to  either warn others or in many cases praise items in which I purchased!&lt;br</li>
            <li> did not want to write a negative review of Amazon LLC, but I feel obligated as a consumer to  either warn others or in many cases praise items in which I purchased!&lt;br</li>
            <li> looking for one to compete with it, this I think will take a very close second, though...</li>
            <li> was completely sealed.</li>
            <li> Givenchy brand looks promising, likely to purchase another within the brand in the coming months!</li>
            <li> My old fave was Givenchy Pi</li>
            <li> Over the course of about a year, I completely used up the contents of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Boy, let me tell you, I couldn&#x27;t click the \\&quot;Add to Cart\\&quot; button fast enough.</li>
            <li> WILD, I HAVE.</li>
            <li> cheap imitation!!</li>
            <li> stuff smells pretty similar, but not the same.</li>
            <li> My body tends to absorb colognes quickly because i don&#x27;t drink enough water and for those that don&#x27;t dehydration makes your skin absorb moisture so fragrances won&#x27;t last as long on your skin.</li>
            <li> As the name says, it is intense and lasts all day long!</li>
            <li> Overall I recommend this for guys trying to find a new scent or for the women trying to find a scent they&#x27;d like on a man.</li>
            <li> At least, not until this month  The most recent order I received checked out in every way.</li>
            <li> Just be aware of the hidden costs.</li>
            <li> My other colognes are YSL Intense, and John Varvatos Vintage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a kind of a freak original perfume person.</li>
            <li> , I absolutely love this scent, I get an extremely pleasant tonka bean and pink pepper dry down with a hint of coffee, but it just seemed lighter and watered down compared to what I&#x27;ve heard, leading me to believe the cologne was reformulated or I received a fake...  </li>
            <li> Many online sellers have old products where the smell has faded or changed, or the product is fake all together.</li>
            <li> i love givenchy brand perfumes i use to be addicted to givenchy blue label</li>
            <li> the package was exactly the same, it was as if it was watered down..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got other colognes from them, so they&#x27;re really the only one&#x27;s I trust.  </li>
            <li> The first time I smelled this cologne was actually a few years back inside of a maxim magazine I believe.</li>
            <li> I was a little bit doubt about the quality because the price was really decent!  </li>
            <li> Opened package, and sprayed cologne , it smells like pure alcohol , with a little resemblance of cologne in the background, and this is the 3rd item of the same purchased from amazon</li>
            <li> I am addicted to Play Original, and</li>
            <li> The bottle looks pretty sporty and guy-like too, so at least you won&#x27;t get harassed by any of your buddies about that.</li>
            <li> Listen up if you want a real review from an ordinary guy you might want to relate to, or even if you&#x27;re a woman looking for a scent for her man.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last as long</li>
            <li> I was looking for something last long when you put it</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t wear cologne often, so this should last him quite a long time.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, compliment getter.</li>
            <li> Has a long lasting aroma that both I &amp; others around me pick up on.</li>
            <li> The scent Did not last long as it should have, keep in mind that you can not return this product if you purchase it.</li>
            <li> last long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no effective way to describe this other than a sweet smelling product.</li>
            <li> It may seem like too much at first but it will ensure a slow and balanced diffusion.</li>
            <li> Definitely was a fake, box was made out of a material a step up from tissue paper and the fragrance smelt like alcohol with a small hint of some kind of woodsy smell.</li>
            <li> in the pictures i supplied of you look at the two, the real givenchy is on the left while the fake is on the right, things like the box is what is a dead give away...</li>
            <li> The pink pepper definitely stands out, along with a hint of coffee.</li>
            <li> I really do not like the initial notes.</li>
            <li> Goes a long ways and is not too overhwelming.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a perfume for a long time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this before from Sephora, and decided to purchase it again due to it running low.</li>
            <li> I believe it wasn&#x27;t original or there was something wrong with it.</li>
            <li> , maybe they got a bad batch, took it to macys and the cologne specialist at the store advised it is fake, or an OK replica, the fixer does not hold , and it has a strong smell of alcohol.</li>
            <li> I did not bother taking back since I did that for my last few amazon products.........</li>
            <li> The original scent lasts 10+ hours, the fake lasted roughly about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> At a price that was still cheaper than in stores, I decided I would rather pay 7-8 more dollars to ensure I am getting the real product from Amazon rather than a fake one from a random seller I knew nothing about.</li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s any complaint, it&#x27;s that it doesn&#x27;t project very far in my experience.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical with the reviews saying it was fake, but it is indeed a genuine Givenchy Play Intense.</li>
            <li> PARTIALLY fault Amazon because they are the ones who do business with &amp;#34;DISTRIBUTORS&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Rated 4 stars because shipping was slower than expected.</li>
            <li> It was a little bit sharp initially but became smoother and sweeter with time.</li>
            <li> The bottle looks different, the sprayer never worked correctly, and it feels slightly like rubbing alcohol on the skin and has a slightly week fragrance.</li>
            <li> A very low key but subtle fragrance.</li>
            <li> After narrowing my selection down to a few, this was the one I kept coming back to.</li>
            <li> It was cheaper than the other places I visited to buy it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this cologne from Amazon three times over the past several years.</li>
            <li> looked up some perfume stores in the area in which my items were shipped and found some shady websites that are based in the same area in which this Amazon distributor is located!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> like!e stores in the area in which my items were shipped and found some shady websites that are based in the same area in which this Amazon distributor is located!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like an extremely ripe fruit or something.</li>
            <li> but no one will smell it other than u after 10 minutes</li>
            <li> I wanted to rate this 1 star so that other people wouldn&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> com or any other online retail stores.</li>
            <li> It was only recently that I was browsing Amazon and found that the same cologne was going for HALF THE PRICE ($46.00!?!?!?!?!).</li>
            <li> I thought it is 24 hours active but could not see that impact.</li>
            <li> I bought it from Amazon directly and not third party because I have never received a fake doing it that way.</li>
            <li> My heart stopped beating when I saw the bottle was different than the one pictured, but after short research, I found out the late 2013 to now bottles have a new design without the silly FF and RW buttons and the odd square on the bottom</li>
            <li> bought this product from Amazon and not another seller due to the whole \\&quot;fake product\\&quot; issue.</li>
            <li> To me this is a very casual cologne though, not something to wear on a special night.</li>
            <li> Not worth anything close to what is being charged.</li>
            <li> and you can see what the real one looks like and what the fake looks like...</li>
            <li> at least thats what ive been told multiple times.</li>
            <li> I realized it it was fake because the play buttons on the bottle were  not there like real one.</li>
            <li> The bottle lasted me a little less than a year I believe and I used it maybe every other day.  </li>
            <li> The pricing online is half of the department store, and has been every bit as quality until this point.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered this product from Amazon and i recieved a perfume that is expired or is a fake even the spray tester at the store is stronger and last longer than what i recieved .This</li>
            <li> it was half price.</li>
            <li> box it self was a dead give away with the cellophane wrap</li>
            <li> The package was poorly made, the design on both the bottle and package are different than the picture.</li>
            <li> Your game and your approach is entirely on you.</li>
            <li> My friends also did not enjoy the smell when questioned.</li>
            <li> waste of time and money</li>
            <li> But give it a few minutes to settle on your skin.</li>
            <li> and it was not nearly as strong as the one at macys</li>
            <li> Makes you realize that you need an off-white Italian linen blazer, and that you deserve an expensive timepiece.</li>
            <li> I got it for my boyfriend for Christmas as he has had it in the past.  </li>
            <li> Amazon probably had a seedy supplier in the past.</li>
            <li> Amazon usually has the cheaper price compared to fragrancenet.</li>
            <li> With Amazon its usually a hit/</li>
            <li> Truly a masterpiece that people will remember, but don&#x27;t go overboard.</li>
            <li> Too bad is not an returnable item, due to amazon policy, a bank charge back should fix, if there is no amazon warranty on the item.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bottom of the box where the upc is there is a taped on UPC long code covering a thin slice of the box in which has been CUT OUT!</li>
            <li> , buyers beware this cologne is a fake, i am not sure if amazon knows this, but this cologne is definitely not real</li>
            <li> The spray dispenser is hard to operate.  </li>
            <li> the fact that it is very thin and white inside instead of black shows that it is indeed a fake</li>
            <li> Sorry, but wasn&#x27;t what I  expected.</li>
            <li> i do 10 spray at least and walk out</li>
            <li> I was certainly afraid to because a good majority of the bad reviews claim to have gotten fake or knock off cologne, even buying from Amazon LLC themselves!</li>
            <li> In addition this scent was very faint and only lasted ~15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> If youre looking for a sweetly subtle tantalizing smell this is the stuff.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not good.</li>
            <li> ; who are sending out fake (potentially dangerous) items/perfumes/colognes to people and Amazon is letting theses independent DISTRIBUTORS ruin their reputation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not sure if a fake or reformulated...</li>
            <li> Who cares about a dumb bottle, though?</li>
            <li> i wish they just start making blue lable again :(</li>
            <li> the bottle is dumb to look at</li>
            <li> The only downside is having the stupid mp3-styled bottle on your counter (reason for 4 instead of 5 stars)</li>
            <li> I was helping a woman select some bedroom furniture because she had just broken up with her boyfriend and he took everything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> this is so frustrating and dissapointing.</li>
            <li> It had poor finish.</li>
            <li> and I must say even though there was a few bad reviews I decided to take my chances</li>
            <li> I blind bought this due to a recommendation by someone and wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong though</li>
            <li> Fake.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m unable to do it justice in words, but it&#x27;s one of those colognes that somehow boosts your self-esteem the moment you put it on.  </li>
            <li> Just like there is fake designer purses, glasses, and watches ...</li>
            <li> there are fake fragrances.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not sure if a fake or reformulated...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was quite excited when I first got this in the mail, as reviews said it was a longevity and sillage monster, however, it was rather light and only lasted about 4 hours before becoming a skin close scent, while for comparison, I sampled this and got about 8 hours ~ longevity and a much heavier scent.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong though, I absolutely love this scent, I get an extremely pleasant tonka bean and pink pepper dry down with a hint of coffee, but it just seemed lighter and watered down compared to what I&#x27;ve heard, leading me to believe the cologne was reformulated or I received a fake...  While I am aware that the cologne has been reformulated and the bottle has been changed, I would like to mention that the bottle I received did not match the one in the picture, as the bottle in the picture shows the pre-formulated (supposedly superior) fragrance.  As a result of this, while ordering, I was lead to believe that the cologne I ordered would be a pre-formulated version, however, received a newer batch per-se of the cologne.  (there is no ff/rw on the bottle, and there is &amp;#34;GIVENCHY&amp;#34; labeled on the bottom of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance: 9.25/10 (if you&#x27;re looking for gourmands)&lt;br /&gt;Longevity: 6.5/10&lt;br /&gt;Projection: 6/20&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the product and will continue to use it, however I honestly don&#x27;t think it was worth the all money, and would have preferred to have an updated image shown of the product...</li>
            <li> the best .... no question.  women love it</li>
            <li> I purchased my original bottle from Macy&#x27;s and absolutely loved its rich sweet warm scent that lasted all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this bottle from Amazon, and it is not the same. The bottle looks different, the sprayer never worked correctly, and it feels slightly like rubbing alcohol on the skin and has a slightly week fragrance. Like scented poppers.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of Givenchy Play Intense and I&#x27;ll do it a third and a fourth and a fifth. My husband smells yummy! It&#x27;s definitely a warmer, winter month fragrance. Girls, do yourself a favor and get some of this for the man in your life.</li>
            <li> I got hooked on this one day when i was walking through Macys and a lady sprayed it over me. I came back and the fragrance lasted for more than 8 hours. It was a little bit sharp initially but became smoother and sweeter with time. I have always got tons of compliment when i wore this to any place. This is perfect for any occasion but is usually recommended for evening use. I love it and it is my favorite fragrance. I will reorder it once it&#x27;s over.</li>
            <li> The first time I smelled this cologne was actually a few years back inside of a maxim magazine I believe. I remember liking it a lot and telling myself that I would one day buy it. I had forgotten the brand but remembered it was called \\&quot;play\\&quot;. Easy to remember because of its sexual connotation. I found it, I bought it, and what can I say I love it. Not too sweet, not too musky, it is right in between. Can&#x27;t wait to buy the play intense version.</li>
            <li> Got it for my husband and he loves the scent. Price is right too.</li>
            <li> this stuff smells awesome</li>
            <li> I was hanging out with my buddy over the weekend and he had this Cologne. He recommended it and mannnn it smells good. I have to say its the best smelling cologne out there in my opinion. So after the weekend I found it on amazon and decided to order it.</li>
            <li> Es una colonia que tiene muy buen aroma y a mi hijo le queda muy bien, a sus amigas les encanta. Estoy muy contenta y satisfecha con la compra y por supuesto que el tambiÃ©n.</li>
            <li> Product is great. It smells awesome. It was cheaper than the other places I visited to buy it. It arrived very soon. I try not to use a lot just to perlong it. It just smells very good.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my father and loves ... was an excellent gift.&lt;br /&gt;scent is manly and endures with the passing of the hours.</li>
            <li> Since buying PlayIntense last fall, I&#x27;ve used it probably 3-4 times a week. It&#x27;s a great scent that is mainly sweet and somewhat floral with undertones that are more spiced and manly. The lasting time is pretty good-- one spray will continue projecting for about 4 hours and then the scent will linger close to the skin and mellow, making it really enjoyable to smell your wrist during the day. Applying a second spray later in the day will boost it up and make other people notice when you&#x27;re out.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a wonderful slightly sweet scent that will give you and others hours of pleasure. Whenever anybody hugs you they won&#x27;t want to let go. The only downside is having the stupid mp3-styled bottle on your counter (reason for 4 instead of 5 stars)</li>
            <li> First time I see this product at Macys and found good  price at Amazon. I bought it. Its great product.I thought it is 24 hours active but could not see that impact. It is overall ok product.</li>
            <li> the best scent a man could even wear</li>
            <li> ok its cologne, this smells cirtus like with a strong man smell on delicate undertones of some some flowers.  Those are what the women like... while you still smell like a man</li>
            <li> Fake. Not worth anything close to what is being charged.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! BRAND NEW, SEALED &amp; LEGIT FROM AMAZON.COM LLC!!! GREAT PRICE TOO!!!</li>
            <li> What a wonderful clean manly smell! And the bottle was bigger than I thought it was gonna be so ALOT for your money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never purchased a cologne before without having smelled it first.  But I&#x27;d received such strong recommendations, and the reviews here were so positive, that I took a gamble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m unable to do it justice in words, but it&#x27;s one of those colognes that somehow boosts your self-esteem the moment you put it on.  It makes you want to order a martini and impress the woman you&#x27;re sitting next to with your unique brand of charming and witty banter. Makes you realize that you need an off-white Italian linen blazer, and that you deserve an expensive timepiece. Makes you look into having your teeth professionally whitened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.  Just be aware of the hidden costs.</li>
            <li> Colognes by Givenchy are always awesome!   But I have never bought any parfume on-line before.   I was a little bit doubt about the quality because the price was really decent!  And because of the price I couldn&#x60;t help but buy it:)  The shipping was fast enough.  What about the quality of the cologne? It is exatly the same amazing smell that I tried in Sephora.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I got it for my boyfriend for Christmas as he has had it in the past.  So much cheaper online!</li>
            <li> Tons of compliments. Great long lasting scent.</li>
            <li> This cologne is awesome. It smells great. The scent is more along the sweeter side. Not a Musky scent. I really like it and it combines well with my own scent. Definitely something you should put into consideration before you buy any cologne. This is my second bottle I purchase and I do not want to change it. It took me a long time to find a scent I liked. My girlfriend loves how I smell.</li>
            <li> I saw Givenchy at Macy&#x27;s and really liked the smell. The deal on Amazon is great, so I&#x27;d jump on this deal.  I am very happy with this cologne.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite for a man !</li>
            <li> Perfume wonderful in every sense of the word  Gives you a sense of excellence</li>
            <li> Givenchy Play Intense by Givenchy for Men is my favorite cologne.  I have appropriately 90 different men&#x27;s colognes ranging from Bond 9 to good old Eternity and can&#x27;t forget Cool Water.  Givenchy Play Intense is Superior due to its unique scent.  My #2 Spot goes to (Bond 9 Hampton).  The Collection Continues!</li>
            <li> This scent is wonderful.. Got this scent for my hubby for valentines day and is hooked on it ever since.  He ran out and i immediately ordered more!!! This is a mans man scent..</li>
            <li> I would reccomend that if you are buying ANY kind of perfume of calone do it in stores by a registered seller of the product. Many online sellers have old products where the smell has faded or changed, or the product is fake all together. Just like there is fake designer purses, glasses, and watches ... there are fake fragrances.</li>
            <li> This turned out to be everything I hoped it would be and more. I&#x27;ve gotten so many comments on how good I smell. I love it.</li>
            <li> Found this cologne in Maxim magazine, had my girlfriend take a whiff from the page and it got her approval, so I decided to ask for it for Christmas. The bottle looks pretty sporty and guy-like too, so at least you won&#x27;t get harassed by any of your buddies about that.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy this cologne. People like it too.  If you like colognes with a sweet scent this will likely be perfect for you.  Fans of Allure, Valentino, Yves Saint Laurent will like this.</li>
            <li> Love this, price at amazon is incredible.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite sents and my wife always makes a good comment when I where it.  She rarely says anything about cologne</li>
            <li> Opened package, and sprayed cologne , it smells like pure alcohol , with a little resemblance of cologne in the background, and this is the 3rd item of the same purchased from amazon, maybe they got a bad batch, took it to macys and the cologne specialist at the store advised it is fake, or an OK replica, the fixer does not hold , and it has a strong smell of alcohol. Too bad is not an returnable item, due to amazon policy, a bank charge back should fix, if there is no amazon warranty on the item.</li>
            <li> Bought this about 2 years ago. I bought it from Amazon directly and not third party because I have never received a fake doing it that way. It still smells the exact same as it did when i first got it. Honestly, this is one of my favorite colognes ever! Woman love it too!</li>
            <li> It smells so good and the fragance stays in the body. Its the real thing, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Longer lasting good smell.</li>
            <li> Update - March 2015 I have purchased this cologne from Amazon three times over the past several years. My original review, which you can find below, is glowing. Never have I had an issue with the quality of this cologne. I have always seen the reviewers claiming they&#x27;ve received fake bottles, but it never happened to me. At least, not until this month  The most recent order I received checked out in every way. The box was authentic with black interior packaging as well as a serial number which matched on both the box and the bottle. The sprayer appeared intact and the bottle had all marketing markings which my old bottle has.   The issue is when you actually use the cologne. The smell is not rich and warm as it would normally be described. No, instead the smell is much more alcohol-like and does not last at all. I can&#x27;t even say that the fragrance hangs around for ten minutes, as it doesn&#x27;t seem to. I&#x27;ve been using this cologne for nearly 5 years and I have received compliments on the scent up to 12 hours after I&#x27;ve sprayed it. The cologne I received on this order would not be able to elicit a female response even thirty minutes after I had sprayed it. In fact, the alcohol smell may linger and make me smell offensive.   Amazon continues to offer world class service and gladly worked with me to resolve the issue. However, I wish it hadn&#x27;t come to this. The pricing online is half of the department store, and has been every bit as quality until this point. I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll stick with the department stores from now on, to save myself the inconvenience.   One thing I noted in my research is that although this item is marked as &amp;#34;sold&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;fulfilled&amp;#34; by Amazon, it is not wholly the case. Some reviewers elsewhere have indicated that the package is &amp;#34;drop shipped&amp;#34; by another vendor in Amazon&#x27;s name. A telltale sign of this is that the box is not packaged with Amazon&#x27;s identifiable tape. This is how my box arrived and I fear this is how many others receive theirs as well.   Original Review I purchased this cologne in July of 2011 after spending some 45 minutes in Dillard&#x27;s going through their collection with a sales clerk. We spent a lot of time talking about what kind of ingredients were in each cologne and what occasions each was best suited for. After narrowing my selection down to a few, this was the one I kept coming back to. Accompanying me that day was a girl with whom I was having relations at the time. She was also quite a fan of the cologne, and she definitely knew her men&#x27;s fragrances. I have since worn this cologne nearly every day and I never fail to get compliments and female friends standing very near me. I worked as a salesman for a furniture store awhile ago. I was helping a woman select some bedroom furniture because she had just broken up with her boyfriend and he took everything. In the middle of working with her she cut me off in the middle of my sentence and said &amp;#34;I just wanted to tell you, you smell phenomenal.&amp;#34; Similar things have happened with female strangers while I&#x27;m out shopping, at parties, and at dinner. I cannot recommend this cologne enough. I strongly recommend that you first go to a department store and see how you like the smell. It is fairly strong and sharp at first. After a while it will dull and become very warm. It stays on me for about 8 hours. I recommend doing a spray under the collar and one above. It may seem like too much at first but it will ensure a slow and balanced diffusion.</li>
            <li> Awful FAKE, buyers beware this cologne is a fake, i am not sure if amazon knows this, but this cologne is definitely not real, it is a very cheap knock off... the bottle is very similar the thing is the scent doesn&#x27;t last longer than 5 minutes, and it needs to be sprayed on a lot for it to even last 5 minutes... on top of that i can tell this is diluted with water and rubbing alcohol, it burns the skin when its sprayed... i have some photos attatched of the bottle and the packaging and you can see what the real one looks like and what the fake looks like... in the pictures i supplied of you look at the two, the real givenchy is on the left while the fake is on the right, things like the box is what is a dead give away... the fact that it is very thin and white inside instead of black shows that it is indeed a fake</li>
            <li> I think this is the best smelling cologne hands down.  While, I do like others, from other designers and even the regular \\&quot;Play\\&quot;, this happens to be my top choice.  I used to get this at a dept. store for almost $30 more but I love this and it is cheaper than the dept. store price for the smaller size...</li>
            <li> I got this for my son , he loved it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Givenchy Play Intense. It has such a unique wonderful scent. When I buy this cologne again, it will most likely be through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son, he loves it.</li>
            <li> Tried this on a cruise, but there was no way in heck I was paying the outrageous price they were selling it for! This is very true to the scent we smelled on ship. (What I&#x27;m trying to say is this isn&#x27;t a knock off!) awesome scent, though. Great purchase ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> Original fake&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay !&lt;br /&gt;40 dollar of the original product dilute !&lt;br /&gt;Smell good but is not the original .</li>
            <li> great; just as i expected.</li>
            <li> this is the perfect cologne for my husband it smells so very good on him we plan to buy more</li>
            <li> Purchased for my husband; he really likes it.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying how disappointed I was in Amazon when this item arrived today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this along with Nautica Voyage (Both items came from Boca Raton area in Florida I know this because I tracked the package from the beginning!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box it self was a dead give away with the cellophane wrap having seams (on both items so they were both wrapped by Amazons distributor in Florida)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box it came in was made of FLIMSY,PAPER like cardboard &amp;#34;fraying&amp;#34; on the inside....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box it self has no rewind or fast forward &amp;#60;&amp;#60; &amp;#62;&amp;#62; on the sides nor does it display it on the front cover!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom of the box where the upc is there is a taped on UPC long code covering a thin slice of the box in which has been CUT OUT! This is laughable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle has no NO RUBBER SIDING, there are also NO &amp;#60;&amp;#60;RRWD  FFWD&amp;#62;&amp;#62;  on the upper sides of the bottle and the bottom front of the bottle has a flat surface not the &amp;#34;square&amp;#34; like design on a real Givenchy Play Intense! It also has &amp;#34;GIVENCHY&amp;#34;  with BIG white text on the lower portion of the bottle. On the sprayer it self the &amp;#34;GIVENCHY&amp;#34; that is imprinted on it is absent as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; ! Smells like STRONG , STRONG ALCOHOL SMELL when first sprayed then dies down to something that smells like one of those cheap &amp;#34;Cigar&amp;#34; (Cuba) colognes or a very feint &amp;#34;Ferrari Black&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anything this should be called&amp;#34;Gone in Sixty seconds&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this direct from Amazon LLC (i make it a point to buy most if not ALL my Amazon purchases directly from Amazon!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I PARTIALLY fault Amazon because they are the ones who do business with &amp;#34;DISTRIBUTORS&amp;#34; who are sending out fake (potentially dangerous) items/perfumes/colognes to people and Amazon is letting theses independent DISTRIBUTORS ruin their reputation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked up some perfume stores in the area in which my items were shipped and found some shady websites that are based in the same area in which this Amazon distributor is located!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DID THIS DISTRIBUTOR NOT THINK SOMEONE WOULD KNOW THIS WAS GARBAGE JUICE?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do they not know they have fake product? OF COURSE THEY DO!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now hesitant to buy colognes or scents from Amazon because of this, ALTHOUGH customer service was great and I will still hold Amazon in high regards and continue to be a customer though this incident made an otherwise great relationship between me and Amazon a little sour. (the inconvenience mostly)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not want to write a negative review of Amazon LLC, but I feel obligated as a consumer to  either warn others or in many cases praise items in which I purchased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be uploading some pictures of this item I received to show everyone what this fake looks like!e stores in the area in which my items were shipped and found some shady websites that are based in the same area in which this Amazon distributor is located!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DID THIS DISTRIBUTOR NOT THINK SOMEONE WOULD KNOW THIS WAS GARBAGE JUICE?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do they not know they have fake product?

            <li> Great fragrance.... Quick delivery</li>
            <li> It looks like this product isn&#x27;t original. I have the same cologne this bottle has imperfections. I&#x27;m not really happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Smells the same, still a knock off. Doesn&#x27;t last as long</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cologne. Smelled it on the fly by from a customer at my job and had to ask what he was wearing. Smells so good.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I&#x27;ve bought 5 bottles of this cologne. It smells soft and women seem to love it lol.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but wasn&#x27;t what I  expected. I order diferente one and you send it wrong one. I am really disappointed. I was thinking to send back but I opened already. Now I don&#x27;t now what to do with this because I don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> Every woman i come close to wearing this, loves the scent!</li>
            <li> I received a counterfeit bottle of cologne. The package was poorly made, the design on both the bottle and package are different than the picture. Even with it being amazon you cannot return cologne. Do not buy</li>
            <li> Awesome smelling cologne! My husband has worn this several years! He&#x27;s had more compliments on it than any other cologne he has ever worn. Decent price.. Could always be better though:)</li>
            <li> once i received the shipment great cologne</li>
            <li> I purchased this before from Sephora, and decided to purchase it again due to it running low. I was skeptical with the reviews saying it was fake, but it is indeed a genuine Givenchy Play Intense. I&#x27;m glad I decided to take the chance and am glad I did.</li>
            <li> Actually stole this from a friend because I liked it so much (bought him a new bottle kindly).  The bottle lasted me a little less than a year I believe and I used it maybe every other day.  Not sure what else to say - smells great, plenty of compliments on it - highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Givenchy Play Intense.  It has such a unique wonderful scent.  It took me a while to find this cologne at a decent price at the department stores.  When I buy this cologne again, it will most likely be through Amazon.    I have 11 different colognes and this is the newest addition to my collection.  It is also my favorite at the moment.  I use this one the most.  The scent is very nice and very addictive.  It has a very classy scent to it.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this.  Trust me.</li>
            <li> this was my first time buying a fregrance from amazon. I was looking for something last long when you put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Givenchy Play was the right choice for me.</li>
            <li> I used it like two years ago or more. Now I use it again and I don&#x27;t why I still love it</li>
            <li> This cologne is worth having in every man&#x27;s collection.  As the name says, it is intense and lasts all day long! I love when my husband wears it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell... So sweet</li>
            <li> Ideal for parties, great fragance.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and the ladies love it.. well that&#x27;s what many have told me ;)</li>
            <li> This is an excellent cologne and use it as my daily scent. I get a lot of compliments on this one. You will do well with this as well. Your game and your approach is entirely on you.</li>
            <li> I loved this scent as soon as I smelled it in a magazine. Found this price to be reasonable. Great Christmas gift for my fiance. He loved it as well and the size is great. He doesn&#x27;t wear cologne often, so this should last him quite a long time.</li>
            <li> I must admit I was excited to receive this cologne initially. But it&#x27;s not the exact scent I was looking for. My uncle came over and smelled it and told me I smell like cookies. That&#x27;s not good. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this cologne again. It doesn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d hoped. Everyone do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t purchase a new cologne or perfume unless it&#x27;s in person or you know how it smells beforehand.</li>
            <li> Smells good but, after 1 hr or so the fragrance is gone. I believe it wasn&#x27;t original or there was something wrong with it. Usually givenchy lasts for good 6-8 hrs!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend&#x27;s birthday,  and he loved it, he said it smells amazing. I also loved the smell. It brought back wonderful memories :-)</li>
            <li> This is one of the best smelling colognes I have ever had! I have tried over 50 different types, and I am still coming back for more! This is my 4th bottle of this stuff. I refuse to leave the house without smelling like Givenchy Play Intense. I get constantly asked on what type of cologne it is. Yes, even men ask me!</li>
            <li> Always getting compliments.</li>
            <li> I blind bought this due to a recommendation by someone and wasn&#x27;t disappointed. When I first took the cap off and smelled it, I&#x27;ll admit that I didn&#x27;t enjoy the scent at first. The real magic is after you&#x27;ve sprayed it on your skin and let it dry for a few minutes. When I first smelled it before spraying, I thought it smelled very strong and pungent. Like an extremely ripe fruit or something. After I sprayed it on my skin though, it&#x27;s like it became a completely different (and enjoyable) scent. It smells very fresh, sweet, and almost feminine in a way. The pink pepper definitely stands out, along with a hint of coffee. This could definitely pass as a uni-sex cologne, but don&#x27;t let that put you off! I&#x27;ve always opted for the more aquatic and masculine colognes, so this was a radical departure for me. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The longevity is great on this cologne. It also projects very well, so no need to spray more than 3-4 times on your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this cologne wasn&#x27;t what I expected, but I&#x27;m definitely not disappointed. If anything, it exceeded my expectations. I can&#x27;t recommend this cologne enough!</li>
            <li> Excellant fall/winter fragrance! Long lasting, compliment getter. Well blended, quality product.</li>
            <li> Glad I got it from Amazon (I used my other, non-reviewing account lol). I was certainly afraid to because a good majority of the bad reviews claim to have gotten fake or knock off cologne, even buying from Amazon LLC themselves! However, I can 100% confirm that I got an authentic bottle from Amazon (not marketplace), but I DO believe it when people say they didn&#x27;t. Amazon probably had a seedy supplier in the past. My heart stopped beating when I saw the bottle was different than the one pictured, but after short research, I found out the late 2013 to now bottles have a new design without the silly FF and RW buttons and the odd square on the bottom (look it up on the Macy&#x27;s website, it truly was redesigned).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AS FOR THE SCENT ITSELF- pretty good! I don&#x27;t quite feel the coffee notes as strongly as people are saying, but once the high-notes drop down you kind of get a creamy light coffee fragrance buried in the tonka bean and other goodies. It is a good, masculine fragrance. I disagree with the assertion that this is more a nighttime scent- it can be used daytime just fine! But night fits it great as well. The new bottle design is much more attractive without the mp3 player cheese, but it is still plain. Who cares about a dumb bottle, though? If there&#x27;s any complaint, it&#x27;s that it doesn&#x27;t project very far in my experience. Many say it goes arm&#x27;s length- I say it goes about 1 foot out, then kinda just, as they say, \\&quot;sticks to the skin\\&quot; after a couple of hours. If you want a monster laser projection of scent into your friends&#x27; and enemies&#x27; faces, this won&#x27;t do it. But it&#x27;s light and inoffensive, which gives it credence as a sweet, happy smell that won&#x27;t bother people. I give Amazon a 5/5 for authenticity but I give the smell itself a strong 3/5 (average). If it projected more, it would be much better.</li>
            <li> A very low key but subtle fragrance. Has a long lasting aroma that both I &amp; others around me pick up on.</li>
            <li> REAL impressed with Play Intense... I am addicted to Play Original, and looking for one to compete with it, this I think will take a very close second, though... but seriously, something tells me that over time, it is going to take first, and very happy I chose the large spray instead of the small, wish I would have done the same with Play. Bought on amazon and just delivered today, I probably should wait a few days and use it some more till I make a review, but already it has me hooked. Bought on Amazon, I saved a great amount and it is the same scent I got turned on to through a retailer.... REAL glad I bought it here, I would say try Play before trying Intense... both are absolute winners, Givenchy has made me a newfound fragrance addict, lol... great stuff!</li>
            <li> The only real way to describe this scent is delicious.. at least thats what ive been told multiple times. its a good scent for going out to a club</li>
            <li> i just recieve this perfume and also 3 more i was so happy about it box looked great bottle also but at the time that i tried na na!!! fake perfume smells like water with alcohol! this is so frustrating and dissapointing.</li>
            <li> Great cologne, for a decent price.</li>
            <li> I spray this givenchy play intense it stay on my body a through the day even carrying my it will still be on her dress.</li>
            <li> i love givenchy brand perfumes i use to be addicted to givenchy blue label 35% of ppl around me come and ask whats this perfume this one its either fake or this is the way its i do 10 spray at least and walk out and my wife doesnt even notice it at work i ask my friend can u smell my perfume and he asks what perfume lol its nothing compared to the crazy nice smell i got from givenchy blue label its nice to have on but no one will smell it other than u after 10 minutes i wish they just start making blue lable again :(</li>
            <li> Deliciously amazing smell on my husband! He cant keep me off him when he wears this!</li>
            <li> This is only for men that want good comments. Its always personal choice in smell and how it makes you feel but i like it and so do others.</li>
            <li> Tried this at the department store and loved the smell.  Found it here on amazon and a much cheaper price so decided to buy it...Definitely was a fake, box was made out of a material a step up from tissue paper and the fragrance smelt like alcohol with a small hint of some kind of woodsy smell. Nothing at all like the original.  In addition this scent was very faint and only lasted ~15 minutes.  Amazon customer service was extremely professional and easy to work with.  I was able to receive a full refund.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance, arrived quickly... I am very satisfied!  It&#x27;s going to make a great stocking stuffer for my handsome hubby!</li>
            <li> Saved a bunch of money!</li>
            <li> Fake as a three dollar bill</li>
            <li> cheap imitation!! unfortunately I have to keep it</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this cologne! It is on the sweet side so do know this before you order. I am a fan of sweet scents so it is great for myself! Big bottle, scent lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li> This cologne came quickly and in great shape. I will for sure use this company again everything came in with out a hitch. The Givenchy Play smells so awesome i love it!!</li>
            <li> Givenchy Play is a great cologne for men.  Smells great and is long lasting.  Very masculine smelling and a long time favorite of my husbands.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells amazing</li>
            <li> Great subtle scent.... clean and  fresh... not overpowering but wish the scent would last longer. Excellently priced. Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Skeptic if this was actually a geniune Givenchy.  The scent Did not last long as it should have, keep in mind that you can not return this product if you purchase it.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this perfume at Macys for $81.00 its a very unique smell and i recieve many compliments when wearing this cologne . I recently ordered this product from Amazon and i recieved a perfume that is expired or is a fake even the spray tester at the store is stronger and last longer than what i recieved .This product  last 30 minutes .i just spoke to Amazon and a replacement will be sent out which i will recieve shortly excelent customer service from Amazon .hopefully replacement perfume is good because i really like the smell and the Amazon price is great.</li>
            <li> I usually use Issey Miyake, but Play is definitely best for night time.&lt;br /&gt;If only there were an official deodorant.</li>
            <li> Have to say that I bought this on amazon after smelling it at Macy&#x27;s so I already knew I liked the scent but wanted to find a cheaper option.     The smell is great it is very manly yet soft and subtle very nice to wear out for dinner wearing nice suit or dress up shirt. over all an awesome cologne your b/f will love it girls and guys get it man you will get compliments from the ladies for sure.</li>
            <li> This cologne is perhaps the most attractive cologne I have seen ever.  Women constantly compliment me on the smell of it!</li>
            <li> let me say givenchy hit a home run with this. the bottle is dumb to look at but u dont wear the bottle. this cologne smells like a latte, vanilla sort of at the beach...have no clue how that makes sense but this cologne is great. longevity is good 8 hrs and projection is solid.</li>
            <li> This product was  gift, but I think I enjoy smelling it more than he does.  What a treat.  I recommend.</li>
            <li> When I smell my husband wearing this, I blush. Yeah, it is like THAT. Musky and clean all at once. Makes you want to take a roll in the sheets.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne and my lady loves it. Such a great price for it and it ships quickly. Can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> the product arrived in good condition. was completely sealed. had not tried this perfume before and did not know what had odor. is very mild and pleasant. last long. I&#x27;m comfortable with. really recommend it. the only observation is that beware of shipping costs</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I wanted and arrived very timely.  Price was great.</li>
            <li> I have over 60 bottles of cologne and this is definitely right there close to the top, ladies love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s excellent.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a sweet, sport and sensual scent, personally i take an sport alternative scent for PI Givenchy That&#x27;s my principal fragance</li>
            <li> I wanted to rate this 1 star so that other people wouldn&#x27;t buy it and then it&#x27;d be more rare, but I just can&#x27;t do it. This is a really great cologne and I like the bottle form factor a lot since it makes traveling with it much easier. There isn&#x27;t a lot of excess bulk plus the flatter design allows for easy transport in my shaving bag. I won&#x27;t go in to the scent itself since its been done to death already. Plus I feel that if you&#x27;re considering this cologne, you&#x27;ve smelled it elsewhere and already know it. And furthermore, reading about a smell is a lot like reading about a food. You can&#x27;t fully understand it until you&#x27;ve tried it yourself.</li>
            <li> I have been using this fragrance for months and it&#x27;s my primary perfume. Intense is better if you want to have a long lasting perfume. I use it mornings and the smell is still on the clothes evening. I recommend to every man.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why everyone is so hyped up about Givenchy. The smell comes off as somewhat of a somewhat bitter, somewhat pungent, slightly sweet scent at first. I really do not like the initial notes. Throughout the midnotes, it becomes more pleasant and less bitter, however I do not think it is worth it for the initial repulsion. My friends also did not enjoy the smell when questioned. I was disappointed in my purchase.</li>
            <li> very nice scent.everything good ecept ups problems....</li>
            <li> Good smelling cologne</li>
            <li> My son is a junior in college and has worn this for a couple years now.  This is the one I like the smell of the most as well that he owns.  He has maybe 10 and this is the best for a young man.</li>
            <li> My daily, 5 stars! women love it, can&#x27;t say enough.</li>
            <li> I completely love at I think is one of the best colons in a market I will .Thank for the great product</li>
            <li> Goes a long ways and is not too overhwelming. One spritz is all you need. Has a nice sweet undertone with a little bit of spice mixed in. I get compliments on how I smell all the time.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like right</li>
            <li> AKA &amp;#34;sex in a bottle.&amp;#34; The ladies LOVE this scent as I get comments from nearly everyone I am in contact with. My other colognes are YSL Intense, and John Varvatos Vintage.</li>
            <li> I have had more women ask me what this fragrance is than anything else I have ever used.  One squirt on each arm and one under your neck and you are good to go for the whole day.  Doing that application each day I can get over 8 months of use from one bottle.</li>
            <li> I wish I could count the amount of compliments I have gotten while wearing this fragrance. Too many. This scent is on the stronger side, so less is more. But the women absolutely love it, I am definitely getting longer hugs and constantly being asked; &amp;#34;what fragrance is that?&amp;#34;...But of course I never tell.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on this anddddd regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stuff smells pretty similar, but not the same. Wonk wonk.</li>
            <li> I am a fragrance collector. I own about 30 different bottles. Amazon usually has the cheaper price compared to fragrancenet. com or any other online retail stores. With Amazon its usually a hit/ or a rare case miss. 80% of the time I receive an authentic fragrance. Unfortunately this time around it was a fake one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Givenchy&#x27;s Play intense is a sexy fragrance. Amazing silage and amazing longevity. I own Rochas men as well. These two fragrances fall under the same category of Sweet coffee/ sexy gourmand fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the shipment- I received a fake bottle. The serial number on the box and on the bottles match. However, the box itself is of low quality. It had white interiors- (original one has black). It had white particles (kind of like tissue paper particles) inside the box when I opened it. The box was thinner than the original. It had poor finish. The box edges that get tugged in when you close the box were shorter than the original. It must have been cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle looks very close to the original. The original scent lasts 10+ hours, the fake lasted roughly about 20 minutes. The opening notes are different. Its more watered down version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, amazon customer service was exceptional. They refunded my account. Fragrance buyers, just be wary of what you get. This is just an informational post, so fellow readers can benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anand</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend as a gift, great price and smells great :)</li>
            <li> The spray dispenser is hard to operate.  Fragrance was just ok.</li>
            <li> This was not the authentic play intense by givenchy.  I realized it it was fake because the play buttons on the bottle were  not there like real one. Also it did not last more than 1 hour on my skin. Completely fake!  I called customer service and got an immediate refund!  Be warned,  do not buy!</li>
            <li> This is the best scent I&#x27;ve ever owned. Really pleased with what I purchased. Friends compliment me on the scent. I think I&#x27;ve found \\&quot;my\\&quot; scent. Givenchy brand looks promising, likely to purchase another within the brand in the coming months! I would recommend this to anyone looking to try a new scent, You&#x27;ll love it!!</li>
            <li> Smells great, obviously i wouldn&#x27;t buy a cologne without trying it first, but this was the cheapest place i can find it and know that it&#x27;s legit (not a fake).</li>
            <li> Have to say I took a leap on this cologne and and this stuff is insanely good! My gf loves it. I just got it today sprayed it and she is already hooked saying its the best stuff shes ever smelled. And she would know cuz she happens to work in a fragrance shop. Like i said this is some incredible stuff. My old fave was Givenchy Pi but now I think this is gonna be my new hit. If youre looking for a sweetly subtle tantalizing smell this is the stuff. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of my favorite scents, I get many compliments from women when I wear it.  It&#x27;s not overpowering so they would need to stand pretty close to smell it, but hey, works for me.  There&#x27;s a certain lingering undertone to this cologne that just puts me in a better mood, while making me feel like a man at the same time.  Get your bottle today!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne and thought the price was probably too good to be true. I was correct and received a counterfeit bottle. The packaging appears legit but the bottle is not and neither is the scent. It also lasts for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband &amp; he loved it. It smells great. I will definitely buy it for him again &amp; the men in my family.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cologne for quite some time now. I was introduced to it at a random perfume/cologne store in a mall. Some guy really knew his stuff and one thing lead to another and I bought it and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no effective way to describe this other than a sweet smelling product. It is perhaps more of a \\&quot;going out\\&quot; cologne rather than an everyday smell good cologne, if that makes sense. It doesn&#x27;t last 16 hours. It does last long enough to make some good impressions though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product from Amazon and not another seller due to the whole \\&quot;fake product\\&quot; issue. At a price that was still cheaper than in stores, I decided I would rather pay 7-8 more dollars to ensure I am getting the real product from Amazon rather than a fake one from a random seller I knew nothing about.</li>
            <li> I sampled this and bought it at macys. After leaving the store i pulled out my droid and checked on amazon it was half price. I felt insulted for paying double so i ordered it on amazon. recieved it and tried it out and it was not nearly as strong as the one at macys even tho the package was exactly the same, it was as if it was watered down.. this is a 100 percent legit user experience review</li>
            <li> With just 3 sprays Givenchy Play Intense projects a sweet masculine oriental-gourmand with hints of vanilla, coffee, and warm spicy qualities that continue on for 7-12 hours on the dry-down. Truly a masterpiece that people will remember, but don&#x27;t go overboard. With that said however, buying perfume online is a risky business with so many fakes, if this is your first time you might want to buy it retail.</li>
            <li> I did not bother taking back since I did that for my last few amazon products.........waste of time and money</li>
            <li> You will be very happy with this cologne it smells amazing to me and the lady&#x27;s and the bottle is really cool looking</li>
            <li> I use this and Fuel by Diesel and whenever I put my cologne on, I have to debate which one I would rather use. They both smell amazing. I work as an IT Technician for a high school and I always get compliments from staff and students on how well I smell. I recommend you purchase this.</li>
            <li> Great smell. I use this for Friday nights when I&#x27;m going out to the local pub always gotten great compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Much better price than Macys. GREAT gift for a GREAT price. shipped so fast &amp; exactly what was pictured!!! VERY HAPPY</li>
            <li> This was given as a gift for nephew, he loves the smell, not too over powering,  he really likes it a lot</li>
            <li> This is the smell my boyfriend has been wearing since we met. Love the smell. I got this for him as a Christmas gift. The price was great, fast delivery, actually faster than all the other items I ordered. Smell is strong, intense, and romancing as it should be!</li>
            <li> One of the best scents for a man available !</li>
            <li> I tried a sample of this Givenchy essence on a Caribbean cruise and had to buy a bottle to bring back to the States with me. I get stopped daily and told I smell nice and what am I wearing. It has become my signature scent!</li>
            <li> I bought this solely off of reputation and reviews and I&#x27;m fully satisfied. Every female that has smelled this has liked it and I agree.</li>
            <li> This cologne is great. It lasts all day and you don&#x27;t need to spray a whole lot...you can even smell it after you leave the room!</li>
            <li> This got here so quick - in time for Valentines Day -- awesome customer service!!!! Would suggest to anyone who is interested</li>
            <li> What can I say that hasn&#x27;t already been expressed in this title?? This cologne is AMAZING, if you&#x27;re looking to leave a lasting impression on anyone you encounter, go with this. It&#x27;s a very sophisticated scent with a subtle sweetness. I originally purchased this cologne right when it came out from my local mall for $92.00, and it was well worth it... It smells exactly like what a $92.00 cologne SHOULD smell like. It comes in a decently sized bottle as well. Over the course of about a year, I completely used up the contents of the bottle. It was only recently that I was browsing Amazon and found that the same cologne was going for HALF THE PRICE ($46.00!?!?!?!?!). Boy, let me tell you, I couldn&#x27;t click the \\&quot;Add to Cart\\&quot; button fast enough. I just received my bottle today, and it&#x27;s that same brilliant stuff. I&#x27;ve been reading some of the other comments that say the cologne they received wasn&#x27;t authentic... I guarantee you that mine IS. My cologne specifically came from [...] retailer. I&#x27;ve got other colognes from them, so they&#x27;re really the only one&#x27;s I trust.  HOPE THAT HELPS GUYS :)  -Brian C.</li>
            <li> Its got a good fragrance..really fresh and classy !!! Good rate too on Amazon and shipped quickly..so all in all..very happy :)</li>
            <li> Uhhhhh... It&#x27;s alright. Not my favourite. I guess it&#x27;s just me because i&#x27;ve gotten tons &amp; tons of compliments from the ladies about it. One of whom purchased a sweet smelling car scent because she stated it smelt like me. Wooza! I was like &amp;#34;Wow! Do i smell that great?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Well, i&#x27;ll still recommend it to a friend but TO ME (my opinion), it&#x27;s not on the TOP SHELF but it&#x27;s lovely though.</li>
            <li> First time buyer from this seller and I must say even though there was a few bad reviews I decided to take my chances and I must say the cologne was spot on, the ladies love the smell and I could ask for a better cologne. I received my pkg in 2 days. Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for years. It&#x27;s awesome. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. The other &amp;#34;Play&amp;#34; is great too! With the clear bottle. I&#x27;ve found that Amazon has a great price on this compared to the going to the mall or a specific fragrance shop.</li>
            <li> I bought on 11/13 the same perfume from Fragance Zone Inc  (It was 5 Starts  5***** /  / but this from Amazon.com LLC, is the worst perfume . The Fragance is almost  &amp;#34; Zero &amp;#34; is  like fake it/ I hope I can return it / and buy one  from Frangance Zone Inc</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift and have ordered it twice again. Smells great and many have complimented me its fragrance. Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it...</li>
            <li> really good I like it</li>
            <li> I smell great with this on... Thanks</li>
            <li> Listen up if you want a real review from an ordinary guy you might want to relate to, or even if you&#x27;re a woman looking for a scent for her man. This cologne far exceeded my expectations, I personally love the way it smells. This cologne is what the name gives you: Intense. It is really strong when you spray it but fades ever so slightly to that comfortable &amp;#34;I can smell it but not overpowering&amp;#34; spot. I needed a cologne to match all the new cloths I bought since i&#x27;ve never bought and wore a cologne of my own, usually just whatever my friends use and are willing to give me a sprits of. Play Intense tops all those in my eyes. My girlfriend can not get over how much she loves the smell and she claims it better than her dads cologne which is sayin something since her dads was her favorite scent (key word WAS)! Overall I recommend this for guys trying to find a new scent or for the women trying to find a scent they&#x27;d like on a man.</li>
            <li> Best perfume out there, I recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> Timely delivery and great product.</li>
            <li> Over the years I tried different brands you name it , This is the best of all . Lasts long , attractive and refreshing .&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended , will never regret it</li>
            <li> I really like this one. It almost smells edible. To me this is a very casual cologne though, not something to wear on a special night. More like something to wear to school or work. Its fairly strong so you only need 3 to 4 sprays. My body tends to absorb colognes quickly because i don&#x27;t drink enough water and for those that don&#x27;t dehydration makes your skin absorb moisture so fragrances won&#x27;t last as long on your skin. But i think for most people this one could last 6 to 10 hours. I got about 4 out of it.&lt;br /&gt;  I bought this blind after seeing great reviews on this one. When i first smelled it the first thing that came to mind was brut aftershave. That&#x27;s a bad thing. But give it a few minutes to settle on your skin. And wait for it to change. The notes i smell remind me of that good coffee smell, Mixed with a good summer day. The smell of making smores outside over a burning fire. Very pleasant smell, But it keeps changing and playing tricks on your nose. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ve smelled like this but it reminds me of something, something really good. You will like this one, ladies will too.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent, and pleasant spicy and somewhat sweet and a long lasting people please. YOU CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THIS ONE! !!!!!!!!!!!!! BUY IT AND DRIVE THEM WILD, I HAVE. USED IT FOR FIVE YEARS NOW AND ALWAYS GET NUMEROUS COMPLIMENTS!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a perfume for a long time. I went to several stores and after thinking a lot I bought this one. Let me say that this perfume is just perfect to me. I don&#x27;t like to get a lot of attention, so this on is very discrete but don&#x27;t think you will pass unnoticed. It has kind of a sweet smell not too strong. I received several complements specially from girls. I saw many comments saying that they get a fake one from amazon. I&#x27;m not a kind of a freak original perfume person. I guess I got a original one, it came all sealed and I could smell it even after taking a shower!</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne after reading about it in a popular mens magazine. I really like the way this smells and I&#x27;ve gotten compliments from several ladies when I wear it. Rated 4 stars because shipping was slower than expected.</li>
            <li> Smells great and works well with me! It is real and there&#x27;s a website you can check the dates with the serial number on the bottom</li>
