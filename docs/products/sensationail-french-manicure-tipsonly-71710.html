    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and the end result!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results!!</li>
            <li>I did went on flawlessly!</li>
            <li>but they looked great when I was done.</li>
            <li>They were very easy to use and turned out perfect.  </li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>The perfect way to have great looking tips!\\&quot; Since i really suck at painting them with my non-dominant hand...</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>and they still look nice.</li>
            <li>I used these on my toes as well, and I&#x27;m loving how they look.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply</li>
            <li>Note they are like stickers, so they have a very strong adhesive meaning they will stick to anything they touch...</li>
            <li>Okay so for me these were a breeze to apply, they looked great but they chipped right away...</li>
            <li>great for the first 5 minutes...</li>
            <li>I guess if it is too good to be true then it is.</li>
            <li>I love, love gel nails.  </li>
            <li>and once they were on my nails they would not even stick and kept tearing even more.</li>
            <li>so I used them with the Sally Hansen LED gel polish bottom and top coats.</li>
            <li>up with three coats of Sally Hansen gel top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, make sure that no edge of the tab is sticking up as it will continue to come</li>
            <li>but the result came out outstanding.</li>
            <li>I was able to apply and adjust them if I messed up.</li>
            <li>I found them relatively easy to use and did not experience any issues with tearing or crinkling...</li>
            <li>I must re-say it, it was too easy.</li>
            <li>If you follow these steps you will have beautiful nails for several weeks.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with the results and love these things!</li>
            <li>but they worked fine.</li>
            <li>And when you peel them off be very gentle!!</li>
            <li>My nails looked great ... but only for ONE DAY.  </li>
            <li>and you have to cure it with a UV nail light.</li>
            <li>They look nice and very sticky.</li>
            <li>You get ONE chance to apply perfectly, if it sticks on crooked, the whole nail is ruined.  </li>
            <li>You just have to be gentle when using the tips because like I said there like stickers and have a very strong adhesive.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try these</li>
            <li>I love them so much</li>
            <li>I did it right for the first time and will buy more</li>
            <li>You put them on your nail, paint, and then remove, where the perfect french tip is then left!  </li>
            <li>I have used these French manicure wraps multiple times on my finger nails and toe nails with absolutely beautiful results!</li>
            <li>They looked AMAZING for one entire day.........</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>I spent a good hour trying to do one hand.  </li>
            <li>so my nails were chip free, and reapplied pink and top coat, making sure I really capped the ends.  </li>
            <li>it is a bit easier someone else but still doesn&#x27;t look right...</li>
            <li>checked on youtube for how to apply and was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was  after a few practices, and how great they looked.  </li>
            <li>Anyways, these were pretty easy to use and they look much better than what I did with normal white tip polish.</li>
            <li>I love french tips</li>
            <li>I watched the instructional video and followed the steps exactly.</li>
            <li>They are pretty stick and will stick to everything but the nail.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also found that it&#x27;s not necessary to cure them with a gel top coat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to do french nails more often now</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>first nail</li>
            <li>wish I would have looked at reviews before purchasing, but I guess i&#x27;m glad they only cost me a couple of bucks..</li>
            <li>Works as advertised, for the first hour at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this because I love having my nails in french manicure style and thought this kit would be a breeze to use....</li>
            <li>I knocked them down a star because I had to cut the sides to make them fit on most of my fingers....</li>
            <li>After placing a few tips on, they wrinkled easily and began to tear when touching them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was able to do one hand fairly successfully, however trying to apply the tabs to the other hand was a mess.  </li>
            <li>I was surprise how easy the white tips just came out.</li>
            <li>They may take a little practice if you are not use to using these kind of strips</li>
            <li>I just took my time and they turned out very professional-looking.  </li>
            <li>I will keep searching and paint my tips by hand until I find something that sticks without chipping so fast.</li>
            <li>The tips would break too much at the end.</li>
            <li>but you have to be gentle though when applying...</li>
            <li>I ended up doing my whole hand and thats when the problem began..</li>
            <li>I did completely finish three nails just to see if the look was worth the hassle.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like these.</li>
            <li>I have been doing my own gel polish manicures  for about a year now, but don&#x27;t have a quick french manicure down yet, so I thought this might be a &amp;#34;simple &amp; quick&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>In the past I have hand painted the white tips on BUT saw how perfect these white strips looked and thought I should give it a try  </li>
            <li>I LOVE other sensationail products</li>
            <li>I will say for the record they do take some practice, but after the first few nails I did it was pretty easy.</li>
            <li>And because they are much too long, when I attempted to lightly file the tips [downward motion, according to the directions], the edges became ragged and torn.  </li>
            <li>break/peel off before you can even add the top coat or file down</li>
            <li>(go a quick search here at Amazon, you can get them for seriously as low as a dollar).  </li>
            <li>You have to have a steady hand to apply well.</li>
            <li>you are better off sticking to white polish to make your french manicure!</li>
            <li>Within an hour of applying an entire manicure, one corner of one of the tips peeled right off and cracked.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t happen with the other regular color gels from Sensational though, just with the French Tips.</li>
            <li>I bought the Sheer Pink French Manicure set that included the free white gel polish, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>However, despite several coats of gel on top of them, including capping my nail tips, the sticky on the underside of the tips never dries or hardens, and it makes the strips extremely susceptible to peeling.</li>
            <li>I got my first chip the same day I used them.</li>
            <li>The trick is to wipe them down lightly with alcohol pads.</li>
            <li>But I thought it would be worth it if they lasted 2 weeks or so, like all of my other gel polish manicures normally do.  </li>
            <li>The tip strips look great, and with a little practice are not too hard to apply.</li>
            <li>These have a lot of bad reviews but they deserve more love then they are getting.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a huge waste there.  </li>
            <li>These wraps have to be used with the Sensationail gel clear coat</li>
            <li>am on day 3 and so far no chips...</li>
            <li>I will update this review if needed as far as wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It got me so much time to do my nails to just undo them the same day.</li>
            <li>I tried doing a french tip with regular nail polish, but it just didn&#x27;t look right.</li>
            <li>I am glad I got the free white polish because I have already had to do a few touch ups on the tips, however it leaves the mani looking very uneven.</li>
            <li>but they work well enough to not have to spend all the money on the full kit or other curing lamps.</li>
            <li>If you purchase the french kit you have 2 choices either clear or sheer pink, I purchased the sheer pink and I love it!</li>
            <li>First of all, the tips are much too wide and long (even though my hands are NOT petite).  </li>
            <li>(leaving it still incased in the hard plastic overlays) for easy access one by one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not sure if this is because I did not use them with the original product line or not.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was fortunate enough to get a white polish with the kit I bought and found that to be a little easier to use.  </li>
            <li>I found it helps a little to make sure the gel primer is completely aired dried before trying to apply.  </li>
            <li>I used 1 coat of sheer pink under then the white tip, and then another coat of sheer pink on top of the white tip.</li>
            <li>If you are very careful, you can get them off of the film and onto your nail but sticking them to your nail and pulling them off the film gently.  </li>
            <li>Plus, the gel doesn&#x27;t dry like normal, so you can&#x27;t shape it with the acetone as you would with regular polish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m assuming the other reviewers did not do it properly, otherwise they would have lasted much longer than a day.</li>
            <li>Which really helps mute down the white tip if you don&#x27;t like the bold white ( like me :/ )</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Which really helps mute down the white tip if you don&#x27;t like the bold white ( like me :/ )</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, after approximately an hour and a half to two hours, (and following all the rules with the file, gel cleanser, primer, base and top coat, and the clear gel polish), I loved how my nails looked after I with finished them.</li>
            <li> I tried to use the white stickies on my nails and it is impossible to do on your own...</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m feeling lazy ill just paint over them with a normal top coat</li>
            <li> They looked as if I had come out of the salon but not for too long.</li>
            <li> They are sticky on one side so be careful when peeling the protective cover back and not lay the sticky side on anything.</li>
            <li> Even though I had read the reviews, I thought these would work if I was extra careful in handling them.  </li>
            <li> First, they usually tear in half when you try to get them off the plastic they come on.  </li>
            <li> Plus, you can have other colors besides white as your tips then.</li>
            <li> I thought about using gel white, but I figured that it would create a \\&quot;lip\\&quot; or step on the nail due to the thickness after curing.</li>
            <li> what a waste of time.&lt;br /&gt;I will go back to painting the white tip on by hand.  </li>
            <li> that normally I have a hard time getting gel polish off my nails</li>
            <li> They come pressed between a single strip of plastic.</li>
            <li> The clear coat will still feel a little sticky after it has dried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised at all the negative reviews for this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was such a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> These strips were tearing while I was carefully peeling them off of the sheet</li>
            <li> Total waste.</li>
            <li> They stick to EVERYTHING other than the nail.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even attempt to do the other one.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed because I do like some of the Sensational products</li>
            <li> I filed down</li>
            <li> however I still have some from the previous purchase...</li>
            <li> What a mess.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They could be a little thicker..</li>
            <li> I will keep looking for tips that are both inexpensive and a little thicker as I think the added support of a thicker tip would help me keep my nails growing.</li>
            <li> I just purchased these little guys at Walmart today</li>
            <li> Putting on the tips on my nails was a hard, filing the excess was even harder.</li>
            <li> the tips are fragile and thin.</li>
            <li> I went to all that trouble for nothing.</li>
            <li> Definitely a waste of my time and money.  </li>
            <li> did a top coat of gel, and these suckers still cracked and looked like crap within 3 days.</li>
            <li> I ended up having to soak off what was left and do my nails over again (NOT with these lousy tips).  </li>
            <li> They usually run around $6.</li>
            <li> but these are a waste of time and money!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> So hard to get on correctly.  </li>
            <li> They break, stick to each other, split, won&#x27;t come off the backing without tearing, impossible to remove</li>
            <li> They are stickers, poor quality and they  peeled off under 2 gel coats after 3 days, I do not recommend this product</li>
            <li> It  was somewhat frustrating applying the stickers since they stuck to EVERYTHING, and often broke / cracked while trying to position them correctly on the nail.</li>
            <li> These are EXTREMELY thin stick-ons that fall apart and break as you handle</li>
            <li> Very thick and weird looking.</li>
            <li> but this one is by far the worst product.</li>
            <li> Not worth it in the end :(</li>
            <li> What a waste of time and money that was.  :-(</li>
            <li> The worst french manicure tip strips ever!!!!</li>
            <li> These tips are difficult to apply.  </li>

            <li> Boy, was I wrong!</li>
            <li> /&gt;These were chipping badly by day 4 of wear.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love, love gel nails.  I love french tips and I thought this product would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was such a waste of money.  First, they usually tear in half when you try to get them off the plastic they come on.  There&#x27;s a huge waste there.  Then they appear to stick to everything but the nail.  It&#x27;s so frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then bought french manicure stickers (go a quick search here at Amazon, you can get them for seriously as low as a dollar).  You put them on your nail, paint, and then remove, where the perfect french tip is then left!  I use those with my gel polish. Buy those instead.  Plus, you can have other colors besides white as your tips then.</li>
            <li> The worst french manicure tip strips ever!!!! These strips were tearing while I was carefully peeling them off of the sheet and once they were on my nails they would not even stick and kept tearing even more. These strips would not last a day on..I&#x27;m very disappointed because I do like some of the Sensational products but this one is by far the worst product.Ladies do not spend the money on these strips..</li>
            <li> They are stickers, poor quality and they  peeled off under 2 gel coats after 3 days, I do not recommend this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised at all the negative reviews for this product.  I found them relatively easy to use and did not experience any issues with tearing or crinkling... I just took my time and they turned out very professional-looking.  I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and the end result!</li>
            <li> I watched the instructional video and followed the steps exactly. In the past I have hand painted the white tips on BUT saw how perfect these white strips looked and thought I should give it a try  They looked AMAZING for one entire day.........what a waste of time.&lt;br /&gt;I will go back to painting the white tip on by hand.  THOSE will stay on for 2 weeks.  I guess if it is too good to be true then it is.</li>
            <li> A friend gave me a strip of these to try so I used them with the Sally Hansen LED gel polish bottom and top coats. They were very easy to use and turned out perfect.  They come pressed between a single strip of plastic. What I did was I cut between each tip with scissors  (leaving it still incased in the hard plastic overlays) for easy access one by one.&lt;br /&gt;I am on day 3 and so far no chips...I will update this review if needed as far as wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what I did...&lt;br /&gt;Cleaned nail with alcohol&lt;br /&gt;Applied Sally Hansen bottom gel coat and fired in LED light&lt;br /&gt;Wiped off sticky residue with alcohol&lt;br /&gt;Applied stickers&lt;br /&gt;Followed up with three coats of Sally Hansen gel top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They could be a little thicker..but they worked fine. I think cutting them into little square individual tips and then peeling off the plastic to apply one by one made it much easier than it would have been otherwise. I will keep looking for tips that are both inexpensive and a little thicker as I think the added support of a thicker tip would help me keep my nails growing. But for now I am going to by a couple sets of these because they look so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;These were chipping badly by day 4 of wear. Not sure if this is because I did not use them with the original product line or not. I don&#x27;t think that should have mattered given that normally I have a hard time getting gel polish off my nails and I have to soak for 30 minutes minimum. I will keep searching and paint my tips by hand until I find something that sticks without chipping so fast.</li>
            <li> Putting on the tips on my nails was a hard, filing the excess was even harder. The tips would break too much at the end. Nonetheless, after approximately an hour and a half to two hours, (and following all the rules with the file, gel cleanser, primer, base and top coat, and the clear gel polish), I loved how my nails looked after I with finished them. They looked as if I had come out of the salon but not for too long. After just a couple of hours later, the tips were starting to fall out by pieces and on the same night, I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore and took them all out with my hands. I was surprise how easy the white tips just came out. I must re-say it, it was too easy. It got me so much time to do my nails to just undo them the same day. It wasn&#x27;t worth it. WORST PRODUCT EVER, DON&#x27;T FALL FOR IT, DON&#x27;T BUY IT. This doesn&#x27;t happen with the other regular color gels from Sensational though, just with the French Tips.</li>
            <li> These tips are difficult to apply.  They are thin, only not thin enough to file them off very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to do one hand fairly successfully, however trying to apply the tabs to the other hand was a mess.  They are pretty stick and will stick to everything but the nail.  I found it helps a little to make sure the gel primer is completely aired dried before trying to apply.  Also, make sure that no edge of the tab is sticking up as it will continue to come up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was fortunate enough to get a white polish with the kit I bought and found that to be a little easier to use.  You have to have a steady hand to apply well.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. I had no experience doing french gel nails but the result came out outstanding. Very easy to apply but you have to be gentle though when applying...the tips are fragile and thin. I did it right for the first time and will buy more however I still have some from the previous purchase...</li>
            <li> My nails looked great ... but only for ONE DAY.  :-( By the second day the white tips (stickers) were already chipping off on the ends. I ended up having to soak off what was left and do my nails over again (NOT with these lousy tips).  Before using the Sensationail French Manicure Tips, I watched the youtube tutorial, and I then followed the directions to the letter. It  was somewhat frustrating applying the stickers since they stuck to EVERYTHING, and often broke / cracked while trying to position them correctly on the nail. But I thought it would be worth it if they lasted 2 weeks or so, like all of my other gel polish manicures normally do.  I went to all that trouble for nothing. I have been doing my own gel polish manicures  for about a year now, but don&#x27;t have a quick french manicure down yet, so I thought this might be a &amp;#34;simple &amp; quick&amp;#34; solution. Boy, was I wrong! What a waste of time and money that was.  :-(</li>
            <li> These have a lot of bad reviews but they deserve more love then they are getting. I had no problem applying these. They are sticky on one side so be careful when peeling the protective cover back and not lay the sticky side on anything. I was able to apply and adjust them if I messed up. They may take a little practice if you are not use to using these kind of strips but they looked great when I was done. I&#x27;ve also found that it&#x27;s not necessary to cure them with a gel top coat. If I&#x27;m feeling lazy ill just paint over them with a normal top coat and they still look nice. Gel and curing do last longer but they work well enough to not have to spend all the money on the full kit or other curing lamps. I&#x27;ve found them cheaper than here in my local store. They usually run around $6.</li>
            <li> I have used these French manicure wraps multiple times on my finger nails and toe nails with absolutely beautiful results! I&#x27;m assuming the other reviewers did not do it properly, otherwise they would have lasted much longer than a day. I&#x27;ve had mine on for 2 weeks now without one chip out of them on my fingers AND toes. These wraps have to be used with the Sensationail gel clear coat and you have to cure it with a UV nail light. If you don&#x27;t follow these steps they will not work. The clear coat will still feel a little sticky after it has dried. The trick is to wipe them down lightly with alcohol pads. If you follow these steps you will have beautiful nails for several weeks. In all my times using them I&#x27;ve never had one chip. I&#x27;ve only had to remove them to get my nails balanced. I love them so much I just ordered another 5 boxes! Also kudos to this seller for pricing these so well! If they stay at this price I will continue to order them often.</li>
            <li> They look nice and very sticky.</li>
            <li> I just purchased these little guys at Walmart today and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results!! My nails look like I just to them done at a salon. I will say for the record they do take some practice, but after the first few nails I did it was pretty easy. Note they are like stickers, so they have a very strong adhesive meaning they will stick to anything they touch... And when you peel them off be very gentle!! Otherwise they will break or split. I purchased the french manicure polish kit that just comes with the color polish, 100 white tips, a nail file and cuticle stick. I already have been using the gelish line so I already had the basic supplies needed. If you purchase the french kit you have 2 choices either clear or sheer pink, I purchased the sheer pink and I love it! I used 1 coat of sheer pink under then the white tip, and then another coat of sheer pink on top of the white tip. Which really helps mute down the white tip if you don&#x27;t like the bold white ( like me :/ ) I used these on my toes as well, and I&#x27;m loving how they look. You just have to be gentle when using the tips because like I said there like stickers and have a very strong adhesive. So just be patient and I guarantee you won&#x27;t regret it!! I&#x27;m going to do french nails more often now that I have a way to do it myself. And if you need extra help using these guys go to utube and type in sensatioNail french manicure and there&#x27;s a demo video that explains every step. Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with the results and love these things! I would recommend to anybody! Good luck ;)</li>
            <li> I bought the Sheer Pink French Manicure set that included the free white gel polish, and I&#x27;m glad I did. The tip strips look great, and with a little practice are not too hard to apply. However, despite several coats of gel on top of them, including capping my nail tips, the sticky on the underside of the tips never dries or hardens, and it makes the strips extremely susceptible to peeling. Within an hour of applying an entire manicure, one corner of one of the tips peeled right off and cracked. I can see peeling underneath the rest of the tips. And it isn&#x27;t the manicure either, as the rest of the gel is solid on my nail, its just the tips! I am glad I got the free white polish because I have already had to do a few touch ups on the tips, however it leaves the mani looking very uneven. In the future I plan to only use the white gel and use the guide strips I have from another kit.</li>
            <li> I tried the tips immediately thinking \\&quot;Yes! The perfect way to have great looking tips!\\&quot; Since i really suck at painting them with my non-dominant hand...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first nail I did went on flawlessly! I was immediately hooked! I ended up doing my whole hand and thats when the problem began..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;-Cheap to purchase&lt;br /&gt;-Look great for the first 5 minutes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;-Sticky...very sticky! They stick to EVERYTHING other than the nail. Once I finally got 1 on my nail and began to file - as directed...it peeled up and cracked and broke&lt;br /&gt;-Look CHEAP!&lt;br /&gt;-When trying to get 1 out of the package...about 4 others lifted up with it b/c they stick to everything&lt;br /&gt;-Thin/Fragile - they crack/break/peel off before you can even add the top coat or file down&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I would have looked at reviews before purchasing, but I guess i&#x27;m glad they only cost me a couple of bucks..</li>
            <li> These are EXTREMELY thin stick-ons that fall apart and break as you handle them- if you can even get them off the plastic strip. You get ONE chance to apply perfectly, if it sticks on crooked, the whole nail is ruined.  They had chipped off within hours.  Don&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> If you are very careful, you can get them off of the film and onto your nail but sticking them to your nail and pulling them off the film gently.  Works as advertised, for the first hour at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a top coat of gel, and these suckers still cracked and looked like crap within 3 days. I got my first chip the same day I used them. They don&#x27;t last. Total waste.</li>
            <li> These are awful!!!!  I LOVE other sensationail products but these are a waste of time and money! So hard to get on correctly.  They break, stick to each other, split, won&#x27;t come off the backing without tearing, impossible to remove (w/out ripping them) to adjust once they touch your nail.  I was so excited to try these and then so dissapointed.  I spent a good hour trying to do one hand.  I didn&#x27;t even attempt to do the other one.  I did completely finish three nails just to see if the look was worth the hassle.  It wasn&#x27;t.  Very thick and weird looking. These went in the trash.</li>
            <li> Okay so for me these were a breeze to apply, they looked great but they chipped right away... Sadly even with multiple top coats. Not worth it in the end :( I really wanted to like these.</li>
            <li> Even though I had read the reviews, I thought these would work if I was extra careful in handling them.  I attempted to place the tips  on with a tweezers.  What a mess.  First of all, the tips are much too wide and long (even though my hands are NOT petite).  After placing a few tips on, they wrinkled easily and began to tear when touching them.  And because they are much too long, when I attempted to lightly file the tips [downward motion, according to the directions], the edges became ragged and torn.  Definitely a waste of my time and money.  Just 3 nails took up 45 minutes of my time before I used acetone to remove them.  Spare yourself the aggravation!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I love having my nails in french manicure style and thought this kit would be a breeze to use.... NO WAY!!!! I tried to use the white stickies on my nails and it is impossible to do on your own... it is a bit easier someone else but still doesn&#x27;t look right... you are better off sticking to white polish to make your french manicure!</li>
            <li> [ASIN:B009F9UDYA Sensationail French Manicure Tips\\&quot;ONLY\\&quot; #71710]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I checked on youtube for how to apply and was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was  after a few practices, and how great they looked.  This was shattered the very next day when the tips started chipping.  I filed down so my nails were chip free, and reapplied pink and top coat, making sure I really capped the ends.  They were chipping again within an hour.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I bought these after purchasing the sally hansen gel manicure kit. I tried doing a french tip with regular nail polish, but it just didn&#x27;t look right. I thought about using gel white, but I figured that it would create a \\&quot;lip\\&quot; or step on the nail due to the thickness after curing. Plus, the gel doesn&#x27;t dry like normal, so you can&#x27;t shape it with the acetone as you would with regular polish. Anyways, these were pretty easy to use and they look much better than what I did with normal white tip polish. I knocked them down a star because I had to cut the sides to make them fit on most of my fingers....wish they made these in petite size!</li>
