            <li>Beautiful nail stickers that are easy to use.  </li>
            <li>i ordered these for a quick way to add nail art to my clients nails and figured if they weren&#x27;t that great</li>
            <li>Either way, they&#x27;re easy to apply and add loads of character to your nail beds!  </li>
            <li>I love the way they look.</li>
            <li>these nail tattoos look much better in the picture than in</li>
            <li>I was hoping after the top coat was applied</li>
            <li>They were cute when I saw them&lt;br</li>
            <li>u will pay much more</li>
            <li>These nail tattoo&#x27;s are super cute and after a top coat look like they have been hand painted on.</li>
            <li>dosent slide off easy</li>
            <li>I got the impression that these were like stickers that you can easily peel off.</li>
            <li>Great Fun and such an easy way to add character to your nail beds!  </li>
            <li>My wife buys these things and her nails look fabulous.</li>
            <li>very pretty and so easy to use,</li>
            <li>Either polish your nails first, or add them free of any polish!  </li>
            <li>Very nice, still a bit harder to remove from backing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure these would be fine on natural nails</li>
            <li>I love the vibrant color and design, but I needed to experiment a couple of time before I got the pattern</li>
            <li>Very pretty</li>
            <li>looks great over a soft pink polish</li>
            <li>THEY ARE SO PRETTY.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to find different nail stickers.</li>
            <li>First thing i noticed is that you could see the whole outline of where you have to cut out your design  </li>
            <li>This nail decal looks like it was hand painted and also looks like real flowers.</li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE THIS DESIGN ALOT</li>
            <li>they are so thin and after applying a gel top coat as suggested you cant even tell its a tattoo sticker!</li>
            <li>The picture shown here shows a clear backing so you can apply to any polish color, that&#x27;s what I wanted.</li>
            <li>i was shocked to get them way earlier then quoted since they came to the USA from Germany and the packing was great too!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nails have to have clear polish  on  in order for tattoos to show</li>
            <li>If you have your nails professionally done beware</li>
            <li>but as far as professional nails</li>
            <li>Anyone who has gel topcoats done knows that once they come out from under the light they are hard as a rock.</li>
            <li>not what you see in this picture show, and it printed on a brown paper hard to see you have to cut out every each design first not just peel design off from the whole sheet.</li>
            <li>real life.&lt;br /&gt;The colurs are muted and the detailing is not as clear as the picture the items are tiny as expected</li>
            <li>They were hard to use and you had to cut them out yourself and they were too long to fit on my nails</li>
            <li>the application was easy and they are so thin they do not leave outlines of the design at all.</li>

            <li> the application was easy and they are so thin they do not leave outlines of the design at all.</li>
            <li> These are pretty stickers, but hard to use.  </li>
            <li> They last for a long time.</li>
            <li> However my exctiment did not last long.</li>
            <li> The only problem was how long it took to arrive as long as you don&#x27;t mind the wait.</li>
            <li> These stickers are really hard to take off the paper and look very washed out when they are nails.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t get them off the backing without shredding them, a complete waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> and I have rather long fingernails.</li>
            <li> Not only that, there is only one sheet of wax designs, they could&#x27;ve at least gave three.</li>
            <li> Total waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I ended up throwing them away after destroying several designs.</li>
            <li> OTHER THAN THAT</li>
            <li> even black looks like dark brown.</li>
            <li> They are so thin and fragile it is not worth the effort.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get fool by these stickers type, they came out with kinda dead colors</li>
            <li> The colors are soo dead looking</li>
            <li> Waste of money on my part - do not recommend</li>
            <li> I wasted 5 of them from trying to peel it from the paper before I got one to not tear.</li>
            <li> says, my nail tech did my acrylic nails as usual and buffed my nails</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time looking at these or your $$$!</li>
            <li> I would not order any other products made by this conpany, it was a waste of my hard earned money!!</li>
            <li> Designs to small to see in person and to hard to use.  </li>
            <li> With the small size that is hard to do.  </li>
            <li> Too hard to use.  </li>
            <li> hard to use and paper</li>
            <li> but...SO HARD TO PEEL IT OFF THE BROWN PAPER!</li>
            <li> Dumb design.</li>
            <li> The stickers are very hard to get off the backing and after applied to your nail you can see all the edges.</li>
            <li> These were very hard to get off the paper and onto nails without ripping them.</li>
            <li> But instead they are thin plastic wax and as you pull it up you rip the design, rendering it unusable.</li>
            <li> can I say other than disappointed, wont be purchasing from them again.</li>
            <li> I was unable to use any of them.  </li>
            <li> I would not see the edges, but unfortunately I could.</li>
            <li> They offer stickers but those are made of paper, and are difficult to use</li>
            <li> BUT THE PROBLEM WAS IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO REMOVE FROM PAPER.  </li>
            <li> you have to cut them to size and then its impossible to peel the backing off,</li>
            <li> it looked an ugly color brown</li>
            <li> I ended up, messing a couple off and got frustrated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Useless!!</li>
            <li> Hated them.</li>
            <li> The product is terrible</li>
            <li> Horrible product!</li>

            <li> I bought these for my Wifes business and they were a hit.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get fool by these stickers type, they came out with kinda dead colors not what you see in this picture show, and it printed on a brown paper hard to see you have to cut out every each design first not just peel design off from the whole sheet. I&#x27;m so disappointed. The colors are soo dead looking even black looks like dark brown. Product ship out from china it took forever. I would not recommended to anybody even kid.</li>
            <li> My wife buys these things and her nails look fabulous.</li>
            <li> Hated them. The backing is beige so I can only apply to beige nail polish so the backing blends in. The picture shown here shows a clear backing so you can apply to any polish color, that&#x27;s what I wanted. But the ones I received are on beige paper so I can&#x27;t. Total waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Just got my nail tattoo today, have not had time to use them yet. I love the way they look. Good job miss nail cosmetics will order again.</li>
            <li> I thought these were like stickers. you have to cut them to size and then its impossible to peel the backing off,</li>
            <li> If you have your nails professionally done beware these DO NOT work with the gel like the package says, my nail tech did my acrylic nails as usual and buffed my nails then placed these stickers over the buffed nail and then added gel topcoat.  First thing i noticed is that you could see the whole outline of where you have to cut out your design  it looked an ugly color brown, then the next morning i found that the stickers created a pocket under the gel and they started peeling off as soon as I peeled my orange for my breakfast.  Anyone who has gel topcoats done knows that once they come out from under the light they are hard as a rock. not the nails with the stickers.  The package says the sticker will absorb the gel. no nada they do not.  I&#x27;m sure these would be fine on natural nails but as far as professional nails I definitely WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> these nail tattoos look much better in the picture than in real life.&lt;br /&gt;The colurs are muted and the detailing is not as clear as the picture the items are tiny as expected but they just appeared to be a faded version of the advertised item.&lt;br /&gt;What can I say other than disappointed, wont be purchasing from them again.</li>
            <li> I was unable to use any of them.  They tear before you can even get them off the backing.  Too hard to use.  Waste of money and too much time.  Tried several.</li>
            <li> The product is terrible you can&#x27;t get them off the backing without shredding them, a complete waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like because, the tatto nails with water don&#x27;t stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The times I&#x27;ve tried you wear them, figure to keep and use water dana and when I try to put myself in enamel, as if rid the tatto.</li>
            <li> Designs to small to see in person and to hard to use.  Waste of money on my part - do not recommend</li>
            <li> Refer to the nail art gems, same review.  This nail decal looks like it was hand painted and also looks like real flowers. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Beautiful nail stickers that are easy to use.  Just Peel and stick - no water required.  They last for a long time.</li>
            <li> you have to cut out the design and try to peal from the backing....they would not peal ...just rip....I ended up throwing them away after destroying several designs.</li>
            <li> These stickers are really hard to take off the paper and look very washed out when they are nails. The water transfer decals are way easier to use.</li>
            <li> hard to use and paper dosent slide off easy</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews before purchasing. Yes you can see all of the excess you don&#x27;t cut off on your nail. I wasted 5 of them from trying to peel it from the paper before I got one to not tear. They are so thin and fragile it is not worth the effort. Horrible product! never again will I try these or recommend.</li>
            <li> very pretty and so easy to use,</li>
            <li> These nail tattoo&#x27;s are super cute and after a top coat look like they have been hand painted on. Its a litte tricky getting them off the backing, but I found that tweezers help! Love them!!</li>
            <li> Great Fun and such an easy way to add character to your nail beds!  Either polish your nails first, or add them free of any polish!  Either way, they&#x27;re easy to apply and add loads of character to your nail beds!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Dumb design. I got the impression that these were like stickers that you can easily peel off. But instead they are thin plastic wax and as you pull it up you rip the design, rendering it unusable. I want my money back! Useless!! Not only that, there is only one sheet of wax designs, they could&#x27;ve at least gave three.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS DESIGN ALOT BUT THE PROBLEM WAS IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO REMOVE FROM PAPER.  OTHER THAN THAT IT WOULD OF BEEN GREAT CAUSE THEY ARE SO PRETTY.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to find different nail stickers. However my exctiment did not last long. The stickers are very hard to get off the backing and after applied to your nail you can see all the edges. I was hoping after the top coat was applied I would not see the edges, but unfortunately I could. I would not order any other products made by this conpany, it was a waste of my hard earned money!!</li>
            <li> I ordered a bunch of these stickers. This one, the eyes, the blk &amp; pnk stars, blk &amp; blue stars and music notes. Very pretty but...SO HARD TO PEEL IT OFF THE BROWN PAPER! I ended up, messing a couple off and got frustrated. Don&#x27;t waste your time looking at these or your $$$! Will never buy again.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase. The only problem was how long it took to arrive as long as you don&#x27;t mind the wait.</li>
            <li> I love the vibrant color and design, but I needed to experiment a couple of time before I got the pattern they way I wanted</li>
            <li> It is not what they offer in pictures. They offer stickers but those are made of paper, and are difficult to use</li>
            <li> Very nice, still a bit harder to remove from backing but the color is perfect as advertised. looks great over a soft pink polish</li>
            <li> They were hard to use and you had to cut them out yourself and they were too long to fit on my nails and I have rather long fingernails.</li>
            <li> These were very hard to get off the paper and onto nails without ripping them. I ended up only trying twice and never used them again.</li>
            <li> i ordered these for a quick way to add nail art to my clients nails and figured if they weren&#x27;t that great it would be a good stocking stuffer for my daughter....i am happy to say they work amazing! they are so thin and after applying a gel top coat as suggested you cant even tell its a tattoo sticker! the application was easy and they are so thin they do not leave outlines of the design at all. the shipping was awesome also...i was shocked to get them way earlier then quoted since they came to the USA from Germany and the packing was great too! i will definitely be ordering from this seller again for all my business needs.</li>
            <li> They were cute when I saw them&lt;br /&gt;Nails have to have clear polish  on  in order for tattoos to show</li>
            <li> I am done even trying these again.  The last time I tried I thought maybe i need practice. Forget it.  Never again will I EVER buy these.  The sheet ended up in the garbage like the last one.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet but I can&#x27;t wait to try them out if u buy something like this in the store u will pay much more</li>
            <li> These are pretty stickers, but hard to use.  You have to cut the shape out and then try to peel it off the backing.  With the small size that is hard to do.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
