            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this RESCUE Tooth Powder and the RESCUE Oil Massage on my gums and I have seen a significant improvement in gum growth.</li>

            <li>My teeth feel super clean and my mouth feels fresh.</li>
            <li>I have come to find that the product is viable for long term good dental and gum health.</li>
            <li>Ever since i purchased this tooth powder and started using it as directed my gums have been feeling ten times better!</li>
            <li>I had fluorosis of the teeth, and this product is clearing it up amazingly, I also had bleeding gums whenever I brushed and</li>
            <li>This powder leaves your mouth feeling fresh and soothes your gums.</li>
            <li>but so far I have noticed two things in a week of use: 1) my breath is better in the morning after I use this at bed time 2)</li>
            <li>I have dramatically shrunk the pockets that had developed around many of my teeth.</li>
            <li>It is different has a good taste, helps get tarter off in a gentle way.</li>
            <li>results.&amp;#34;  Does not compare to my minty fresh toothpaste,</li>
            <li>They also provided information pamphlets about the other products which is good to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this three times now (just got it three days ago; using it a little more than 3x a week to to help with a good deal of gum recession), but so far I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li>did notice it really gets the teeth clean.</li>
            <li>This is useful for sore gums, it leaves your mouth very toned and fresh.</li>
            <li>, it is very soft, light in color</li>
            <li>My daughter saw results very fast, within a day or two.</li>
            <li>I first bought this product probably a year ago.  </li>
            <li>, it was really different from the tooth and mouth cleaners I was used to, but I am glad I bought</li>
            <li>The tooth powder is exactly as described and on time.  </li>
            <li>This product worked very well!</li>
            <li>whiter - not blinding white like you see alot now, more healthy NORMAL white -</li>
            <li>Pretty much don&#x27;t notice it anymore.</li>
            <li>It tastes like a very spiced seasoned chai tea.</li>
            <li>When I read through the ingredient list, a big smile comes on my face because they are so full of Mother</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a few days, but my mouth feels amazing, my teeth feel better than getting a professional cleaning done.</li>
            <li>When I purchased this product, I was very hopeful.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice anything</li>
            <li>To much for this product to overcome</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It really worked.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>Thank you all so much.</li>
            <li>This product made my gums very tender, couldn&#x27;t even brush my teeth.</li>
            <li>Alittle messy, but effective</li>
            <li>It also helps to keep my teeth looking white and clean.</li>
            <li>It really does make gums feel better and recession seem less.  </li>
            <li>I used it for 3 days in a row and my very  swollen gums were normal again.</li>
            <li>They feel much cleaner, and this product feels very natural.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend the mouthwash and their powdered toothpastes.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years and have been recommending it to my friends and my dentist after he asked how I have been able to have so little plaque build up between visits.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you bend a little over the sink</li>
            <li>, I am soooooo glad my prayer was answered for help regarding my gum problems, I put 2 stars for those who look at the negative remarks first, I want to share my story with all of you who are considering using this product.  </li>
            <li>, this is normal, this product is detoxing your&lt;br /&gt;gums</li>
            <li>The taste is very subtle, but it&#x27;s pleasant.</li>
            <li>I had a very large gum sore that kept coming back.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a little tender right now, which appears to be normal due to the toxins coming out, but I&#x27;m pleased so far and encouraged to keep using it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s hard to say for sure,</li>
            <li>I do recommend it if you are seeking an natural alternative.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find that all the bleeding I had periodically stopped completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due</li>
            <li>One of my front bottom teeth was very recessed I have had two deep cleanings</li>
            <li>and that is saying a lot because I&#x27;ve tried SEVERAL products and this is the only one that seems to really help!</li>
            <li>After about a month of use I was brushing my teeth and afterward looked in the mirror, I thought my gum was bleeding because the gum was very red on the recessed area, I rinsed and looked again, it was not bleeding it was new gum growing in.</li>
            <li>I told a friend of mine that has been suffering from major dental stress about your products and she got all of them.</li>
            <li>The major change I made in my dental rountine by switching to Anti-Aging Company products made ALL the difference.</li>
            <li>It does take a little getting used to using this powder if you&#x27;re used to paste, but WELL WORTH the accomodation.</li>
            <li>I apparently had a cavity into a filling that decayed below the surface...</li>
            <li>Having spent too much money on dental work I decided to use this and just see if it worked.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first few times I used it I noticed a yellow tinge on my teeth, so I brushed with my normal paste to clear it off.</li>
            <li>have had dental problems for years, the first time using this powder, the pain I had for a year and a half went away, please keep this in mind, whatever you use to detox your system you will have a reaction as the poisons leave your body</li>
            <li>For my particular problem I did not see the results I expected...</li>
            <li>So be careful with that, but I have found that the yellow coloration does not remain after using normal paste.</li>

            <li> , this is normal, this product is detoxing your&lt;br /&gt;gums</li>
            <li> The taste is very subtle, but it&#x27;s pleasant.</li>
            <li> I had a very large gum sore that kept coming back.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little tender right now, which appears to be normal due to the toxins coming out, but I&#x27;m pleased so far and encouraged to keep using it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to say for sure,</li>
            <li> I do recommend it if you are seeking an natural alternative.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find that all the bleeding I had periodically stopped completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due</li>
            <li> One of my front bottom teeth was very recessed I have had two deep cleanings</li>
            <li> and that is saying a lot because I&#x27;ve tried SEVERAL products and this is the only one that seems to really help!</li>
            <li> After about a month of use I was brushing my teeth and afterward looked in the mirror, I thought my gum was bleeding because the gum was very red on the recessed area, I rinsed and looked again, it was not bleeding it was new gum growing in.</li>
            <li> I told a friend of mine that has been suffering from major dental stress about your products and she got all of them.</li>
            <li> The major change I made in my dental rountine by switching to Anti-Aging Company products made ALL the difference.</li>
            <li> It does take a little getting used to using this powder if you&#x27;re used to paste, but WELL WORTH the accomodation.</li>
            <li> I apparently had a cavity into a filling that decayed below the surface...</li>
            <li> Having spent too much money on dental work I decided to use this and just see if it worked.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first few times I used it I noticed a yellow tinge on my teeth, so I brushed with my normal paste to clear it off.</li>
            <li> have had dental problems for years, the first time using this powder, the pain I had for a year and a half went away, please keep this in mind, whatever you use to detox your system you will have a reaction as the poisons leave your body</li>
            <li> For my particular problem I did not see the results I expected...</li>
            <li> So be careful with that, but I have found that the yellow coloration does not remain after using normal paste.</li>
            <li> It really cleans my teeth well, and after only a couple of weeks, my gums bleed less!  </li>
            <li> Not magical, but I really like the feel of this after brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it really helps</li>
            <li> It is gritty and it does need a few swishes and rinses to clear out the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After not using it for so long my teeth started to hurt again</li>
            <li> But then again, maybe they are just really passionate for what they are selling</li>
            <li> , long casting</li>
            <li> was curious about Tooth Powders for dental care</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get directions with the powder, so I was a little confused at first.  </li>
            <li> but I had my doubts partially due to the over selling of information in the title.</li>
            <li> I read on other reviews the reason is because of the porousness of my teeth due to using whitening toothpastes.</li>
            <li> Will do buy again due to cost.  </li>
            <li> Would not buy it again due to its price.</li>
            <li> I use this a few times a week usually at night after brushing with my regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Gets all down front of clothing</li>
            <li> /&gt;After one and a half months of use</li>
            <li> I have less sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Instead of using it like toothpaste I just rubbed a little on the areas of recession after brushing my teeth.  </li>
            <li> When I did this, I also noticed that my teeth looked a little whiter and healthier</li>
            <li> I think my teeth are already looking a little bit whiter</li>
            <li> Messy.</li>
            <li> My situation was very serious with gums due to other health issues that contributed to my gum problems but it did work somewhat for me.</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU PRAY FOR!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used dental powder before, and it&#x27;s a little messy and awkward to get used to, but not a big deal.</li>
            <li> So I usually use the tooth powder at night.</li>
            <li> Not sure that it works for me.  </li>
            <li> Not sure this does anything at all.</li>
            <li> This combo makes me feel like I might avoid having the usual dental problems that I used to have to endure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the product came hard in package</li>
            <li> do you feel when you read something negative or hear something negative?  </li>
            <li> My gums used to get so red and painfully inflamed, and nothing helped - till I found this!  </li>
            <li> Wow...... the taste is awful .</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth very bad</li>
            <li> Was skeptical about this.</li>
            <li> product is a real game changer for cleaning and healing my mouth.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Helped a ton with gum sensitivity! Pretty much don&#x27;t notice it anymore.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference. Not buying again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few days, but my mouth feels amazing, my teeth feel better than getting a professional cleaning done. Would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I first bought this product probably a year ago.  I didn&#x27;t get directions with the powder, so I was a little confused at first.  Instead of using it like toothpaste I just rubbed a little on the areas of recession after brushing my teeth.  It truly made my gums feel better.  Once I ran out I stopped using it because I couldn&#x27;t find it on Amazon again.  After not using it for so long my teeth started to hurt again so I searched Amazon again and found the powder.  I had to order it again.  It really does make gums feel better and recession seem less.  Definitely a must have product for recession...and that is saying a lot because I&#x27;ve tried SEVERAL products and this is the only one that seems to really help!</li>
            <li> Amazing product litteraly worked in just 2 days taste as said is not the treated but it did what it says and more</li>
            <li> awesome product for gum issues!</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> Great product. Alittle messy, but effective</li>
            <li> For my situation this did not work much better than my $8.69 tube of TheraNeem Mint Toothpaste . Neem works pretty good on gum problems too.  I would suggest others try Neem 1st ( because of this price) &amp; see if it works for them. There is another product called &amp;#34;AMOSAN oral wound cleanser&amp;#34;  that may be good for gum problems as well . I have not tried it yet but I like what I have read in the reviews .I did notice it really gets the teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Wow...... the taste is awful . But it did take care of some bleeding problems between my teeth.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical about this. I&#x27;d never used powder tooth cleaning product. Not magical, but I really like the feel of this after brushing my teeth. They feel much cleaner, and this product feels very natural.</li>
            <li> taste good , heals well, absolutely worth the money!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This powder leaves your mouth feeling fresh and soothes your gums.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, pleasant taste. My gums look much better and rarely bleed now. I use this and the Happy Teeth powder... both are great! I think my teeth have also become whiter. I&#x27;ve been using these products for over a year now and will continue.</li>
            <li> Great product. I will definitely be placing another order from this company again. It works.</li>
            <li> Good taste. Seems to be working. Mouth looks and feels cleaner. Messy. Gets all down front of clothing</li>
            <li> This product has saved my gums. I&#x27;ve been using this RESCUE Tooth Powder and the RESCUE Oil Massage on my gums and I have seen a significant improvement in gum growth. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Anti Aging Company LLC products for over 2-1/2 months and I highly recommend the mouthwash and their powdered toothpastes. Their products are as described. I am so glad I tried them.</li>
            <li> This is useful for sore gums, it leaves your mouth very toned and fresh. I do recommend it if you are seeking an natural alternative.&lt;br /&gt;I was curious about Tooth Powders for dental care so I decided to try this but I had my doubts partially due to the over selling of information in the title. But then again, maybe they are just really passionate for what they are selling and they know it is a great product... So I bought it, It arrived quickly and without any issues. They also provided information pamphlets about the other products which is good to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one and a half months of use and I&#x27;ve found that Dental Rescue Tooth Powder is very effective for soothing my gums when they are irritated after flossing. I use this a few times a week usually at night after brushing with my regular toothpaste. I started using this tooth powder just for good measure not that I had any oral issues. But then I noticed that when I had any tenderness in my mouth after flossing this powder would soothe it very quickly. No sore gums or achy feeling and that is a great thing for this powder to do.&lt;br /&gt;The first few times I used it I noticed a yellow tinge on my teeth, so I brushed with my normal paste to clear it off. I read on other reviews the reason is because of the porousness of my teeth due to using whitening toothpastes. So be careful with that, but I have found that the yellow coloration does not remain after using normal paste. So I usually use the tooth powder at night. It tastes like a very spiced seasoned chai tea. It is gritty and it does need a few swishes and rinses to clear out the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**(If you are in need because of your mouth and gums give this a chance, it was really different from the tooth and mouth cleaners I was used to, but I am glad I bought it.)**t did.)**</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how good it is yet, just started using it.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this product, I was very hopeful. After two weeks of using the product for bedtime brushing, I can see no visable improvement.</li>
            <li> Saved gums from perio surgery !</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice anything</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it really helps</li>
            <li> It works like magic! I bought one for my daugther that was having problems with bleeding gums but after using this product not anymore.  She is super pleased  with the results.  My daughter saw results very fast, within a day or two. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had a very large gum sore that kept coming back. I could not find anything that helped it. I used this powder. I put a bunch of it on with my finger and left it in the inflamed area. It hurt for a moment but then I started feeling some relief. It almost felt like it was drawing out the toxins or whatever was causing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has such a healing nature to it I started using it on all my teeth and gums. I was surprised to find that all the bleeding I had periodically stopped completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to all these good things happening, I started using the powder to brush with. When I did this, I also noticed that my teeth looked a little whiter and healthier looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product--and the ingredients are the purest!</li>
            <li> For my particular problem I did not see the results I expected...BUT The company staff was EXCELLENT..Refunded cost with no hassle..I have come to find that the product is viable for long term good dental and gum health.I apparently had a cavity into a filling that decayed below the surface...To much for this product to overcome</li>
            <li> Not too sure about this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this three times now (just got it three days ago; using it a little more than 3x a week to to help with a good deal of gum recession), but so far I&#x27;m loving it. My teeth feel super clean and my mouth feels fresh. The taste is very subtle, but it&#x27;s pleasant. I&#x27;ve never used dental powder before, and it&#x27;s a little messy and awkward to get used to, but not a big deal. I think my teeth are already looking a little bit whiter and it&#x27;s hard to say for sure, but I think I&#x27;m seeing some improvement in my gums already. They&#x27;re a little tender right now, which appears to be normal due to the toxins coming out, but I&#x27;m pleased so far and encouraged to keep using it. Here&#x27;s hoping I can reverse my dental issues without a hefty dental bill!</li>
            <li> Not sure that it works for me.  Tastes pretty good though!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It taste amazing and really cleans my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;This product is a real game changer for cleaning and healing my mouth.</li>
            <li> I have not had this product long to get the miracle results that others have experienced but so far I have noticed two things in a week of use: 1) my breath is better in the morning after I use this at bed time 2) I have less sensitivity. I will have to write an update if more happens!</li>
            <li> It did help with bleeding gums but still had soreness. My situation was very serious with gums due to other health issues that contributed to my gum problems but it did work somewhat for me.</li>
            <li> this is the best tooth powder...I use it after I brush with regular toothpaste...It says not to but I use my sonic toothbrush with it.....this does an amazing job, it makes you feel like you just went to the dentist...good flavor too..very herbal</li>
            <li> Not sure this does anything at all. Seems like a placebo.</li>
            <li> My gums used to get so red and painfully inflamed, and nothing helped - till I found this!  I sometimes even use it as toothpaste. I don&#x27;t know how they do it, but their products work better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me.  But the seller refunded my money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and have been recommending it to my friends and my dentist after he asked how I have been able to have so little plaque build up between visits. It also helps to keep my teeth looking white and clean. Everyone should have this in their cabinet at home.</li>
            <li> Makes your mouth feel really clean.</li>
            <li> Excellent. The tooth powder is exactly as described and on time.  I have been using it for a week now and can already feel a difference in how clean my mouth feels.  I will be buying again it the future.</li>
            <li> I told a friend of mine that has been suffering from major dental stress about your products and she got all of them. She used them and then went to her dentist. Both, she and her dentist were amazed at the transformation of gum health. As a present for helping her, she sent me this powder. Now, I am using it with the happy powder and mouthwash. This combo makes me feel like I might avoid having the usual dental problems that I used to have to endure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to thank you for making such holistic products. When I read through the ingredient list, a big smile comes on my face because they are so full of Mother Nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is time to get back to Mother Nature!</li>
            <li> Love this product! It does take a little getting used to using this powder if you&#x27;re used to paste, but WELL WORTH the accomodation. Just make sure you bend a little over the sink so the powder doesn&#x27;t sprinkle on your clothes. I can see that my teeth have gotten whiter - not blinding white like you see alot now, more healthy NORMAL white - and it has help IMMENSELY with my dental health. I have dramatically shrunk the pockets that had developed around many of my teeth. The major change I made in my dental rountine by switching to Anti-Aging Company products made ALL the difference. I can&#x27;t give enough praise to Dr. Arenander&#x27;s dental products.</li>
            <li> Best dental appointment I ever had after using this. No cavities!!!!</li>
            <li> Gentle on the teeth and tastes great.</li>
            <li> It is different has a good taste, helps get tarter off in a gentle way.</li>
            <li> One of my front bottom teeth was very recessed I have had two deep cleanings and it did not help. I was starting to think I would lose this tooth and as a last measure decided to use this along with the mouth detox. After about a month of use I was brushing my teeth and afterward looked in the mirror, I thought my gum was bleeding because the gum was very red on the recessed area, I rinsed and looked again, it was not bleeding it was new gum growing in. I could not believe it, this has been a problem for 20 years, all dentist that I went to said nothing could be done. I am beyond happy and will be using this from now on.</li>
            <li> This product is AWESOME ! w/ in 2 days, the pain was gone from the mouth &amp; the swelling went away&lt;br /&gt;Highly REC</li>
            <li> This product worked very well! I have dry mouth very bad and this is the only toothpaste/powder that gets all the tarter off my teeth. Thank you for this wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Omigosh!  This is the BEST tooth care product that I&#x27;ve come across.  It really cleans my teeth well, and after only a couple of weeks, my gums bleed less!  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone with dental issues.</li>
            <li> nice cleaning sensaci&amp;oacute;n, long casting</li>
            <li> Product is ok.  Like the neem toothpaste better.  Will do buy again due to cost.  Did not notice any difference using this product.</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU PRAY FOR!!!! YOU might get it, I am soooooo glad my prayer was answered for help regarding my gum problems, I put 2 stars for those who look at the negative remarks first, I want to share my story with all of you who are considering using this product.  I have read the same thing you did, and thought to myself, what do I want to get out of this product?  Hummm then I decided to try it, because I did MY own RESEARCH on this company and their product, it sound good to me.&lt;br /&gt;How do you feel when you read something negative or hear something negative?  YOU have to decide what to do with what you hear, I am so very HAPPY I listened to myself and ordered this powered, it is very soft, light in color the taste is good, I want to eat it.&lt;br /&gt;I have had dental problems for years, the first time using this powder, the pain I had for a year and a half went away, please keep this in mind, whatever you use to detox your system you will have a reaction as the poisons leave your body, this is normal, this product is detoxing your&lt;br /&gt;gums, you may get a sore or tender gums, Do YOUR own RESEARCH take care of body, may your gums be healthy and happy I give this product 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D. Thomas</li>
            <li> I had fluorosis of the teeth, and this product is clearing it up amazingly, I also had bleeding gums whenever I brushed and this product has stopped that too. I honestly feel the enamel rebuilding itself the more I use this product. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have had this for about a week now and can already see an improvement in the irritated spots on my gums.</li>
            <li> I love this product. This product saved me. It really worked.&lt;br /&gt;Will order again</li>
            <li> What a great product! This stuff really works. Ever since i purchased this tooth powder and started using it as directed my gums have been feeling ten times better! Shout out to the makers of this product and the seller. Thank you all so much. God bless!</li>
            <li> the product came hard in package</li>
            <li> I use this and I like it.  My teeth and gums look healthy to me!  Lots of really good quality ingredients in this mixture.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> This product made my gums very tender, couldn&#x27;t even brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> Going on 3 weeks now; have not  noticed &amp;#34;miraculous results.&amp;#34;  Does not compare to my minty fresh toothpaste, but I will give it more time to see.</li>
            <li> I am waiting for my 6 month dental appointment to see if there is any change in my gums.</li>
            <li> Having spent too much money on dental work I decided to use this and just see if it worked.I used it for 3 days in a row and my very  swollen gums were normal again. Now I use it every 3 days or so and the swelling has not returned...IDK how it worked but it did...and I don&#x27;t give this review lightly. It worked..</li>
            <li> I bought these as I thought they&#x27;d make my gums stop bleeding. Its been about a month I have been using this and I don&#x27;t see any difference. My teeth hasn&#x27;t whitened either. The product however tastes good. Would not buy it again due to its price. I will stick to Sensodyne</li>
