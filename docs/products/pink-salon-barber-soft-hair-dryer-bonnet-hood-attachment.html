            <li>I did not get good results with this product.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t have any kind of elastic or anything.</li>
            <li>This product is very cheap in it doesn&#x27;t stay on your head</li>
            <li>It gets very hot but work good</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t recommend spend more money to get a better one, and the string  hang out the product ...</li>
            <li>WELL LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>its just ok.</li>
            <li>I love this product..</li>
            <li>Love it and will recommend.</li>
            <li>but I am sure I can work with it.</li>
            <li>However, I wish the draw string would stay in place better.</li>
            <li>I am able to tighten it and it doesn&#x27;t come off until I take it off.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to be a good buy.</li>
            <li>me, it&#x27;s a worthy purchase for the price!</li>
            <li>It was cheap and you get what you pay for</li>
            <li>and it was cheap</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t even fit my blowdryer</li>
            <li>It took longer  than I thought to receive but it was worth the wait!</li>
            <li>and I wanted it for hot oil treatments so its ok for that.</li>
            <li>Apparently she loved it.  </li>
            <li>Tube is very slim, it barely fit around the hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Nice product to have when you are traveling and need to deep condition your hair.</li>
            <li>but its pretty cool.</li>
            <li>it is worth the money</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>This product was ok the only thing that I didn&#x27;t like was the fact that it wouldn&#x27;t stay on my head without me having to hold the strings.  </li>
            <li>it gets REALLY hot under there</li>
            <li>I am using my bonnet for the 2nd time and I love it.</li>
            <li>because my roots show pretty fast.</li>
            <li>My hands are free and it really causes my hair to dry quickly.  </li>
            <li>Simple to install and works fine..</li>
            <li>once you get it down its ok.</li>
            <li>Buying this bonnet saved me from purchasing a whole new hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Use only LOW HEAT, that provides more than enough heat for conditioning and styling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty standard.</li>
            <li>probably good for travel but difficult to keep hand held hair dryer attached to bonnet</li>
            <li>as far as trying to dry my hair with rollers I don&#x27;t think I would try it.</li>
            <li>and then it really doesn&#x27;t hold that tight.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and then it really doesn&#x27;t hold that tight.</li>
            <li> This bonnet is too small to fit over curlers, and the heat is not evenly distributed, I suspect as a result of it being too small.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay on head, even while on low dry setting.!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t hold heat very long.</li>
            <li> It is a little small for the rollers and the hose attachment that goes to the handheld hair dryer is very had to attach.</li>
            <li> The black gizmo that is suppose to tighten it broke off after the second use.</li>
            <li> This is a very inexpensive for a reason because the quality is poor.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is my big head.</li>
            <li> Other then that I would give no stars!</li>
            <li> Even though I tied the strings tightly it would come off when I turned the blow dryer on.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t matter how tight you tie the string.</li>
            <li> no matter hoe tight</li>
            <li> The string will not get tight for it to stay on.</li>
            <li> a little tricky.</li>
            <li> The opening is a little small</li>
            <li> so you have to work really hard at getting the rope tight.</li>
            <li> This is small, but works.</li>
            <li> Poor ineffective product waste of money.</li>
            <li> Very poorly constructed.</li>
            <li> It doesnt stay on the mouth of the hair dryer, despite its elastic ring &amp; this item is awkward to hold when using because it tends to act like an accordian or snake by twisting and it is difficult to keep the bonnet on your head and in place when in use.</li>
            <li> Horrible product and not worth the $5 I paid for it</li>
            <li> The item is horrible when you cut on heat from blow dryer the bonnet  flys off.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> will not stay on, the thing to tighten it with broke 1st. time i used it</li>
            <li> Gets the job done....I would def recommend it</li>
            <li> It great work perfect</li>
            <li> this works great with my blow dryer.</li>
            <li> This is small, but works. I only use it occasionally.</li>
            <li> Does not distribute heat evenly around the head.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed. It took longer  than I thought to receive but it was worth the wait!</li>
            <li> This product was ok the only thing that I didn&#x27;t like was the fact that it wouldn&#x27;t stay on my head without me having to hold the strings.  Even though I tied the strings tightly it would come off when I turned the blow dryer on. It was cheap and you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> I did not get good results with this product. It doesnt stay on the mouth of the hair dryer, despite its elastic ring &amp; this item is awkward to hold when using because it tends to act like an accordian or snake by twisting and it is difficult to keep the bonnet on your head and in place when in use. I would not recommend this product for these reasons.</li>
            <li> probably good for travel but difficult to keep hand held hair dryer attached to bonnet</li>
            <li> Just what my wife wanted. great seller.</li>
            <li> Tube is very slim, it barely fit around the hair dryer. Also, the hat flew off my head as soon as I turned the dryer on, there was no way to tighten it enough so it wouldn&#x27;t come off. It only stayed on if I kept it on low and used both hands to hold it on.</li>
            <li> This product is very cheap in it doesn&#x27;t stay on your head doesn&#x27;t matter how tight you tie the string. Don&#x27;t recommend spend more money to get a better one, and the string  hang out the product ... made from China didn&#x27;t take their time with it....</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S WORKS WELL LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> its just ok. I wouldn&#x27;t buy another. it doesn&#x27;t have any kind of elastic or anything. so when you turn on the drier it blows off. so you have to work really hard at getting the rope tight. and then it really doesn&#x27;t hold that tight. so you have to try and hold the cap on while you turn on the drier. a little tricky. once you get it down its ok. doesn&#x27;t hold heat very long. I only got it because I have to color my hair a lot. because my roots show pretty fast. and I wanted it for hot oil treatments so its ok for that. as far as trying to dry my hair with rollers I don&#x27;t think I would try it. maybe if you had thinner shorter hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product..</li>
            <li> This bonnet is too small to fit over curlers, and the heat is not evenly distributed, I suspect as a result of it being too small.</li>
            <li> Very poorly constructed. It doesn&#x27;t stay on head, even while on low dry setting.! Horrible product and not worth the $5 I paid for it</li>
            <li> I bought it to use for home hair conditioning treatments. It works wonderfully for what I use it for, a couple recommendations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Use only LOW HEAT, that provides more than enough heat for conditioning and styling.&lt;br /&gt;2. I sewed a button on the opposite side of the cinch to use the extra cord as a under-the-chin fastener - works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, it&#x27;s a worthy purchase for the price!</li>
            <li> Apparently she loved it.  The cats meow.</li>
            <li> Nice product to have when you are traveling and need to deep condition your hair. Love it and will recommend.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is my big head. the hood do not stay on my head. no matter hoe tight I make the draw string .. but its pretty cool. it gets REALLY hot under there so prepare to sweat. it is worth the money</li>
            <li> It is a little small for the rollers and the hose attachment that goes to the handheld hair dryer is very had to attach.</li>
            <li> It gets very hot but work good</li>
            <li> I have not gotten a chance to use this as of yet but I plan on using it for when I deep condition and wear sew-in weaves.The opening is a little small but I am sure I can work with it.</li>
            <li> Simple to install and works fine..</li>
            <li> Like it a lot.  Buying this bonnet saved me from purchasing a whole new hair dryer.  However, I wish the draw string would stay in place better.</li>
            <li> Did the job and it was cheap</li>
            <li> I am using my bonnet for the 2nd time and I love it. My hands are free and it really causes my hair to dry quickly.  I am able to tighten it and it doesn&#x27;t come off until I take it off. I recommend it and I want to order another one.</li>
            <li> The string will not get tight for it to stay on.</li>
            <li> Even though it has the draw string, it still slips off so the purpose is defeated.</li>
            <li> This is a very inexpensive for a reason because the quality is poor. The black gizmo that is suppose to tighten it broke off after the second use. Would not ever purchase again.</li>
            <li> it arrived sooner then estimated and that was wonderful! Other then that I would give no stars! It didn&#x27;t even fit my blowdryer and I have a Revlon dryer. It&#x27;s pretty standard. I really wanted this to be a good buy.</li>
            <li> The item is horrible when you cut on heat from blow dryer the bonnet  flys off. Poor ineffective product waste of money.</li>
