            <li> However, the lid was not tightly screwed on and some what dented and I only got a partial bottle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in stores as everyone seems to like perfumed, colored, anti-bacterial soap with dubious claims that its better (and may well be worse for you).</li>
            <li> In my family it is the one brand that has not caused dry, irritated skin.</li>
            <li> There was a problems with the shipment (it leaked), but otherwise, I still prefer Ivory liquid hand soap over any other brand on the market.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be the same soap I&#x27;ve ordered in the past.  </li>
            <li> Bought it because other liquid soaps are smelly; just don&#x27;t like a waft of syrupy stench when I&#x27;m washing my hands.  </li>
            <li> Ivory, Dove et al are letting us down.</li>
            <li> Some individuals develop allergic skin reactions which typically appear as eczema or contact dermatitis.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> tougher packing items-the balloons are not ok for a bottle this heavy.  </li>
            <li> It has very little, if any, scent.  </li>
            <li> Buyer beware ... read those labels before exposing yourself and young family to potentially dangerous soap and shampoo.</li>
            <li> Also dislike when soap is hard to rinse off.  </li>
            <li> I use it for my CPAP mask and it hos gotten impossible to find locally.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find a gental in sentenced hand soap.  </li>
            <li> It does the job well without exposing my family to any questionable ingredients.</li>
            <li> I wish that I could buy it in stores, because all I can find in stores these days has too much horrible, cloying fragrance which I find very offensive and sickening.  </li>

            <li> My favorite hand soap.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for years</li>

            <li> natural clean and simple Works in hard water</li>
            <li> Per WWW research on listed ingredients: &amp;#34;formaldehyde-releasing ingredients such as DMDM Hydantoin can cause various allergies, (skin, eyes, lungs) is a known human immune system toxicant and a possible skin toxicant. Some individuals develop allergic skin reactions which typically appear as eczema or contact dermatitis.&amp;#34;  An additional chemical, Tetrasodium EDTA which is a &amp;#34;preservative that’s made from the known carcinogen, formaldehyde and sodium cyanide. it breaks down the skin&#x27;s protective barrier, going right into your bloodstream.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to return this inexpensive product or will trash it. My health is worth more than a &amp;#34;bargain&amp;#34; on what was once 99.9 % Pure. Ivory, Dove et al are letting us down. Buyer beware ... read those labels before exposing yourself and young family to potentially dangerous soap and shampoo.</li>
            <li> If you use Ivory Liquid Hand Soap you will never find a deal this good. I got 98 oz. for the price of what others sell 32 oz. for.</li>
            <li> The bottles had leaked a bit but I washed them off and they were fine. I&#x27;m just so happy to find the soap I like to use. I&#x27;m allergic to so many things, but have had no problems with Ivory.</li>
            <li> I really like the size (amount) of the liquid soap container.  Ivory is the best hand soap around, it&#x27;s mild and safe.  It has very little, if any, scent.  It does the job it&#x27;s suppose to do.  There was a problems with the shipment (it leaked), but otherwise, I still prefer Ivory liquid hand soap over any other brand on the market.</li>
            <li> Great stuff...........still pure, simple, and with a pleasant scent!  I sound like a commercial... :)</li>
            <li> Much thinner and weaker soap ...for example it does not lather well.  I was expecting it to be the same soap I&#x27;ve ordered in the past.  Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> The ivory soap was great!  However, the lid was not tightly screwed on and some what dented and I only got a partial bottle</li>
            <li> Not slimy or smelly.  Washes hands and rinses off well...like it.  Bought it because other liquid soaps are smelly; just don&#x27;t like a waft of syrupy stench when I&#x27;m washing my hands.  Also dislike when soap is hard to rinse off.  This Ivory is much better than some others.</li>
            <li> Ivory liquid hand soap is getting more difficult to find in the stores. In my family it is the one brand that has not caused dry, irritated skin. It arrived on time, and did not leak. Glad to have it!</li>
            <li> Item arrived and performed as advertised.</li>
            <li> Excellent, just what I wanted</li>
            <li> one of those bifurcated reviews---product great !  does the job and gets us back to a proven product.  ok? now,the packaging was poor-box too big--plastic ballons were not tough for the heavy bottles-leaked,but most in bottle and usable.suggest they !) fit the product to the box @)use tougher packing items-the balloons are not ok for a bottle this heavy.  i will order again,but i will have fingers crossed!!!!</li>
            <li> just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and is as advertised.</li>
