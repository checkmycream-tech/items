            <li>Feels very light on skin.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Covers my skin imperfections and makes my completion look so much better.</li>
            <li>I really love this powder.  </li>
            <li>and my face stopped breaking out, like magic.</li>
            <li>I hope I&#x27;m always able to find this foundation</li>
            <li>I tried Mary Kay Liquid Foundation, and although it was better then Neutrogena, I didn&#x27;t love the way it feeled.</li>
            <li>It is ok</li>
            <li>i just purchaced the Translucent shade, hoping that works better.</li>
            <li>It is one of the top fifty chemicals produced worldwide.</li>
            <li>This mineral can be found in many products, ranging from paint to food to cosmetics.</li>
            <li>With the surge in cancer rates among all segments of the population, many people are attempting to reduce or eliminate their exposure to carcinogens.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Titanium dioxide is listed as a safe pigment, with no known adverse effects.</li>
            <li>Many cosmetic companies are capitalizing on metal oxide nanoparticles.</li>
            <li>Many cosmetic companies are capitalizing on metal oxide nanoparticles.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite powder foundations.  </li>
            <li>Would love a better color selection.  </li>
            <li>Great coverage, natural look, and does not break out my skin!</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin, and this color is just about light enough.</li>
            <li>Blends easily whether I am wearing foundation or not.</li>
            <li>feels really good on the skin and looks very natural!</li>
            <li>Luckily I don&#x27;t need a TON of coverage, most of my blemishes cover very easily with foundation first.</li>
            <li>This conclusion is relevant to the consumer because of the cosmetics industry&#x27;s increasing use of micronized pigments in sunscreens and colour cosmetics.</li>
            <li>Nanoparticles of titanium dioxide are used in sunscreens because they are colourless at that size and still absorb ultraviolet light.</li>
            <li>These particles were seen in the percutaneous layers of the skin under UV light.</li>
            <li>with any health issue, relevant studies must be examined closely to reach balanced conclusions about its impact on our health and well-being.</li>

            <li>I apply lightly, over moisturizer and primer, with a Ecotools retractable kabuki brush--</li>
            <li>&quot; look, that had good yet natural looking coverage, and wouldn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li>Despite repeated requests for micronized pigments in our colour cosmetics, we insist on using only coarse or fine particles of mineral pigments, balancing our need to look beautiful with our more pressing need to stay healthy.</li>

            <li>This does not end the debate, however, as controversy over the safety of one unique form of titanium dioxide still exists.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very smooth lovely natural color.</li>
            <li>I tried Matte &amp; Original in the BM line, and the matte was too orangey in every possible shade that would match my skin tone- and the original, which I ended up using for about 10 months in Fairly Medium-</li>
            <li>Coarse or fine particles of titanium dioxide are safe and effective at deflecting and absorbing UV light, protecting the skin, but consumers should avoid using products with micronized mineral pigments, either in sunscreens or colour</li>

            <li>Still good product overall.</li>
            <li>But are these claims true?</li>
            <li>It is reasonable to conclude then, that titanium dioxide is not a cancer-causing substance and is generally safe for use in foods, drugs, paints and cosmetics.</li>
            <li>Good texture, absorbs face oil well (important for me), but without making  skin looking dry, just  makes it look velvet and matte.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s only at first, once you stop breaking out, just continue to use it and your skin will look better than ever, healthy and glowing!</li>
            <li>With the multitude of cosmetics and chemicals available to us, it is in our best interest to become informed as consumers and make pure, natural and simple choices to protect our health and longevity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>While many are praising this new technology, others are warning of its inherent dangers to our bodies.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and many things</li>
            <li>I love this Mineral Wear it looks very natural.</li>
            <li>it does look a little powdery when used as a foundation, but after setting my face with a hydrating mist/makeup setting spray it looked great.</li>
            <li>my face doesn&#x27;t get slimy, it looks very natural and gives me a wonderful NATURAL glow (not a shiny, wet looking \\&quot;glow\\&quot; like BM Original did).</li>
            <li>I have tried several foundations for my oily but sensitive skin and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>This stuff is well worth it.</li>
            <li>Amazon was kind enough to refund it for me, as it was unusable.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t get the right color this time</li>
            <li>As technology has advanced, so has its ability to take normal sized particles of minerals and reduce them to sizes never before imagined.</li>
            <li>It feels good on the skin, and I like the little brush that comes with it.</li>
            <li>Here we have very humid summers and this stuff powers through!</li>
            <li>Even the higher priced brands don&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li>There are probably better mineral foundations, or even non-mineral foundations out there... but out of everything I have personally tried-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find a way to make the area under my eyes look brighter, I&#x27;ve tried many different things and NOTHING worked-</li>
            <li>I use the Physicians Formula Primer in Nude, put Mary Kay foundation in one of the Ivory tones around my eyes, put Physicians Formula Cream Concealer in Light over the Mary Kay, and then put on the Physician Formula Mineral Wear Foundation in Creamy Natural (all over, including eyes).</li>
            <li>The smaller the particle size, the more toxic it is (see Table 2).</li>
            <li>The smaller the particle size, the more toxic it is (see Table 2).</li>
            <li>VERY lightweight!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, Good for the price, the powder is not fine enough,</li>
            <li>The Organic Make-up Co. considers fine or coarse particle sized titanium dioxide and other mineral pigments to be safe according to the studies available and information discussed in this article.</li>

            <li>Both forms contain pure titanium dioxide that is bound to impurities.</li>
            <li>at the University of British Columbia in their paper \\&quot;Induction of Fibrogenic Mediators by Fine and Ultrafine Titanium Dioxide in Rat Tracheal</li>
            <li>at the University of British Columbia in their paper \\&quot;Induction of Fibrogenic Mediators by Fine and Ultrafine Titanium Dioxide in Rat Tracheal</li>
            <li>Titanium dioxide is chemically processed to remove these impurities, leaving the pure, white pigment available for use.</li>
            <li>I really dislike this brand of makeup.</li>
            <li>I do use it over a light application of liquid foundation- around eyes and occasional blemishes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very affordable for a mineral foundation.  </li>
            <li>I really like this powder.</li>
            <li>Then I went back to this, however, this time I used Bare Minerals brushes (which are definitely better than the brushes that come in the Physicians Formula containers).</li>
            <li>Great coverage (can be a little cakey if you have very dry skin</li>
            <li>Will continue to buy it as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>These studies were conducted in industrial settings where the increased exposure puts these individuals more at risk than the average person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this primarily in the summer because it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; off of my face in the dry summer heat of Colorado.  </li>
            <li>I particularly like the Mineral Wear Talc-free Mineral Face powder.  </li>
            <li>Titanium dioxide is regarded as an inert, non-toxic substance by many regulatory bodies such as the MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheets) and others charged with the responsibility of safeguarding the health of occupational workers and public health.</li>
            <li>The U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (2002) allows for its ingestion, external application including the eye area, and considers it a safe substance for public health.</li>
            <li>Good coverage especially for older skin with a few wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>This powder is very light and covers little flaws.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>It may look a little powdery for some, but I love it and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to be hypoallergenic and for sensitive skin but for me when I put it on it made it feel like my face was on fire and made me break out hard core which I rarely get more than two pimples at a time.</li>
            <li>Really pink areas like around my nose and chin, I go in with the concealer brush from my BareMinerals Kit and apply the PF Mineral Wear foundation with it, and it looks more natural throughout the day than the Bare Minerals did.</li>
            <li>if foundation on my 40 year old acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>mine arrived completely smashed.</li>
            <li>It is a white, opaque and naturally- occurring mineral found in two main forms: rutile and anatase.</li>
            <li>Other epidemiological studies showed that workers exposed to titanium dioxide exhibited no statistically significant relationship between such exposure with lung cancer and respiratory disease, although some cases of pulmonary fibrosis did occur.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact powder... theoretically:), but very fluffy.</li>
            <li>the brush is small, but I don&#x27;t know how they can fix that and fit it in the case.</li>
            <li>This stuff blows Bare Minerals out of the water.</li>
            <li>I used this stuff for a year, then got Bare Minerals thinking it&#x27;d be an upgrade.</li>
            <li>I wanted a natural \\&quot;second skin\\</li>
            <li>Oh and I also buff this foundation in to my skin like I learned to do with the Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>: pretty messy.</li>
            <li>It is important to note that rats are known to be an extremely sensitive species for developing tumours in the lungs when overloaded with poorly soluble, low toxicity dust particles.</li>
            <li>, B.Ed.&lt;br /&gt;Titanium dioxide is the subject of new controversy, yet it is a substance as old as the earth itself.</li>
            <li>I find the product to be slightly drying, but since I use moisturizer on the dry areas first, this is not a problem.  </li>

            <li> it does look a little powdery when used as a foundation, but after setting my face with a hydrating mist/makeup setting spray it looked great.</li>
            <li> my face doesn&#x27;t get slimy, it looks very natural and gives me a wonderful NATURAL glow (not a shiny, wet looking \\&quot;glow\\&quot; like BM Original did).</li>
            <li> I have tried several foundations for my oily but sensitive skin and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> This stuff is well worth it.</li>
            <li> Amazon was kind enough to refund it for me, as it was unusable.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t get the right color this time</li>
            <li> As technology has advanced, so has its ability to take normal sized particles of minerals and reduce them to sizes never before imagined.</li>
            <li> It feels good on the skin, and I like the little brush that comes with it.</li>
            <li> Here we have very humid summers and this stuff powers through!</li>
            <li> Even the higher priced brands don&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> There are probably better mineral foundations, or even non-mineral foundations out there... but out of everything I have personally tried-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a way to make the area under my eyes look brighter, I&#x27;ve tried many different things and NOTHING worked-</li>
            <li> I use the Physicians Formula Primer in Nude, put Mary Kay foundation in one of the Ivory tones around my eyes, put Physicians Formula Cream Concealer in Light over the Mary Kay, and then put on the Physician Formula Mineral Wear Foundation in Creamy Natural (all over, including eyes).</li>
            <li> The smaller the particle size, the more toxic it is (see Table 2).</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s very affordable for a mineral foundation.  </li>
            <li> I really like this powder.</li>
            <li> Then I went back to this, however, this time I used Bare Minerals brushes (which are definitely better than the brushes that come in the Physicians Formula containers).</li>

            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> It may look a little powdery for some, but I love it and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to be hypoallergenic and for sensitive skin but for me when I put it on it made it feel like my face was on fire and made me break out hard core which I rarely get more than two pimples at a time.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent product, does not cake or change colors.  Blends easily whether I am wearing foundation or not.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to be hypoallergenic and for sensitive skin but for me when I put it on it made it feel like my face was on fire and made me break out hard core which I rarely get more than two pimples at a time. I really dislike this brand of makeup.</li>
            <li> Best powder ever!  I use it instead if foundation on my 40 year old acne prone skin.  It&#x27;s wonderful.  Covers my skin imperfections and makes my completion look so much better.</li>
            <li> I really love this powder.  I have very sensitive skin and many things give me a rash.  Physicians Formula products work great for me.  I particularly like the Mineral Wear Talc-free Mineral Face powder.  I use it instead of foundation and it works great.  It&#x27;s sometimes hard to find the Creamy Natural shade, so I&#x27;ve started buying 2 or 3 at a time so I never run out.  One compact lasts me about 3 months.</li>
            <li> Product broken down to powder during shipment from POOR packaging.  Compact popped open and spilled powder throughout box. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have tried several foundations for my oily but sensitive skin and this is by far the best. I do use it over a light application of liquid foundation- around eyes and occasional blemishes. I always get compliments on the staying power of this foundation. Here we have very humid summers and this stuff powers through! I highly recommend it! I have been using it for about 3 years now and can&#x27;t imagine using anything else. I have tried others just to see if there is an upgrade but trust me-there is not. Even the higher priced brands don&#x27;t compare. This gives me a beautiful non cakey finish that lasts and blends wonderfully with my skin tone.  I love PF products, I use their liquid liners, blush and bronzers as well and have yet to be disappointed with anything I try. I do not use the brush that comes with this though, just a regular blush brush works great- I found the kabuki (or whatever) brush to be odd.</li>
            <li> Love it the best face powder in drug store</li>
            <li> Years of acne prone skin, tried every cream out there, with not so pleasant side effects! Started using this and my face stopped breaking out, like magic. It&#x27;s incredible. Great coverage (can be a little cakey if you have very dry skin so use a brush to brush off excess after application). Very smooth lovely natural color. I highly recommend this. If you are REALLY broken out it could be too cakey at first since its not liquid. But that&#x27;s only at first, once you stop breaking out, just continue to use it and your skin will look better than ever, healthy and glowing! I love this! Also- I buy separate powder puff applicators because the brush is terrible. This stuff is well worth it.</li>
            <li> good coverage for under a bronzer</li>
            <li> I hope I&#x27;m always able to find this foundation but I suppose someday it will be impossible to find since it&#x27;s not sold in stores. Physicians Formula has a different version of this product...looks like a bunch of pastel spots....and it is NOT the same. This makeup covers so well. It may look a little powdery for some, but I love it and have been using it for years. Please continue to carry this brand!</li>
            <li> There are probably better mineral foundations, or even non-mineral foundations out there... but out of everything I have personally tried- this was the best!! This stuff blows Bare Minerals out of the water. At least, that&#x27;s my take on it anyways. I used this stuff for a year, then got Bare Minerals thinking it&#x27;d be an upgrade. Well it wasn&#x27;t. I tried Matte &amp; Original in the BM line, and the matte was too orangey in every possible shade that would match my skin tone- and the original, which I ended up using for about 10 months in Fairly Medium- broke me out, causing a tiny bit of cystic acne and scarring from the blemishes it caused. After I gave up on BM, I tried going back to the foundation I used in highschool and middle school- Neutrogena Skin Clearing Liquid Foundation. I didn&#x27;t like it this go around. I wanted a natural \\&quot;second skin\\&quot; look, that had good yet natural looking coverage, and wouldn&#x27;t break me out. I tried Mary Kay Liquid Foundation, and although it was better then Neutrogena, I didn&#x27;t love the way it feeled. Then I went back to this, however, this time I used Bare Minerals brushes (which are definitely better than the brushes that come in the Physicians Formula containers). This is PERFECT- my face doesn&#x27;t get slimy, it looks very natural and gives me a wonderful NATURAL glow (not a shiny, wet looking \\&quot;glow\\&quot; like BM Original did). I also like that it has silica, because I can use it to set my concealer. I&#x27;ve been trying to find a way to make the area under my eyes look brighter, I&#x27;ve tried many different things and NOTHING worked- until now! I use the Physicians Formula Primer in Nude, put Mary Kay foundation in one of the Ivory tones around my eyes, put Physicians Formula Cream Concealer in Light over the Mary Kay, and then put on the Physician Formula Mineral Wear Foundation in Creamy Natural (all over, including eyes). I&#x27;m really, really happy with it. Really pink areas like around my nose and chin, I go in with the concealer brush from my BareMinerals Kit and apply the PF Mineral Wear foundation with it, and it looks more natural throughout the day than the Bare Minerals did. I also do this for blemishes and scars to cover them up. Oh and I also buff this foundation in to my skin like I learned to do with the Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li> Not Physicians Formula&#x27;s fault, but mine arrived completely smashed. Amazon was kind enough to refund it for me, as it was unusable. However, I bought another one in a store, and it&#x27;s a great powder! I have very fair skin, and this color is just about light enough. And the best part is it doesn&#x27;t clog pores!</li>
            <li> Good texture, absorbs face oil well (important for me), but without making  skin looking dry, just  makes it look velvet and matte. Feels very light on skin.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: pretty messy. It&#x27;s compact powder... theoretically:), but very fluffy.Still good product overall. Just don&#x27;t forget to dust down after using it. (or may be it&#x27;s just me).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, Good for the price, the powder is not fine enough,</li>
            <li> Great coverage, natural look, and does not break out my skin!</li>
            <li> It is ok but I would not repurchase.</li>
            <li> Great face powder! Doesn&#x27;t break my face out and good coverage too.</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past and really like it but I didn&#x27;t get the right color this time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it about a month and its crackling and crumbly. However it does do its job and covers well.</li>
            <li> my wife like this makeup.</li>
            <li> i replace the brush it comes with with a make up applicator. works great.</li>
            <li> I love this Mineral Wear it looks very natural. I do not like to look to made up. Thank You</li>
            <li> Good coverage especially for older skin with a few wrinkles.  I use a good moisturizer and then apply with a kabuki brush.  It never feels dry or fills in wrinkle lines and lasting coverage all day.  When going out at night I will reapply and it doesn&#x27;t feel caked on.</li>
            <li> This powder is very light and covers little flaws.  If you have dark circles, use it over your foundation to help hide them.  It stays on all day for me, and doesn&#x27;t turn color.  It feels good on the skin, and I like the little brush that comes with it. (It is under the powder)</li>
            <li> creamy, blendable, buildable coverage. sets makeup beautifully, and on it&#x27;s own as foundation gives great coverage. just looking at the swatches online i thought this color would be a good match, it was too dark for me. i&#x27;m usually 2-3 colors from the lightest in foundation. i just purchaced the Translucent shade, hoping that works better. it does look a little powdery when used as a foundation, but after setting my face with a hydrating mist/makeup setting spray it looked great. lasts a really long time too. feels really good on the skin and looks very natural!</li>
            <li> This is the third time I have purchased this face powder.  I love it!  The texture is great and it covers skin imperfection beautifully.  Will continue to buy it as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> WHAT? Check out the ingredient - TITANIUM DIOXIDE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Titanium Dioxide: Toxic or Safe?&lt;br /&gt;By Lori Stryker, B.Sc., B.H.Ec., B.Ed.&lt;br /&gt;Titanium dioxide is the subject of new controversy, yet it is a substance as old as the earth itself. It is one of the top fifty chemicals produced worldwide. It is a white, opaque and naturally- occurring mineral found in two main forms: rutile and anatase. Both forms contain pure titanium dioxide that is bound to impurities. Titanium dioxide is chemically processed to remove these impurities, leaving the pure, white pigment available for use. Titanium dioxide has a variety of uses, as it is odorless and absorbent. This mineral can be found in many products, ranging from paint to food to cosmetics. In cosmetics, it serves several purposes. It is a white pigment, an opacifier and a sunscreen. Concern has arisen from studies that have pointed to titanium dioxide as a carcinogen and photocatalyst, thus creating fear in consumers. But are these claims true? What does the research on these allegations bear out? Would we as consumers benefit from avoiding this mineral to preserve our long-term health?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A carcinogen is a substance that causes a cellular malfunction, causing the cell to become cancerous and thus potentially lethal to the surrounding tissue and ultimately the body as these rapidly growing mutated cells take over. With the surge in cancer rates among all segments of the population, many people are attempting to reduce or eliminate their exposure to carcinogens. Titanium dioxide is regarded as an inert, non-toxic substance by many regulatory bodies such as the MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheets) and others charged with the responsibility of safeguarding the health of occupational workers and public health. The MSDS states that titanium dioxide can cause some lung fibrosis at fifty times the nuisance dust, defined by the US Department of Labor as 15 mg/m cubed (OSHA) or 10 mg/m cubed (ACGIH Threshold Limit Value). The ACGIH states that titanium dioxide is \\&quot;not classifiable as a human carcinogen\\&quot;. Symptoms of chronic overexposure to titanium dioxide in an industrial setting, according to the MSDS, include a \\&quot;slight increase in lung tumour incidence in lab rats\\&quot;. It also states \\&quot;when titanium dioxide was fed to rats/mice in a carcinogen bioassay, it was not carcinogenic\\&quot;. The NIOSH declares that at 5000 mg/m cubed there was slight lung fibrosis, concluding that this substance was carcinogenic in rats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The NIOSH declaration of carcinogenicity in rats is based on a study by Lee, Trochimowicz &amp; Reinhardt, \\&quot;Pulmonary Response of Rats Exposed to Titanium Dioxide by Inhalation for Two Years\\&quot; (1985). The authors of this study found that rats chronically exposed to excessive dust loading of 250 mg/m cubed and impaired clearance mechanisms within the rat, for six hours per day, five days per week for two years, developed slight lung tumours. They also noted that the biological relevance of this data to lung tumours in humans is negligible. It is important to note that rats are known to be an extremely sensitive species for developing tumours in the lungs when overloaded with poorly soluble, low toxicity dust particles. Rat lungs process particles very differently compared to larger mammals such as dogs, primates or humans (Warheit, 2004). This sensitivity in the lungs has not been observed in other rodent species such as mice or hamsters (Warheit, 2004), therefore using the rat model to determine carcinogenicity of titanium dioxide in humans can be misleading, as extrapolation of species-specific data to humans is erroneous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many organizations and businesses have perpetuated this assessment of the carcinogenicity of titanium dioxide (ewg.org). However, several studies and study reviews have been used to compile the safety disclaimers for the regulations on the permitted use of titanium dioxide. One such study review took place in Rome, 1969 between the World Health Organization and the Food &amp; Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Cross species analyses were performed and reviewed for possible toxicity of titanium dioxide. The conference concluded that among the following species: rats, dogs, guinea pigs, rabbits, cats and human males, ingestion of titanium dioxide at varying diet percentages and over long periods of time did not cause absorption of this mineral. Titanium dioxide particulates were not detected in the blood, liver, kidney or urine and no adverse effects were noted from its ingestion. The U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (2002) allows for its ingestion, external application including the eye area, and considers it a safe substance for public health. Other epidemiological studies showed that workers exposed to titanium dioxide exhibited no statistically significant relationship between such exposure with lung cancer and respiratory disease, although some cases of pulmonary fibrosis did occur. These studies were conducted in industrial settings where the increased exposure puts these individuals more at risk than the average person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Titanium dioxide is listed as a safe pigment, with no known adverse effects. It is not listed as a carcinogen, mutagen, teratogen, comedogen, toxin or as a trigger for contact dermatitis in any other safety regulatory publications beside the NIOSH (Antczak, 2001; Physical &amp; Theoretical Chemical Laboratory, Oxford University respectively). It is reasonable to conclude then, that titanium dioxide is not a cancer-causing substance and is generally safe for use in foods, drugs, paints and cosmetics. This does not end the debate, however, as controversy over the safety of one unique form of titanium dioxide still exists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One form of mineral or mineral extract, including titanium dioxide, that we should be concerned about is ultrafine or nano particles. As technology has advanced, so has its ability to take normal sized particles of minerals and reduce them to sizes never before imagined. While many are praising this new technology, others are warning of its inherent dangers to our bodies. A study by Churg et. al. at the University of British Columbia in their paper \\&quot;Induction of Fibrogenic Mediators by Fine and Ultrafine Titanium Dioxide in Rat Tracheal Explants\\&quot; (1999) found that ultrafine particles of the anatase form of titanium dioxide, which are less than 0.1 microns, are pathogenic or disease causing (see Table 1).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Table 1: Measurements of Mineral Pigment Particles&lt;br /&gt;Particle Size Measurement&lt;br /&gt;Coarse Less than 10 microns&lt;br /&gt;Fine Less than 2.5 microns&lt;br /&gt;Ultrafine (nanoparticles) Less than 0.1 microns or 100 nanometres&lt;br /&gt;etcgroup.org&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Table 2: Particle Size and Entry into the Human Body&lt;br /&gt;Nanoparticle Size Entry Point&lt;br /&gt;70 nanometres Alveolar surface of lung&lt;br /&gt;50 nanometres Cells&lt;br /&gt;30 nanometres Central Nervous System&lt;br /&gt;Less than 20 nanometres No data yet&lt;br /&gt;etcgroup.org&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kumazawa, et. al. in their study, \\&quot;Effects of Titanium Ions and Particles on Neutrophil Function and Morphology\\&quot; concluded that cytotoxicity (danger to the cell) was dependent on the particle size of titanium dioxide. The smaller the particle size, the more toxic it is (see Table 2). This conclusion is relevant to the consumer because of the cosmetics industry&#x27;s increasing use of micronized pigments in sunscreens and colour cosmetics. Nanoparticles of titanium dioxide are used in sunscreens because they are colourless at that size and still absorb ultraviolet light. Many cosmetic companies are capitalizing on metal oxide nanoparticles. We have seen, however, that if titanium dioxide particles used to act as a sunscreen are small enough, they can penetrate the cells, leading to photocatalysis within the cell, causing DNA damage after exposure to sunlight (Powell, et. al. 1996) The fear is that this could lead to cancer in the skin. Studies with subjects who applied sunscreens with micronized titanium dioxide daily for 2-4 weeks showed that the skin can absorb microfine particles. These particles were seen in the percutaneous layers of the skin under UV light. Coarse or fine particles of titanium dioxide are safe and effective at deflecting and absorbing UV light, protecting the skin, but consumers should avoid using products with micronized mineral pigments, either in sunscreens or colour cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any health issue, relevant studies must be examined closely to reach balanced conclusions about its impact on our health and well-being. Often, risk determinations are made without considering actual hazards and real-life exposures (Warheit, 2004). The Organic Make-up Co. considers fine or coarse particle sized titanium dioxide and other mineral pigments to be safe according to the studies available and information discussed in this article. Despite repeated requests for micronized pigments in our colour cosmetics, we insist on using only coarse or fine particles of mineral pigments, balancing our need to look beautiful with our more pressing need to stay healthy. With the multitude of cosmetics and chemicals available to us, it is in our best interest to become informed as consumers and make pure, natural and simple choices to protect our health and longevity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;References:&lt;br /&gt;Antczak, Cosmetics Unmasked.

            <li> The Physicians Formula products are perfect for my skin and this powder is my favorite.  I use it alone and it fills and covers just as a liquid makeup would, but without all that to clog the pores.  The tint of the Creamy Natural powder is also perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have Talc which is a carcinogen but has two Parabens in it, which are also carcinogens....doesn&#x27;t make sense to me.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite powder foundations.  I use this primarily in the summer because it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; off of my face in the dry summer heat of Colorado.  It is a little messier than a talc-based powder (which I actually have nothing against), but MUCH less messy than a loose mineral powder.  I apply lightly, over moisturizer and primer, with a Ecotools retractable kabuki brush--works great!  I set it with ELF setting spray, and it does not budge, or change color, all day.  I like the SPF, too.  It&#x27;s very affordable for a mineral foundation.  I also like that it is one of the few mineral powders that does NOT contain bismuth oxychloride, which I have a terrible reaction to.  I find the product to be slightly drying, but since I use moisturizer on the dry areas first, this is not a problem.  Would love a better color selection.  TIP:  the brush is the best computer keyboard cleaner EVER!</li>
            <li> I really like this powder. the brush is small, but I don&#x27;t know how they can fix that and fit it in the case.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful. Luckily I don&#x27;t need a TON of coverage, most of my blemishes cover very easily with foundation first. But this is a great finish to set my foundation and soften up my tone. VERY lightweight!</li>
