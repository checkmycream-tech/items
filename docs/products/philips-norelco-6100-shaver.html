            <li>This shaver is  beautiful ,but the shaver can&#x27;t stand up with its fixture because the fixture is too lightness.</li>

            <li>This is an excellent shaver for this price level, it is rechargeable, comes with battery power display and can be used with/without shaving cream, but I would recommend using some kind of a moisturizer to stop getting razor burns.    </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m considering writing the company to tell them what a great job they did with this one!\\</li>
            <li>I decide to get this from amzon with a great deal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;My fianc&amp;eacute; is extremely happy with his.</li>
            <li>This is has given his a great shave and no razor burn.</li>
            <li>Great design.</li>
            <li>not all that  great.</li>
            <li>I am not so happy with the design of the charger.</li>
            <li>The razor is great.</li>

            <li>I got a great price</li>
            <li>This great price also means that when it comes time to replace the blades the cost of the replacement blades will be  substantial compared to the purchase</li>
            <li>It looks great, is ergonomically designed, and gets alot of shaves on a charge.</li>
            <li>For the price ($86 I think), I am happy.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This is great because I don&#x27;t need to carry the charging stand etc.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall a great purchase.</li>
            <li>It does not get as close as a razor but is great for use in between.</li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job.</li>
            <li>IT WORKS GREAT,</li>

            <li>I have to say i was really happy with Amazon&#x27;s shopping experience.</li>
            <li>It is great.  </li>
            <li>It is working great.</li>

            <li>A great shave too.</li>
            <li>Great shave when you can keep the shaving head from falling off.</li>
            <li>Been happy with the results.</li>
            <li>The battery holds a GREAT charge.</li>
            <li>but I splurged on this thinking that this would work great, but it does not.  </li>
            <li>It has a great value/price ratio.</li>
            <li>While I haven&#x27;t got the rebate yet, shaver itself is working great beyond the look.</li>

            <li>if there is more spare head , it will be perfect.</li>
            <li>happened to own it!</li>
            <li>The price of this product in China is the equivalent of $353, and here, I am bought with $60, the price is very good, and the most important is that the razor is very good, my husband told me, this is I bought the best razor!</li>
            <li>My husband liked it, and especially easy to use.</li>
            <li>and it was an absolutely pleasant shaving experience.  </li>

            <li>1150 is a good razor, I like it very much, the Amazon price is very good, quality is very good!</li>
            <li>Very loving, very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Price is also very suitable</li>
            <li>I still give it a star though cuz it is all bright and whiney.</li>
            <li>but if you think about 3 times the cost of 3D .. this 2D must be better for 90% of the user and the performance is amazing and the battery life is also excellent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been a huge fan of &#x27;flexible&#x27; shavers, and it took some getting used to, to achieve the best results.    </li>
            <li>Good product,</li>
            <li>Thought it would be good for shaving my head, no so.  </li>
            <li>The quality of the shave seems just as good as the 8240, although the 8240 was the \\&quot;Speed\\&quot; model</li>
            <li>I will not be returning the shaver as it is that good.  </li>
            <li>The shaver I received is good, but cannot be charged.</li>
            <li>I will buy another one for my father if the price is as good as 55 USD.</li>
            <li>The device has a good grip on it as well, which is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and its appearance looks good  </li>
            <li>I purchased this because there is a discount showing on Amazon, plus a manufacture&#x27;s rebate, which makes it a good deal.</li>
            <li>Do not have to rake it over my face for 15 to 20 minutes to get a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>That gave me a smooth shave and was very happy with it.</li>
            <li>really good.</li>
            <li>So after years of this I decided to find myself a good rotary shaver.     </li>
            <li>Good performance for an electric shaver</li>
            <li>all in all a good shaver and a good value.</li>
            <li>However, this shaver is so good that I felt compelled to write this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li>My husband said the electric razor does a good job.  </li>
            <li>Good purchase for the money.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m fairly butter-fingered.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought on Nov, it is good and convinent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a good deal</li>
            <li>that is the good thing I have get it...  </li>

            <li>This is really a good stuff what I want.</li>
            <li>, looks good on the counter.</li>

            <li>The wireless feature will be good for travel.  </li>
            <li>Good deal</li>

            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s as fair</li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s as fair as I can get.</li>

            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d think that it would be nice for Amazon to take some actions to protect its own image as those products were sold on your site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It would have been nice to have a place to store it on the charging stand.  </li>

            <li>They really liked it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s job effectively like a razor would do.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if there was a charging port on the shaver itself to use it corded as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I liked it,</li>
            <li>One of the nice features, which I never used and now never will, is that the shaver is waterproof.  </li>
            <li>These really are the best shaving results that I&#x27;ve ever encountered with an electric shaver.    </li>
            <li>However it looks nice</li>
            <li>It took me around a week to get a good shave and a couple of weeks before I was totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>nice shaver.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it may to some time to shave tidily.</li>
            <li>Well, good price, is the most cost-effective to buy commodities.</li>
            <li>well under the neck, avoiding razor burn  -Does a nice job around the lips and mouth   -So</li>
            <li>It does a good job picking up most of the hair, even  under the chin.</li>
            <li>Nice touch and feelings.   </li>
            <li>There are many good reviews for this shaver.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be honest...</li>
            <li>&quot; kind of shaver</li>
            <li>Every morning I used to cut my face by handy shaver blide.  </li>
            <li>Nice Look.</li>
            <li>nice would recommend for everyone who has to shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>its own official rebate saying Amazon has this product on sale</li>
            <li>He wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the product but kept it anyway.</li>
            <li>nice shaver.  </li>
            <li>shaving attachments sometimes fall off when shaving (the happens quite seldom and the chance of it can be minimized by making sure that you apply a good amount of pressure when inserting the shaving</li>
            <li>I guess nothing will ever match some nice shave gel and a razor in the shower.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not sure if it can stay with a good performance.</li>
            <li>has a nice stand that suits the item nicely in it.</li>
            <li>Really nice razor.  </li>

            <li>Handy</li>
            <li>I liked the look and feel of the shaver.</li>
            <li>not as good as 3d razor should have bought the 3d version it gives a better shave than 2d shaver</li>
            <li>My husband really liked it.  </li>
            <li>nice charging stand...</li>
            <li>(button release would be nice vs just pulling on it until it</li>
            <li>I liked the Remington a lot</li>
            <li>One piece change of razor head is nice.</li>
            <li>but I really liked the look of this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for only 54 years (true, since 1960) and always found them excellent, but this one is the best.</li>
            <li>For sure, I prefer the product came perfectly the first place.</li>

            <li>and it&#x27;s doing a better job of catching longer whiskers (Idon&#x27;t always shave every day - one of the prerogatives of retirement).    </li>
            <li>So glad I own this</li>
            <li>oh wow it looks amazing!!!!!</li>
            <li>I found that on my face, using Afta preshave makes a nice shave even better.  </li>
            <li>I found that on my face, using Afta preshave makes a nice shave even better.  </li>

            <li>It is by far the best razor I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>Honestly this electric razor does OK on the face.</li>
            <li>Ive always had norelco shavers and this ones the best ive had so far.</li>
            <li>It has great battery life, and the recharge/recharging indicators are useful and not garish.  </li>
            <li>and so far I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>

            <li>This one is the best so far.</li>
            <li>I liked the pop-up trimmer better.</li>
            <li>For me the lower cost and the more effective shaving experience outweighs the bells and whistles found on the 1090.  </li>
            <li>Been using it for a week and very impressed so far with no negatives.</li>
            <li>and my hubby said it&#x27;s handy and smoothy when shaving although i will never have a chance to try:).</li>
            <li>After the shaver&#x27;s in, it&#x27;s own weight makes things much more stable, though.</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon, was a good price with free s/h.</li>
            <li>There are better choices for a nice electric shave.</li>

            <li>Very happy so far with the battery performance even after 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice shaver, but the trimmer needs to be better.</li>
            <li>I used this for more than 1 year, it&#x27;s with good quality and easy to use.</li>

            <li>All in all though this shaver is very nice and does a great job, especially since it is the bottom of the line model!</li>

            <li>however its been 20-25 days since i started using it and already see that its not doing as great a job when i first bought it.</li>
            <li>The sensotouch worked great the first time i used it, and every time since.</li>
            <li>My face was already conditioned to the Norelco rotary blades so it was great from the first day.</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s so good, so cool</li>
            <li>It works great, smooth and clean.</li>

            <li>Very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>price is very cheap..</li>
            <li>Keep the pressure very light.</li>

            <li>Very smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>It is very comfortable to use.</li>

            <li>took a great deal of time searching for a suitable replacement, but really had a price point of being practical.  </li>
            <li>use philips first time,it&#x27;s seem very nice</li>
            <li>This is a great product, than my original HQ560 shave clean  </li>

            <li>Its shape is very smooth and magic.</li>
            <li>Philips Norelco 1150x/40 and absolutely love it,very very smooth shaving  </li>
            <li>It is a friend who was too beautiful to organize a realistic price and your beard.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!!!  </li>
            <li>It certainly is egonomically designed and looks great.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very nice,my daddy is very love it!</li>
            <li>but everything still look new and good quality !</li>
            <li>I was very impressed from first cut until now with how smooth and effortlessly this keeps my face clean.</li>
            <li>if your looking for a new razor and one that&#x27;s fairly priced with a great shave and clean up</li>
            <li>Interestingly, the razor must be in the holder to recharge.</li>
            <li>Not that the look is THAT important, but it kind of is in marketing the product.  </li>
            <li>This is an awesome product that men definitely need in their bathrooms to use with grooming.    </li>
            <li>Maybe go with one of the 3D models that might change their angle to get that area better, a foil shaver, or the trusty blade.</li>
            <li>I even tried a foil shaver from a competetor but this Norelco is way better.</li>
            <li>My husband is satisfied with the effort of the product.</li>
            <li>Makes it more versatile.</li>
            <li>I have been using electric shavers for many years.</li>
            <li>It is okay on the neck</li>
            <li>There is nothing to say any more.</li>
            <li>I will not buy Philips product any more.</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon was better than I could find it anywhere else.</li>
            <li>Ok so, i was an owner of Philips norelco 8000 series with the triple track system and a cleaning station and everything.</li>
            <li>My partner was in need of one and according to him it works better than what he was expecting.  </li>
            <li>Either was a no go, so I decided to bite the bullet and return the 7340XL and find a much better shaver.    </li>
            <li>I love the look, and the design.  </li>
            <li>Then, the convenience of the design: top notch.</li>
            <li>Philips/Norelco used to bundle, which is an excellent improvement especially for travelers.    </li>
            <li>but now it&#x27;s much better.     </li>
            <li>For those who don&#x27;t need the better detail trimmer, the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The trade-offs are the better features and longer battery life.  </li>
            <li>The 1150 operates faster and quieter than the 7310, and it has a better trimmer than either the 7310 or the 1250.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it requires too many passes to get them all.  </li>
            <li>The attachment trimmer works better than the 1250&#x27;s pop-up trimmer</li>
            <li>most users, lower end models like the 7310 will work sufficiently well.  </li>
            <li>For most users, lower end models like the 7310 will work sufficiently well.  </li>
            <li>give you more burn compared to rotary blades.     </li>
            <li>/&gt;The battery of the 8251XL proved to be okay.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I continued to be pleased with the shaver&#x27;s performance, the battery died after just three months.</li>
            <li>This seems to be more robust, gives an even better shave and is even quieter, but I&#x27;ll have to see if the battery holds up</li>
            <li>Sure, that&#x27;s one more thing to pack when traveling.</li>
            <li>I had a Braun 5 series before this which worked much better.   </li>
            <li>Well this shaver won&#x27;t conduct a cookout or wash your back in the shower, but it still does a real good job at shaving!  </li>
            <li>I had a beard for many years but took a position in sales that required a clean-cut look.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quieter, more comfortable, smooth on the face and does a good job on neck hair.  </li>
            <li>Love it.&lt;br /&gt;July</li>
            <li>I purchased this after watched a famous website&#x27;s suggestion.</li>
            <li>This thing is absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li>More cuts; more discomfort.  </li>
            <li>Nice and smooth too.  </li>
            <li>My shaves did get better the more</li>
            <li>but I attribute that to me learning how to use it more than my face getting used to it.</li>
            <li>I assume that the 3D will shave quicker because it has more blades</li>
            <li>I was ALSO able to apply for a $30 SensoTouch rebate, still waiting for the rebate check from Norelco, hope they make goon on that offer.    </li>
            <li>if the $30 rebate comes, that makes it an even better bargain.</li>
            <li>So I wonder how guys whose hair grows out faster are satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE that the unit can be cleaned under running water.  </li>
            <li>Battery life is good and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>but it took more than 15 days to ship it.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It would be better if it had another option for charging (i.e. a side plug in)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>I have done this for MANY years.</li>
            <li>Just off the top of my head I have used Atra, Sensor, Tracer, Headblade, Mach 3 , Proglide, Hydro5</li>
            <li>We can make electricty, but we can&#x27;t make more water. :-).</li>
            <li>, okay....</li>
            <li>Afta Pre-Electric (better than Lectric Shave or Face-Saver for me),</li>
            <li>SO CLOSE and SO COMFORTABLE!</li>
            <li>It just doesnt do its job,,,need to use razor on top of it for a uniform shave.</li>
            <li>They choose not inform the customer of rebate disqualification - counting on customer forgetfulness and expiration of merchandise return period;  (iii) It is at best an attempt to control customer&#x27;s end purchase price with a third party vendor.  </li>
            <li>OK.  </li>
            <li>Still satisfied with Norelco electric razors.</li>
            <li>It shaves closely even when I have two days&#x27; growth, which is much more than I could say for the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>U r not repent of this purchasing. :)</li>
            <li>if i got chance ,i will buy more.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, he sent this type shaver to his friends as gifts and share this convenience.</li>
            <li>I had assumed Phillips is a reputable company.</li>
            <li>The battery life alone is why I love it.</li>
            <li>When I bought it, I was told that I would receive a rebate, however, I receive nothing after more than three months.</li>
            <li>Norelco usually is better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I DOUBT IT TAKES ME MORE THAN 20-30 SECONDS.</li>
            <li>/&gt;THE REMOVAL PROCESS OF THE HEADS REQUIRES MORE EFFORT THAN NOT.</li>
            <li>I tried it on my legs, most men&#x27;s shavers don&#x27;t do well on legs</li>
            <li>I had many trimmers  </li>
            <li>Most of the time I replace just to replace.  </li>
            <li>Tried this one and assumed newer design meant better shave...</li>
            <li>I like and satisfied.</li>
            <li>Glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Made my gift shopping much easier and he is happy, too.  </li>
            <li>although 7310 is cheaper, it is better, more convenient, shaves better, much much better.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more.</li>
            <li>It does the job, but just costs a bit more than it</li>
            <li>Also it nicks me more than an electric shaver should.</li>
            <li>This item is absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li>It gives a much closer shave and looks great on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>i will give more information .</li>
            <li>It gets the job done better than the lower-end models and won&#x27;t blow a hole in your wallet.</li>
            <li>I have used this shaver for two day,and  I love it.</li>
            <li>But simple is the best I believe so.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>and now I&#x27;m glad I tried it again.</li>
            <li>Like so many others; I never received the $30 rebate.</li>
            <li>OK,i will shop in amazon more times...</li>
            <li>One more bulky thing to pack if you travel with it.</li>
            <li>I have shaved with Norelco shavers for 40 years and love them.</li>
            <li>It was and has been my all time favorite.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that you can just wash it out after each use.</li>
            <li>But with promotion, I think it is ok to have it.</li>
            <li>Most of all, I like the feature that it can be water cleaned.</li>
            <li>Will order another though, so as not to have to share with beard, mustache hairs, etc.......:)</li>
            <li>Effective and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I hope I can buy more as gifts.</li>
            <li>For the price after rebate, I would have given it more stars.</li>
            <li>Overall it was excellent!</li>
            <li>well designed and a pleasure to use it has redefined my morning shave for the better.</li>
            <li>Philips have proven that they are one of the best brands in the area of electric personal grooming devices.</li>
            <li>Norelco electric shavers have been my shaver of choice for more years than I can remember.</li>
            <li>Overall, very impressed.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>My skin looks so much better.</li>
            <li>I did not see a need to spend more for the bells and whistles, and I was relieved that my thoughts were correct.</li>
            <li>The shaver is OK.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy one more for my dad.  </li>
            <li>It had served me well for many years but was beyond repair.</li>
            <li>If you buy this, you will be pleased with what you get.</li>
            <li>I guess Philips didn&#x27;t expect so many people bought it</li>
            <li>He has never found an electric he could use, and since using this has been pleased.</li>
            <li>He enjoys the fact that if water gets on this razor it is ok.</li>
            <li>You can shave many times before the battery needs to be recharged again.  </li>
            <li>changed to cheaper model from Braun, and it works so much better for me</li>
            <li>and price is great,besides i got coupon from AMAZON and save even more money  </li>
            <li>comfortable to use in terms of swiveling and moving around, no snagging hairs&lt;br /&gt;--Cradle for charging is a really nice touch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>may have had better luck with the 3d</li>
            <li>Quiet and the battery life is awesome.</li>
            <li>I purchased this razor 90 days ago, and have been nothing but pleased with its sleek design, and elegant battery and charging lights.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>You would do better finding a $19 unit as it will work just as well.</li>
            <li>The closeness of the shave is so much better that this is all I use now.  </li>
            <li>I haven’t been able to get more than 2 years on these Phillips / Norelco</li>
            <li>It has been more than 3 months since I submitted it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving with electric shavers for more years than I care to mention.</li>
            <li>That was my favorite shaver.</li>
            <li>-Battery&#x27;s life of my Smarttouch is way better than 1150x.</li>
            <li>saw to many T.V. ads</li>
            <li>I may find more uses for it&#x27;s expanded capabilities over time.</li>
            <li>he will be satisfied with it!&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>THIS RAZOR IS BETTER THAN I EZPECTED.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best for its price~~~~~~good present for me.so</li>
            <li>I was pleased by the reviews and therefore decided to purchase it.  </li>
            <li>3D&#x27;s are out; costing more, and Norelco will probably be phasing the 2D&#x27;s out in favor of the 3D version eventually.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used a better electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Outstanding results.</li>
            <li>this found much better price.  </li>
            <li>think this is more for people with thinner hairs, thinner beards, and who shave everyday.&lt;br /&gt;Kudos.</li>
            <li>a try you will be satisfied with results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>think most man like it.</li>
            <li>The shaving system is ok but never received my $30 rebate.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;No more than 15</li>
            <li>so I do not have much to add, but it works great for me.</li>
            <li>This have and ergonomic shape and metal sheets that endures many many many uses.</li>
            <li>It has so many quirks, and the &amp;#34;ergonomic&amp;#34; design does not contour as it should.</li>
            <li>and Whistles: The 1090 has more bells and whistles.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with its performance</li>
            <li>My father-in-law is satisfied with this electric razor.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Buy a gift to my friends, my friends love it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Have not bought this product, but unless you are 100% sure you will like it</li>
            <li>This razor more tha met my expectations.</li>
            <li>I think, it is OK.</li>
            <li>This was one of the presents I got my husband for Christmas, he has been wanting one for years, but I wanted to be sure to get one that did the job, no complaints.  </li>
            <li>you will find the 3D may be even better</li>
            <li>Holding up well, been using it for over 6 months, glad I got it.</li>
            <li>Outstanding.)</li>
            <li>so I am not 100% satisfied with the shave.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with it</li>
            <li>The downside to this setup is that the trimmer is a separate piece, whereas most shavers have the trimmer integrated into the shaver itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The downside to this setup is that the trimmer is a separate piece, whereas most shavers have the trimmer integrated into the shaver itself.    </li>
            <li>The 1090 has more bells and whistles.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve dabbled here and there with electrics over the years but have mostly stayed with the disposable-blade system.  </li>
            <li>It seems to do a better job with shaving cream</li>
            <li>I believe my dad will love it</li>
            <li>Perfect for daily shaving.</li>
            <li>but i love it</li>
            <li>i personally love this</li>
            <li>i love it and will continue to use it on my legs.  </li>
            <li>I resorted to my Gillette Fusion to shave my sideburns more efficiently and speedily.  </li>
            <li>Just pop the top of the shaving unit off, and run it under the faucet.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the 1150X.</li>
            <li>The head does a wonderful job of adapting to your face to get as many hairs as possible; you can even use it in the shower!</li>
            <li>it works ok.</li>
            <li>this is nothing better than an electric face massager.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s water proof, so I can shave in the shover.</li>
            <li>i bought this for my father as a gift, he love it</li>
            <li>But could just never bring myself to pay hundreds for something better.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product and I am loving the experience.</li>
            <li>SURE I&#x27;D GET A CLOSE SHAVE,</li>
            <li>The SensoTouch 2D models looked interesting and were not outrageously priced like some of the newer 3D 1200-series models.</li>
            <li>But, I was sceptical that they would do a dramatically better job than my existing shaver.    </li>
            <li>so it is ok.</li>
            <li>( you cannot kill yourself with a cordless shaver, don&#x27;t ask :-)</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>So ended up paying more like $60 for it.  </li>
            <li>exxelente maquina de afeitar le queda la cara suave y sin irritacion,recomiendo este producto justo lo que yo buscava ok</li>
            <li>great product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Even a 20 pounds shaver I bought in the UK some years ago shaved better than this one.</li>
            <li>The 1150x does a better job on my neck than the 8140XL.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;SensoTouch 2D\\&quot; means the blades push in and out and flex to the contours of your face better.</li>
            <li>Stunning appearence as the picture shown on web</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE GILLETTE, BUT</li>
            <li>I have used the Norelco shavers for years and this is my latest acquisition.  </li>
            <li>This purchase from Amazon comes out to be about $20 more than I would have paid at Costco.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been having issues with too many hairs that got missed by my shaver.</li>
            <li>In addition, I am used to and now prefer to be able to shave in a circular motion to catch my hairs from all angles.  </li>
            <li>I wish the construction was a litter heavier and more sturdy.</li>
            <li>takes up to eight minutes for my face to feel decently smooth, and this after wetting whiskers at beginning and during shave with warm water.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m 200% satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>think he love it also.</li>
            <li>The downside to this setup is that the trimmer is a separate piece, whereas most shavers have the trimmer integrated into the shaver itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am confident that the 1150X is the best one I&#x27;ve used-and I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 weeks!</li>
            <li>and he just love it.</li>
            <li>He told me in China it costs more than 3,000RMB.</li>
            <li>It is quieter than most shavers I have owned.</li>
            <li>I will appreciate if you have better idea.</li>
            <li>The shaver is OK</li>
            <li>Not that the rebate will make it a better product.</li>
            <li>For $90, we were expecting a better product.</li>
            <li>and i can not understand any review with more than one star.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was ok when it lasted.</li>
            <li>im sure</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Trust me, like many of you guys</li>
            <li>/&gt;In terms of the product, it&#x27;s just a $20 product with a bit more fancier design.</li>
            <li>This problem is more an over all three head shaver problem and not a Phillips problem</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I bought</li>
            <li>This mid range shaver is great!</li>
            <li>Im sure they make better ones every year</li>
            <li>/&gt;i love it ~</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>I would routinely go a week or more between shaves.   </li>
            <li>This seems to be more of a \\&quot;take your time\\</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t, I love this shaver.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think you will get a better shave, just more bells and whistles.</li>
            <li>The shave isnt quite as close as you would get with a manual razor but its much better and quicker than any electric razor I have used before.</li>
            <li>Battery is more durable, have not yet been charged.</li>
            <li>I bought it use when in a time crunch and truly love it.</li>
            <li>All done :)</li>
            <li>The quality is perfect and same as shopping.  </li>
            <li>overall a great shave!</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>will buy one more for my father.</li>
            <li>okay ..........</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend the 7310 instead, as it is a much better value.</li>
            <li>My 10 dollar beard trimmer does a better job.</li>
            <li>* Chatted with AMAZON and had much better experience, a customer shouldn&#x27;t have to go through this, but</li>
            <li>Since we are all time having problem with Phillip Norelco rebate, we would switch to Panasonic shaver since Panasonic gives better service.</li>
            <li>I hope it costs them a lot more than the amount they saved on all of the $30 rebates</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m leaving this feedback more for the company than for the product.</li>
            <li>I am so love it,I want to buy more,but you limitied the number,how can i do</li>
            <li>and I was hoping that over the years they have gotten better.  </li>
            <li>What a sexy looking shaver.</li>
            <li>Better ergos in my opinion as well, but that is subjective.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Norelco razors for more than 50 years.  </li>
            <li>Some have been better shavers than others.  </li>
            <li>My son requested this shaver and I found it on Amazon for a better price than anywhere else.</li>
            <li>ok?</li>
            <li>Just got it and love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I have switched to an epilator that works MUCH better.</li>
            <li>looks nice and really comfortable.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s water proof,  </li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>This shaver is a top of the line instrument.</li>
            <li>I purchased it Nov. 20, 2011, three more uses per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>there are four more cracks around the button&#x27;s cave (see my uploaded pictures</li>
            <li>I just got mine yesterday, much better than Philips/Norelco 7340XL</li>
            <li>all in all not any faster or more convenient than a manual.</li>
            <li>and it was fantastic!</li>
            <li>it took about a week for my beard to adjust - and the results were just okay.</li>
            <li>probably as with most products in todays world.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I love this shaving feeling, the price is materially beneficial.</li>
            <li>and the price is much reasonable than best buy.&lt;br /&gt;wash, clean is easy.</li>
            <li>like。I hope to be able to better</li>
            <li>Sexy out look of the product had been the biggest reason I bought it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for 3 months now and cannot and have never been able to get a close shave.</li>
            <li>For the money it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>better than all the rest.</li>
            <li>All of them would work ok, but I would have to shave my neck/</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I love this shaver.  </li>
            <li>Too famous razor.</li>
            <li>OK...</li>
            <li>The Best part and why i would recommend:&lt;br /&gt;- Baby-smooth shave for facial hairs on cheek and jaw-line.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Sleek design with elegant looks</li>
            <li>bought many of it for gifts.</li>
            <li>Much better than ther klast generation Norelco Razor.  </li>
            <li>Dis keeps me lookin fresh as fuh fo da ladies and works good</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s great!I love</li>
            <li>I have used Norelco products forever and the one that I bought recently is the best one.</li>
            <li>made and really love it.</li>
            <li>shaver itself is ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not as pleased with this as I&#x27;d hoped I&#x27;d be.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned, but it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>I liked the addition of 3 miniature suction cups at the bottom of the cradle, and they provided surprisingly good grip without requiring much depression of the cradle.  </li>
            <li>Not only it shaves very smooth and the result is very good, but it is very easy to be cleaned as well.</li>
            <li>Not only it shaves very smooth and the result is very good, but it is very easy to be cleaned as well.</li>
            <li>It just cut clean and very easy to use and cleaning is very easy  </li>
            <li>Very good razor, I recommend to anyone who is not very stiff bristles.</li>
            <li>This is the best shaver that I&#x27;ve ever used, sharp, comfortable and good looking.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The packaging is right good.</li>
            <li>I have been using older models of Norelco for 15 years, all with excellent success.  </li>
            <li>The battery life is fantastic, its easy to use and shaves close and very smooth, it contours nicely to your face.  </li>
            <li>wish all have a happy new year!  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to clean and delivers a very smooth shave</li>
            <li>Nice, clean shave.  </li>
            <li>It gives a smooth and comfortable shave, is easy to use and a good value.</li>
            <li>One can get a pretty good shave out of most items out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, out of the box I liked the design and ease of removing parts to clean.  </li>
            <li>This works better than the lower-end models, as it moves around more easily and fits in my hand better.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace an older Panasonic, and once I got the feel for using it, I&#x27;m quite happy with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been successfully using various Braun shavers for abou 20 years and wouldn&#x27;t have even considered purchasing this one except for a combination coupon/rebate deal which made the price too good to pass up.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer does its work great, but you have to remove the main shaver head and insert the trimmer.  </li>
            <li>very easy to use and gives a close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>very easy to use, and it&#x27;s so cheap</li>
            <li>Great product, would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It has a good value for money,I like it very much.</li>
            <li>It shaves very clean everywhere except for my jawline--really just under my jaw/upper neck area.</li>
            <li>But if your beard is not bushy, maybe it can&#x27;t shave your beard very clean.</li>
            <li>Love that this can be rinsed clean, very easy.  </li>
            <li>I used to shave the beard is very clean.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This was the best investment I have made in a long time.</li>
            <li>It works pretty good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty fairly priced razor and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>in all, it&#x27;s pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Besides, the attachment does a pretty good job doing touch up work.</li>
            <li>The product is pretty good, and so is the price after $30 discount.</li>
            <li>The shaving is also pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good</li>
            <li>Pretty good</li>
            <li>Pretty good</li>
            <li>He said it was pretty good.</li>
            <li>Best buy I have made in a long time.    </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a pretty good razor for the money</li>
            <li>As I shave with it more and more, it gets more comfortable and a closer shave, just like the manual said.</li>
            <li>He and I loved it so much we brought one for my father!</li>
            <li>Excellent for slightly long hairs for people like me who shave once in 3-4 days&lt;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m interested to see how good the replacement heads are for this model, they were not satisfactory for prevkious model.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the top end of the new Philips Norelco line, but it also isn&#x27;t $300+ and in that regard it provides a very nice counterpoint to today&#x27;s blade shaving systems.  </li>
            <li>Good and not expensive  worthy and nice deal  </li>
            <li>It gives a very clean shave, and it&#x27;s very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This was a Christmas gift and He loves it , great price , norelco has always been a grat product and this new razor was  </li>
            <li>I have owned this brand razor for years and this new version is great.  </li>
            <li>I had the Norelco architect razor which was great when it was new</li>
            <li>happy with this new shaver...</li>
            <li>The design of the charging stand is elegant, and the razor slips in and out easily.  </li>
            <li>gives a good clean shave, is easy to clean and water can rinse it with out hurting any of the moving parts.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so greatful, cheap,and i love it.it&#x27;s  easy to use.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so greatful, cheap,and i love it.it&#x27;s  easy to use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any better than my 10years old shaver, but I thought it was still a great buy for $20.</li>
            <li>Overall, an excellent shaver, comfortable sooth shave, sleek design lines.  </li>
            <li>This razor gave me the best shave with such a light touch.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect the shave quality to be quite as good, but I&#x27;m actually finding that it&#x27;s slightly superior (and I do replace blades).  </li>
            <li>My SmartTouch XL 9160 XL is more than 5 years old and still works great.</li>
            <li>That said, the most comfortable shave I was able to get was post shower with shaving cream.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nothing on this Earth beats a blade, but this razor is sleek, smooth, gets close enough, &amp; i&#x27;m a very happy customer!</li>
            <li>It would be better if  it was much more cheap.</li>
            <li>So far (1 month), I am happy with it, would give a better grade wasn&#x27;t for the lightness of the body.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much much more cheaper than China.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty good and like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Light weight, very quiet and excellent product.</li>
            <li>this good is not quiet good.</li>
            <li>i loved it , the battery last a lot longer than what they say , and i loved the fact that i received the item 3 days after placing the order even thou</li>
            <li>Found it very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to clean</li>
            <li>It is VERY easy to take apart and clean.</li>
            <li>Loved the Panasonics, but decided to try the Philips Norelco 1150X/40 based on positive reviews I read here.</li>
            <li>Generally I think this is a good shaver, but I think I liked the 8140XL better.</li>
            <li>Is worth purchasing, the price is ok!</li>
            <li>This razor is fantastic, cuts close, and is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>This razor is very light weight and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>As a very long-time Norelco/Philips user I am pleased to say this new model is the best electric shaver I have used yet.</li>
            <li>It was more portable and did a fine job shaving.  </li>
            <li>They work just fine as a vanity top appliance.  </li>
            <li>It just does not provide a clean, convenient shave!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s fast, very easy to clean and provides a good shave</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and looks cool.  </li>
            <li>so kind of used this over a year and kind of give up on this shaving, I mainly use this for trimming sideburns now.</li>
            <li>For the price range it is a very good unit and I would recommnend it to anyone for a quality shave, trimming and daily useage.</li>
            <li>very good The design on the SensoTouch is quite futuristic, with a blue front, curved body, and perched shave head.</li>
            <li>Although I bought it one month before thanksgiving deal and cost a little more than the biggest deal, still it is a great deal for this good product</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;ve got the light good and bright and spot some whiskers that didn&#x27;t get clipped, I&#x27;ll run around and over and back and forth and seem not to make any progress.  </li>
            <li>This senso touch tilts and moves to the countours of the face for the smoothest and most comfortable shave ever.</li>
            <li>For wet shaving I was really impressed with this razor.  </li>
            <li>But with this razor if my skin is wet( like after a shower) and I can just use some shave gel and get a perfect shave.      </li>
            <li>This Philips Norelco 1150x/40 is in my opinion one of the best rotary wet shavers I have used.</li>
            <li>It shaves wonderfully around the neck region, with minimal irritation.</li>
            <li>So, to keep up with military appearance, I feel that this shaver does and excellent job!  </li>
            <li>I dont think it is quicker or closer than a blade, but It is much more comfortable and does not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s justa more comfortable alternative.</li>
            <li>It works well, and the most important we purchased during thanksgiving, there are $30 rebate from amazon and $30 from phiplips too.</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon for having such a great price for the shaver and thank you to Phillips Norelco for making such a great product!</li>
            <li>With the amount/type of surface area I have to cover, the rotary seems to be a better fit for my shaving routine.  </li>
            <li>However, this was by far the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced for five day stubble.  </li>
            <li>wow what a great shave.</li>
            <li>Excellent close shave esp if you use the wet option with shave cream.  </li>
            <li>This is the most comfortable shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Look at the video&#x27;s, and check out phillip&#x27;s website to get more detailed information about the shaver.</li>
            <li>the most important is</li>
            <li>AND we hope we can get more cheap goods fm you.</li>
            <li>Shaver shaves well,but if you wet shave with lather it is awesome.</li>
            <li>(Nov 9, 2014): Still going as my primary razor. :)</li>
            <li>So, the amount of irritation a razor produces is what is most important to me.  </li>
            <li>It did do a great job except my lower neck near my adam&#x27;s apple.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>No complaints so far, it works great.</li>
            <li>What a great shaver, def an upgrade to my old 10year razor.</li>
            <li>And even if you are able to fit in a travel bag or another part of your suitcase, you have to worry about it breaking it  - thus eliminating your ability to charge your shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s enjoy this shaver :)</li>
            <li>tried using it in the shower, but didn&#x27;t really have a good experience.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice electric shaver, and I believe it&#x27;s worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Did take me a week or two to really figure out how to get a good shave with it.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, good service and exellent produt.  </li>
            <li>thanks to norelco for a good shaver,</li>
            <li>This razor is really good, very domineering..</li>
            <li>I would recommend a norelco to anyone who wants a good reliable razor.</li>
            <li>very good,good price good shaver</li>
            <li>THANKS FOR A GOOD PRODUCT  </li>
            <li>Works very well - good shave.</li>
            <li>I find I really need to stretch my skin to get a good close shave.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a good electric shaver and with reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Not big,not heavy,it&#x27;s in a good price and very usefull for me!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A good product, and shipping is fast too.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Really gives a good shave.</li>
            <li>Good so far, shaves nice and close, holds a charge, comfortable to grip.  </li>
            <li>CLEANING: Just a quick word about cleaning; it&#x27;s very easy to perform here.  </li>
            <li>Overall, very good, but the razor head is easy to get rid of, a heads scrapped, sad&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>The new ones are better, but this shaver is good for the price point.</li>
            <li>very useful and cheap!</li>
            <li>it is greatwish more goods like this~~~~~it is very useful and Convenient.</li>
            <li>Quick charge, and has a nice comfortable feel in my hand.  </li>
            <li>ITS VERY SMOOTH ON YOUR SKIN AND A BREEZE TO CLEAN</li>
            <li>The trimmer isn&#x27;t great, but other than that I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I found the best results by simply wetting my face and then rinsing the shaver with warm water, thus getting a very close comfortable shave.      </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave very clean but quite comfortable.</li>
            <li>It, like every other electric razor that I have tried, is not the greatest at shaving the neck.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to save your original receipt if you&#x27;re thinking or taking advantage of the 45-day trial.</li>
            <li>THIS NORELCO, MAY TAKE A LITTLE MORE TIME, BUT IT IS EXCELLENT, AND GETS U SHAVED CLOSE.  </li>
            <li>I could not ask for a better razor, definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>I received it last week ,it&#x27;s beatful,and smooth to the skin, very good.</li>
            <li>I bought it when it on deal, the price is good and item is better than my old electric razor, I would like to buy another one for my friend.</li>
            <li>It was easy to plug in the stand and wait for the razor to charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Cleaning is also quite easy.</li>
            <li>Like the stand has plungers so sticks easy.</li>
            <li>Most important is this Shaver cheap</li>
            <li>Shaver is really easy on my skin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s on and is easy to remove and replace.</li>
            <li>The 1050 is one of the models with flip-out heads which makes it easy to rinse but is not designed for disassembly.</li>
            <li>But for convenience, rechargeable battery, fit and finish, and light weight, this Norelco has a lot of appealing features.</li>
            <li>Love the extra trimmer attachment which works great.</li>
            <li>Just another shaver that doesn&#x27;t do the job easily.</li>
            <li>It also charges very quickly and holds that charge for well over a week.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s easy to switch heads and</li>
            <li>but I dont buy into the cleaning systems because this one washes easily under the faucet once you remove the cutters.</li>
            <li>The heads pop off easily for cleaning.  </li>
            <li>But like I said, it would be good to be able to plug in directly and not have to carry the stand when doing extended travel.  </li>
            <li>Easy to operate and smoth.</li>
            <li>One of the good parts can be smooth shaving that doesn&#x27;t require to much power.</li>
            <li>but they aren&#x27;t as easy on the skin as this</li>
            <li>The charger is sturdy and the shaver settings are easy to figure out.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Also, we received the product in a very quick manner.</li>
            <li>You can wash the head after easily removing it, and you can brush the hair out of the receptacle under the heads.</li>
            <li>You can wash the head after easily removing it, and you can brush the hair out of the receptacle under the heads.</li>
            <li>give this thing five stars quite easily, and without exaggeration.  </li>
            <li>It gives me a close shave fairly easily.  </li>
            <li>It is a very quick click (just a pull) to remove the shaving blades and click in the trimming attachment.  </li>
            <li>Using once a day I can easily get two weeks out of a charge.  </li>
            <li>Close shave, easy to maintain, locking feature for travel to avoid discharge, easy cradle charge</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s easy on your skin</li>

            <li>Received item very quickly.</li>

            <li>It was easy to use and gave a close shave.</li>
            <li>It shaves close and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold, lightweight, cleans well.  </li>
            <li>It could easily be solved with a port in the shaver into which the charging cord could be plugged.</li>
            <li>With coupons, the price is the lowest and the product is so easy to use</li>
            <li>I have found it to be exceptionally easy to clean - much better than electrics of yore.  </li>
            <li>Easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>It works well, shaves my face well cleans up easily.</li>
            <li>Cleans easily,  keeps a charge and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to hold, even when soapy.  </li>
            <li>This however does make it a bit easier to use the trimmer, since the unit is so easy to hold.</li>
            <li>easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and easy to use.</li>

            <li>Easy to use, waterproof, easy to recharge.</li>
            <li>It easily does the job</li>
            <li>, I really enjoy the wet shave, it fly&#x27;s on your face!!</li>
            <li>So I think it&#x27;s better to use manual to keep clean</li>
            <li>Even with the trimmer attachment, does not remove hair easily.  </li>

            <li>may be easy to broke.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the people this works for don&#x27;t have iron strong beard hair</li>
            <li>If you have strong beard hair and neckline hair, save yourself the pain and discomfort, and avoid this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>/&gt;UPDATE (Nov 25, 2011):  Still going strong.  </li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s not as strong either.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I will not buy another product from Phillips Norelco and would strongly recommend that no one else does, until they fix their customer service.</li>
            <li>Still going strong.</li>
            <li>Good things, the use of down feeling good, and the price is very cheap, hope Amazon continues to launch cheap goodies.</li>
            <li>for me this is a&lt;br /&gt;Great alternative to the high cost of shaving , and for me 99% as good as a pro.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>HE LIKED IT VERY MUCH.</li>
            <li>it can go in the shower with it and does a good job I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Although I have not used it for too long, the charge seems to be very good.      </li>
            <li>The package is very good, nothing misses during long way transportation.  </li>
            <li>But I have to admit this one is a complete improvement, very smoth easy to use, very good desing, and the materials are way more durable</li>
            <li>First off, this is a really nice razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to accept that these incidents are a trade off for a perceptibly closer shave and my own experience tells me that my beard growth will adapt.</li>
            <li>I didnt give it five stars simply because there is still nothing better than a good ol razor shave :)  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give the close shave that bladed razors give you, but it comes pretty close and is a nice option to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>is my first letter of praise of any kind, ever.  </li>
            <li>Work&#x27;s okay, but would really have to shell out more money for a better electric razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gift to my friend, and my first time to buy this kind stuff.</li>
            <li>After about a year of searching for a great quality product at a reasonable price (for full-time college student), I am delighted with my final choice.   </li>
            <li>Grate razor and it cuts close and fast with no pulling, it is easy to clean and holds a good charge.</li>
            <li>High cost of a Philips electric shavers, discounts are also very affordable, in line with my request, the effect is also very good use</li>
            <li>Great value, and clean and soft shaving.</li>
            <li>Good touch feeling ,voice is very light,easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best electric razor I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>This is hands down the best shaver I have ever owned!</li>
            <li>Ordered from Australia and it arrived very quickly with tracking available.</li>
            <li>Fine shaver - five stars.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very happy for the price paid, less than $90 on the internet, and</li>
            <li>Shaver works fine</li>
            <li>purchased this product with a mail in rebate on reading all the fine print plus asking an amazon rep about its validity.</li>
            <li>It works fine then.  </li>
            <li>But, since it holds a charge for over two weeks it suites my just fine.</li>
            <li>I can shave my face and neck very quickly and smoothly.</li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>That said, however, I have a sparse light beard that should be easy to get a close shave.</li>
            <li>The razor work just fine.</li>
            <li>Cheap and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I still wasn&#x27;t overly impressed for the first week or two of daily use.</li>
            <li>Quite cheap and easy to use...  </li>
            <li>Plus, I&#x27;m a shower shaver and it works just fine in the shower -</li>
            <li>I do not know if it works fine.</li>
            <li>Brought this for my husband and it is the first (of many shavers) to get those stubborn, short,white hairs and leaves him so smooth!</li>
            <li>It seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>The battery life is outstanding and I love the ease of cleaning the head after each use just by running it under hot water.</li>
            <li>A quick charge feature allows you to charge the shaver for 5 minutes, and get 3 minutes of shaving time, but sometimes 5 minutes is more than I have when I&#x27;m in a rush.  </li>
            <li>Most have lasted well and shaved adequately.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty quiet, looks good, holds a good charge and cleans easy</li>
            <li>A quick charge feature allows you to charge the shaver for 5 minutes, and get 3 minutes of shaving time, but sometimes 5 minutes is more than I have when I&#x27;m in a rush.</li>
            <li>I came to the conclusion that Philips cares more about $30 than it does about its loyal customers.  </li>
            <li>i feel very suitable to use it.although this product is 2D system,its very good,shaving quickly and clean.i will suggest to my friend buying it.</li>
            <li>his face feels much, much smoother than I can ever remember it feeling before - which I love!  </li>
            <li>I think he will love it very much!</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, I like it very much.</li>
            <li>Holds its charge, easy to recharge, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Cuts well, smooth, small, comfortable in the hand, and the battery is most impressive.  </li>
            <li>Mainly the price is also very satisfied</li>
            <li>This Electric Shaver Cheap and fine.</li>
            <li>The best razor my boyfriend ever had he loves it!.simple to use works great dry or wet.</li>
            <li>it is certainly tempting to consider an electric shaver as a cost effective alternative.</li>
            <li>, I had settled on the Norelco approach to shaving as the best for me and thought there was little else Norelco could do to improve.</li>
            <li>Discount is very good, love family, very to force, hope still to discount next time, I will continue to buy</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, super sharp, no irritation, battery holds an excellent charge.....</li>
            <li>The shave I get was smooth, no nicks, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, comfortable, close shave.</li>
            <li>Light, smooth and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Light weight, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Also its made in the Netherlands \\&quot;NOT CHINA\\&quot; which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>Shaving gel makes a huge difference with this razor.</li>
            <li>This is a huge step backwards.</li>
            <li>They are comfortable and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Loves this shaver recently shaved my head and it does a great job of keeping my head  smooth without irritation .</li>
            <li>The head bends well with the contour of the whole face and shaves nice and smooth without giving a rash.</li>
            <li>That will eventually leave a huge hole.  </li>
            <li>I got this razor for Christmas and still haven&#x27;t used it more than 5 times, but I really liked it so far.</li>
            <li>Light weight.</li>
            <li>The blades are easy to clean too.  </li>
            <li>I get a close shave free of any skin irritation.</li>
            <li>it is a a nice product,specially for people who has much mustache.  </li>
            <li>It cut the hairs easily and is a breeze to clean.</li>
            <li>Purchased this one because I thought it would be a smoother comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Pulls, grabs, pinches and does not deliver a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>The trimmer requires manual attachment, though it&#x27;s worth it since it functions better than the pop-up on the 1250&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>He gets a close, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>It is comfortable to use</li>
            <li>and I found the Norelco didn&#x27;t move as smoothly across the skin as the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>/&gt; After the shave the razor was easy to clean and reassemble.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy with this norelco and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>no exception  Same great product</li>

            <li>Took it for a test run, it is really smooth without getting yanked or pulled, contours to your jaw and shaves every hair, assuming you give it a bit of a circular motion  </li>
            <li>I could not believe how smooth and effortless this razor removed the hair.  </li>
            <li>SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver is nice, shipping fast.</li>

            <li>Super smooth save with easy clean up.</li>
            <li>This shaver gives a smooth and clean shave.</li>
            <li>I was slightly bummed but still happy I was able to get it so cheap.</li>
            <li>Easy to grab when in the bathroom and get a quick shave.</li>
            <li>I like it, would buy again, but not as handy as the classic design.</li>
            <li>Cleaning is easy and quick.</li>
            <li>With this easy and quick Norelco I now shave every day.</li>
            <li>and you have to really work at it to get a good shave in the first place.</li>
            <li>(I use a gel), but that may be largely imagined because it glides so much more easily.  </li>
            <li>Very close and nick free and clean up is very easy.</li>
            <li>price is very affordable, very easy to use, he said.</li>
            <li>Good product with reasonable price, there are no reasons not to love it so far!  </li>
            <li>each new model seems to do a better job!</li>
            <li>I received the razor in just a few days and not only that it does a great job for shaving, i love the way it looks and the handling was great too.</li>
            <li>I love it very much and will continue shopping in Amazon.</li>
            <li>The motor does not run very fast, but is still OK.</li>
            <li>i buy it for my father ,he love it very much</li>
            <li>My son love it very much.  </li>
            <li>Great, my husband really like this product, which is his New Year&#x27;s gift.</li>
            <li>I just use it \\&quot;Dry\\&quot; with some &#x27;Lectric Shave lotion, but when I have a little more time in the morning I use it with Edge gel and that is really the best combination.  </li>
            <li>good  very useful ， its  very helpful  for me ,and  whats important is its  very  cheap！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！  </li>
            <li>A good shave is easy to get in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>Works quick, doesn&#x27;t tug and it easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great shaver that allows you a quick shave, if you don&#x27;t have the razor burn problem.</li>
            <li>great feature of this razor is how quick it is to charge (about 30 minutes) and that it maintains that charge for about 5 days with daily use.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to take apart and clean the attachments and is a breeze to use for a quick trim.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, body wash, Thank you such a good product,I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li>Design quality, appearance is very beautiful, very smooth shave, hope can be lasting and reliable quality, hope the blade can be maintained for a long time, also hope to be able to buy the right accessories</li>
            <li>I have been using Norelco rotaries for the past 25 years or so, but this one is the best.</li>
            <li>Recommended annual blade replacements add significant cost&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>-- Recommended annual blade replacements add significant cost  </li>
            <li>If you look at the cost over 3 years, the Panasonic would cost $65 whereas the Norelco would cost $117 which exceeds the original cost of the shaver ($100).    </li>
            <li>indicator lights are great, so you know how long of a charge you&#x27;ve got</li>
            <li>also the finish on this thing makes it appear more as a toy than a piece of equipment that real men would like to use!  </li>
            <li>It worked great, it lasted a long time</li>
            <li>I bought this for myself this Christmas past as somewhat of an impulse buy, and it&#x27;s probably one of the best impulse buys I have made.</li>
            <li>Evidently it just gets better from here.</li>
            <li>I upgraded electric shavers for the first time in 20 years, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my dad, and I have used it on occasion, and I am very satisfied with the purchase so far.</li>
            <li>Originally, I had planned on putting it under the Christmas tree but,  with all of the rush of the holidays, it got shoved aside.  </li>
            <li>Okay, it doesn&#x27;t say that exactly, but it does say to use it for 21 days to get your skin used to this electric razor.</li>
            <li>It does not matter how many hot women they put in the commercials.</li>
            <li>love the warranty; it is already dying, exactly 2 year after the warranty expired.  </li>
            <li>It gives a close shave and has a long battery life - which is great if you keep it in you</li>
            <li>It takes many more passes to shave my beard smooth than my old Norelco.</li>
            <li>I was terribly excited as I had wanted to buy this razor after viewing the marketing videos on Amazon.</li>
            <li>but it is sure it slides on your face like cream on hot bread.</li>
            <li>Well, I wanted to try it out because of its unique look.</li>
            <li>I have excited about this product and gone through all the reviews and bought</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been pretty pleased with this shaver.  </li>
            <li>Original (MADE IN NETHRELANDS)product,higher quality than its cheaper models which from China.</li>
            <li>This is the first Norelco shaver that I have used in many years.</li>
            <li>I have been using shavers for more than 20 years and  my first one from philips lasted for 14 years.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>My 15-year-old Norelco shaves as well as this one and as close even with the original heads.  </li>
            <li>It is worth buying!</li>
            <li>Also, I found that the trimmer comes as a separate attachement which is not user friendly.</li>
            <li>I like the ability to wash the razer head with hot water, etc., and have been using these models for many years.  </li>
            <li>Dutch original.</li>
            <li>Got one for Christmas and was the first electric in many years.</li>
            <li>worth to buy !</li>
            <li>My first electric razor after many years of using a blade.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a nice looking razor with good features for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a nice looking razor with good features for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Very very sharp, very good battery.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable and enjoyable, and really far beyond my expectation.</li>
            <li>When I am in blade shave mode the Schick Hydro5 is my tool of choice, best blade hands down for me, however this new  Norelco 1150x/40 is going to have me using it more than I ever thought</li>
            <li>The shavers are nice, but the company forces you to buy a new one every so-many years.</li>
            <li>I bought two razors are Philips, a 1150 and a 1250.As a New Year gift for my friends, they liked.</li>
            <li>(And yes, I clean my razor&#x27;s and change the heads periodically).  </li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t done any disassembling to do a thorough clean.   </li>
            <li>I also find it easier to clean.</li>
            <li>Its smooth on th The battery charges quick and holds its charge.</li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t see myself paying for a Jet Clean that does something I could do myself, plus I don&#x27;t have the counter</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several electric razors before but this razor is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I just want a clean, close shave without having to spend 15 minutes at it.</li>
            <li>I clean the heads by taking it apart and just running the heads under water.</li>
            <li>I clean the heads by taking it apart and just running the heads under water.</li>
            <li>YOU NEED TO CLEAN THE HEADS PERIODICALLY.  </li>
            <li>While the charge time and length of charge per the advertisements seem to be accurate I believe 7 to 10 shaves per charge is more reasonable with shave times closer to 4 minutes of duration.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth to buy and easy to chean.  </li>
            <li>It can shave efficiently and completely clean.</li>
            <li>but I feel unsure if clean.</li>
            <li>I even offered to let my wife use it for her legs and underarms since she can just wash to get it clean.</li>
            <li>, I just shake out the wiskers into the garbage can; and yet it still gives me a great dry shave every day.  </li>
            <li>but then again it is easier to clean too and its still trivial to swap in/out trimmer,</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fantastic IF your need the quick charge.</li>
            <li>My father-in-law NEVER in 70 years used anything but an electric, and he always seemed clean shaven.</li>
            <li>My father-in-law NEVER in 70 years used anything but an electric, and he always seemed clean shaven.</li>
            <li>It can shave face clean, and is user-friendly and power-save.</li>
            <li>The 1090 is a bit easier to clean.</li>
            <li>With the 1150 you need to remove the cleaning head off the body of the razor in order to clean it out.</li>
            <li>much faster shaving speed than BRAUN and more comfortable feeling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He said its quite and keep the face clean.</li>
            <li>Never had any problems with this razor and always a clean shave.</li>
            <li>but I quickly discovered I needed a preshave lotion to facilitate a smooth shave with the Norelco.</li>
            <li>The 1090 is a bit easier to clean.</li>
            <li>With the 1150 you need to remove the cleaning head off the body of the razor in order to clean it out.  </li>
            <li>For now, I use this for about 20 seconds in the morning and then switch to a 5-blade cartridge razor to clean up the rest.</li>
            <li>This shaver is definitely the best shaver I have owed, by far.  </li>
            <li>very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;much more cheap than HK</li>
            <li>It shaves closely and cleanly.</li>
            <li>and I sometimes have to shave twice a day to stay clean shaven.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, good stuff, thank you very affordable price.</li>
            <li>This razor does a very nice job and seems to hold the charge a long time.  </li>
            <li>The thing worked fine, with no loss of motor torque or any other oddities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Value: Compared with the Braun, the Sensotouch is a great value.</li>
            <li>It does not seem to be very powerful, but appears to be enough for a good shave.  </li>
            <li>It was just over the cost for a new head so very cheap, very quick charging too</li>
            <li>It looks cool to begin with but the most important thing is that it works very well.</li>
            <li>originally got this for my hubby, who has a norelco smart touch XL, which he likes very much, but I don&#x27;t find that it gives me as nice a shave as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My 4401LC is a 20 yr old corded model that still does a very nice job/close shave, with HQ4 heads, but I have to be gentle</li>
            <li>buy your self a good shaving machine \\&quot;Gillette Mach3\\&quot; or simillar that will last for years (i own the same one for more than 8 years</li>
            <li>very good，My husband says it is very comfortable to use, and</li>
            <li>The shaving accuracy is excellent, although I don&#x27;t see it as a marked improvement over my previous Philips/Norelco (which I was perfectly satisfied with)    </li>
            <li>I had a Cool Skin 6700 series which I liked better as well as a Braun which I really liked and a lot more convenient when traveling (but the Braun didn&#x27;t have anything behind the blades to collect the cut stubble).</li>
            <li>but it seems to require a special cleaning device that did not come with it.     </li>
            <li>Because the head is large, you won&#x27;t have to do many circular motions to cover your face.</li>
            <li>This Norelco shaver is great for quick dry shaves in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I did a lot of research and discovered (after a few purchases) that the Women&#x27;s Razors weren&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li>home dad feel very good with it, but the replacement head is a bit of trouble</li>
            <li>This razor is quiet, fits great in my hand while giving a pretty clean shave.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean with hot water.  </li>
            <li>I experienced razor burn for the first week or ten days (I&#x27;ve made a point of using it every morning until I finish the review).</li>
            <li>Electric razors are not for everybody, but they are a great convenience, especially if you don&#x27;t need to get up and shower first thing every morning (another prerogative of retirement).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean by opening it up and running it under hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean by opening it up and running it under hot water.     </li>
            <li>This razor does a great job with absolutely no adverse effects.</li>
            <li>We both agree the wet/dry use is a great option, but he&#x27;s not one to change up his routine and get it &#x27;wet&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I have owned many Philips Norelco razors in the past and they have been great razors for me</li>
            <li>But it is not the most suitable for Asian.</li>
            <li>far as holding a charge, the Phillips is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It is what I expected and does a great job.  </li>
            <li>it works good, but the only matter is the nick line....</li>
            <li>Good as a regular razor.</li>
            <li>Overall, good product.</li>
            <li>Wow, this is a nice shaver.  </li>
            <li>But later it got good....</li>
            <li>(full charge in an hour, but you can use the shaver within minutes of charging)  </li>
            <li>Philips Norelco 1150x/40 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver, Metallic Blue]] is a good electric razor for those looking to buy a SensoTouch model.  </li>
            <li>For a much more reasonable investment of time and funds, you can have an almost equivalent shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For a much more reasonable investment of time and funds, you can have an almost equivalent shaving experience.    </li>
            <li>: It can get hard-to-get hairs around nostrils and unsightly ear hairs, so I&#x27;ve definitely found a good use for my Norelco.</li>
            <li>All in all, I think this rechargeable Philips Norelco razor is a good daily shaver</li>
            <li>I found that both shavers did a relatively good job overall.  </li>
            <li>Love it so much.</li>
            <li>So....the design is nice, but the lack of a close shave and the lack of a direct plug to charge takes off two stars.  </li>
            <li>prefer a wet/dry razor because just being able to rinse it out everyday is my preferred (and most cost effective) cleaning</li>
            <li>They advertised $30.00 rebate that i never received i would not have bought it for full price.</li>
            <li>Also, being able to rinse it with water after the shave makes it much easier to keep cleaner than brushing it alone.    </li>
            <li>My review is based against an old remington 7 series, so this shaver, I believe is a nice upgrade.</li>
            <li>The most thing is it&#x27;s very cheaper.</li>
            <li>This Phillips is more for touch-ups than for a real shave or an all the time shaver.</li>
            <li>Everything they said about it is true.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li>Looks cool though....</li>
            <li>I can still shave much faster, and get a better shave the ol fashion way.</li>
            <li>this 2d is just a cool one to put in the bathroom but not for shaving.</li>
            <li>This shaver is the gift that the first time i send to my husband, he love this shaver very much,the shaver has a nice appearance,it&#x27;s very suit for my husband.</li>
            <li>Because my last model was so good, I do have a couple of complaints.  </li>
            <li>Charged up the unit the night before, to ensure full</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean and quick.</li>
            <li>Besides, the shape and color all looks cool.</li>
            <li>Just a good solid Norelco.  </li>
            <li>Realistically I wouldn&#x27;t expect this device to do a good job with a three or four day growth of facial hair.</li>
            <li>I did not pay full price for mine - had a $30 coupon and a $30 rebate so the price was unbeatable.  </li>
            <li>If there is a clear link on a listing for a product, there is no way it honest merchandising not to honor what is offered.</li>
            <li>I think if you have a light beard and shave daily with this Norelco, you&#x27;ll get better results and may well love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And, surprise, the Norelco actually does a good job of getting ear hair.</li>
            <li>I think if you have a light beard and shave daily with this Norelco, you&#x27;ll get better results and may well love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And, surprise, the Norelco actually does a good job of getting ear hair.</li>
            <li>I bought it just so I could try a rotary shaver, but really didn&#x27;t expect it to be any better than my others.</li>
            <li>It takes me about 3 minutes for a full shave and the neck hairs are gone.</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>This is particularly true in those areas underneath the chin and jaw-line.</li>
            <li>This is particularly true in those areas underneath the chin and jaw-line.  </li>
            <li>- I would imagine that some detergent should be used with the blade for more intense cleaning.</li>
            <li>The more important is it&#x27;s suit me better than the last razor I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>Not using yet, but this is a good price to buy this product, it&#x27;s a present for farther-in-law.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver so much I am contemplating getting another for travelling.</li>
            <li>and it really did a noticeably better job of getting the chin and neck stubble off.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m gone for more than a week, I really would feel compelled to take the charging stand and AC adapter.</li>
            <li>as a chrismas gift to my boy friend, he love it very much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;will</li>
            <li>It shaves OK for an electric (I have been shaving with a mug and brush and modern blade razor for 50 years)</li>
            <li>The price is fair and I will definitely recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li>The order arrived within 5 days, and the product was in good quality, just the same as the description of the seller.</li>
            <li>One full charge and two weeks of use with no recharge till now.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I bought this items was it was a good deal.</li>
            <li>Stay away from this razor, spend the extra $20 or so and get an actually good one.</li>
            <li>Good performance with low price   </li>
            <li>love it very much！It‘s helpful for me and use it everyday！I</li>
            <li>I should start off by saying that this watch takes a reasonable amount of intelligence for you to get the most out of it.</li>
            <li>to clean, and charge is quick.</li>
            <li>If anything a nice light touch and it does the job better than pressing harder.</li>
            <li>electric razors are good only as fill in shavers when there isn&#x27;t time or energy for a shaving cream and razor shave.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am delighted with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Promotions are purchased only $ 60.A good deal.</li>
            <li>I really have enjoyed this shaver.</li>
            <li>so cool ！</li>
            <li>i am not thrilled with the recharging stand, but the shaver is excellent.  </li>
            <li>Nice price to buy a professional razor for my elder brother.</li>
            <li>It works well, my father love it very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hope Philips gets good customer care in future.</li>
            <li>I had to repeatedly go over the same spots to even begin to get a good shave.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>not bad</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth and glides easily across the skin, and the head and blades pivot to make easy work of facial contours.  </li>
            <li>easy to shave, like it very much.</li>
            <li>Very nice, the price is Very cheap,I really like it very much,and I hope you can continue to buy it at this price</li>
            <li>It just glides over my face and trims as good or better than the previous two electric razors I have owned.  </li>
            <li>For the price compared to some others, there is good value....and with the current $30 coupon I&#x27;d jump on this quick.</li>
            <li>Perfect goods that we purchased them more due to the low price.</li>
            <li>Just ok no to impressive does the work like any other ones, a bit to pricy for being so simple</li>
            <li>Very comfortable razor, that does a decent job, it just seems supremely under powered.  </li>
            <li>Cuts real close and clean and is easy to wash clean after use.</li>
            <li>This razor gets three out of five because it is comfortable to hold, the head rotates well around &amp;#34;knobby&amp;#34; areas like ankles and knees, seems to charge well and quickly, holds a charge for several days (and legs are a lot more area to cover than faces!), and it is made well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would very much recommend the purchase of this fine razor.</li>
            <li>This electric razor is great for going on, and around, all of the little bumps and irregularities that no one notices, until you try to get a smooth scalp.    </li>
            <li>First of all the razor is OK at best, it cannot be used if your facial hair gets very long</li>
            <li>The shaver charged quickly.</li>
            <li>and how i wish 1240 could be as worthy as this one</li>
            <li>i have owned 2 braun, 1 panasonic, and 1 philips before this one, and this is the best one that i have ever owned even thought it wasn&#x27;t the most expensive one.  </li>
            <li>] it is best designed for daily use of shorter facial hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;++ Best for daily shaving of shorter facial hair</li>
            <li>Charging is quick</li>
            <li>Alternatives like the 7310 still offer a better value for most of the same features&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>Now many months later, I still love this razor.</li>
            <li>It also allows for a more streamlined, ergonomic, and comfortable-to-hold shaver, compared with older models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All told, the 1150X is an execllent shaver.</li>
            <li>I bought it online and found it is quite and worthy.</li>
            <li>It is close, and it is quick.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>SHAVES QUICKLY.</li>
            <li>The head is very flexible and glides over the contours of the face easily, it is easy to clean too.</li>
            <li>I recommend every one to use this if you not bit choosy on price as its worthy for every penny u spend.</li>
            <li>Compared to Panasonic ES-LA63-S, SensoTouch 2d gives a more comfortable shave for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Once opened, a quick review of the instructions, plugged in the charger w/shaver in the charger and the unit was charging.</li>
            <li>And, most impressively, it even works on my neck, where the Braun was almost useless.  </li>
            <li>convenience to useshave bread on my face neatly and charge quickly.</li>
            <li>I received it quickly.</li>
            <li>The main reason is the $30 rebate :) which I haven&#x27;t received yet.  </li>
            <li>only drawback is that you will need to use some kind of lube or go with shaving cream if you want a smooth glide over your face.</li>
            <li>Charging quickly in 3 min.</li>
            <li>Two minutes for every day, the shaver still runs quickly without charge for 1 month</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t blame the Norelco as I have super sensetive skin.</li>
            <li>Quick charging time.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean, and holds it charge very well.</li>
            <li>This one cuts even better than the older models and ypu can shave in the shower as well.</li>
            <li>So if I&#x27;m looking to pick one to take on a trip or for when I need a quick shave</li>
            <li>Just started to use , but so far I really like it and is doing a good job for me</li>
            <li>So if I&#x27;m looking to pick one to take on a trip or for when I need a quick shave</li>
            <li>Philips claims that the best results will be seen after several weeks of regular use - and I&#x27;m getting close to that, so we&#x27;ll see.  </li>
            <li>I LIKE THE QUIETNESS,EASE OF CLEANING AND QUICK RECHARGE.</li>
            <li>Feels better built and more solid</li>
            <li>But Philips replaced it quickly under the warranty.</li>
            <li>Norelco was quick to send the correct one, however.  </li>
            <li>I am now using an older model which does a better shaving job for me.</li>
            <li>and I think that I&#x27;m now ready to provide an accurate and detailed review.</li>
            <li>I have used cordless razors for many years and was always able to plug in the cord when the battery was low.  </li>
            <li>I am lucky that I have an outlet inside the cabinet under the counter</li>
            <li>It works really quickly and gets to every spot in seconds.</li>
            <li>Well, I can now state that I am no longer a loyal Philips customer.</li>
            <li>I think the older models may be better</li>
            <li>I have the older style Norelco and like it much better.  </li>
            <li>First, the new body: it&#x27;s made of a cool looking metallic material that integrates buttons and lights in a continuous surface, so it&#x27;s very easy to wipe clean.</li>
            <li>It works very good on my coarse beard, easy to clean and when charged, it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>I cannot speak more highly of this Norelco unit:</li>
            <li>Very stylish, quick to charge, and fast delivery, brand new shrink wrapped in the box.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is pretty effective, quiet, and pretty good around the neck!</li>
            <li>Overall, it is pretty effective, quiet, battery lasts more than a week and pretty good around the neck</li>
            <li>I have owned other Norelco Shavers and, though I loved the convience and the smooth shave, I often turned it off accidently while shaving.</li>
            <li>However, the Panasonic performed slightly better on the flat cheek areas whereas the Norelco did slightly better on the curved areas around the jaw bone and neck.  </li>
            <li>In general, it&#x27;s a nice deal.</li>
            <li>I have confirmed with a Philips CS supervisor that they are authorized to do exactly that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Norelco shaving systems for decades and have normally found it to be superb and far better than any other shaver on the market.  </li>
            <li>With the price of $50, overall I&#x27;m very satisfied</li>
            <li>It is worth to buy such a razor.&lt;br /&gt;I will consider to buy one more if there is more discount.</li>
            <li>It took more time to shave than if I were to use a normal Mach 3 razor.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer is better for detail work on the 1150x/40, and it looks far more stylish, but in the end that&#x27;s not worth $60 more to me.</li>
            <li>I like it very much!</li>
            <li>first It looks beautiful,and I feel comfortable when I use it.</li>
            <li>I like this products  very much!</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied, I hope next time there</li>
            <li>The trimmer is also good, doesn&#x27;t catch or yank on your long beard hairs.   </li>
            <li>Good product, battery lasts long time however cannot shave as the shaver has to be in the supplied cradle to charge.</li>
            <li>It holds a charge for quite a long time and is also quite good looking for a razor.  </li>
            <li>I want a philips 1150X for a long time, it&#x27;s good shaver</li>
            <li>Not as good as my Braun 390 Razor, the triple razor head looks good but working really not as it looks,so my next Razor will be a Brauns</li>
            <li>It has a good long battery life, too.</li>
            <li>The 1150X gives a plenty close shave, smoothly and very comfortably glides over the skin with no irritation whatsoever, and is simple to clean with a quick rinse under the tap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>:) total worth the SURPRISE!!</li>
            <li>Was a great deal, and he loves that it can be used in the shower or out, and that he is done shaving so quickly with much less irritation and cuts.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend it to any one young or old,it gives a good close shave.</li>
            <li>The shaver itself is very easy to clean; you can use the small brush or hold it under running warm tap water.  </li>
            <li>While keeping the original traditional 3 circular heads design, it improves radically on many important points.  </li>
            <li>My advice to new users is to make sure you keep your receipt and all of the packing material until the three-week guarantee time has passed.    </li>
            <li>I could buy a new head from Norelco for $40, but I don&#x27;t plan to give them any more of my money.  </li>
            <li>I love this new SensoTouch.  </li>
            <li>I love this new shaver.  </li>
            <li>My friend is so satisfied with his new shaver.</li>
            <li>If they lost it, I can&#x27;t magically make a new one.</li>
            <li>I thought the new technology would give me a better, closer shave.</li>
            <li>I have been using Norelco electric razors 25 years or more, I decided to try the new format unit.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet cheap and very useful to my lift, it&#x27;s easy to clean and assemble.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has space-age looks and would do the job for anyone:  a great shave in half the time.</li>
            <li>It looks modern and adjusts to curves easily.</li>
            <li>Overall, pretty good product.  </li>
            <li>Close quick shave, easy to clean, with hot water from the faucet, and sits in the recharge cradle so it is always fully charged and ready to shave.</li>
            <li>He says the shave is very close and the shaver is easy for him to use.</li>
            <li>, I can use it easily, it looks very lighting.so</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use,charge is for 110v/220v is very helpful.</li>
            <li>It is very ergonomic, easy to hold.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and doesn&#x27;t need to charging much.  </li>
            <li>Either way, this shaver has never cut me, unlike the Braun, which gave me various scars as I learnt to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Result: On the first pass for me, it cuts fairly close.</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t recommend any product from a company that does this kind of shady business in this day and age.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Hopefully Phillips Norelco can develop a way to make the travel stand foldable so that it will be much easier to travel with because that would make this product an easy 5-star device.</li>
            <li>He used the new Norelco 1150x and it was love at first shave!</li>
            <li>The first month provided a clean shave, as you get with most new electric razors.  </li>
            <li>I just know that if you are considering this shaver, I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>However, this shaver gets pretty darn close!</li>
            <li>In closing, if you are interested in buying an electric razor for about 100 bucks, this is the one!  </li>
            <li>I have not try it myself,but it looks like very awesome  at least!</li>
            <li>He was Absolutely!!</li>
            <li>and it shaves his beard really well!!  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric shaver in over 50 years!</li>
            <li>I got this new, great looking, 1050x 2 days ago and have used it only once.</li>
            <li>I am impressed that this razor is wet/dry although I have only tried it dry.  </li>
            <li>My most recent shaver, an 8140XL, was still going strong after years, but it wasn&#x27;t shaving quite as well, probably because of worn blades.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve buy two Philips Norelco 1150 for both my dad and my boyfriend&#x27;s dad, they love it~  especially the easy clean&amp;travel lock</li>
            <li>The charging stand is quick and easy to use, an improvement over the plug-in charger of the older models.      </li>
            <li>But more importantly, i think the irritation comes from having to do way more passes than I normally would, especially shaving my chin and neck.</li>
            <li>I needed a new shaver and I read several reviews of this one that said it gave a smooth shave and was good for getting those pesky neck</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd shaver, I love it,it is very comfortable and smart.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean, also looks robust enough.</li>
            <li>The first time I took the head apart to clean it, the pieces fell apart on the counter.</li>
            <li>I think this would be an exceptional shaver for those with light to average beards.  </li>
            <li>very good quality,this product for this price, I want to give 5 stars, but,,, shipping is too slow, it&#x27;s takes me almost 1 month to wait, and maybe another month to wait for rebate(hope</li>
            <li>I bought this one is as present for a firend, based on his feedback, It is easy to use, he also recommend his friend to buy this product, the price compared to other product is very good.</li>
            <li>pretty smooth, enjoy it, it is a decent razor.</li>
            <li>Holds the charge very well and gives a nice close shave, plus no mess!  </li>
            <li>time will invest a little more money,  although for $100 you would think you would get a good shave without too much worry.</li>
            <li>This shaver is amazingly fast and smooth.</li>
            <li>I purchased this shaver for almost 1 month, like it very much, very good-looking outsides, comfortably.</li>
            <li>but that is only because the head is so much more flexible which means it follows facial curves more accurately and comfortably.  </li>
            <li>This was an amazing shave but taking 40 minutes daily to shave was out of the question.</li>
            <li>This shaver provides a fast and smooth shaving.</li>
            <li>We received the razor in just a few days and it looks great.  </li>
            <li>I have had this one for 3 weeks and haven&#x27;t experienced a dead battery yet.</li>
            <li>Charging was reasonably fast, and the razor is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>Along with Absolute Comfort Shave, there&#x27;s just nothing as close or comfortable than a blade.</li>
            <li>The price of this one is reasonable, and it shaves smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I purchased a cheap corded Braun razor and are much happier with it.</li>
            <li>The shave was very close and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The sound is very light&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast, thorough and comfortable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;2.very fast and comfortable</li>
            <li>Shaves smooth as silk and gets very close.</li>
            <li>Very close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it is comfortable and has a fast work</li>
            <li>I think the biggest difference though between this razor and my old Arcitec is that my face feels SOOOO smooth after using the 1150x!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the tradeoff though.</li>
            <li>For that, I like this one so much more than the old razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;++ Smooth and quiet operation compared to most electric razors</li>
            <li>It shaves better than the old one and is not comparable to the foil bladed one.</li>
            <li>As a day to day razor its actually quite nice.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t hold my own butter-fingeredness against the product design, until such a time as I do drop it and it does break...</li>
            <li>The norelco was much more comfortable but left stray hairs as well.</li>
            <li>The product is powerful.</li>
            <li>not only does this have a nice design to it</li>
            <li>I did a good job but who wants to keep putting the shaving blades back in their holder.</li>
            <li>I hope this will be useful to you.</li>
            <li>** surprised at NORELCO stiffing so many Customers over a Rebate SNAFU.  </li>
            <li>My 12 year old Remington worked much better, but I can&#x27;t find blades for it.</li>
            <li>Worth having.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a nice shaver.  </li>
            <li>Away better than my old shaver, which was brought 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>I think this model worth its price.</li>
            <li>All in all, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, but if you&#x27;re used to electrics its worth a shot.</li>
            <li>My old Norelco 980XL was top of the line and cost me $85 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>Well the first shave was sweet and has been every since.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ever owned, and I can honestly say I wont be going back razor blades.</li>
            <li>It works far better then</li>
            <li>all three together will give you a phenomenal clear face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been not only a nice experience generally, but also the first electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever truly liked.</li>
            <li>As far as i&#x27;m concerned, that&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Con: shaves not as closely as 7310, now I have to take about 10 minutes to shave (before it takes only 30 seconds), looks kind of plastic (in hand)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i have order it three weeks ago, i have to say it works very well, and the price is very competitively.i love it.</li>
            <li>It is worth the money, believe me.</li>
            <li>product itself was OK so far, but the company refused to honor its rebate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An irresponsible company that you won&#x27;t want to do business with.</li>
            <li>it is worth every cent.</li>
            <li>It does have several bells and whistles that are nice, but do not improve the shaver&#x27;s capability.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very goodUse a very greatI think value for moneythere was more then 30 days already</li>
            <li>It is worth buying.</li>
            <li>powerful look</li>
            <li>but sometime I can&#x60;t clear my  beard quickly&lt;br /&gt;I will buy more for giftI</li>
            <li>my old razor was much better</li>
            <li>Wow, better than you think.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It fits comfortably in the hand, and has a rubber ridge that runs around the edge for added grip (especially useful when using the shaver wet).</li>
            <li>Useful, can be recommended, with every morning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>It fits comfortably in the hand, and has a rubber ridge that runs around the edge for added grip (especially useful when using the shaver wet).  </li>
            <li>It has a nice simple stand and indicator lights to show that the razor is charging / charged, etc.</li>
            <li>All that said I feel the razor is worth the cost.</li>
            <li>a nice gift.&lt;br /&gt;i will choose it for next year.</li>
            <li>Worth the price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got an old trimmer that I use that works much better, and I guess I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
            <li>It fits comfortably in the hand, and has a rubber ridge that runs around the edge for added grip (especially useful when using the shaver wet).</li>
            <li>I am fair of face, and so don&#x27;t need much in the way of a razor, but the last razor I used did not come close to comparing to a manual razor.  </li>
            <li>it is worth it without one</li>
            <li>It is far more convenient to use.  </li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t  worth the price if there is no rebate.</li>
            <li>Affordable, effective and simple.</li>
            <li>Is worth purchasing, the price is</li>
            <li>ALthough this razor is an excellent piece of equipment all the way around, I am not happy with the shaving.  </li>
            <li>It fits comfortably in the hand, and has a rubber ridge that runs around the edge for added grip (especially useful when using the shaver wet).</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s well worth it.  </li>
            <li>it is a powerful razor, I like it.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth the trade-off.</li>
            <li>It is of high quality and easy to operate.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use with high quality.</li>
            <li>I like it very much, beautiful design, ship fast, I would like to get second one if I live in states</li>
            <li>I have found it is very important to clean regularly (about once a week works for me).  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too sure about the charging aspect when I first unpacked and set up my new razor.  </li>
            <li>Charges fast on a very useful station that suctions to the surface</li>
            <li>For dry shaving this razor is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Also, unlike older designs with a pop-up trimmer of limited usability due to its lack of clearance, on this shaver the trimmer just plugs into the top of the body as a replacement to the shaving heads, so the angle, clearance and visibility are perfect.  </li>
            <li>My other favorite features about this razor and the 8240 is how easy they are to clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a step back for electric shavers and there are far better products out there--products that perform better and are easier to charge and clean.</li>
            <li>the shaver is pretty good, but the single track heads miss a bunch of hairs and may take a while to cut.</li>
            <li>When I try,  the device kind of skids around my face abruptly instead of moving smoothly over it.</li>
            <li>It fits my smaller hands perfectly, and has 4 buttons on the body, comprising a main power on/off, travel lock indicator, battery low indicator, and charging indicator.  </li>
            <li>Pretty quick delivery, if I recall.</li>
            <li>I used it everyday, and I found that 1150 is very effective.</li>
            <li>Before this razor, the only way I could be sure to get my neck clean was with a manual safety</li>
            <li>It gives you a nice clean shave with minimal effort, and does not cause any sort of rash or irritation.  </li>
            <li>In person, it is not as vibrant blue as it appears online, and that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Shaves much closer than my old one and is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>He says that it gives a close shave, is comfortable to hold, easy to clean  and holds a charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li>To those who compare any electric to a blade - is this shaver as good as a sharp blade ?</li>
            <li>However, is this razor as good as any other electric I have tried ?  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and am very pleased with the comfortable shave that I get with the Metallic Blue Shaver.  </li>
            <li>And hope to the first time know。&lt;br /&gt;Thanks very  much!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned other electric shavers over the years and none of them have given me as good a shave as the Senso Touch 2d has.</li>
            <li>Makes my face break out with razor bump but works well other wise.</li>
            <li>I read other reviews and decided this would be a good one to get.</li>
            <li>and it sounds like it isn&#x27;t charged up as good as some of the other one&#x27;s</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good deal with low price and high quality.</li>
            <li>IT VERY MUCH HAVE USED NORELCO MOST OF MY LIFE ( AND I AM 87 YEARS OLD )  </li>
            <li>Do give it time before your skin adjusts and while you try to figure out the right pressure and shaving motions that suits your face.</li>
            <li>so now, i don&#x27;t even buy shaving cream any more....just shave in the shower and wash my face right after...get 2 things done at once.  </li>
            <li>but if you keep up with shaving it will cut right through with zero irritation.</li>
            <li>At around $80, the price is right.  </li>
            <li>i needed it for one hand shaving because i had surgery on my right hand it worked for this and shaved</li>
            <li>I have always trusted amazon to do the right thing.</li>
            <li>someone should make it right.</li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco 1150 Senso Touch 2d Electric Shaver is designed for men, it&#x27;s right to have one.</li>
            <li>Ordered this for my husband for his birthday (right after Xmas).  </li>
            <li>It looks like a lot of people have called the Philips Customer Service regarding this rebate, since the customer service representative guessed right away that I bought the shaver from Amazon.</li>
            <li>If A rebate is being offered on Amazon, Amazon or the manufacturer need to step up and do the right thing.</li>
            <li>+ the price was right.</li>
            <li>It did work right out of the box and give a close shave.</li>
            <li>One being that there&#x27;s no way to \\&quot;lock\\&quot; the head into place, so if you are an aggressive shaver you will eventually end up popping the head right off.  </li>
            <li>He is an electric shaver that runs right corner of the face to remove all the hair and does not damage the skin.</li>
            <li>The shave is clean and smooth and I like how much quieter this motor and the razor heads are than the older one.</li>
            <li>the manual razor is much quicker to clean.</li>
            <li>Within a few weeks your skin *will* acclimate and you&#x27;ll be able to get an accurate and close shave very quickly.     </li>
            <li>I recommend this shaver for anyone that wants a clean, close shave.</li>
            <li>I am wet shaving and my face feels the best it&#x27;s felt in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Highly</li>
            <li>/&gt;it didnt shave clean, and time to time beard stuck and hurt me really much that made me scare to shave at all with this&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Voice is very light,easy to use,shaving is clean.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really give u a clean shave at all.  </li>
            <li>One issue is that, you need to hold in one particular angle from skin to make a smooth painless hair removal</li>
            <li>First, for me, it does not shave better than the 7310, which is considerably cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I certainly would not have purchased this if I knew I would not receive the full mail-in</li>
            <li>I certainly would not have purchased this if I knew I would not receive the full discount.</li>
            <li>While this shaver is very easy on the skin, it doesn&#x27;t seem to get close enough.</li>
            <li>I have only shaved dry, but it did a very good job out of the gate.  </li>
            <li>but i really like the new Norelco better than any others I have tried over the years and</li>
            <li>I replaced an earlier version and the new one is easier to use and does a good job of getting all the whiskers.</li>
            <li>Shaving in the shower has been great and actually gives a better shave with just a little soap to make it glide over your face.</li>
            <li>The price on eBay was 20 less than the best local price.</li>
            <li>I wanted something that was light and had a head that was easy to replace, and which was not a big deal if it got wet.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave two stars is that the battery life seems to be more than adequate.</li>
            <li>A younger person may strongly perfer its streamlined, cobra-head styling, and light feel.  </li>
            <li>Charging is quick though and the charging cradle is simple, but elegant.</li>
            <li>The razor was the quietest one I&#x27;ve owned, it comes with a 45 day money back guarantee, and on top of all that it has a quick charge.  </li>
            <li>This razor doesn&#x27;t do as good a job at capturing longer hairs as my old one did (although the old electric was capable of taking a nip out of my lip if I got too close); if I have skipped a couple of days (gone camping) it really has difficulty making a clean sweep of my face.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic has more difficulty getting a clean shave on some parts of the neck and has a more annoying buzzing sound, but with a shave that is so superior</li>
            <li>The Panasonic has more difficulty getting a clean shave on some parts of the neck and has a more annoying buzzing sound, but with a shave that is so superior</li>
            <li>It works adequately and the battery last for many shaves,</li>
            <li>I cannot say if the higher models are worth the money, because I have not used them.</li>
            <li>not sure if they still make this or not, but for me it wasnt too great experience using this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very convinient and looks cool.</li>
            <li>I wish I could afford the Senso Touch 3D since it has a few more extra features, but this is a great alternative at this price.    </li>
            <li>the gift for daddy , good looking and cleaning by water directly is very useful for our travell  life, I wish the 1250 has the same decline price if it is possible</li>
            <li>It was easy to clean with just a quick rinse as long as you can keep the cats face out of it.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure using a  little lather would be even better.</li>
            <li>matter how soft or how hard you push, I did not get burn, the \\&quot;cushion\\&quot; in the floating heads adjusted for a great shave over all surfaces!  </li>
            <li>it gives me a very close shave (better than the old one when it was new) and is comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a work of art, and delivers an amazing dry shave.  </li>
            <li>He has been quite satisfied with it so far; it gives him a very close shave.</li>
            <li>And you can wash it easily and don&#x27;t need to change the head frequently.</li>
            <li>The included soft case makes it easy to transport</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cleaning and comfortable after used it, The shacer have Line Noise and very save electricity</li>
            <li>I returned this shaver under Norelco&#x27;s 45-day money back guarantee policy, and replaced it with a newer Panasonic ES8243A that shaves even closer and more comfortably than my older Panasonic that beat this Norelco.    </li>
            <li>The feel of the SensoTouch&#x27;s form-fitting grip in my hand, its quiet \\&quot;whirring\\&quot; sound, and fit of its  trimming heads to my neck and face are fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The trimmer actually trims sideburns nicely and straight, but (read CONS)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>1150x had just one tiny light that tells you that you are screwed if it light up.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product, a typical razor.</li>
            <li>It takes me significantly less time to get a good, close shave</li>
            <li>The 1140x works fairly well in this regard, but I wish I had my old razor back.  </li>
            <li>and I really have to give myself razor burn, even using gel, just to get a \\&quot;super smooth\\&quot; shave as they boast on their videos.</li>
            <li>This is a well engineered, well designed product, overall feel is good, clean shave and simple removal of head for cleaning.</li>
            <li>I have a Brawn and this shaver is not even half as good as the Brawn.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what manufacturer&#x27;s get by packing such a great product in such a messed up way.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I experienced some razor burn upon initial usage, but after the third or fourth time, the 1150X felt very comfortable.    </li>
            <li>cleaning is so easy, after the shave, just pop open the blade cover and run both parts under water...and its as clean as the first time you use it....</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my father and he seems like it very much</li>
            <li>Lectric shave also works very very well.  </li>
            <li>Lectric shave also works very very well.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend like it very much.</li>
            <li>.BE VERY VERY WARY.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li>It was very gentle though.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>And when I turned it on, the rotary blades didn&#x27;t seem to be turning very fast.</li>
            <li>Because it shaves very smooth and is very quiet.  </li>
            <li>Like it very much to my experience,&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>i like it very much.</li>
            <li>I would very much prefer it if they sold two or three shavers for each crowd, and did it well.</li>
            <li>It turns out he likes it very much.</li>
            <li>He like it very much</li>
            <li>like it very much.</li>
            <li>I bought at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>,everything is perfect~he like it very much</li>
            <li>Very reasonable product.</li>
            <li>The product is very light, and seems to be a bit fragile.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very fast and leaves no irritation at all.</li>
            <li>My dad and my family like it very much</li>
            <li>like it very much.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>It is a gift and my friend likes it very much.</li>
            <li>Logistics speed very fast.</li>
            <li>My father likes it very much.</li>
            <li>He likes it very much.</li>
            <li>My friend like it very much.</li>
            <li>very very good&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>He likes it very much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the charging speed is very fast.</li>
            <li>This is a step up from most of the other products out there without the huge price tag.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s fine for young people to use.</li>
            <li>My old Norelco was fine but wore out.  </li>
            <li>Claims it gives an excellent shave &amp; is very convenient to use anywhere &amp; wet or dry.</li>
            <li>Cleaning is pretty easy, it&#x27;s easy to open the main attachment, brush with the included cleaning brush and rinse.        </li>
            <li>I received this item new and in the original box.</li>
            <li>I found that I got a very close shave, but the razor was very time consuming to keep clean, if you followed Norelco&#x27;s suggested cleaning methods.  </li>
            <li>This does not give anywhere near the closeness of shave as many of my older models.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the price of blade shaving has been quite a bit higher because of the price of blades (it&#x27;s very much like color printers and ink), but one of the instructions on the Norelco box was to replace the shaving head once a year.</li>
            <li>Nice one, having a sense of high tech, I like the blue one.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>I am comfortable when I using it.50$ is very cheap,but its high quality can still be believed.</li>
            <li>I was also able to find a $30 instant coupon online which made the price very reasonable.</li>
            <li>We had a 15 year old Remington that I threw away thinking this &#x27;high tech&#x27; razor would be better</li>
            <li>This shaver is a handy little tool,and it&#x27;s so cheap to a shaver which has so much functions.</li>
            <li>When I first opened the packaging, I thought the head was flimsy.</li>
            <li>Evidently, the on/off switch was positioned for the places men shave.</li>
            <li>Norelco SensoTouch Razor 1150x may not have all the bells &amp; whistles compared to higher priced models.  </li>
            <li>Since I am a senior citizen, I have used many different wet/dry shavers in my lifetime.</li>
            <li>The 8240 had been my first rotary razor experience</li>
            <li>On the first day, I got the closest electric shave ever using the Norelco.  </li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>Overall, I have been pleased with this razor.  </li>
            <li>so it is a very saitable product to be a gift !</li>
            <li>I tried the Panasonic first and it ripped my hair out and irritated my skin.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t even buy it in the first place.</li>
            <li>I followed exactly all steps in submitting the rebate requests.  </li>
            <li>I first puchased a Norelco 7340XL razor and went to work with it.</li>
            <li>at first, i use this with shaving cream, but one time i used it with Nivea face wash for men, and to my surprise....</li>
            <li>This is my first electric razor ever.</li>
            <li>My first electric shaver was a corded Norelco 2-head razor, state of the art at the time.</li>
            <li>In summary, the Panasonic rated higher than the Norelco in all areas with the exception of the warranty.  </li>
            <li>shaving process itself feels smooth, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my face as much as my old one, but it also doesn&#x27;t shave as closely.  </li>
            <li>He shaves first thing in the morning with no pain.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is in the utilization of the separate trimer, I am sure that I will eventually it will be lost during trips.</li>
            <li>I bought this model and a braun 3 series the same day to see which I like better.</li>
            <li>Use a light circular motion and rinse the shaver frequently.</li>
            <li>At the same time, however, I&#x27;ve never been pleased with electric razors.  </li>
            <li>and it is still working as if it were the first day</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for from an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>First impression was,</li>
            <li>I first started with a Norelco razor when i was 17.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>First one I&#x27;ve owned that has come close to shaving like a blade.</li>
            <li>I traversed many times the neck to shave it properly.</li>
            <li>I wish, they would be more transperent in further promotions.</li>
            <li>That said, when used consistently, it works well, and aside from the first use (when i wasn&#x27;t used to it)</li>
            <li>FIRST YOU HAVE TO UNSNAP THE MECHANISM THAT HOLDS THE HEADS, THEN REMOVE EACH HEAD AND BRUSH THEM, THEN REPLACE THEM</li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased.</li>
            <li>I gave the Norelco 1150x/40 Senso Touch shaver to my son as a Christmas gift - he was so pleased with it that he requested the same shaver for his birthday.  </li>
            <li>Very efficient in shaving!  </li>
            <li>I found the shave to be most comparable with a regular stick when I use it in the shower.</li>
            <li>After years of using a Braun electric razor, and finding that it was mediocre at best, I took a gamble and decided to get the Philips Norelco 1150.  </li>
            <li>When I first received it from Amazon, I noticed that the rotary heads had just one ring of blades.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that would make it better is if it came with a case for when you travel.</li>
            <li>This is the first shaver I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I actually find it a bit more cumbersome to handle and am not all that fond of the charging cradle</li>
            <li>First, Norelco does not honor their rebates.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and exactly as shown.</li>
            <li>First electric</li>
            <li>I tried shaving for the first time....</li>
            <li>I have found it works very well for my use and the texture of my beard and skin!</li>
            <li>so I put it in a pretty Valentine&#x27;s bag</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>my first one bought by myself.</li>
            <li>The delievery time is more earlier than  my expection.  </li>
            <li>I was always sceptical about electric shavers since i used my first about 10 yrs ago.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect that, just because you aren&#x27;t using hot water and cream, you&#x27;ll be getting thru your morning shave faster than you would with a blade.</li>
            <li>$20 is ok, $50 is a BIG NO NO.</li>
            <li>I really love the fact that when it needs cleaning i can simply wash it.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s also my first purchase in Amazon.</li>
            <li>first shaver that my Dad bought me was a Phillips.  </li>
            <li>maybe, It is the one of the most famous shaver on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve known this stuff gives extra discount occasionally.</li>
            <li>The shaver- you can do better for the money, especially since the rebate was phony.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver for my husband for father&#x27;s day in hopes that it might get him to shave more than his standard once per week.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Finally received a postcard, first correspondence since Christmas 2011</li>
            <li>My most recent electric was purchased about 20 years ago, and it&#x27;s a Braun which is all I can compare to this Norelco 1150.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You would do better buying lottery tickets with your money as you might actually pick a winner.</li>
            <li>You still must go over the same area more than once and hold the skin taut in the area you are shaving, but not to the degree where it is a problem.</li>
            <li>First time, I was given a Remington as a gift, which looked like a Norelco..</li>

            <li>will be a lot more hands on with my selection the next time.</li>
            <li>$49, a big bargain.:-)  </li>
            <li>There were a couple of missed hairs on the neck and cheek, but the larger you make the circular motions, the better it shaves.  </li>
            <li>I tried shaving my face with it knowing that I have never been successful in the past with an electric shaver for my beard.  </li>
            <li>This was my first attempt at buying an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>the rebate&#x27;s been denied by the manufacturer; I see many others complaining about the same issue.  </li>
            <li>I bought this shaver for my frind, and he really loves it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed the 1090 and use it regularly whenever I use an electric shaver rather than a blade.</li>
            <li>Thanks again Amazon!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot more quiet</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had no problem with soap buildup on the foil since I make sure to briefly rinse it out after each shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning the shaver could not be easier, after each use you simply pull off the top plate of the shaver head and run water through it and the shaver head.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed the 1090 and use it regularly whenever I use an electric shaver rather than a blade.  </li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s at the point where the cost, year over year, is essentially even or better with this razor.    </li>
            <li>I will add more details a while later.</li>
            <li>REALLY!</li>
            <li>This is the first on I have bought in 15 years</li>
            <li>I like the ergonomics of the razor &amp; it shaves better under the jaw , but the shave doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>This is my first battery powered razor.  </li>
            <li>AT FIRST I WASN&#x27;T</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve always been well made and usually last for many years.</li>
            <li>On my first use of the 1150X, I was amazed with how well it followed the neck contours</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t stand to shell out enough for the newest top of the class, but I wanted to move up in the price/quality menu.  </li>
            <li>So I bought the top level of the last generation (senso touch 2D --</li>
            <li>After being married to her for 46 years I&#x27;m not going to fight with her now</li>
            <li>just take the razor head off and place the blades under running hot water for about 30 secs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The most recent shaver I had before the 1150x was a Norelco 8140XL which I bought close to five years ago.</li>
            <li>However, I think the 8140XL did a better job on my upper lip.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used batteries or electric shavers, razors only, but when I buy the Philips Norelco remain quite satisfied with the results</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning the shaver be easier, after each use you simply pull off the top plate of the shaver head and run water through it and the shaver head.</li>
            <li>(first a Remington, then a low-end Norelco, then the Norelco 1150X),</li>
            <li>This is my first time to may a shaver.</li>
            <li>This is the first electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned so take it with that</li>
            <li>first correspondence since Thanksgiving/Christmas 2011 - REBATE COULD NOT BE HONORED!!&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Manufacturer&#x27;s discounts taken at the cash register are not valid for rebate promotions..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Comfort: The SensoTouch offers a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>No expensive foils or assemblies to replace.</li>
            <li>I was concerned that the charge life being shorter with this model might be a disadvantage, but I&#x27;ve been going on the first charge for over a month.  </li>
            <li>I cleaned theold one manually for many years, It&#x27;s not that big</li>
            <li>Battery lasts long enough to leave the charger at home while weekend/business traveling, but is also 110/220 great when leaving the states.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty close shave as well...</li>
            <li>You can buy the higher level models and pay the higher prices</li>
            <li>a rotary blade Norelco has a sort of money-back guarantee deal in the event that it doesn&#x27;t do the job for you, so there&#x27;s no reason not to be confident in the machine&#x27;s ability to dominate your facial hairs.   </li>
            <li>but so far its gone a month without the charge light coming on.    </li>
            <li>For the first time in the Amazon shopping  </li>
            <li>I received this e. razor as a gift and on first use it screwed up my skin.</li>
            <li>I hope to have more such preferential activities.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I have returned this unit for a higher end Norelco.</li>
            <li>It gives a very close shave, it is quiet and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>but I bought my first electric shaver in a pinch at an Army PX store.</li>
            <li>and I have had more razor burn from it than with a simple disposable razor.</li>
            <li>the first person I spoke with didn&#x27;t comprehend anything)  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Have always shaved and this is my husband&#x27;s first electric.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time to buy a electronic razor, my transitional razor worked better for me actually.</li>
            <li>Also, the package looks pretty, said by mum.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and gives the closest shave I&#x27;ve gotten in a long time from an electic model.</li>
            <li>I have used a Norelco triple head shaver for the last 20 years, had many units and replaced the cutters</li>
            <li>A $10 Mach razor is much better and faster, The only thing you get with this razor is the ability to shave on the go but trust me everyone will know.</li>
            <li>My husband used it first</li>
            <li>Go to get a higher end model or Braun.</li>
            <li>Cool blue color and smooth, soft-touch</li>
            <li>and this is my first electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>do not have a higher rating</li>
            <li>My overall feeling is that the unit does an ok job.</li>
            <li>This is actually my first of many before that i finally like it at all !!!</li>
            <li>The first day the plastic shaver head cover broke when I removed it to shave.  </li>
            <li>maybe next Christmas I will buy an even better one, after this first trail.</li>
            <li>but it still is pretty.</li>
            <li>SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver is so good ,my father used it everyday.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never used an electric shaver, or if you haven&#x27;t used one in a while, you have to use it for a few weeks before you start getting good results.</li>
            <li>,it works good, and i use it everyday.  </li>
            <li>Looking for a good replacement, I thought this would do the job and get those spots the Remington had been missing.</li>
            <li>I have used many, many norelco razors that have the conventional look and they have all given closer shaves than this new style.  </li>
            <li>Very surprised by the clean shave I get, even without using a pre-shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving since 1955, and have had everything from an Eversharp Shick Electric Razor to the first two-rotor blade Norelco to a Panasonic that was a wet/dry (which sounds like a vacuum cleaner in more ways than one).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really liked, and used, Braun shavers for decades, but this Norelco shaver is my new standard.</li>
            <li>I gave myself a smooth, quick and almost silent shave.</li>
            <li>the older models do, when you take the screen off to clean, everything falls apart, a real pain.</li>
            <li>It runs very quietly and feels super smooth on the skin.  </li>
            <li>this shaver is brilliant in my books lets you use it wet or dry .</li>
            <li>Not as close a shave as my previous experience with Reming ton and Braun, however it is certainly more comfortable.</li>
            <li>And against my face, the razor just glided across, without the familiar pulling action and grinding sound that I had with my old Braun.  </li>
            <li>Bigger suction cups would be good, but in a bathroom where there is powder and other things that get on the counter, I wouldn&#x27;t leave it out providing I have a drawer that can take a razor that is light</li>
            <li>Bigger suction cups would be good, but in a bathroom where there is powder and other things that get on the counter, I wouldn&#x27;t leave it out providing I have a drawer that can take a razor that is light</li>
            <li>Use it until you feel it begin to shave differently or tug lately, then charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, ok beginner, but that wasn&#x27;t what I thought I was buying, thought this was an advanced model I would used for a long time and get a great deal, neither were true.  </li>
            <li>When I saw this online and found out you could use a shave cream with it, I figured spending a little bit more would be worth it, and boy was I right!</li>
            <li>It is very good with them, that is a little bit big noise.</li>
            <li>With the 8140XL, you just pop the top which is on a hinge, empty any excess hair into the wastebasket, rinse the whole thing under warm water, and close it back.</li>
            <li>It looks very professional and cool.</li>
            <li>Even though it says you have to wait really 21 days to see good results, so far in the 3rd day I am getting a really good-smooth shave.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no significant deficiency with this razor, but it didn&#x27;t offer a noticeably improved, more comfortable shave either.  </li>
            <li>Now I know that user manual said that it is normal to feel skin irritation upto 21 days of normal use, but I wasn&#x27;t satisfied by the fact that the shaving time equaled or exceeded the time required to shave when I am using a normal razor.   </li>
            <li>The battery died on my 8 year old Norelco, and it had the original heads.  </li>
            <li>Nice unit, sleek, no buttons or other items to fill with debris.</li>
            <li>I have veary sensitive skin and was so excited when I purchased the 2D.  </li>
            <li>It has a sleek design , nice looking, but other than that</li>
            <li>I bought this product a week ago , unlike other chinese products this is very good product, functions well and lasts long  very long on battery and easy to operate and very fast and clean ,smooth finish shave/ trim.</li>
            <li>Feel clean and soft when shaving.</li>
            <li>&gt;* easier to keep the handle clean since there are far fewer seams and ridges</li>
            <li>This particular shaver is worth about 20 dollars.</li>
            <li>the price is appropriated。&lt;br /&gt;this item can shave clean than the old one。&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do believe it is splashproof while cleaning in the basin, but I don&#x27;t think it would be wise to use it constantly in water such as in the shower, but not 100% on that.  </li>
            <li>Company is giving 50 days money back guarantee i would like to return the product and get back my money which i think is wise as i am unsatisfied with the performance.   </li>
            <li>I have stopped using it because of is low performance when compared to the cheapest available in markets which are worth putting the money as they perform well balanced with investment.  </li>
            <li>After using the shaver, its ok but not worth the full price.</li>
            <li>It actually gives me an OK shave, and is very convenient for travel, airports, and end of day touch-ups.  </li>
            <li>As for the razor itself, it has done a nice job for me - not perfect, but nice.</li>
            <li>Yeah, it looks stylish, and it charges fast if necessary</li>
            <li>I keep my head shaved everyday, and this shaver is so good that you can get a very close shave for even your head.</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t the most expensive model, but it was good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried wet shaving with cream a few times, and it was awesome, but</li>
            <li>It works quietly, efficiently, and almost as good as a regular razor shave.  </li>
            <li>I visited my local Target and fell in love with the look of this razor and the fact that replacement blades were much cheaper than Braun&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>The flex head design works very well fitting facial and neck contours and leaves a close shave.  </li>
            <li>Nice soft grip and is very quiet.</li>
            <li>well we are in China, a place that everything advanced are marked in high price!</li>
            <li>It was very easy on the skin with minimal irritation .</li>
            <li>For the price and for the sweet sexy design of this electric razor, I really thought this would massively out perform the 4 year old plug in electric I was using.</li>
            <li>razor seems to get very, very close without even the benefit of soap or shaving cream, which is really nice!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>very good.it&#x27;s beautiful.thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Very cheap very affordableThe 1150  not has an LED display that shows you how much time is left before recharging</li>
            <li>so you have to spend about 5-7 minutes extra to clean it after each use!  </li>
            <li>I have a fairly light beard with fine hairs plus my skin is not overly sensitive so some one else might get different results than I did.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shaving with the SensoTouch is kind of odd at first.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Shaving with the SensoTouch is kind of odd at first.</li>
            <li>I replaced it with a Norelco because of the brand name and the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>was looking forward to this shaver after seeing all the positive reviews which are now suspect in my mind.</li>
            <li>For some reason I don&#x27;t do particularly well shaving with this thing right after washing and drying my face.</li>
            <li>I shaved with the SensoTouch for the first time yesterday and it did the whole job in about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>The 1150 is a compromise, but unless you really need the detail trimmer give the entry level units a try first.    </li>
            <li>Charging can then be used for a long time, love.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I am not an Electric Razor expert as some of the other reviewers seem to be, however I do know when I have had a smooth, comfortable, close shave.</li>
            <li>at first it was on back order, but within days it became available, and the shipment was fast, my husband likes it!</li>
            <li>the battery charge lasts a long time thru more than 15 shaves.   </li>
            <li>This is a first electric shaver in my whole life.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first real quality shaver I got.</li>
            <li>In my country,this kind of things sold  very  expensive,including other commodities like watchs, powdered milk,and so on.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and maintain (compared to other models that come with jet-clean and shaving capsules and</li>
            <li>love it, and wish it can be used for long time.</li>
            <li>I have used Norelco shavers in the past 10 years and they are all good.</li>
            <li>The noise is very small, shaving very clean, face feel very comfortable</li>
            <li>Works great, clean shave, quite, cuts close, can&#x27;t go wrong with this flex head shaver, grat price and quality</li>
            <li>I do like Norelco, and have purchased a pretty standard Norelco rechargeable at about half the cost - and am once again happy.</li>
            <li>did better for first few weeks but quickly ran out of gas.</li>
            <li>Sometimes i have to use the side-burn trimmer real quick to get it short enough for the regular razor to be effective.  </li>
            <li>if amazon is offering a coupon without a rebate by all means take advantage of the item, but if there is a rebate attached to the item as well, make sure its says you can stack both before using both you basically have to choose 1 or the other for most items and specially for phillips/norelco items, after calling and giving them a good piece of my mind for what i believe is false advertising on amazon&#x27;s and phillips part they are sending me a 15% off coupon for future purchases, so again buyer beware...</li>
            <li>I have a good bit of fun shaving my husbands face just because the shaving element was so sharp and it totally rocked as a close shave.  </li>
            <li>The multi angle head and unique shape does not provide a close shave and requires many strokes covering the same area to finally get the job done.  </li>
            <li>But after scoping out the hassle of installing a new battery and the cost of replacement heads, I decided it wasn&#x27;t worth refurbishing.  </li>
            <li>It shaves smooth the first time, and is very quiet.  </li>
            <li>razor works great for my problems and its allot quieter and charges quicker than the old norelco shavers I had in the past.</li>
            <li>its better then the dry ones and has a realy close shave.</li>
            <li>I get a very decent shave out of it</li>
            <li>I liked the previous model, I like this one.</li>
            <li>The higher end shavers might do better with floating heads or multi-pivot as opposed to the two-dimensional pivot of the heads on this razor.  </li>
            <li>The shave itself is pretty smooth but only if you use the cream.</li>
            <li>he is a marine and very particular about his appearance.    </li>
            <li>The replacement heads are easy to find and my local store has plenty of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>that  are easy to insert into the back of the razor, the SensoTouch 1150x Electric Shaver does not come so equipped.  </li>
            <li>So the search continues...5 lotion packs by Nivea that  are easy to insert into the back of the razor, the SensoTouch 1150x Electric Shaver does not come so equipped.  </li>
            <li>have purchased several Norelco Shavers over the last thirty years and was always very satisfied.</li>
            <li>The razors inside triple head easily and often fall out if opened or dropped accidentally and within several weeks</li>
            <li>It can be used as a dry shaver but Use it with shaving cream for better results.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Battery holds strong for short travel without need for packing in the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are very easy to use and much more economical than disposable razors and their expensive refills.</li>
            <li>It does ok, so if you&#x27;re able to get it for $20 or less for a first electric, it might be ok as it would be more gentle as your skin gets used to it, but not good overall.  </li>
            <li>The shaver itself feels good but has two design quirks: it flops to the side when you set it down; and the charging cord cannot be plugged directly into the device</li>
            <li>The only way I found to do it was sitting at my desk with a bright light and using a set of picks tiny enough to fit between the individual blades and</li>
            <li>It certainly is a keeper (10 yrs?)</li>
            <li>Purchased the Philips SensoTouch Electric Shaver largely in part because of the $30 Rebate Promotion..</li>
            <li>It certainly isn&#x27;t as close of a shave as a non-electric razor, but of course you wouldn&#x27;t expect it to be.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Purchased the Philips SensoTouch Electric Shaver largely in part because of the $30 Rebate Promotion..</li>
            <li>face  twice weekly with a blade because the shaver just couldn&#x27;t get to certain spots.  </li>
            <li>When a more intense cleaning is needed you can disassemble the entire shaver assembly and clean out each rotary blade individually with the included brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When a more intense cleaning is needed you can disassemble the entire shaver assembly and clean out each rotary blade individually with the included brush  All in all...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving and waxing my legs for a few years (never you mind how many!)</li>
            <li>You have to like totally get this is the right spot and sweet spot on your face.  </li>
            <li>Went to Wal-Mart and purchased a Remington rotary electric razor for half the cost of the Senso Touch which is smooth and comfortable.</li>
            <li>The sound is slight and it is comfortable for my face.</li>
            <li>It shaves wet or dry and does a great job either way.</li>
            <li>Shaves great dry or wet</li>
            <li>long lasting battery life without recharging it- easy to clean!</li>
            <li>There were a couple of points where I thought the design fell a little short, but they&#x27;re small enough that I don&#x27;t think it would be fair to ding the rating of this otherwise excellent shaver by a star:  </li>
            <li>I first tried the 1150 dry,and I was surprised that with several days growth..I was able to get a reasonably close shave..</li>
            <li>I probably have light growing facial hair but the the first charge lasted me an entire month before the battery charge warning light started to blink.  </li>
            <li>While other brands seem to work better for some people, the Norelcos I&#x27;ve used have been far superior compared to any of the other brands I have tried.  </li>
            <li>For emergencies, this is a fine product, but don&#x27;t expect it to replace your daily razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband likes the razor fine, but we only purchased the item because of a promised $30 rebate.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of electric shavers, I find them to provide a less than perfect shave - leaving blotches of hair and not being close enough, this electric shaver, however, is in my opinion the closest you can get to a razor shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i have old NORELCO electric shaver for many many years and just about few month ago it did not hold the charge,  but still works great,so i got new one</li>
            <li>the old one seems to have higher RPMs !&lt;</li>
            <li>In addition it is much more fun to shave with than the scary de razor; I have now decided to discard my de razor, brush, and soap; I will not be needing those anymore now that I have this more up to date form of shaving; shaving my face dry is a simpler,  more convinient way to shave.</li>
            <li>The Phillips Norelco Sensotouch (expensive shaver) is very good, however, will not purchase another from Phillips unless I can confirm they include a carry case.</li>
            <li>First, because the shaving heads are mounted on a deported piece with a narrow neck, it&#x27;s very easy to see what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li>This is my fifth Norelco razor and I have been happy with all of them, but I would like the blades to last a little longer.</li>
            <li>If you really want an electric razor, stay away from this one--get a decent quality cheaper one or go elsewhere!    </li>
            <li>I would spen a little more money next time on a better razor.</li>
            <li>At this point, I should mention that I&#x27;ve had a beard much of my adult life and so usually shave only my cheeks and my neck, with is both the most sensitive area and the hardest place to get a clean shave with any kind of razor.    </li>
            <li>Have had great success with this shaver, it hasn&#x27;t completely eliminated my use of a straight razor (I have a tough beard) but it using it in combination with my straight razor, I don&#x27;t go through blades as often.</li>
            <li>I have used Norelco shavers for several years and have found them all very durable and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>The Norelco 1150x/40 is very quiet and smooth and you don&#x27;t really feel the vibrations.  </li>
            <li>After using this razor for six months, my initial impressions were confirmed--it&#x27;s flimsy, cheaply made, and doesn&#x27;t shave very well--with or without shaving cream.</li>
            <li>The one I bought for my father was at the same amazing price but also was supposeto give a $30 rebate back.  </li>
            <li>Is really fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li>I was really upset with this choice.</li>
            <li>sleek and modern looking.  </li>
            <li>The razor glided very well and gave me the smoothest shave I have ever had with an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>It causes some irritation especially in the neck area and its a bit longer to give a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>It cuts a 3-day beard much faster and cleaner than any shaver that I have ever used before.</li>
            <li>Very nice,I like it.</li>
            <li>Quiet when turned on, the heads seem to float over the skin with an extremely light touch that he enjoys - all with NO pulling or snagging of whiskers or skin.</li>
            <li>I really wanted something I could use in the shower and at the price point I was looking at(I</li>
            <li>it gives a very close shave</li>
            <li>Charging is fast</li>
            <li>The 1150 is a compromise, but unless you really need the detail trimmer give the entry level units</li>
            <li>and he absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>I find it to be both comfortable and quiet.  </li>
            <li>Recommended for teenagers with a hint of stubble on their cheeks, but not for men who need a real shaver.    </li>
            <li>It shaves my face very close and no pulling of the beard like my Remington rotary electric does!Admittedly the Remington cost $35.00 and the Norelco $100.00  </li>
            <li>It is much louder than the Norelco but</li>
            <li>not so much so that I would return it.  </li>
            <li>The shaver is very comfotable to use.</li>
            <li>I used this for about three weeks straight before I was in a hurry one morning</li>
            <li>This shaver gets my face smooth in only 2 traffic lights.      </li>
            <li>This thing just works and for twenty bucks after rebate, you can&#x27;t complain much.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I bought this one because of the updated design, and I thought the price was reasonable.  </li>
            <li>My experience with this razor is that it doesn&#x27;t really shave that close without spending quite a bit of time.  </li>
            <li>but it also works very well</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t want to use as much water in the shower or shaving.  </li>
            <li>Is this really an upgrade?</li>
            <li>heck this may not be much of a difference of a shave.  </li>
            <li>Using the circular pattern (with and against the grain) with this or any Norelco shaver really gives on a close shave.</li>
            <li>This razor is still performing very well.</li>
            <li>This razor is still performing very well.</li>
            <li>Iam now 57 and have used Norelco razors the whole time.</li>
            <li>letter from company refusing it for it didnot apply to the product which I thought was very odd.jay</li>
            <li>Bought this razor thinking it would be a close and comfortable shave, but it was no different than my $20 corded philips razor.</li>
            <li>It was very circular with infinite pastabilities.</li>
            <li>very goog</li>
            <li>(The cheap Norelco razors are like chainsaws-spend the extra).  </li>
            <li>It removes the hair from my face very well which is it&#x27;s core function.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It worked better when wet w shaving cream but still by 12 o clock</li>
            <li>And the deal breaker was that the spinning motion seemed to really irritate my skin and cause razor burn</li>
            <li>I bought is for trial but kept it after product worked better than i expected.</li>
            <li>Thanks Phillips for the non existing customer service.</li>
            <li>It takes forever to shave your whole face and even with wetting the face I would get shaver irritation on my skin.</li>
            <li>It does a closer shave and is much quicker.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really had any razor burn issues.  </li>
            <li>I spent the better part of a hour looking for the bits and never did find them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>* always found them to be very Customer</li>
            <li>off was NEITHER unusual nor a Windfall (as Norelco claims).  </li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li>guess it depends on how close a shave you want and how much you want to spend.</li>
            <li>Normally, I need to use the trimmer first to get to a point I don&#x27;t feel like things are being yanked from my face.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t add anything to those that reviewed this before me (their reviews were the reason I bought it).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so fast to me from amazon  </li>
            <li>I really like it  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>At this point, I think the Amazon.com service is really beyond discussion.</li>
            <li>This razor really works.</li>
            <li>the modeling of the shaver is fashion too,I very like this product.</li>
            <li>very convenient , my christmas gifts .lol~~</li>
            <li>It really does require a 3-4 week break-in period for your face and beard to adjust, just as the directions say.  </li>
            <li>However, because the battery works for three weeks, it&#x27;s not that much of a problem.</li>
            <li>Really this product is a 1 star for me</li>
            <li>but I gave it 2 because I really didn&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco Senso Touch electric shaver is very nice,so clean,so cheap,i like it</li>
            <li>(Thanks for Dragon Sam&#x27;s help )</li>
            <li>Thanks for fixing this problem.</li>
            <li>I really do like that this is a wet/dry razor that can be used with shave creams and in the shower.</li>
            <li>So Thanks to amazon for the coupons and Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li>It will leave you smooth, but it has the feel of brushing your teeth - going over the same area again and again.</li>
            <li>I bought this product during Thanks Giving</li>
            <li>when I get it,I am shockedIt is too beautiful,it is a gift for my friend,he is very satisfaction,thank you,amazon...</li>
            <li>I was worried about skin irritation and battery not so much as close shave.  </li>
            <li>I have to say that it gives a really close shave.</li>
            <li>It would beep when to much whiskers were built up in the head and needed cleaning.</li>
            <li>ive had the shaver is quiet and light.</li>
            <li>These are the ones that make it look as though you should be getting a haircut way before you really need</li>
            <li>and I very like it.</li>
            <li>The gel helps the razor get much closer</li>
            <li>and the shave is much smoother.</li>
            <li>Be detailed and specific.</li>
            <li>I tried a wet shave, and it was better than a blade.  </li>
            <li>fast shipment.</li>
            <li>my dad like it so much.</li>
            <li>, his wife appreciated my gift for his hus.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap enough  </li>
            <li>This one is quite reasonable for it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li>Now I really regret that I throw away my $20 junk shaver.  </li>
            <li>I like this electric razor,the battery life of a razor very power and  met my expectations.</li>
            <li>So far as what my hubby says it does its job and worth the money.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>I like the blue color and smooth appearance.</li>
            <li>My father is very like it.</li>
            <li>Since this one has a 2D pivot and tilt capability it shaves real close without discomfort.</li>
            <li>I received my Norelco Shaver in two days and the product performs better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>1150X can shave off Beards fast and well.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t have much effect at all on his neck hair.</li>
            <li>but after a couple of years and head replacements I didn&#x27;t want to spend so much money again.</li>
            <li>I upgraded to this one and not only is it cleaner, its an extremely smooth shave.</li>
            <li>overall, it was worth it to me to upgrade especially since the 7340XL gave me many reliable years of service</li>
            <li>I REALLY wanted to like this electric razor.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it&lt;br</li>
            <li>that’s what this one’s suppose to be capable of doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much cheaper for a company to just make it removable rather than</li>
            <li>NOPE  just a man who wants to help someone learn from my mistakes</li>
            <li>The shaving head does not cut very well.</li>
            <li>Very noisy.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>shaver is very disapointing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Makes me very distrustful of the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>i bought this elcetic shaver for my husband, when he got it,he was very pleased,it let him fondle admiringly.</li>
            <li>It gives a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>and he says it gives him a real close shave.</li>
            <li>I got this razor at a quite reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Just expected it to be more efficient.</li>
            <li>It shaves close and it does it fast.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Takes longer than a straight shave, but that&#x27;s to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like its appearance and performance as described.</li>
            <li>I really recommend it</li>
            <li>The shaver head pivots smoothly in all directions, and the three shaving heads pivot individually as well.  </li>
            <li>The shaver head pivots smoothly in all directions, and the three shaving heads pivot individually as well.  </li>
            <li>One place where this shaver does not work very well at all, is the neck.  </li>
            <li>One comparison I can make is with the much lower priced (~$40) 7310 / 7310XL razors also from Norelco.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve already have one，just bought it for my father，it&#x27;s really good，except one corner of the box was ruined by express</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work very well unless you use the cream that comes with it.  </li>
            <li>REALLY</li>
            <li>and it seems like they really improved the electric shave.    </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s convient and quiet and gives a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>Flick on the power switch, and you&#x27;re ready to go.  </li>
            <li>The 2D is terrific, it&#x27;s smooth, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my face/neck irritated.  </li>
            <li>so the Norelco 1150X/40 really does save the day..</li>
            <li>It is fairly quiet and smooth to use.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite things about the razor is how long the charge lasts - I shave daily and one full charge lasts me around 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li>I have to shave in all directions to get all(most) of the hairs cut, but when it does cut them it is very close.</li>
            <li>They way they pivot really does not contour to you face.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t trim my hair well at all.</li>
            <li>For the price, I expected better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving for about 20 years, and using an electric razor the whole time.</li>
            <li>Love that this will shave with a wet face.  </li>
            <li>very much!but</li>
            <li>it really wasn&#x27;t trimming, you don&#x27;t even feel it.    </li>
            <li>but this thing does the job very well.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really think of any pros.  </li>
            <li>The shaver head pivots smoothly in all directions, and the three shaving heads pivot individually as well.</li>
            <li>but  only  can  buy  one in the cheap price</li>
            <li>this was a gift for my friend, he loves the 1150 because he feels the shaver works gently</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much easier just to pack a cord.</li>
            <li>Although the shave doesn&#x27;t feel quite as close as my old Braun Series 5,the difference is negligible, and the SensoTouch wins in terms of comfort, ease, and cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As well, in order to hook the charging cable to the cradle, you really need to jam it into the port.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really disappointing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just stay away from Philips and you&#x27;ll be much happier in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is where the my real issue is.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been waiting on the low battery light to come on . . . .</li>
            <li>The head of the razor came apart, springs and all, and I had no choice but to toss the whole thing into the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works well enough and easy enough that my son stays clean shaven--a requirement for his school.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very good&lt;</li>
            <li>very close to a razor except this doesn&#x27;t irritate my face like a razor.</li>
            <li>and everything is ready to go again.  </li>
            <li>With the charger, it does not take up much space.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>This whole \\&quot;2d, 3d senso touch\\</li>
            <li>I think they really do shave just as well as a blade.  </li>
            <li>It charges fast as well.  </li>
            <li>the suction cups don&#x27;t want to stick to it very well</li>
            <li>it’s very nice！I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much space so the station takes up too much room.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>I always use blade as I prefer a much cleaner shave.</li>
            <li>I would recommend scissors and a straight razor before I would recommend this garbage.</li>
            <li>very good。</li>
            <li>THANKS AMAZON:    </li>
            <li>I expected to get more than 1 year of use.</li>
            <li>,it is very good.it is the one i want.</li>
            <li>Never seemed to get a very close shave</li>
            <li>, modern look&lt;br</li>
            <li>afterwards)&lt;br /&gt;+ nice and intuitive indicator lights (telling you if the battery is low, if the device is charging properly, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;+ seems to be very water resistant</li>
            <li>Now this is a real improvement.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be using my Norelco since I have found a shaver that really works and meets all my needs.  </li>
            <li>It does not shave3 very well and</li>
            <li>It glides really well and doesn&#x27;t keep pulling your hair.</li>
            <li>I have to shave in all directions to get all(most) of the hairs cut, but when it does cut them it is very close.  </li>
            <li>But, well.... the shaving not so much.</li>
            <li>Scratchy&amp;#34; - really, the closeness that I&#x27;ve achieved with the comparably priced Panasonic mid-level razor was no contest.</li>
            <li>Scratchy&amp;#34; - really, the closeness that I&#x27;ve achieved with the comparably priced Panasonic mid-level razor was no contest.</li>
            <li>it is fast and close.  </li>
            <li>Service is also very good。&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very eacy to use.</li>
            <li>It is a very high-quality product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s SOOOOO much cheaper compare with mainland China.</li>
            <li>Really a high-tech capable razor.  </li>
            <li>really like。Well</li>
            <li>, I really</li>
            <li>I have tried everything, from safety razors to straight razors.</li>
            <li>I really like this razor, really well.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>very much!&lt;br</li>
            <li>hahaha...</li>
            <li>and as is written it is really marvels</li>
            <li>Wifey didn&#x27;t like that much.</li>
            <li>very convenient to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and he had to finish up with his foam and straight razor each day.</li>
            <li>said Philips Norelco is very usefull and he like it.</li>
            <li>it finall started operating it sounded  very noiy</li>
            <li>, the price is much lower than BESTBUY.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really seem like it cuts</li>
            <li>packaging is the old timing cut your hand before you open type that most manufacturers have abandoned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone as far as to experiment with having my face waxed, but the sample site explored was enough to convince me that I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;m not going to ever endure the indignity of a bikini</li>
            <li>I was genuinely surprised, thinking that it would be a mediocre shaver at best.  </li>
            <li>I was genuinely surprised, thinking that it would be a mediocre shaver at best.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned at least 5 different electric razors and this is the best one I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>This razor is similar to my old one in closeness of shave and because I can&#x27;t use it if I wait more than a day between shaves.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer being an extra piece is not a problem, and it does a much better job than the pop up one from the old razor.  </li>
            <li>I bought this one last year (January 2012) from Amazon as a present for myself, since it looked like a neat design and had features which I liked.  </li>
            <li>I wish they had been more clear in telling you the only way to charge it is using the stand.</li>
            <li>He like the new shaver very much.  </li>
            <li>Strong buy recommendation especially for the price - not sure how much better higher end, higher priced models could be</li>
            <li>Have used a Norelco Spectra 8894xl  for years bought new when it was first offered.</li>
            <li>My husband was pleased, enjoyed for about 5 months, very clean shave, charging enough for a few weeks, despite the fact that my husband shave every other day.</li>
            <li>The soft pouch is not as nice as the carrying case included with other models</li>
            <li>The battery is not user-replaceable and will limit the unit&#x27;s life  -- Does not include the jet cleaning system  -- The soft pouch is not as nice as the carrying case included with other models    </li>
            <li>If you happen to have to shave everyday like most military then this thing is perfect, no more replacing razor blades or forgetting to buy any</li>
            <li>/&gt;Those who want the Jet Clean system should try the 1250, as long as they are willing to pay the premium and don&#x27;t mind the hassle and expense of changing the fluid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Phillip does a nice clean shave every time and doesn&#x27;t leave any hair behind.</li>
            <li>It is a gift to my uncle, he looks quite like this razor, at least his face is more clean than before.</li>
            <li>I purchased this razor after having other Norelco razors and found it did a better job of shaving,(closer shave) than others I have bought.</li>
            <li>Like I said, I&#x27;m not willing to spend much more than $100 on a razor.  </li>
            <li>would I trust them again when we have so many other alternatives?&lt;br /&gt;Zero</li>
            <li>Maybe mine is more contoured than other guys&#x27; necks, but I tried a couple times and just started using a razor.</li>
            <li>Original Holland, work relatively well.</li>
            <li>better than other razor I used.</li>
            <li>Other Norelco&#x27;s I&#x27;ve owned are better with longer hair and with the neck / problem areas.</li>
            <li>This may be due to the curved shaving heads that seems to follow the contours with more efficieny.</li>
            <li>With a better electric razor I don&#x27;t have to shave but every other day.</li>
            <li>This may be due to the curved shaving heads that seems to follow the contours with more efficieny.  </li>
            <li>Better than other razor I used.</li>
            <li>Reading the Amazon forum on this, I can see that this happened to many other people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They were better than the other brands</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I got this, but it&#x27;s been a total letdown from the beginning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got this razor at a reasonable price, and my father likes it very much and replaced the old one.</li>
            <li>Maybe the jet clean system offered on the other models is worth the money, but I really didn&#x27;t want an appliance on my bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li>Again, very minor and it swaps out quite easily.  </li>
            <li>The wet and dry shave were ok, but not as smooth as one would expect for a product at this cost.</li>
            <li>I agree that it&#x27;s not a blade, but it&#x27;s close enough, and I get a clean shave in about 45 seconds.  </li>
            <li>, I think (though, the scientist in me wants to conduct an experiment doing both legs, equal amount of passes with each razor to be truely unbiased...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually pretty generous here with stars, but I expect more from a company like Norelco, so maybe I&#x27;m being a touch harsh.  </li>
            <li>I was using an older Norelco for a number of years and this one is definetly much improved.</li>
            <li>This is great and the price is unbelievable low.</li>
            <li>The product falls apart when you attempt to clean it, and cannot be put back together correctly.  </li>
            <li>even I forgot to clean it and left it there for a week.</li>
            <li>I was thankful it did not come with the massive Jet Clean charger/cleaner system.</li>
            <li>Great little razor gets close shave, battery lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>Then it is not only useful but also very cheep!</li>
            <li>In the future include an indicator to show how much time or power is remaining for a shave after a full charge.</li>
            <li>It takes only minutes to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li>I noticed much more irritation than I&#x27;m used to, especially on dry.</li>
            <li>It is not powerful enough to do a good job.  </li>
            <li>husband liked this so much, we purchased a second one for his brother, a stroke victim.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the 3D is all sorts of amazing, but I&#x27;m not super obsessed with getting the most super close shave possible.  </li>
            <li>The Norelco is more comfortable, and there&#x27;s a irresistible urge to go over and over the same spots, especially now that it&#x27;s almost silent.</li>
            <li>The Norelco is more comfortable, and there&#x27;s a irresistible urge to go over and over the same spots, especially now that it&#x27;s almost silent.</li>
            <li>really had high hopes for this</li>
            <li>I want to go back to the old as it was tried and true!  </li>
            <li>When a more intense cleaning is needed you can disassemble the entire shaver assembly and clean out each rotary blade individually with the included brush (I actually throw the blades and heads into the dishwasher on a sanitize cycle to get them extra clean).    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard &#x27;Thank you for the new razor&#x27; several times each day, making this a fantastic gift in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you very much special sales, and hope that the next $ 49 the opportunity to come again</li>
            <li>The high end for Norelco seems to top out around $200, but I&#x27;m not willing to spend that on a razor...</li>
            <li>I have almost 2 years using this product and let me tell you that is good both dry and wet.</li>
            <li>Looks good and compact charger, charges quickly (less then 2 hours) then last for days of shaving.</li>
            <li>Good close shave every time both wet and dry.</li>
            <li>would make a great gift for a new shaver, long time shaver, male of female, in my opinion!</li>
            <li>Smooth, close shave and the battery has lasted a long time...</li>
            <li>They advised a 3 week break in period to get your skin accustomed to this razor but from the first shave I did not have any rash or discomfort just a smooth extremely close shave.</li>
            <li>It almost doesn&#x27;t work at all for dry shaves, does much better with foam/creme, but still not very close or clean.</li>
            <li>The primary downside of the Philips-Norelco is that shaving takes about 3x as long as with my Fusion razor.  </li>
            <li>and amazon i believe knew that phillips would not honor those rebates in the first place because the form clearly states you cannot combine deals, so</li>
            <li>very satisfied with the battery, lasted for a month at least.</li>
            <li>, the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a five was because nothing is perfect, not too sure about the charging base and the suction</li>
            <li>It has a quick-charge feature which is only 3 minutes, and a full charge in 40 minutes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 45, been shaving for ages now, and I have to say, of all the razors I&#x27;ve owned that are of an electric model, this one is the first one to do the complete job.  </li>
            <li>The rechargeable battery here is a much-appreciated Lithium-Ion, which can hold a full charge for 40 minutes of continuous shaving, or about a dozen overall shaves.    </li>
            <li>when I realized, life is good when things are simple rather those so many so called features failed against the olders products.    </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many minutes on average</li>
            <li>Shaver is good but must go over face several times and pull skin  tight.</li>
            <li>: The 1150 is considerably less exepensive without taking any special offers or discounts that may become available into account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The 1150 is considerably less exepensive without taking any special offers or discounts that may become available into account.    </li>
            <li>In many respects - unfortunately other than closeness - there&#x27;s a certain WOW factor to the Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In many respects - unfortunately other than closeness - there&#x27;s a certain WOW factor to the Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Otherwise it shaves fine, and has a longer lasting battery than my old shaver.</li>
            <li>I have used Norelcos for more than forty years and have yet to be let down with a newer product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a New Year gift for my father!</li>
            <li>Hubby loves his new shaver!</li>
            <li>I liked my last Braun enough to have the internal battery replaced when it died the first time.</li>
            <li>The rebate offer is made deliberately misleading - designed to disqualify the rebate based on a loose, &#x27;bait and switch&#x27; wording of the fine print;  (ii)</li>
            <li>I used 6 different Norelco products in the past few years and they were on average good to very good.</li>
            <li>Really like this new razor.</li>
            <li>I when I tried my neck hair with this new razor, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.  </li>
            <li>Also, the new one is very noisey/loud.</li>
            <li>This new razor is quite different as it shaves almost as close a blade when used with water and kept clean.</li>
            <li>have to press many times to turn it on or off right now, and I am sure it will be dead within a week as it no more waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The battery life is much better than my previous razor.  </li>
            <li>I then knew I wanted to purchase another Phillips Norelco shaver because of how pleased I was with my previous model.  </li>
            <li>And now that my beard is half-gray, the gray hairs are even more wiry than the black.</li>
            <li>I have to do less stretching and craning of the neck to make sure the shave is completed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It functions much better than my two previous Norelcos.</li>
            <li>I have to do less stretching and craning of the neck to make sure the shave is completed.    </li>
            <li>better shaver than the previous Norelco....  </li>
            <li>Andit holds charge better (aided by less time shaving).</li>
            <li>I bought this item on black Friday and like so many others had my rebate rejected by Phillips.</li>
            <li>It looks about 5x better then what it delivers, which is a half hearted trim.</li>
            <li>This can be used &#x27;wet or dry&#x27; and is very sturdy and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I have not tried it wet yet, but I like the easy water cleanup when I use it from time to time.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s working well, better than my previous HQ9090.</li>
            <li>You will need to prop it against the wall to steady it.  </li>
            <li>Have been using an older Norelco shaver,loved it....</li>
            <li>This Phillips SensoTouch replaced an older corded electric that I had been using.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I give the edge to Panasonic for a better overall shave.    </li>
            <li>I was fairly satisfied with it but ended up growing my beard back and only periodically using it.  </li>
            <li>Then again, maybe the more expensive models shave better???  </li>
            <li>I use it mainly on my face but have also used it on my head.  </li>
            <li>I use it mainly on my face but have also used it on my head.  </li>
            <li>It is light and quiet compared to my old one.    </li>
            <li>It does not shave good at all, I wasted $100, I will have to go back and buy one of the Power Touch models.</li>
            <li>THIS WAS NOT REQUIRED ON THE OLDER NORELCO SHAVERS</li>
            <li>older model</li>
            <li>The design also seems far more careful in consideration of moving parts</li>
            <li>The main advantage of an electric shaver is the speed to get the shave done.  </li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t pay a premium for it...  buy and older model...  </li>
            <li>The battery lasts through several shaves and recharges quickly.  </li>
            <li>not as quick as with the traditional blade, but is convenient..</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as my older Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>Considering its price, I guess it&#x27;s a decent buy.</li>
            <li>Blue is very beautiful,Very powerful micro motors.</li>
            <li>Since I use my Braun every two or three weeks for quick touch-ups, I didn&#x27;t think this was necessary.</li>
            <li>most likely will not return to blade shaving, even if the medication is no&lt;br /&gt;longer necessary.  </li>
            <li>For the cost that is asked, It is not even remotely as decent as it should be.</li>
            <li>Just has lost a lot of convience compaired to the older design.</li>
            <li>It does not seem to give as close a shave as my older Norelco did.</li>
            <li>and I mainly use them when I travel (about 10~12 times a year).</li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t grab a quick shave if the charge is low.  </li>
            <li>The cutting action isn&#x27;t superb but sufficient.</li>
            <li>This is a decent shaver, but I didn&#x27;t find the shave itself to be particularly close compared to cheaper electric shavers that I&#x27;ve had:</li>
            <li>I have an older Norelco razor that gives me a closer shave.</li>
            <li>This 2D 1150X appears to be able to perform all the mobile functions of the more expensive models.    </li>
            <li>I UPGRADED FROM OLDER NORELCO SHAVER.</li>
            <li>And only one hour quick charge.</li>
            <li>This is for sure my last Norelco product with or without rebate, time to buy quality next time.</li>
            <li>It is super quiet when using.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how the higher models could do much better.</li>
            <li>This shaver gave a good feel for initial few months of use as the shave was close</li>
            <li>This is a decent razor, but I ended up returning it.  </li>
            <li>Most discouragingly, I am currently chatting with a representative from Philips simply named \\&quot;Mack\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>You will be able to see the credit applied on your account at the checkout page while placing the order and it will neither be applied on the items which are sold and shipped by a third party seller or sold by a third party seller and shipped by Amazon.  </li>
            <li>my friend recommended this to me for my boy friend, was expecting more as this is the most expensive one I&#x27;ve bought.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>You can get a fast and clean shave because you can use it with your dry skin.</li>
            <li>Decent price.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It does run quieter than I expected, the impression is that it isn&#x27;t as strong but in fact it does quite well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>all, I&#x27;d have to say this is a fantastic item, and the only minor flaw I see is my own worry that if I dropped it, the small pivoting head, should it land just right, would be damaged...</li>
            <li>Although the trimmer is considerably more useful than the built-in trimmer of previous models, it&#x27;s also another small, easy to lose part.</li>
            <li>Overall, battery life is good and blades last really long.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know how people can rate this razor so high</li>
            <li>Id highly recommend the Norelco 1150x/40</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recomend.</li>
            <li>use them while I am taking a shower, so the chances of water getting inside them is high, but</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the 1150 model, depending on features you want.</li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS RAZOR</li>
            <li>The product is in high quality.</li>
            <li>The circular-pressing motion you&#x27;re asked to do gets a bit tiring at first, my wrist started feeling strange near the end of my second shave, but it&#x27;s not a problem any more.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend  to anyone thinking of going electric.</li>
            <li>I decided to try a high quality electric razor to see how it compares.</li>
            <li>The product has a high cost performance, I have used thisrazor two weeks.</li>
            <li>High quality construction.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>We both highly recommend it for both men &amp; women.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>A wonderful shave that is quick and no longer such a painful chore.</li>
            <li>The other comment he made is that he gets a better shave with the old shaver than with this one.  </li>
            <li>My old one (forgot the model) lasted 15 years with the original battery and only !</li>
            <li>, I read all the fine prints really carefully.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it improves my shaving experience, but certainly doesn&#x27;t replace my old razors.</li>
            <li>The Norelco was comfortable to hold, quiet and had extraordinary battery life - nearly two weeks of long shaves.  </li>
            <li>and it is getting a little better</li>
            <li>I love the 3 head design and the way it pivots, plus the blue is pretty sharp.</li>
            <li>I bought a Philips Norelco SensoTouch Shaver from Amazon on Nov, 2011 with $30 mail-in rebate.&lt;br /&gt;After more than three months, Philips sent me a little rejection card, which says that \\&quot;Manufacturer&#x27;s discount taken at cash register are not valid for rebate promotions\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>&amp; he&#x27;s been shaving nearly 70 years!!  </li>
            <li>This is my first Norelco, after using many other traditional shavers.</li>
            <li>A little more effort there gets it done, though.  </li>
            <li>pay a little more and get quality.</li>
            <li>I find that I have to spend a little more time shaving to get the job done.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Philips for finally bringing out a product in the market that is pure delight!</li>
            <li>I prefer the older chord capable of plugging directly into the shaver.</li>
            <li>This works fine for him, but, it takes him twice as long to get a close shave as his old razor.</li>
            <li>Shaving is very clean, and hurt less than the face.</li>
            <li>No other electric I have ever owned is as smooth as this, but my current fave electric shaver is the Remongton F5.</li>
            <li>No other electric I have ever owned is as smooth as this, but my current fave electric shaver is the Remongton F5.</li>
            <li>Easily learned but not as convienent as the hinged head assembly on the other models I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>The nice thing is is you dont have to press hard to get the hairs.</li>
            <li>Doesnt shave as close as a wet shave with normal razor, but it shaves close enough and is very easy to use/clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Looking forward its further special offers</li>
            <li>When a more intense cleaning is needed you can disassemble the entire shaver assembly and clean out each rotary blade individually with the included brush (I actually throw the blades and heads into the dishwasher on a sanitize cycle to get them extra</li>
            <li>These are the reasons:  - The razor heads seem to turn at a much slower pace than the 7310, therefore, a complete shave takes almost twice the time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft on the face and really does shave \\&quot;as close as a blade.\\&quot; Cleanup is a breeze.</li>
            <li>Compare my old type Philips shaver this one get much improvements.</li>
            <li>This Norelco worked great in all areas for me, plus got all those difficult neck and chin hairs with ease.</li>
            <li>The action and the technology of the newer Model 1150x is much improved.</li>
            <li>Even then it takes longer to shave than with my old (much cheaper) razor.  </li>
            <li>wow, norelco really came through.  </li>
            <li>Just remember to clean it and dry it off after....</li>
            <li>My husband loves the Norelco &amp; I do also as it truly gives him a close shave &amp; his skin is so smooth with absolutely no stubble.</li>
            <li>I guess only time will tell if that proves to be the case.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;aquatec\\&quot; feature alone is enough to make this razor worth it.</li>
            <li>Overall pleased with the razor, haven&#x27;t tried using it with wet shaving cream yet, but it seems to work fine dry.</li>
            <li>I have ALWAYS used normal razors.</li>
            <li>Shave quality is normal.</li>
            <li>I saw a commercial on TV and then researched reviews online and decided it was worth</li>
            <li>I rinse it with hot water after each use and it is ready to go for the next shave.</li>
            <li>razor is only worth about $20</li>
            <li>but I like it better than the Williams Lectic Shave without the green tea.  </li>
            <li>The product itself worth the money, they were offering $30 rebate when I purchase this shaver, and I followed their instruction and send rebate form back with the bar code</li>
            <li>One of the better razors I have had, had a few over the years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had Philips Norelco shavers before, and this one is pretty much the same.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s actually a hole where the plastic has broken off and more cracks spidering from the top of the button as well.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>I may still think it was only worth $10 if that tells you anything.  </li>
            <li>I love it,and use it everyday.</li>
            <li>I normally shave 2-3 times per week.</li>
            <li>I have always found the round tri-head electric shavers from Norelco work much better than the foil syle design from Remington and others.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using mine for 6 months now with no complaint.</li>
            <li>A few more days will tell.</li>
            <li>I get in grown hairs all the time from just normal shaving.</li>
            <li>All in all - good, but not great.    </li>
            <li>a Norelco which was good but not great in those days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sometimes it still leaves a good deal of residual hair behind if I don&#x27;t check closely.</li>
            <li>Its good as long as I shave everyday.</li>
            <li>it glides smooth over your face and the tough spots to shave under the chin are easy because it pivots inwards.</li>
            <li>It cuts my beard fine, but so do other shavers.</li>
            <li>The rebate has a fine print saying \\&quot;May not be combined with other offers\\&quot;, but the $30 discount by Amazon is not an offer by Philips.</li>
            <li>This shaver is a much better shaving unit than the previous XL models!</li>
            <li>He had a razor that was 4 years old and really needed a new one.</li>
            <li>The upside is this razor does not cause as much razor burn as his old one did even when it was brand new.</li>
            <li>Amazingly you can wet shave or dry shave with this electric razor.  </li>
            <li>Have 2 other old ones that are years old that are much better.</li>
            <li>This type of shaver, with three heads, doesn&#x27;t allow you to shave right under your nose well, especially if your are shaving around a mustache, as I need to.  </li>
            <li>I HAVE A LIGHT BEARD, AND NORMALLY DO THIS EVERY OTHER WEEK</li>
            <li>Those who want the Jet Clean system should try the 1250, as long as they are willing to pay the premium and don&#x27;t mind the hassle and expense of changing the fluid.      </li>
            <li>Was bought this razor as a christmas gift, I have very sensative skin and this one works great wet or dry, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like other razors do</li>
            <li>Blades still holding strong and sharp after 2 years of regular usage (Note: Not daily usage but twice a week on average)&lt;br /&gt;- Comfortable grip, head swivel movement and wet-use&lt;br</li>
            <li>The wet shave was also smooth and the unit easy to clean but still not quite as close as a typical 3 to 5 edge safety razor and probably should not be expected to.</li>
            <li>it got his neck smooth, smoother than any other shaver he has tried.  </li>
            <li>and Philips sent me a new handle within a week.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is the cheapest out of all of these new style Norelco&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>A week ago i saw the new sensotouch, which was 50 dollars cheaper and water proof, so i returned the 8000 series and bought this one.</li>
            <li>I bought a new Norelco 1150X and have had it for 3 months now.</li>
            <li>I bought a new Panasonic ES-GA-21S razor in October 2010 and regretted it.  </li>
            <li>I bought it for a new razor.</li>
            <li>so I was in the market for a new shaver.  </li>
            <li>, so I get my new 1150.</li>
            <li>Well, wait, now the 1150x has this new neck pivot device.</li>
            <li>The item arrived just in time and as described, brand new.</li>
            <li>New blades are over $40.  </li>
            <li>I purchased tis electric shaver after trying my college bound sons new one that his Mother bought for him for school.</li>
            <li>new one</li>
            <li>(model varied over time) and did not have any problems, just wanted to try the fancy new \\&quot;blue\\&quot; electric shaver.      </li>
            <li>Now Norelco has made a new version that cuts almost as close as the blade.</li>
            <li>In may 2011 I purchased a new Norelco 1150 model...</li>
            <li>When I need new one, I choice Philips too.</li>
            <li>I may not have gotten used to this new shaver.</li>
            <li>&quot; brings increasing prices of the blades and lessening durability along with the \\&quot;new, 23 blades and shaves your dog too!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>New Senso Touch(2D) is the one WE got for him.</li>
            <li>They sent me a new shaver head which I am still evaluating.  </li>
            <li>I have used Norelco for years and felt it was time for a new razor.</li>
            <li>After months of unsatisfactory shaving with a safety razor, I&#x27;ve heard nothing but praise from him about this new razor.  </li>
            <li>but this new one is so updated.  </li>
            <li>Eventually, the battery begins to lose charging capacity or a new \\&quot;must-have\\&quot; feature is introduced that compels me to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>I guess that I learned to live with it.</li>
            <li>new class is the 3D).  </li>
            <li>I suppose I could crack the new one</li>
            <li>My face needed no adjustment time for this new razor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the 8260XL for a couple of years now and switched to the 1150x/40 SensoTouch for something new.  </li>
            <li>With this unit once the batteries start to die it is basically time to get a new one.</li>
            <li>While I was waiting to get the new Norelco</li>
            <li>This new razor gives a close shave.  </li>
            <li>I thought a new  razor would be quieter.</li>
            <li>will my new one to my dad.</li>
            <li>, so I&#x27;m on the prowl for a new razor.</li>
            <li>live in LA</li>
            <li>I have to remove the shaver head and attach a separate trimmer head on my new shaver.  </li>
            <li>Also, the new shaver requires a separate charging stand.  </li>
            <li>If you are at your ends wit for shaving and want something new, try this.</li>
            <li>When I got the new razor</li>
            <li>decided to give the new shaver a quick try at a dry shave, with five days of growth on my face.  </li>
            <li>I never thought it was important, but I found out how much I had been missing.  </li>
            <li>Used it dry and the shave is very close, left my face smooth.</li>
            <li>I like the way you clean the rotary blades, and I have not tried using it as a wet shaver.  </li>
            <li>The dry or wet feature makes it even more readily usable.</li>
            <li>I still get a comfortable and quiet shave, and the shave is still close enough even with year-old shaving head blades.</li>
            <li>older Norelco&#x27;s plugged in directly for recharging, but this model comes with a charger stand.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really speak to the effectiveness of the trimmer, as three days&#x27; growth isn&#x27;t enough for it to really make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My facial hair doesn&#x27;t really grow THAT fast, statistically speaking...</li>
            <li>The razor ended up being shipped way earlier than expected and I am now able to give it as a gift for Christmas.</li>
            <li>Not a big deal, it&#x27;s easy to do, but it&#x27;s still an extra step that I didn&#x27;t have to do with my old Norelco.</li>
            <li>However, the Norelco 1150x did NOT shave nearly as close and comfortably as my older Panasonic ES8103S that it was intended to replace.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a few and this one just feels more comfortable and irritates my skin less.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, re-assembling the heads isn&#x27;t terribly difficult, and you get better at it with practice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After all, a charge lasted for weeks, no nicks, cuts or razor burn while getting a close quick dry shave.  </li>
            <li>The low battery light alerts you when there are 5 minutes of shave time left.  </li>
            <li>but I really didn&#x27;t notice much of a change in closeness of shave, just a change in overall comfort.    </li>
            <li>The same rebate that was good only on Black Friday and advertised on the Amazon website as being valid on the razor.</li>
            <li>The low battery light alerts you when there are 5 minutes of shave time left.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave as fast as my old 12 year old Norelco did.</li>
            <li>I forget the model, but it would leave stray hairs here and there and would give me tons of irritation as I have kind of a thick beard and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Nothing exceptional, but nothing irritating in any way.  </li>
            <li>My husband has very sensitive and irritable skin.</li>
            <li>its not convenient to travel with and the contacts are very sensitive.</li>
            <li>Shaving is very soft.</li>
            <li>Thus, it happened with me that 2 times the shaver got on by itself in the shaving kit bag given that the button are very sensitive to touch (thus name \\&quot; Sensotouch\\&quot;)</li>
            <li>Thank you very much for such products.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Almost completely misses the hair on my upper lip right under my nose.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Enjoy.al attachment, though it&#x27;s worth it since it functions better than the pop-up on the 1250  -- The battery lasts less time than all other SensoTouch models  </li>
            <li>I am Chinese buyers, this robot is too great, you deserve it, although we Chinese made, but you America price than our domestic prices cheaper by half</li>
            <li>If you buying an electric shaver for the first time, skip this section and read the next     Electric shavers basically come in 2 types - Rotary (philips norelco) &amp; foil (braun &amp; panasonic)     </li>
            <li>so far!  </li>
            <li>As some reviewers have already stated, the first thing you notice is it is very quiet.</li>
            <li>Amazons price and shipping as usual was outstanding.</li>
            <li>I have been a Norelco user for the past 15 years and have always  been satisfied with their shavers.</li>
            <li>The first time I shaved, the shaver left crease marks on my neck all over.</li>
            <li>Over the last year I have been obsessed with having the perfect daily shave.</li>
            <li>This is the third Norelco I&#x27;ve owned, although it is my first higher-end shaver.</li>
            <li>In addition, either the motion or the heat (not that it felt hot) from the head made my skin red and sore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You have to take the stand with you because you can&#x27;t plug into the shaver directly!</li>
            <li>While it wasn&#x27;t completely their fault, I can&#x27;t believe they did it!</li>
            <li>I think it will be better if the price can be lower to 49.99 as in the past.</li>
            <li>This shaver has just amazed me, better than any  electric or blades that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually take time to review products, but thought I would because I&#x27;ve been so pleased.  </li>
            <li>It shaves pretty close to a regular blade.  </li>
            <li>* slightly more expensive to replace blades (+$5) since 1150X replacements include the entire flex head and drive shaft/springs, not just the blades, however this means more of the unit is \\&quot;new\\&quot; each time, so eh&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I guess I need to be aware next time</li>
            <li>I had to go over the same area many times and it still left hairs, especially in the neck area.</li>
            <li>SmartTouch has a wheel that has 3 positions for Normal and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>And the first charge lasted for almost a month, after daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The razor itself is pretty basic.</li>
            <li>It is his first electric razor, he has only tried it once.</li>
            <li>Like many other reviewers I want to say that philips did not honour our rebates and they give different reasons by mail and when you call them.</li>
            <li>design.&lt;br /&gt;- Not really quiet but a better timbre than other shavers makes it seem quieter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The facial part it works great at but the attatchment for trimming overall sucks.</li>
            <li>Always blood after shaving now no more ,specially I love shaving with Electric Razor specially&lt;</li>
            <li>Other wise, this was certainly a waste of my money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll still use the new one, but wished I&#x27;d just bought new blades for the old one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Prices in Phillips keep getting higher and higher to a point that it is becoming ridiculous, so it is time to give a chance to my Chinese friends, and try one of theirs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first few shaves were spotty and left many random stragglers, but after about 5 days of shaving daily, I began getting the best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten with a DRY electric.  </li>
            <li>He had to use the shaver multiple times at the same area to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li>Older one was much cheaper and did same job as this one.</li>
            <li>It shaves reasonably well, but the increased articulation of this design still isn&#x27;t enough to cut around the angles of my jaw, which was the reason I bought this particular model.</li>
            <li>You have to shave back forth several times to be clean.  </li>
            <li>It did not shave of the hairs on my neck cleanly, and I had to rotate it back and forth and around multiple times before it shaved the hair on my face.  </li>
            <li>The 1150x is more difficult to clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is the neck problem also where i need to use a razor to finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;The hair storage capacity is very low and you need to open it and clean after each use for optimal</li>
            <li>You might as well go with a cheaper electric razor as the blades will last just as long and most likely longer than the blades on this high priced razor.</li>
            <li>Clean and sharp on shaving.</li>
            <li>It delivers a very close, comfortable shave, especially, using some hot water and a small amount of shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I bought it as a replacement for my old Norelco, which wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge and needed new heads.  </li>
            <li>I shave every weekday; my old shaver needed a new blade every 14 months or so.</li>
            <li>Old Norelco needed new batteries and shaving head.  </li>
            <li>Do not feel very easy to use, yet my old clean shaven, the other is only charging cradle too much trouble</li>
            <li>Combined with my Amazon Prime free shipping, I paid much less than my price</li>
            <li>Secondly, the shavers have come a long way in getting a comfortable and closer shave.  </li>
            <li>It gives me close smooth shave compared to the previous one arcitec.</li>
            <li>It may sound odd, but I can move the shaver around my face faster with the soap/wather greasing the skids, so to speak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned to use the SensoTouch with a light touch, and the payoff is a close shave with less irritation.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned to use the SensoTouch with a light touch, and the payoff is a close shave with less irritation.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned to use the SensoTouch with a light touch, and the payoff is a close shave with less irritation.</li>
            <li>I only ever used it dry, as I had no need to attempt a closer shave, and liked the convenience of a dry shave.  </li>

            <li>I only ever used it dry, as I had no need to attempt a closer shave, and liked the convenience of a dry shave.</li>
            <li>quiet, fast and clean shave, not very comparable to manual shaver though.</li>
            <li>It has been more convenient in the past to plug in the old Norelco&#x27;s   using the power cord, and let it charge overnight.</li>
            <li>product is ok, but not powerful enough.</li>
            <li>The blade-head is also pretty abusive to skin--maybe I&#x27;m extra sensitive--</li>
            <li>There are several customers having the same issue and Amazon has issued them full refunds:  </li>
            <li>I always shave wet (usually in the shower) and I use a good, non-foaming gel (King of Shaves).</li>
            <li>Nice little razor, I don&#x27;t care for dry shave, irritates my skin, but using it with shaving cream is assume.  </li>
            <li>, you can&#x27;t get a good grip on it because it feels like you could easily damage the cutting foils, and that it could go flying out of the hand when it snaps loose.  </li>
            <li>In fact, having become used to the raucous hum of older electric razors, the Norelco doesn&#x27;t SOUND powerful enough to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My most recent Braun shaver&#x27;s battery would no longer hold a long enough charge and it was time for a replacement.  </li>
            <li>No Neha, I am due the full $30.  </li>
            <li>I must say; up until now, I thought safety razors with double edge blades were the most economical razors since there was hardly any waste other than your own blood.</li>
            <li>But for the \\&quot;20%\\&quot; of smaller hairs, it takes a very long time to get a smooth shave with this.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I&#x27;ve owned one other shaver (Foil) that shaved much faster BUT irritated my face very much.</li>
            <li>the XL is more solidly built, but gives less of a close shave</li>
            <li>If you look back at some of my previous reviews, you&#x27;ll see I&#x27;ve tried most things out there for shaving.</li>
            <li>I have used many electric razors, both dry, and wet &amp; dry.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>(Black men are more susceptible to razor bumps than white men because of the course curly nature of our hair).</li>
            <li>Traditional razors tend to irritate my skin the most, and through experimentation over the years, I have found that Norelco brand razors tend to irritate my skin much less than all the others.  </li>
            <li>but i love the fact that its a wet dry razor.</li>
            <li>It might work better for someone with less facial hair.</li>
            <li>thin and comfortable ,it is very cheap and I strongly suggest every man should buy one thin and cothin and comfortablethin and comfortablethin and comfortablethin and comfortablemfortable</li>
            <li>the most important reason I bought is the low price, which is one-third price of China selling price.&lt;br /&gt;However, after using this, it is not good as I thought, and I found the cleaning effect is same as the cheaper one which made in China.</li>
            <li>RIght side of face, dry shave eh</li>
            <li>This shaver gives a really close smooth shave, whether wet or dry</li>
            <li>Also, a quick shave cleans up the stubble, but if I don&#x27;t use extra time (and effort/pressure), the stubble&#x27;s back by early afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>first time (and only time) using it he tried to shave with a dry face first.</li>
            <li>, I think the point is his beard grows slowly, as for me, I ordered a la63 in 2013, and ordered a 790cc last year, I think these shavers work more efficiently!</li>
            <li>After about a month I can honestly say that I am not very impressed.</li>
            <li>I have shaved with a Norelco razor for several year, this is my first bad one it is noisyier than my other razor&#x27;s and does not shave as good, I recharged my old one and it shaved much better than the new model 1150X</li>
            <li>I would guess that this rebate practice is by an &#x27;opportunistic&#x27; marketing idea from a &#x27;smart&#x27; US Norelco division to increase next quarter sales by &#x27;any&#x27; means.  </li>
            <li>but....the Lectric Shave smelled like pure alcohol, and the Afta left me smelling like an old man, like something my grandpaw wears.</li>
            <li>Still not that hard, but more troublesome than the 8140XL.    </li>
            <li>Since I found this out, I have been using it every other day with somewhat adequate results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;price is surprizingly low while it has very high performace</li>
            <li>The razor and trimming attachment are a little larger than expected but do a good job.</li>
            <li>The razor and trimming attachment are a little larger than expected but do a good job.  </li>
            <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, the shaves from the 1150 come in a very close second to shaves from a blade.  </li>
            <li>Also, the rebate form was clearly offered in the listing of the item on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I like the old one so much that I recently replaced it with another one.</li>
            <li>After using it for a few days, I was surprised how smooth it is.</li>
            <li>Given the fact that I&#x27;m only in my early twenties, I don&#x27;t have that much shaving experience.</li>
            <li>This is a clear example of bait and switch</li>
            <li>He has no complaints with it so far</li>
            <li>and the razor comes alive.  </li>
            <li>However, it  provides soft smooth,quiet shave without irr.itation.  </li>
            <li>I bought this razor after my 3 year old Arcitec decided to die, and I wanted to stay in the Norelco line of razors.  </li>
            <li>I would finish a shave with the old razor, and invariably there would still be 20-30 straggler hairs that I would have to go over a second/third time to catch them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost as if the razor head/foils cut the hair even deeper than the old Arcitec did...</li>
            <li>I dropped the old one when I got it.  </li>
            <li>Cons:  Slow/weak operating action  </li>
            <li>Its cheaper and water proof, which i must say feels so much closer to the traditional shaving experience with a shaving gel and everything.</li>
            <li>I really like the design of it and actually prefer that the heads interchange for shaving and trimming.</li>
            <li>i bought this shaver because my braun 5 series stop charging completely.  </li>
            <li>so this product completely eliminated that problem for me....</li>
            <li>-- There are instructions included showing how to completely disassemble the head, if you need to do so.    </li>
            <li>I was also surprised by razor</li>
            <li>Also, if you really want to do a thorough job, I find that it&#x27;s actually quicker to use a razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks now and its very thorough.  </li>
            <li>It may have been a symptom of my aging razor, but the old one made quite the hum as it went about its business, and I was pleasantly surprised by the SensoTouch.  </li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t had a need to pop off the daily head, so I can&#x27;t comment about the transition to the trimming attachment.  </li>
            <li>Who needs that racket early in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>I am yet to find any shaver that gets as close as a fixed blade and won&#x27;t ever expect to either.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic has an A/C adapter that can be plugged directly into the shaver and the shaver can be used with the cord attached.  </li>
            <li>The closest shave I have got using an electric razor by far.</li>
            <li>This razor replaced a Remington that wasn&#x27;t that old, but it was an inexpensive model and was wearing out fairly early, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>I have one gripe with a design issue...there is no way to plug the charger directly into the razor.  </li>
            <li>My old Norelco died and I went online to find a replacement.  </li>
            <li>They work well for my daily routine and work fast.</li>
            <li>It makes the heads last much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>wow factor there.</li>
            <li>After using this shaver, I then took a blade and went over the same spots to see if I could get any closer.....not really.  </li>
            <li>I have to say, so far, it rocks in every way.  </li>
            <li>My old Norelco is about 7 years old (6XXX series) and was about $140 when purchased.  </li>
            <li>I can see that getting old.  </li>
            <li>But so far, I didn&#x27;t receive $30 mail rebate.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not as close a shave as my old Remington&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>but if you should happen to drop it it flies completely to pieces.  </li>
            <li>Cheap waste of time.  </li>
            <li>Buyers should have been told by Amazon if the two offers were mutually exclusive.  </li>
            <li>Having sensitive skin I decided to go with a rotary instead of a foil.</li>
            <li>He is away from home frequently in his work and wanted one for home and another for his  travel bag.  </li>
            <li>While the Norelco was close, it just could not match my old Panasonic in any respect.    </li>
            <li>another day--not the same day--I tried it as part of a wet shave routine only to yield slightly better results (because of the gel, I imagine)</li>
            <li>what it cost me is the razors) and do not waste your money on this trash....</li>
            <li>DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN.</li>
            <li>I was surprised</li>
            <li>In fact I bought this item for one of my friends, he has already bought one for his relative and he really likes it and asked me to but another for him.</li>
            <li>I have a light beard but still need to shave everyday unless I am going hiking or working in the yard on the weekend.     </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem as sturdy as the old one but time will tell.</li>
            <li>It shaved quite well on the straight away&#x27;s, but around the curves and my neck area \\&quot; where I have hairs going in 3 different directions</li>
            <li>far as the trimmer goes, I have no problem with clicking in the separate trimmer blade maybe every week or so</li>
            <li>almost seems as though it&#x27;s not running fast enough to do the job, but it does.</li>
            <li>almost seems as though it&#x27;s not running fast enough to do the job, but it does.</li>
            <li>The contour-following shave heads yield a considerable improvement in comfort and closeness over lower end Norelcos.</li>
            <li>my five year old electric shaver I use.</li>
            <li>my old razor would leave hairs on my neck and struggle to provide a close shave.</li>
            <li>I am moving on from a Norelco 7775x, which is about 7 years old.</li>
            <li>I replaced a 6 year old Norelco with this unit, and have been using this razor for about 1 month.  </li>
            <li>I would have to shave for everyday with the foil one whereas with this one I can go about a day or two without shaving and still have a fairly smooth face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought to replace old, reliable Norelco 7340XL.  </li>
            <li>In the old days, for me this would have led to ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>If he were still alive, I might well have given him this Norelco for Christmas.</li>
            <li>If he were still alive, I might well have given him this Norelco for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I did not have to recharge it until early January, so the battery lasted for about 3.5 months.  </li>
            <li>I paid enough for this product to work much longer ......</li>
            <li>My old one did not need a stand for a charge.</li>
            <li>Old unit had charger built into cord, and cord plugged into unit.</li>
            <li>I use Edge shave cream for sensitive skin and use it in and out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>either party suppose to responsible for such mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He has been using a really old electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Blue Ridge Books N Gifts!</li>
            <li>A complete charge takes 1 hour, and lasts 40 minutes.  </li>
            <li>So far no complaints.</li>
            <li>and It is lighter and easier to use than my old one.  </li>
            <li>and even he was surprised at the close shave.  </li>
            <li>I bought this on at the time thinking that it would be an improvement to my old electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>Foil shavers such as Braun provide a much eaiser and closer shave.</li>
            <li>I have always used electric razors for ease of use, and this one by far cuts the closest, when compared to the others (but the others were also cheaper x.x).</li>
            <li>IT DOES TAKE SEVERAL PASSES TO GET A REALLY CLOSE SHAVE, BUT MY FACE IS NOT IRITATED FROM THE CLOSENESS AS IT WOULD BE WITH A FOIL HEAD SHAVER.</li>
            <li>Although not purchased here, I am submitting this review because I am a frequent Amazon</li>
            <li>The unit recently developed a crack in the area around the push button that turns it on.</li>
            <li>I have an old Remington 3 Head rotary.</li>
            <li>The blades on the Remington are 6 months old too&lt;</li>
            <li>I BOUGHT THIS RAZOR FOR MY 90 YEAR OLD BROTHER---</li>
            <li>HE TOLD ME TO GIVE HIM MY 2 YEAR OLD NORELCO FOR THIS</li>
            <li>Instead, the 1150x/40 shaved me so well and so comfortably that it has replaced my Braun shaver for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, I can use the neoprene case that came with my old razor.</li>
            <li>and I got feedback that it does not perform very well either after a short period of time.</li>
            <li>So far I did not receive refund.</li>
            <li>you are attempting to combine offers which is not allowed under phillips policy basically stating you cannot stack your coupon with a rebate to get $60 bucks off the item, now amazon did not state anything at the time i purchased the item that you couldnt use the rebate after accepting their coupon upon purchasing the item</li>
            <li>It offers a hassle-free, idiot-proof shave.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s smooth to the eye, it&#x27;s not smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my old shaver and after about 3 uses</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now over the years I have tried a number of razors--any number of traditional one-to-four blade straight (disposable) handles, as well as electric units from Remington and Norelco.  </li>
            <li>I have submitted the rebate in early Jan. 2012.</li>
            <li>So far no issues with the product,it have been a year now since this purchase.</li>
            <li>Meaning, you can&#x27;t plug the cord directly into the unit and use it as a corded shaver.</li>
            <li>Purchased to replace old Norelco that was 10 years old.  </li>
            <li>The next will come back to buy bath just sound big</li>
            <li>I do have a really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Like it so much and use it at daily basis.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of facial hair but one charge lasted me almost eight months with 2 or 3</li>
            <li>Shaving with this seems to take a lot longer than my old shaver</li>
            <li>is I have not got the rebate so far.</li>
            <li>I dug out a 10 year old Remington Titanium shaver that I had stopped using.  </li>
            <li>I would have preferred a direct cable connection to recharge the razor</li>
            <li>A complete charge takes 1 hour, and lasts 40 minutes.</li>
            <li>With my old razor, all I had to do was trip the trimmer</li>
            <li>As far as functionality goes, there is nothing that I can complain about.</li>
            <li>If I have to complete a survey like this everytime</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shaver nearly as close as a Brawn, or the Panasonic for that matter.</li>
            <li>I have used Braun shavers for many years (at least since 1988).  </li>
            <li>He has always used Norelco but it far.</li>
            <li>I kept  my old Panasonic shaver and  use its trimmer when needed (it is built in to the shaver)  and do not bother with the swap out.  </li>
            <li>; that also meant it didn&#x27;t actually shave those areas very well and there was always stubble.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, wich is a complete piece of garbage, in consequence I had my doubts about this one.  </li>
            <li>You figure out how old it is.</li>
            <li>I felt like I was using an experimental Razor.</li>
            <li>Philips refused to honor my complete and on-time rebate submission.  </li>
            <li>I miss my old one.  </li>
            <li>The product is is not worth the full price.</li>
            <li>the plus side, battery life lasts long if, as true with any shaver, you don&#x27;t constantly charge it.  </li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t waste the extra $100 for the 3D.  </li>
            <li>The charging base that it sits in didn&#x27;t seem to be of the best construction.  </li>
            <li>Not perfect but still a good shaver.</li>
            <li>I have thick course neck hair, a lot more course than the stuff on my cheeks, and</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the items themselves good</li>
            <li>This shaver takes care of neck hair and  fine facial hairs that my other shavers missed.</li>
            <li>It most certainly did get a much nicer cleaner shave, almost as clean a blade, but I was left with a shredded up neck line and bad irration.</li>
            <li>I would rate this shaver average mainly because it leaves hairs mainly around neck and no matter how much you move this around it wont pick those.</li>
            <li>But this razor doesn&#x27;t cut any closer than my old Norelco, a 73--XL, which is about 10 years old and needs new heads, and cost about only 40% of this new one.</li>
            <li>For half the price, you get as good of, if not a better shave from the cheaper product, with almost none of the inconveniences.  </li>
            <li>do like the fact that because the unit is water tight I can quickly clean the razor under the sink faucet.</li>
            <li>basically, my usage feedback after couple months are  -  it is not standing out while comparing with other low end Philips shaver, it is quite stylish, but considering the actual shaving performance, I just gave 3 starts.</li>
            <li>But, when you come right down to it, I can shave with a blade and clean up faster than with the Norelco (or any other wet/dry</li>
            <li>But, when you come right down to it, I can shave with a blade and clean up faster than with the Norelco (or any other wet/dry</li>
            <li>just right for it to make the connections &amp; be careful not to bump it.</li>
            <li>The razor fits easily into the hand and while running the SensoTouch 1150x Electric Shaver is quieter than the unit it replaces, the motor is underpowered and I could actually hear the blades slowing down if I pressed the razor to closely to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The razor fits easily into the hand and while running the SensoTouch 1150x Electric Shaver is quieter than the unit it replaces, the motor is underpowered and I could actually hear the blades slowing down if I pressed the razor to closely to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The recharging station/stand is a slim cradle with a small footprint, which easily fits in any bathroom.  </li>
            <li>I say shaving dry with an electric razor is only slightly better than shaving dry with a blade.</li>
            <li>I have not given it the full month and a half trial yet.</li>
            <li>He likes to shave in the shower, and until recently, it was difficult to find a good rechargeable shaver that would hold up to true wet shaving.  </li>
            <li>All my previous dry razors would catch and stick and my skin was even the slighest bit most.  </li>
            <li>Cheap feel  Difficult to clean blades  </li>
            <li>On top of this they refuse to honor the advertised rebate, because of the fine print which is very vague.</li>
            <li>as smooth as using a conventional razor!!</li>
            <li>Very comfortableto use,  buy not sharp enough,  </li>
            <li>The other thing I am not crazy about it</li>
            <li>The more expensive models also include a larger capacity battery with shaving time up to 1 hour on a full charge, and a standby duration of up to 20 days.  </li>
            <li>that charger doesn&#x27;t take up much space at all on the vanity and that the contact points are high, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about a wet countertop causing problems.  </li>
            <li>For an extra $20, I bought the sexy blue razor instead of the stripped down model.  </li>
            <li>With this new razor, I notice maybe 5 stragglers, and they will sweep up on my second pass usually, making this razor easily 5 minutes faster than using my old Arcitec.  </li>
            <li>I recently replaced my older Norelco with a foil shaver.</li>
            <li>the shave is a vast improvement over my older norelco (which has been discontinued).  </li>
            <li>Decent enough electric razor, bought anticipating the Philips $30 rebate offer, should have made the razor $19.95 after Amazon coupon and Philips rebate.  </li>
            <li>Putting it back together is sometimes problematic because the plastic piece that holds the heads together must face a particular way or the head won&#x27;t stay in one piece.</li>
            <li>The shaver manages that funny, difficult area just under the nostrils well too -- in fact, much better than my Mach 3 does.</li>
            <li>I recently got this for my teenage son as his first shaver.  </li>
            <li>However upon purchasing this nice device I have found this to be even more economical than my safety razor; it not only reduces the risk of nicks or cuts but also unnecessary products, ie., shaving cream, soaps, and  brush; needless  with this tool.</li>
            <li>Powerful and battery can last long time.</li>
            <li>the shave is close (and that is why you buy a razor), but the overall construction feels flimsy comparison to my 3 older Norelco.</li>
            <li>the older models also last longer on a substanially longer charge.</li>
            <li>so sure how this will effect the long term usability of the blade (we all produce oils and dead skin cells that the razor will pick up and lodge into the blades)</li>
            <li>I had an older Norelco that finally quit.  </li>
            <li>There was initially some razor burn, but this quickly subsided by the time I used it a third and fourth time.    </li>
            <li>When this happens (like it did with my last older style)</li>
            <li>his prior (older)</li>
            <li>the older model left my face burning...</li>
            <li>Both wet and dry shaving are supported; cleaning and taking apart the shaving head is very easy, just rinse under the tap and air dry.    </li>
            <li>I like this model because I&#x27;m not willing to pay the extra money for the jet clean system.  </li>
            <li>Overall highly recommend for a purchase.</li>
            <li>so that is a great outcome, but there is a considerable amount of stubble left behind, shaving wet (in the shower) or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My 10 year old Norelco Advantage Wet/Dry razor finally broke, so it was time to get a new razor.  </li>
            <li>The wet shave is so comfortable that I wouldn&#x27;t even think of using it as a dry shaver.</li>
            <li>It takes a bit longer to shave than a straight razor as previously mentioned, but the shave is very close.  </li>
            <li>Smooth as silk in using it, dry or wet alike.</li>
            <li>Some people complain but for under a 100 bucks, it easily compares to some of the other more expensive shavers out there.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy having the ability to use it in the shower which is where I usually shave.</li>
            <li>The razor charges fast and the charge lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>This one feels cheap, sounds weak, and doesn&#x27;t cut thicker hair very well.</li>
            <li>burn this morning when I used it wet for the first time (with a shaving gel)</li>
            <li>The base is fantastic, I love it!</li>
            <li>The shaver would have been worth the $20, but not worth it without the rebate being honored as stated.  </li>
            <li>Only other thing is that it doesn&#x27;t do a great job if you go several days in between shaves (unless your beard grows slow).  </li>
            <li>The 1150X is missing a replace shaving heads indicator, cleaning indicator, and full numeric battery level indicator.  </li>
            <li>Even though it is not updated technical advances and&lt;br /&gt;fancy gadgets, the price is reasonable and it costs more than half less compared with Sensor Touch 3.</li>
            <li>Fabulous shave, wet or dry!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It need multiple times for clean shave, not worth to money</li>
            <li>While at the bottom of the razor isn&#x27;t a huge issue, my razor has actually had the plastic broken right by the on/off button.  </li>
            <li>The last time I used an electric shaver was over 20 years ago and things have certainly changed yet some remain the same.  </li>
            <li>and this one first impression was not as clean shave as previous ones, also it says change blades after 1 year, when previous ones i used without changing blades.</li>
            <li>means I can shave my chin areas easily, which is something I found hard to do with the Braun.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a few 3-head rotary razors over the past few years, and for the most part, they do okay.  </li>
            <li>and I was excited to give it a spin because it is a wet and dry shaver.</li>
            <li>After several Panasonic Linear shavers (which I use primarly wet with shaving cream), I was excited to try the Norelco 1150x because of its similar ratings and wet/dry capability.      </li>
            <li>Now three decades later, I try the new Norelco SensoTouch Electric and I have to say with a lot of shaving a wetting the beard</li>
            <li>I investigated the new shavers and watched the corporate video for this one.  </li>
            <li>Even new, that one&#x27;s battery only lasted 3 or 4 shaves.  </li>
            <li>I opted to try the 1150 given a replacement head for the 1060 cost $50 and the new razor was only $89.  </li>
            <li>He repairs versus buying new, but I convinced him to give this one a try after telling him about the screamin&#x27; deal I got with Amazon which included a hefty mail-in rebate - making this razor ultimately 75% off.</li>
            <li>With every razor I have, the *only* reason I have purchased a new one is because I can&#x27;t get replacement blades for the one I have.</li>
            <li>this is the second one i bought,this time i want to buy a new one for my friend.so</li>
            <li>I want to buy a new one if necessary.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely getting a smoother shave with the new shaver, but</li>
            <li>However, the new razor has clipped the skin at the corners of my mouth a couple of times and left me bleeding - ouch!  </li>
            <li>I returned this Norelco and ordered a new Remington R5130xlp (about the same price).  </li>
            <li>I am considering sending the new razor back.  </li>
            <li>My husband is on blood thinners for a medical condition, loves the new shaver.</li>
            <li>you can easily pop the cutting heads off of and then just run it under some water to clean.  </li>
            <li>For me it gives better results than my previous foil shaver, and makes far less noise.</li>
            <li>My unit is currently cracking the plastic on the on/off switch and so much for potentially using this in the shower, anymore.  </li>
            <li>It is super quiet - not even half as loud as the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>Have a basic old Norelco shaver which I like but is getting old.</li>
            <li>Back then I used a straight blade electric Remington which I definitely did not care for and</li>
            <li>My last electric shaver was a Norelco Quadra action and it&#x27;s about 15 years old.  </li>
            <li>My next Norelco will have a charging meter to tell me how much shaving time I have left.</li>
            <li>It seems it is much easier to use from former model from same company.</li>
            <li>It has an LED display that shows you how much time is left before recharging is necessary.</li>
            <li>It has an LED display that shows you how much time is left before recharging is necessary.  </li>
            <li>I do not have beard, have only light mustache which I shave everyday.  </li>
            <li>I also noticed that the foil heads had nowhere near the same number of holes as my old shaver.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would also be much better if the clipper were somehow &amp;#34;built-in&amp;#34; ... or at least if Philips was providing a proper case for storage.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of this shaver in terms of how well it works and its battery life, but one area where it really falls short is its travel-friendliness.</li>
            <li>Provides and excellent shave, but my only quibble is that you need to use a base to recharge the shaver.</li>
            <li>the blade speed is a little slow, but in general, my rate is GOOD, 3 stars.  </li>
            <li>and it is very apparent</li>
            <li>My very old Philips Norelco, which was similar in design, had just died.  </li>
            <li>Look is very sleek and the blue color is a nice change from the standard silver or black on his past</li>
            <li>holy moley, this 1150 contours my scalp/and head like no other razor or blade</li>
            <li>I thought it could be due to the first shave..</li>
            <li>They contended that the qualification for the rebate offer specified &#x27;no other discounts&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Each of the past ones has simply worn out after many years of regular use.  </li>
            <li>1150 takes me less time and less efforrt to shave, which is very important.</li>
            <li>Using for a few days now and so far the ONLY problem is that below the chin its hard to maneuver and get a good shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The new Philips Norelco 1150x is one slick shaving device that looks right out of Star Trek.</li>
            <li>The large head means that it&#x27;s harder for me to miss an errant, bit of stubble.</li>
            <li>Sorry Norelco/Amazon, but time moves on and so have I.  Moral: never change a design that has worked for many years just to sucker in some new shavers in the youth crowd who don&#x27;t know better.  </li>
            <li>I had to go over everything multiple times to get a clean shave, and I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard.  </li>
            <li>And that for me is the main disadvantage of the razor; while the Advantage 7735X shaves closely, without lotion, and even better with it, without some sort of moisturizer the SensoTouch 1150x Electric Shaver fails to shave as closely</li>
            <li>And that for me is the main disadvantage of the razor; while the Advantage 7735X shaves closely, without lotion, and even better with it, without some sort of moisturizer the SensoTouch 1150x Electric Shaver fails to shave as closely</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to press as hard to get a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>plan to file my complaints with other customer right agencies like BBB or FTC.&lt;br /&gt;For those who have been denied rebate by Phillips, you could do the same.</li>
            <li>Braun foil systems worked well for me, but, as I have gotten older and my facial hair has gotten more random in its orientation and curvature, problems developed.</li>
            <li>Works much better with water (I&#x27;ve been using mine for a week now), but I spent 20 minutes dry shaving the other day and still had \\&quot;strays\\&quot; all over my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>I used previous \\&quot;standard\\&quot; norelco razor for many  years but this surpasses it for closeness of shave, shaving in tight areas (e.g. under nose), quickness and duration of charge, and effectiveness of trimmer (separate attach).</li>
            <li>My husband uses it for general shaving purposes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We have reported this to Amazon, State Attorney general and BBB.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I just reported this issue to PA State Attorney General.</li>
            <li>But, this is all secondary: my face is, for all intents and purposes, as smooth as if shaved with a blade.</li>
            <li>, when clearly it does not cut hair properly around the neckline.</li>
            <li>only issue I had with the purchase is Philips declined my rebate request even though Amazon clearly stated it&#x27;s eligible for the rebate.</li>
            <li>For cutting long hairs, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>&quot; Clearly, that meant that you cannot use two rebates from Norelco on the same item, not that you cannot receive a discount from the seller and still be eligible for a rebate.</li>
            <li>You have to shave multiple times to have clear shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so convenient and small enough to fit anywhere.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is you have to charge it in the cradle and can&#x27;t plug the charger directly into the shaver.</li>
            <li>The razor barely cut his beard.</li>
            <li>Because the last one was almost 2 years old.</li>
            <li>No regrets on my purchase...</li>
            <li>I like the wet shave feature of this shaver so much, that i stopped using Gillette fusion.</li>
            <li>but with 3 day growth, it actually hurt to shave as my face is somewhat sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Starting with a Fusion I had by far the closest shave.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband since his 20 year old Braun is finally failing.  </li>
            <li>I have used various Norelco and Panasonic shavers for nearly 25 years.  </li>
            <li>they will reject mail-in rebate offers simply because you buy it at a discounted price from Amazon.</li>
            <li>As for the neck, I can barely shave it.</li>
            <li>I just bought this electric shaver in early janurary, after by last norelco was lost.</li>
            <li>It is definitely different in style and features than my old one.     </li>
            <li>We will see if it last me 10 years like the old one</li>
            <li>This shaver gives a close shave even though you barely feel the shaver against your face.  </li>
            <li>This razor works very well with shaving cream and a wet shave.</li>
            <li>also, if you have tried a Braun razor you  know what a loud razor sounds like.its like starting an outboard motor..  </li>
            <li>It is not as close as a razor, but the sensitive areas of my neck don&#x27;t hurt any longer from the razors after only one week.  </li>
            <li>We finally get it fixed.</li>
            <li>Hasn&#x27;t given me any razor burns and the shave is much smoother and closer than I expected from an electric razor</li>
            <li>I have a young teenager who was starting to look a bit scruffy until I purchased this razor from Phillips Norelco for him.  </li>
            <li>As the product documentation says, try to use it on every shave instead of switching back to your old razor in between.</li>
            <li>I did only once with the old shaver</li>
            <li>The 1150x has potential, but so far, has not provided as close a shave as the 8260XL.  </li>
            <li>I going back to my old shaver</li>
            <li>I returned the razor and went back to my old model.  </li>
            <li>A month after submitting the paper work, I got a notice back from Phillips saying that they don&#x27;t do dual offers (I&#x27;m paraphrasing).  </li>
            <li>I ended up going back to the old shaver.</li>
            <li>After about 10+ years, I finally had to replace m old Norelco electric shaver and replaced it with the 2d 1150/40 SensoTouch 2d.  </li>
            <li>every angle possible before i get a complete shave.  </li>
            <li>Fast charging of the accumulators, the possibility of wet shaving</li>
            <li>:-O-:</li>
            <li>i opened box and there was no trimmer O.O</li>
            <li>I can only recommend this razor for perhaps 15 year-olds with only a few whiskers or others who have light beards.</li>
            <li>I can only recommend this razor for perhaps 15 year-olds with only a few whiskers or others who have light beards.</li>
            <li>I used the same Norelco for nearly 25 years.</li>
            <li>The trimmer on this razor barely cuts hair.</li>
            <li>It simply vibrates and doesn&#x27;t do anything as far as trying to even up sideburns or even shaping my stash.</li>
            <li>I am returning this and asking for a refund and going back to my old Remington.</li>
            <li>After about a year of using it, he stopped using it and went back to his old razor.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s had far more expensive razors that haven&#x27;t worked nearly as well.  </li>
            <li>Rotaries are good for cutting longer hairs</li>
            <li>Note that I also shave my head with this razor, and again, it does okay, but not great.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I  would have to say that I am satisfied and they are standing behind their product.</li>
            <li>And even then, it still misses spots and is more frustrating than anything else.  </li>
            <li>A bit more irritating than the competition.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Design is nice and it comes with a cool charging base which needs to be used maybe every the weeks.</li>
            <li>Panasonic E8103 is a very very powerful shaver, if you have lots of hard beard, you may want to go for E8103S.</li>
            <li>Sounds a little big, the other better.</li>
            <li>The product itself is a little better than my other low priced shavers.</li>
            <li>Since I was going from a top of the line razor 3 years ago, to a middle of the line razor today, I expected that the quality would be similar but perhaps not exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>Not much better or worse than old unit, but shaving is not all that pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I had been using a Philips Norelco 1060X for a few years and was getting ready to buy new blades.</li>
            <li>This item does not travel well due to large bulky charging tray required to charge the battery.  </li>
            <li>What Amazon or norelco don&#x27;t really tell you is you half to take the head of the razor completely off to attach the mustache trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, the more expensive models supposedly have a better cutting mechanism, and a jet clean washing system for automatically cleaning the shaver.    </li>
            <li>The side burn trimmer does a poor job and is not as easy to use as the old pop-up trimmer.</li>
            <li>It is a very much improved shaver over the older, former units I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>charging cradle makes it easy to recharge (compared to tight cord plug on other shavers).&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shave is terrific, provided an extremely close shave the veru first time..</li>
            <li>It is a pretty good electric shaver but little awkward while woking around adam apple.  </li>
            <li>And really the only reason I&#x27;m taking off a star is because this one is a little harder to get right under my nose.  </li>
            <li>no matter how hard i press it against my face or neck, i just can&#x27;t feel the pressure and yet it shaves clean...</li>
            <li>it is sharp and very comfort for ..</li>
            <li>and I have to press hard to get it clean.</li>
            <li>The Senco Touch 2d is also really hard to clean, the blades and screans don&#x27;t lock in like</li>
            <li>There are other shavers out there that will shave much closer</li>
            <li>my friend likes the shaver so much, now he changed his used habit shaving the other day for everyday!additionally</li>
            <li>The other razors would not shave my throat/neck area very well.</li>
            <li>But the rebate thing is really cheating me and other customers.</li>
            <li>The recharger is a real pain in the neck it doesn&#x27;t sit in the stand as other electric razors</li>
            <li>: I was not sure if the reputed longer battery life of the more expensive models was important, but I took a chance on this.  </li>
            <li>First, the compartment to hold shavings leaves much to be desired unless you want to empty this everyday.  </li>
            <li>I decided that due to the age, the battery was probably going to go out sooner or later, so rather than pay $30 for new blades, I&#x27;d invest in a new shaver.</li>
            <li>At the end of the second round, I&#x27;m smooth to the touch and will generally not need to shave until two days later.</li>
            <li>Philips razor has been synonymous with speed and efficiency, it is not exceptional also, and the price is very cheap, but a bit less than is generally work, the color is too young to charge some instability</li>
            <li>B001AJ6YS2 Philips Norelco 7310XL Men&#x27;s Shaving System]] offers a decent shave for less.  </li>
            <li>i had one old electric shaver from Philips which did same job, just looked different.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is going straight back to Amazon with no thanks.</li>
            <li>My old Norelco electric razors used to last and last.</li>
            <li>It does a good job cutting the hairs along the jaw, above the lip, and under the neck.  </li>
            <li>takes forever to cut hair, I have to run it SLOWLY over one patch of hair for minutes to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li>I found the Norelco shaving head somewhat difficult to remove whereas the Panasonic foil was very easy to remove/replace.    </li>
            <li>Second, this shaver has a major flaw, the shaver head keeps falling off and will eventually break from hitting the floor.</li>
            <li>the online price was much less than my local target store even with shipping which was very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>The blades on this get dull sooner than the Cool Skin as well.</li>
            <li>A quick dry shave that was quiet and as close or closer than any of the Brauns, Schicks, Remingtons and other numerous Norelcos</li>
            <li>My model has automatic voltage selection, so was able to use it in Australia (240 volt) by using a small black US-AU pin adaptor plug.</li>
            <li>The only problem with the new one is the noise is little high.</li>
            <li>of all, it&#x27;s whisper quiet, which makes a big difference early in the morning, so different from foil shavers which are so noisy that it seems like shaving with a hedge trimmer.</li>
            <li>Minor drawbacks (and non-dealbreakers) all, as far as I&#x27;ve been concerned.  </li>
            <li>I got the 2d mixed up with the 3d and other higher (and more expensive) models in this line and couldn&#x27;t take advantage of the $10 manufacturer rebate.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure if this product is worth without the rebate.</li>
            <li>First of all let me say that my husband is not a shave everyday guy.</li>
            <li>It feels as if without shaving cream you&#x27;re constantly dragging your skin and irritating it more then necessary.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the manual is unclear in describing how to remove the heads to clean them.</li>
            <li>I use it on my knees and down by my ankles since I seem to cut myself with a real razor.</li>
            <li>After 3 very long phone calls on a long distance number, with CSR&#x27;s who don&#x27;t speak English very well, we are still out a shaver and out the money.  </li>
            <li>But A little defective, outsides doesn&#x27;t match completely, don&#x27;t know what cause this issue, i try to fix it by myself, work normal.</li>
            <li>I added the 1150X to my shaving thinking that due to the newer design, that it would be beter than my older Speed model.  </li>
            <li>wet and dry shave, i recommend wet shave using minimal shaving cream, but dry is just as good, its well built and charges relatively fast, not faster than using a blade but at least you aren&#x27;t buying blades all the time.</li>
            <li>(quick charge feature in a few minutes allows it to be used at full strength for a bit), but it feels unnecessarily cumbersome.  </li>
            <li>Is a little clumsy to clean out after a shave, but I use canned air from computer supplies and it makes the job much easier.</li>
            <li>As usual, Amazon delivered right on time.</li>
            <li>I figured I&#x27;d try this Razor out due to all the high review marks it&#x27;s been getting on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Frustrated with shaving irritation, I thought I&#x27;d drop $80 on a \\&quot;good\\&quot; razor, but never expected anything this good.</li>
            <li>It shaves much closer than my previous unit</li>
            <li>Even the trimmer on it won&#x27;t really trim my hair that well, much less the three shave heads.</li>
            <li>But generally I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s about the same overall.</li>
            <li>and I finally had enough of complaints from my inspector general wife that she could still see the hairs after a shave.  </li>
            <li>The material have poor quality and the plastic peels easily.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to upgrade from a cheapo unit I would go even higher than this one and spend a few extra bucks.</li>
            <li>Over the past few months I figured that electric razors have to be much better now days.</li>
            <li>Havent tried it wet yet, but no complaint just regular shaving.</li>
            <li>The first few times I used it, my skin was red.</li>
            <li>I would reccomend it to anyone, especially those who are becoming annoyed by the rising cost of blades.</li>
            <li>the suction cups on the base were not doing such a splendid job of keeping the unit stable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would have to say from the moment I switched it on (after it was fully charged), the super quiet motor, or should I say slow sounding motor, gave me some doubts even before I put it to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very comfortable, but unfortunately they cut prices!Now 30</li>
            <li>Sorry, but the Norelco 1150 simply could not shave neck hair that was more than a quarter- to a half-inch long, and it was not good in what is becoming a NECK with creases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>only drawback is used time not long enough after charging.</li>
            <li>works for dry and wet shave, i  usually use it just before going to office so its pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Some minor, and some major.</li>
            <li>It is still a lot better than some of the old shavers that I used to have, but the neck are is still a little tough.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t compare this razor to any other new ones out there -</li>
            <li>I shaved one side with this new one and shaved the other with my crappy Remington and the Remington gave me a closer shave.</li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s probably due to the new blade rather than the shaver itself.</li>
            <li>I only changed the head once two years ago and although its probably due for a new head, it still serves its purpose for me each day.</li>
            <li>all of this big mess lasted on my face for more than a week.&lt;br /&gt;- 2nd time and last time i use it, same senario happened and i knew for sure that i am not that stupid</li>
            <li>Since i have a thick growth, i prefer clean shaving everyday and this is where philips wins hands down.</li>
            <li>Only down side I would say is the trimmer isn&#x27;t as powerful as I would like, takes several cuts and still not a very clean trim.</li>
            <li>/&gt;3- Nerelco makes good product, this will get them bad</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too bad as this was otherwise a good shaver.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m fairly sure I have a handle and at least one or two blades for nearly every Gillette model going back to at least the 80&#x27;s).    </li>

            <li> I got a great price</li>
            <li> This great price also means that when it comes time to replace the blades the cost of the replacement blades will be  substantial compared to the purchase</li>
            <li> It looks great, is ergonomically designed, and gets alot of shaves on a charge.</li>
            <li> For the price ($86 I think), I am happy.  </li>

            <li> Works great.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job.</li>
            <li> IT WORKS GREAT,</li>

            <li> The battery holds a GREAT charge.</li>
            <li> but I splurged on this thinking that this would work great, but it does not.  </li>
            <li> It has a great value/price ratio.</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t got the rebate yet, shaver itself is working great beyond the look.</li>

            <li> , nice looks!</li>
            <li> if there is more spare head , it will be perfect.</li>
            <li> happened to own it!</li>
            <li> The price of this product in China is the equivalent of $353, and here, I am bought with $60, the price is very good, and the most important is that the razor is very good, my husband told me, this is I bought the best razor!</li>
            <li> My husband liked it, and especially easy to use.</li>
            <li> and it was an absolutely pleasant shaving experience.  </li>
            <li> Very stylish and great battery life.  </li>
            <li> 1150 is a good razor, I like it very much, the Amazon price is very good, quality is very good!</li>
            <li> Very loving, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Price is also very suitable</li>
            <li> I still give it a star though cuz it is all bright and whiney.</li>
            <li> but if you think about 3 times the cost of 3D .. this 2D must be better for 90% of the user and the performance is amazing and the battery life is also excellent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a huge fan of &#x27;flexible&#x27; shavers, and it took some getting used to, to achieve the best results.    </li>
            <li> Good product,</li>
            <li> Thought it would be good for shaving my head, no so.  </li>
            <li> The quality of the shave seems just as good as the 8240, although the 8240 was the \\&quot;Speed\\&quot; model</li>
            <li> I will not be returning the shaver as it is that good.  </li>
            <li> The shaver I received is good, but cannot be charged.</li>
            <li> I will buy another one for my father if the price is as good as 55 USD.</li>
            <li> The device has a good grip on it as well, which is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and its appearance looks good  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because there is a discount showing on Amazon, plus a manufacture&#x27;s rebate, which makes it a good deal.</li>
            <li> Do not have to rake it over my face for 15 to 20 minutes to get a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> That gave me a smooth shave and was very happy with it.</li>
            <li> really good.</li>
            <li> So after years of this I decided to find myself a good rotary shaver.     </li>
            <li> Good performance for an electric shaver</li>
            <li> all in all a good shaver and a good value.</li>
            <li> However, this shaver is so good that I felt compelled to write this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> My husband said the electric razor does a good job.  </li>
            <li> Good purchase for the money.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m fairly butter-fingered.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought on Nov, it is good and convinent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a good deal</li>
            <li> that is the good thing I have get it...  </li>
            <li> and yes even Bic and \\&quot;Good News\\&quot; razors.</li>
            <li> Read the review here and thought it will be good.</li>
            <li> Looked like a well made and good looking shaver</li>
            <li> No problems and feel I made a good purchase.</li>
            <li> It did a really good job</li>

            <li> It was amazing.  </li>
            <li> As a happy owner of a Norelco 7310XL which already has some years of usage I decided to upgrade to the 2d technology when a $ 30 discount for the 1150x became available at Amazon.</li>

            <li> Light, long-life battery and great shave.</li>

            <li> My husband likes this shavor-he said he is still getting used to it, but does a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d think that it would be nice for Amazon to take some actions to protect its own image as those products were sold on your site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It would have been nice to have a place to store it on the charging stand.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Great handle, nice contouring.  </li>
            <li> I try this model and really liked it.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Panasonic EA-SA40, ES7037 and ES 7103---Panny makes really, really nice razors.</li>
            <li> I tried the Remington shave stick which produced a really nice shave, but gosh the residual powder gummed up the razor.  </li>

            <li> The cleaning is a breeze, run both trimmer and shaver head through some warm water</li>
            <li> About the shaver, I already had an old Philips Norelco shaver, but this one is really good for a perfect shaving!</li>
            <li> I have been a luke warm fan of electric shavers over the years until now.  </li>
            <li> It have really nice color.</li>
            <li> It is a nice deal at the price when I brought.</li>
            <li> That is really nice.  </li>
            <li> It is cool and beautiful.</li>
            <li> It also has a nice mustache and sideburn trimmer.  </li>
            <li> A bonus for the aging among us: the shaver is even effective on ear hair.   </li>
            <li> As I said, the razor is good, but even better with shaving cream.</li>

            <li> It would be nice if there was a charging port on the shaver itself to use it corded as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I liked it,</li>
            <li> One of the nice features, which I never used and now never will, is that the shaver is waterproof.  </li>

            <li> He wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the product but kept it anyway.</li>
            <li> nice shaver.  </li>
            <li> shaving attachments sometimes fall off when shaving (the happens quite seldom and the chance of it can be minimized by making sure that you apply a good amount of pressure when inserting the shaving</li>
            <li> I guess nothing will ever match some nice shave gel and a razor in the shower.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not sure if it can stay with a good performance.</li>
            <li> has a nice stand that suits the item nicely in it.</li>

            <li> and my hubby said it&#x27;s handy and smoothy when shaving although i will never have a chance to try:).</li>
            <li> After the shaver&#x27;s in, it&#x27;s own weight makes things much more stable, though.</li>

            <li> Philips Norelco 1150x/40 and absolutely love it,very very smooth shaving  </li>
            <li> It is a friend who was too beautiful to organize a realistic price and your beard.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!!!  </li>
            <li> It certainly is egonomically designed and looks great.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very nice,my daddy is very love it!</li>
            <li> but everything still look new and good quality !</li>
            <li> I was very impressed from first cut until now with how smooth and effortlessly this keeps my face clean.</li>
            <li> if your looking for a new razor and one that&#x27;s fairly priced with a great shave and clean up</li>
            <li> Interestingly, the razor must be in the holder to recharge.</li>
            <li> Not that the look is THAT important, but it kind of is in marketing the product.  </li>
            <li> This is an awesome product that men definitely need in their bathrooms to use with grooming.    </li>
            <li> Maybe go with one of the 3D models that might change their angle to get that area better, a foil shaver, or the trusty blade.</li>
            <li> I even tried a foil shaver from a competetor but this Norelco is way better.</li>
            <li> My husband is satisfied with the effort of the product.</li>
            <li> Makes it more versatile.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric shavers for many years.</li>
            <li> It is okay on the neck</li>
            <li> There is nothing to say any more.</li>
            <li> I will not buy Philips product any more.</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon was better than I could find it anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Ok so, i was an owner of Philips norelco 8000 series with the triple track system and a cleaning station and everything.</li>
            <li> My partner was in need of one and according to him it works better than what he was expecting.  </li>
            <li> Either was a no go, so I decided to bite the bullet and return the 7340XL and find a much better shaver.    </li>
            <li> I love the look, and the design.  </li>
            <li> Then, the convenience of the design: top notch.</li>
            <li> Philips/Norelco used to bundle, which is an excellent improvement especially for travelers.    </li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s much better.     </li>
            <li> For those who don&#x27;t need the better detail trimmer, the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The trade-offs are the better features and longer battery life.  </li>
            <li> The 1150 operates faster and quieter than the 7310, and it has a better trimmer than either the 7310 or the 1250.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it requires too many passes to get them all.  </li>
            <li> The attachment trimmer works better than the 1250&#x27;s pop-up trimmer</li>
            <li> most users, lower end models like the 7310 will work sufficiently well.  </li>
            <li> For most users, lower end models like the 7310 will work sufficiently well.  </li>
            <li> give you more burn compared to rotary blades.     </li>
            <li> /&gt;The battery of the 8251XL proved to be okay.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I continued to be pleased with the shaver&#x27;s performance, the battery died after just three months.</li>
            <li> This seems to be more robust, gives an even better shave and is even quieter, but I&#x27;ll have to see if the battery holds up</li>
            <li> Sure, that&#x27;s one more thing to pack when traveling.</li>
            <li> I had a Braun 5 series before this which worked much better.   </li>
            <li> Well this shaver won&#x27;t conduct a cookout or wash your back in the shower, but it still does a real good job at shaving!  </li>
            <li> I had a beard for many years but took a position in sales that required a clean-cut look.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quieter, more comfortable, smooth on the face and does a good job on neck hair.  </li>
            <li> Love it.&lt;br /&gt;July</li>
            <li> I purchased this after watched a famous website&#x27;s suggestion.</li>
            <li> This thing is absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li> More cuts; more discomfort.  </li>
            <li> Nice and smooth too.  </li>
            <li> My shaves did get better the more</li>
            <li> but I attribute that to me learning how to use it more than my face getting used to it.</li>
            <li> I assume that the 3D will shave quicker because it has more blades</li>
            <li> I was ALSO able to apply for a $30 SensoTouch rebate, still waiting for the rebate check from Norelco, hope they make goon on that offer.    </li>
            <li> if the $30 rebate comes, that makes it an even better bargain.</li>
            <li> So I wonder how guys whose hair grows out faster are satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE that the unit can be cleaned under running water.  </li>
            <li> Battery life is good and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> but it took more than 15 days to ship it.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It would be better if it had another option for charging (i.e. a side plug in)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I have done this for MANY years.</li>
            <li> Just off the top of my head I have used Atra, Sensor, Tracer, Headblade, Mach 3 , Proglide, Hydro5</li>
            <li> We can make electricty, but we can&#x27;t make more water. :-).</li>
            <li> , okay....</li>
            <li> Afta Pre-Electric (better than Lectric Shave or Face-Saver for me),</li>
            <li> SO CLOSE and SO COMFORTABLE!</li>
            <li> It just doesnt do its job,,,need to use razor on top of it for a uniform shave.</li>
            <li> They choose not inform the customer of rebate disqualification - counting on customer forgetfulness and expiration of merchandise return period;  (iii) It is at best an attempt to control customer&#x27;s end purchase price with a third party vendor.  </li>
            <li> OK.  </li>
            <li> Still satisfied with Norelco electric razors.</li>
            <li> It shaves closely even when I have two days&#x27; growth, which is much more than I could say for the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> U r not repent of this purchasing. :)</li>
            <li> if i got chance ,i will buy more.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more, he sent this type shaver to his friends as gifts and share this convenience.</li>
            <li> I had assumed Phillips is a reputable company.</li>
            <li> The battery life alone is why I love it.</li>
            <li> When I bought it, I was told that I would receive a rebate, however, I receive nothing after more than three months.</li>
            <li> Norelco usually is better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I DOUBT IT TAKES ME MORE THAN 20-30 SECONDS.</li>
            <li> /&gt;THE REMOVAL PROCESS OF THE HEADS REQUIRES MORE EFFORT THAN NOT.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my legs, most men&#x27;s shavers don&#x27;t do well on legs</li>
            <li> I had many trimmers  </li>
            <li> Most of the time I replace just to replace.  </li>
            <li> Tried this one and assumed newer design meant better shave...</li>
            <li> I like and satisfied.</li>
            <li> Glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Made my gift shopping much easier and he is happy, too.  </li>
            <li> although 7310 is cheaper, it is better, more convenient, shaves better, much much better.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more.</li>
            <li> It does the job, but just costs a bit more than it</li>
            <li> Also it nicks me more than an electric shaver should.</li>
            <li> This item is absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li> It gives a much closer shave and looks great on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> i will give more information .</li>
            <li> It gets the job done better than the lower-end models and won&#x27;t blow a hole in your wallet.</li>
            <li> I have used this shaver for two day,and  I love it.</li>
            <li> But simple is the best I believe so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m glad I tried it again.</li>
            <li> Like so many others; I never received the $30 rebate.</li>
            <li> OK,i will shop in amazon more times...</li>
            <li> One more bulky thing to pack if you travel with it.</li>
            <li> I have shaved with Norelco shavers for 40 years and love them.</li>
            <li> It was and has been my all time favorite.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that you can just wash it out after each use.</li>
            <li> But with promotion, I think it is ok to have it.</li>
            <li> Most of all, I like the feature that it can be water cleaned.</li>
            <li> Will order another though, so as not to have to share with beard, mustache hairs, etc.......:)</li>
            <li> Effective and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I hope I can buy more as gifts.</li>
            <li> For the price after rebate, I would have given it more stars.</li>
            <li> Overall it was excellent!</li>
            <li> well designed and a pleasure to use it has redefined my morning shave for the better.</li>
            <li> Philips have proven that they are one of the best brands in the area of electric personal grooming devices.</li>
            <li> Norelco electric shavers have been my shaver of choice for more years than I can remember.</li>
            <li> Overall, very impressed.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> My skin looks so much better.</li>
            <li> I did not see a need to spend more for the bells and whistles, and I was relieved that my thoughts were correct.</li>
            <li> The shaver is OK.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy one more for my dad.  </li>
            <li> It had served me well for many years but was beyond repair.</li>
            <li> If you buy this, you will be pleased with what you get.</li>
            <li> I guess Philips didn&#x27;t expect so many people bought it</li>
            <li> He has never found an electric he could use, and since using this has been pleased.</li>
            <li> He enjoys the fact that if water gets on this razor it is ok.</li>
            <li> You can shave many times before the battery needs to be recharged again.  </li>
            <li> changed to cheaper model from Braun, and it works so much better for me</li>
            <li> and price is great,besides i got coupon from AMAZON and save even more money  </li>
            <li> comfortable to use in terms of swiveling and moving around, no snagging hairs&lt;br /&gt;--Cradle for charging is a really nice touch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> may have had better luck with the 3d</li>
            <li> Quiet and the battery life is awesome.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor 90 days ago, and have been nothing but pleased with its sleek design, and elegant battery and charging lights.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> You would do better finding a $19 unit as it will work just as well.</li>
            <li> The closeness of the shave is so much better that this is all I use now.  </li>
            <li> I haven’t been able to get more than 2 years on these Phillips / Norelco</li>
            <li> It has been more than 3 months since I submitted it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with electric shavers for more years than I care to mention.</li>
            <li> That was my favorite shaver.</li>
            <li> -Battery&#x27;s life of my Smarttouch is way better than 1150x.</li>
            <li> saw to many T.V. ads</li>
            <li> I may find more uses for it&#x27;s expanded capabilities over time.</li>
            <li> he will be satisfied with it!&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> THIS RAZOR IS BETTER THAN I EZPECTED.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the best for its price~~~~~~good present for me.so</li>
            <li> I was pleased by the reviews and therefore decided to purchase it.  </li>
            <li> 3D&#x27;s are out; costing more, and Norelco will probably be phasing the 2D&#x27;s out in favor of the 3D version eventually.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a better electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Outstanding results.</li>
            <li> this found much better price.  </li>
            <li> think this is more for people with thinner hairs, thinner beards, and who shave everyday.&lt;br /&gt;Kudos.</li>
            <li> a try you will be satisfied with results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> think most man like it.</li>
            <li> The shaving system is ok but never received my $30 rebate.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;No more than 15</li>
            <li> so I do not have much to add, but it works great for me.</li>
            <li> This have and ergonomic shape and metal sheets that endures many many many uses.</li>
            <li> It has so many quirks, and the &amp;#34;ergonomic&amp;#34; design does not contour as it should.</li>
            <li> and Whistles: The 1090 has more bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with its performance</li>
            <li> My father-in-law is satisfied with this electric razor.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> Buy a gift to my friends, my friends love it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Have not bought this product, but unless you are 100% sure you will like it</li>
            <li> This razor more tha met my expectations.</li>
            <li> I think, it is OK.</li>
            <li> This was one of the presents I got my husband for Christmas, he has been wanting one for years, but I wanted to be sure to get one that did the job, no complaints.  </li>
            <li> you will find the 3D may be even better</li>
            <li> Holding up well, been using it for over 6 months, glad I got it.</li>
            <li> Outstanding.)</li>
            <li> so I am not 100% satisfied with the shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with it</li>
            <li> The downside to this setup is that the trimmer is a separate piece, whereas most shavers have the trimmer integrated into the shaver itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The downside to this setup is that the trimmer is a separate piece, whereas most shavers have the trimmer integrated into the shaver itself.    </li>
            <li> The 1090 has more bells and whistles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dabbled here and there with electrics over the years but have mostly stayed with the disposable-blade system.  </li>
            <li> It seems to do a better job with shaving cream</li>
            <li> I believe my dad will love it</li>
            <li> Perfect for daily shaving.</li>
            <li> but i love it</li>
            <li> i personally love this</li>
            <li> i love it and will continue to use it on my legs.  </li>
            <li> I resorted to my Gillette Fusion to shave my sideburns more efficiently and speedily.  </li>
            <li> Just pop the top of the shaving unit off, and run it under the faucet.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the 1150X.</li>
            <li> The head does a wonderful job of adapting to your face to get as many hairs as possible; you can even use it in the shower!</li>
            <li> it works ok.</li>
            <li> this is nothing better than an electric face massager.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s water proof, so I can shave in the shover.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my father as a gift, he love it</li>
            <li> But could just never bring myself to pay hundreds for something better.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product and I am loving the experience.</li>
            <li> SURE I&#x27;D GET A CLOSE SHAVE,</li>
            <li> The SensoTouch 2D models looked interesting and were not outrageously priced like some of the newer 3D 1200-series models.</li>
            <li> But, I was sceptical that they would do a dramatically better job than my existing shaver.    </li>
            <li> so it is ok.</li>
            <li> ( you cannot kill yourself with a cordless shaver, don&#x27;t ask :-)</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> So ended up paying more like $60 for it.  </li>
            <li> exxelente maquina de afeitar le queda la cara suave y sin irritacion,recomiendo este producto justo lo que yo buscava ok</li>
            <li> great product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Even a 20 pounds shaver I bought in the UK some years ago shaved better than this one.</li>
            <li> The 1150x does a better job on my neck than the 8140XL.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;SensoTouch 2D\\&quot; means the blades push in and out and flex to the contours of your face better.</li>
            <li> Stunning appearence as the picture shown on web</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE GILLETTE, BUT</li>
            <li> I have used the Norelco shavers for years and this is my latest acquisition.  </li>
            <li> This purchase from Amazon comes out to be about $20 more than I would have paid at Costco.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been having issues with too many hairs that got missed by my shaver.</li>
            <li> In addition, I am used to and now prefer to be able to shave in a circular motion to catch my hairs from all angles.  </li>
            <li> I wish the construction was a litter heavier and more sturdy.</li>
            <li> takes up to eight minutes for my face to feel decently smooth, and this after wetting whiskers at beginning and during shave with warm water.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m 200% satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> think he love it also.</li>
            <li> The downside to this setup is that the trimmer is a separate piece, whereas most shavers have the trimmer integrated into the shaver itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am confident that the 1150X is the best one I&#x27;ve used-and I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 weeks!</li>
            <li> and he just love it.</li>
            <li> He told me in China it costs more than 3,000RMB.</li>
            <li> It is quieter than most shavers I have owned.</li>
            <li> I will appreciate if you have better idea.</li>
            <li> The shaver is OK</li>
            <li> Not that the rebate will make it a better product.</li>
            <li> For $90, we were expecting a better product.</li>
            <li> and i can not understand any review with more than one star.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was ok when it lasted.</li>
            <li> im sure</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Trust me, like many of you guys</li>
            <li> /&gt;In terms of the product, it&#x27;s just a $20 product with a bit more fancier design.</li>
            <li> This problem is more an over all three head shaver problem and not a Phillips problem</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I bought</li>
            <li> This mid range shaver is great!</li>
            <li> Im sure they make better ones every year</li>
            <li> /&gt;i love it ~</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> I would routinely go a week or more between shaves.   </li>
            <li> This seems to be more of a \\&quot;take your time\\</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t, I love this shaver.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think you will get a better shave, just more bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> The shave isnt quite as close as you would get with a manual razor but its much better and quicker than any electric razor I have used before.</li>
            <li> Battery is more durable, have not yet been charged.</li>
            <li> I bought it use when in a time crunch and truly love it.</li>
            <li> All done :)</li>
            <li> The quality is perfect and same as shopping.  </li>
            <li> overall a great shave!</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> and I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> will buy one more for my father.</li>
            <li> okay ..........</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the 7310 instead, as it is a much better value.</li>
            <li> My 10 dollar beard trimmer does a better job.</li>
            <li> * Chatted with AMAZON and had much better experience, a customer shouldn&#x27;t have to go through this, but</li>
            <li> Since we are all time having problem with Phillip Norelco rebate, we would switch to Panasonic shaver since Panasonic gives better service.</li>
            <li> I hope it costs them a lot more than the amount they saved on all of the $30 rebates</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m leaving this feedback more for the company than for the product.</li>
            <li> I am so love it,I want to buy more,but you limitied the number,how can i do</li>
            <li> and I was hoping that over the years they have gotten better.  </li>
            <li> What a sexy looking shaver.</li>
            <li> Better ergos in my opinion as well, but that is subjective.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco razors for more than 50 years.  </li>
            <li> Some have been better shavers than others.  </li>
            <li> My son requested this shaver and I found it on Amazon for a better price than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> ok?</li>
            <li> Just got it and love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I have switched to an epilator that works MUCH better.</li>
            <li> looks nice and really comfortable.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s water proof,  </li>
            <li> Okay.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> This shaver is a top of the line instrument.</li>
            <li> I purchased it Nov. 20, 2011, three more uses per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> there are four more cracks around the button&#x27;s cave (see my uploaded pictures</li>
            <li> I just got mine yesterday, much better than Philips/Norelco 7340XL</li>
            <li> all in all not any faster or more convenient than a manual.</li>
            <li> and it was fantastic!</li>
            <li> it took about a week for my beard to adjust - and the results were just okay.</li>
            <li> probably as with most products in todays world.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I love this shaving feeling, the price is materially beneficial.</li>
            <li> and the price is much reasonable than best buy.&lt;br /&gt;wash, clean is easy.</li>
            <li> like。I hope to be able to better</li>
            <li> Sexy out look of the product had been the biggest reason I bought it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for 3 months now and cannot and have never been able to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> For the money it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> better than all the rest.</li>
            <li> All of them would work ok, but I would have to shave my neck/</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I love this shaver.  </li>
            <li> Too famous razor.</li>
            <li> OK...</li>
            <li> The Best part and why i would recommend:&lt;br /&gt;- Baby-smooth shave for facial hairs on cheek and jaw-line.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Sleek design with elegant looks</li>
            <li> bought many of it for gifts.</li>
            <li> Much better than ther klast generation Norelco Razor.  </li>
            <li> Dis keeps me lookin fresh as fuh fo da ladies and works good</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s great!I love</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco products forever and the one that I bought recently is the best one.</li>
            <li> made and really love it.</li>
            <li> shaver itself is ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not as pleased with this as I&#x27;d hoped I&#x27;d be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned, but it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> I liked the addition of 3 miniature suction cups at the bottom of the cradle, and they provided surprisingly good grip without requiring much depression of the cradle.  </li>
            <li> Not only it shaves very smooth and the result is very good, but it is very easy to be cleaned as well.</li>
            <li> Not only it shaves very smooth and the result is very good, but it is very easy to be cleaned as well.</li>
            <li> It just cut clean and very easy to use and cleaning is very easy  </li>
            <li> Very good razor, I recommend to anyone who is not very stiff bristles.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver that I&#x27;ve ever used, sharp, comfortable and good looking.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The packaging is right good.</li>
            <li> I have been using older models of Norelco for 15 years, all with excellent success.  </li>
            <li> The battery life is fantastic, its easy to use and shaves close and very smooth, it contours nicely to your face.  </li>
            <li> wish all have a happy new year!  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to clean and delivers a very smooth shave</li>
            <li> Nice, clean shave.  </li>
            <li> It gives a smooth and comfortable shave, is easy to use and a good value.</li>
            <li> One can get a pretty good shave out of most items out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, out of the box I liked the design and ease of removing parts to clean.  </li>
            <li> This works better than the lower-end models, as it moves around more easily and fits in my hand better.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older Panasonic, and once I got the feel for using it, I&#x27;m quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been successfully using various Braun shavers for abou 20 years and wouldn&#x27;t have even considered purchasing this one except for a combination coupon/rebate deal which made the price too good to pass up.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer does its work great, but you have to remove the main shaver head and insert the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> very easy to use and gives a close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> very easy to use, and it&#x27;s so cheap</li>
            <li> Great product, would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It has a good value for money,I like it very much.</li>
            <li> It shaves very clean everywhere except for my jawline--really just under my jaw/upper neck area.</li>
            <li> But if your beard is not bushy, maybe it can&#x27;t shave your beard very clean.</li>
            <li> Love that this can be rinsed clean, very easy.  </li>
            <li> I used to shave the beard is very clean.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This was the best investment I have made in a long time.</li>
            <li> It works pretty good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty fairly priced razor and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> in all, it&#x27;s pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Besides, the attachment does a pretty good job doing touch up work.</li>
            <li> The product is pretty good, and so is the price after $30 discount.</li>
            <li> The shaving is also pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good</li>
            <li> Pretty good</li>
            <li> Pretty good</li>
            <li> He said it was pretty good.</li>
            <li> Best buy I have made in a long time.    </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a pretty good razor for the money</li>
            <li> As I shave with it more and more, it gets more comfortable and a closer shave, just like the manual said.</li>
            <li> He and I loved it so much we brought one for my father!</li>
            <li> Excellent for slightly long hairs for people like me who shave once in 3-4 days&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m interested to see how good the replacement heads are for this model, they were not satisfactory for prevkious model.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the top end of the new Philips Norelco line, but it also isn&#x27;t $300+ and in that regard it provides a very nice counterpoint to today&#x27;s blade shaving systems.  </li>
            <li> Good and not expensive  worthy and nice deal  </li>
            <li> It gives a very clean shave, and it&#x27;s very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift and He loves it , great price , norelco has always been a grat product and this new razor was  </li>
            <li> I have owned this brand razor for years and this new version is great.  </li>
            <li> I had the Norelco architect razor which was great when it was new</li>
            <li> happy with this new shaver...</li>
            <li> The design of the charging stand is elegant, and the razor slips in and out easily.  </li>
            <li> gives a good clean shave, is easy to clean and water can rinse it with out hurting any of the moving parts.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so greatful, cheap,and i love it.it&#x27;s  easy to use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so greatful, cheap,and i love it.it&#x27;s  easy to use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any better than my 10years old shaver, but I thought it was still a great buy for $20.</li>
            <li> Overall, an excellent shaver, comfortable sooth shave, sleek design lines.  </li>
            <li> This razor gave me the best shave with such a light touch.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the shave quality to be quite as good, but I&#x27;m actually finding that it&#x27;s slightly superior (and I do replace blades).  </li>
            <li> My SmartTouch XL 9160 XL is more than 5 years old and still works great.</li>
            <li> That said, the most comfortable shave I was able to get was post shower with shaving cream.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing on this Earth beats a blade, but this razor is sleek, smooth, gets close enough, &amp; i&#x27;m a very happy customer!</li>
            <li> It would be better if  it was much more cheap.</li>
            <li> So far (1 month), I am happy with it, would give a better grade wasn&#x27;t for the lightness of the body.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much much more cheaper than China.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty good and like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Light weight, very quiet and excellent product.</li>
            <li> this good is not quiet good.</li>
            <li> i loved it , the battery last a lot longer than what they say , and i loved the fact that i received the item 3 days after placing the order even thou</li>
            <li> Found it very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to clean</li>
            <li> It is VERY easy to take apart and clean.</li>
            <li> Loved the Panasonics, but decided to try the Philips Norelco 1150X/40 based on positive reviews I read here.</li>
            <li> Generally I think this is a good shaver, but I think I liked the 8140XL better.</li>
            <li> Is worth purchasing, the price is ok!</li>
            <li> This razor is fantastic, cuts close, and is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> This razor is very light weight and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> As a very long-time Norelco/Philips user I am pleased to say this new model is the best electric shaver I have used yet.</li>
            <li> It was more portable and did a fine job shaving.  </li>
            <li> They work just fine as a vanity top appliance.  </li>
            <li> It just does not provide a clean, convenient shave!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s fast, very easy to clean and provides a good shave</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and looks cool.  </li>
            <li> so kind of used this over a year and kind of give up on this shaving, I mainly use this for trimming sideburns now.</li>
            <li> For the price range it is a very good unit and I would recommnend it to anyone for a quality shave, trimming and daily useage.</li>
            <li> very good The design on the SensoTouch is quite futuristic, with a blue front, curved body, and perched shave head.</li>
            <li> Although I bought it one month before thanksgiving deal and cost a little more than the biggest deal, still it is a great deal for this good product</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;ve got the light good and bright and spot some whiskers that didn&#x27;t get clipped, I&#x27;ll run around and over and back and forth and seem not to make any progress.  </li>
            <li> This senso touch tilts and moves to the countours of the face for the smoothest and most comfortable shave ever.</li>
            <li> For wet shaving I was really impressed with this razor.  </li>
            <li> But with this razor if my skin is wet( like after a shower) and I can just use some shave gel and get a perfect shave.      </li>
            <li> This Philips Norelco 1150x/40 is in my opinion one of the best rotary wet shavers I have used.</li>
            <li> It shaves wonderfully around the neck region, with minimal irritation.</li>
            <li> So, to keep up with military appearance, I feel that this shaver does and excellent job!  </li>
            <li> I dont think it is quicker or closer than a blade, but It is much more comfortable and does not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s justa more comfortable alternative.</li>
            <li> It works well, and the most important we purchased during thanksgiving, there are $30 rebate from amazon and $30 from phiplips too.</li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon for having such a great price for the shaver and thank you to Phillips Norelco for making such a great product!</li>
            <li> With the amount/type of surface area I have to cover, the rotary seems to be a better fit for my shaving routine.  </li>
            <li> However, this was by far the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced for five day stubble.  </li>
            <li> wow what a great shave.</li>
            <li> Excellent close shave esp if you use the wet option with shave cream.  </li>
            <li> This is the most comfortable shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Look at the video&#x27;s, and check out phillip&#x27;s website to get more detailed information about the shaver.</li>
            <li> the most important is</li>
            <li> AND we hope we can get more cheap goods fm you.</li>
            <li> Shaver shaves well,but if you wet shave with lather it is awesome.</li>
            <li> (Nov 9, 2014): Still going as my primary razor. :)</li>
            <li> So, the amount of irritation a razor produces is what is most important to me.  </li>
            <li> It did do a great job except my lower neck near my adam&#x27;s apple.  </li>
            <li> I am happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> No complaints so far, it works great.</li>
            <li> What a great shaver, def an upgrade to my old 10year razor.</li>
            <li> And even if you are able to fit in a travel bag or another part of your suitcase, you have to worry about it breaking it  - thus eliminating your ability to charge your shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s enjoy this shaver :)</li>
            <li> tried using it in the shower, but didn&#x27;t really have a good experience.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice electric shaver, and I believe it&#x27;s worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Did take me a week or two to really figure out how to get a good shave with it.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, good service and exellent produt.  </li>
            <li> thanks to norelco for a good shaver,</li>
            <li> This razor is really good, very domineering..</li>
            <li> I would recommend a norelco to anyone who wants a good reliable razor.</li>
            <li> very good,good price good shaver</li>
            <li> THANKS FOR A GOOD PRODUCT  </li>
            <li> Works very well - good shave.</li>
            <li> I find I really need to stretch my skin to get a good close shave.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a good electric shaver and with reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Not big,not heavy,it&#x27;s in a good price and very usefull for me!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A good product, and shipping is fast too.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Really gives a good shave.</li>
            <li> Good so far, shaves nice and close, holds a charge, comfortable to grip.  </li>
            <li> CLEANING: Just a quick word about cleaning; it&#x27;s very easy to perform here.  </li>
            <li> Overall, very good, but the razor head is easy to get rid of, a heads scrapped, sad&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> The new ones are better, but this shaver is good for the price point.</li>
            <li> very useful and cheap!</li>
            <li> it is greatwish more goods like this~~~~~it is very useful and Convenient.</li>
            <li> Quick charge, and has a nice comfortable feel in my hand.  </li>
            <li> ITS VERY SMOOTH ON YOUR SKIN AND A BREEZE TO CLEAN</li>
            <li> The trimmer isn&#x27;t great, but other than that I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I found the best results by simply wetting my face and then rinsing the shaver with warm water, thus getting a very close comfortable shave.      </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave very clean but quite comfortable.</li>
            <li> It, like every other electric razor that I have tried, is not the greatest at shaving the neck.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to save your original receipt if you&#x27;re thinking or taking advantage of the 45-day trial.</li>
            <li> THIS NORELCO, MAY TAKE A LITTLE MORE TIME, BUT IT IS EXCELLENT, AND GETS U SHAVED CLOSE.  </li>
            <li> I could not ask for a better razor, definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I received it last week ,it&#x27;s beatful,and smooth to the skin, very good.</li>
            <li> I bought it when it on deal, the price is good and item is better than my old electric razor, I would like to buy another one for my friend.</li>
            <li> It was easy to plug in the stand and wait for the razor to charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Cleaning is also quite easy.</li>
            <li> Like the stand has plungers so sticks easy.</li>
            <li> Most important is this Shaver cheap</li>
            <li> Shaver is really easy on my skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s on and is easy to remove and replace.</li>
            <li> The 1050 is one of the models with flip-out heads which makes it easy to rinse but is not designed for disassembly.</li>
            <li> But for convenience, rechargeable battery, fit and finish, and light weight, this Norelco has a lot of appealing features.</li>
            <li> Love the extra trimmer attachment which works great.</li>
            <li> Just another shaver that doesn&#x27;t do the job easily.</li>
            <li> It also charges very quickly and holds that charge for well over a week.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s easy to switch heads and</li>
            <li> but I dont buy into the cleaning systems because this one washes easily under the faucet once you remove the cutters.</li>
            <li> The heads pop off easily for cleaning.  </li>
            <li> But like I said, it would be good to be able to plug in directly and not have to carry the stand when doing extended travel.  </li>
            <li> Easy to operate and smoth.</li>
            <li> One of the good parts can be smooth shaving that doesn&#x27;t require to much power.</li>
            <li> but they aren&#x27;t as easy on the skin as this</li>
            <li> The charger is sturdy and the shaver settings are easy to figure out.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Also, we received the product in a very quick manner.</li>
            <li> You can wash the head after easily removing it, and you can brush the hair out of the receptacle under the heads.</li>
            <li> You can wash the head after easily removing it, and you can brush the hair out of the receptacle under the heads.</li>
            <li> give this thing five stars quite easily, and without exaggeration.  </li>
            <li> It gives me a close shave fairly easily.  </li>
            <li> It is a very quick click (just a pull) to remove the shaving blades and click in the trimming attachment.  </li>
            <li> Using once a day I can easily get two weeks out of a charge.  </li>
            <li> Close shave, easy to maintain, locking feature for travel to avoid discharge, easy cradle charge</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s easy on your skin</li>

            <li> It was easy to use and gave a close shave.</li>
            <li> It shaves close and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold, lightweight, cleans well.  </li>
            <li> It could easily be solved with a port in the shaver into which the charging cord could be plugged.</li>
            <li> With coupons, the price is the lowest and the product is so easy to use</li>
            <li> I have found it to be exceptionally easy to clean - much better than electrics of yore.  </li>
            <li> Easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> It works well, shaves my face well cleans up easily.</li>
            <li> Cleans easily,  keeps a charge and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to hold, even when soapy.  </li>
            <li> This however does make it a bit easier to use the trimmer, since the unit is so easy to hold.</li>
            <li> easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and easy to use.</li>

            <li> It easily does the job</li>
            <li> , I really enjoy the wet shave, it fly&#x27;s on your face!!</li>
            <li> So I think it&#x27;s better to use manual to keep clean</li>
            <li> Even with the trimmer attachment, does not remove hair easily.  </li>

            <li> may be easy to broke.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the people this works for don&#x27;t have iron strong beard hair</li>
            <li> If you have strong beard hair and neckline hair, save yourself the pain and discomfort, and avoid this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> /&gt;UPDATE (Nov 25, 2011):  Still going strong.  </li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s not as strong either.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I will not buy another product from Phillips Norelco and would strongly recommend that no one else does, until they fix their customer service.</li>
            <li> Still going strong.</li>
            <li> Good things, the use of down feeling good, and the price is very cheap, hope Amazon continues to launch cheap goodies.</li>
            <li> for me this is a&lt;br /&gt;Great alternative to the high cost of shaving , and for me 99% as good as a pro.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> HE LIKED IT VERY MUCH.</li>
            <li> it can go in the shower with it and does a good job I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Although I have not used it for too long, the charge seems to be very good.      </li>
            <li> The package is very good, nothing misses during long way transportation.  </li>
            <li> But I have to admit this one is a complete improvement, very smoth easy to use, very good desing, and the materials are way more durable</li>
            <li> First off, this is a really nice razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to accept that these incidents are a trade off for a perceptibly closer shave and my own experience tells me that my beard growth will adapt.</li>
            <li> I didnt give it five stars simply because there is still nothing better than a good ol razor shave :)  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give the close shave that bladed razors give you, but it comes pretty close and is a nice option to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> is my first letter of praise of any kind, ever.  </li>
            <li> Work&#x27;s okay, but would really have to shell out more money for a better electric razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gift to my friend, and my first time to buy this kind stuff.</li>
            <li> After about a year of searching for a great quality product at a reasonable price (for full-time college student), I am delighted with my final choice.   </li>
            <li> Grate razor and it cuts close and fast with no pulling, it is easy to clean and holds a good charge.</li>
            <li> High cost of a Philips electric shavers, discounts are also very affordable, in line with my request, the effect is also very good use</li>
            <li> Great value, and clean and soft shaving.</li>
            <li> Good touch feeling ,voice is very light,easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best electric razor I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> This is hands down the best shaver I have ever owned!</li>
            <li> Ordered from Australia and it arrived very quickly with tracking available.</li>
            <li> Fine shaver - five stars.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very happy for the price paid, less than $90 on the internet, and</li>
            <li> Shaver works fine</li>
            <li> purchased this product with a mail in rebate on reading all the fine print plus asking an amazon rep about its validity.</li>
            <li> It works fine then.  </li>
            <li> But, since it holds a charge for over two weeks it suites my just fine.</li>
            <li> I can shave my face and neck very quickly and smoothly.</li>
            <li> It works fine.</li>
            <li> That said, however, I have a sparse light beard that should be easy to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> The razor work just fine.</li>
            <li> Cheap and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I still wasn&#x27;t overly impressed for the first week or two of daily use.</li>
            <li> Quite cheap and easy to use...  </li>
            <li> Plus, I&#x27;m a shower shaver and it works just fine in the shower -</li>
            <li> I do not know if it works fine.</li>
            <li> Brought this for my husband and it is the first (of many shavers) to get those stubborn, short,white hairs and leaves him so smooth!</li>
            <li> It seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> The battery life is outstanding and I love the ease of cleaning the head after each use just by running it under hot water.</li>
            <li> A quick charge feature allows you to charge the shaver for 5 minutes, and get 3 minutes of shaving time, but sometimes 5 minutes is more than I have when I&#x27;m in a rush.  </li>
            <li> Most have lasted well and shaved adequately.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty quiet, looks good, holds a good charge and cleans easy</li>
            <li> A quick charge feature allows you to charge the shaver for 5 minutes, and get 3 minutes of shaving time, but sometimes 5 minutes is more than I have when I&#x27;m in a rush.</li>
            <li> I came to the conclusion that Philips cares more about $30 than it does about its loyal customers.  </li>
            <li> i feel very suitable to use it.although this product is 2D system,its very good,shaving quickly and clean.i will suggest to my friend buying it.</li>
            <li> his face feels much, much smoother than I can ever remember it feeling before - which I love!  </li>
            <li> I think he will love it very much!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Holds its charge, easy to recharge, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Cuts well, smooth, small, comfortable in the hand, and the battery is most impressive.  </li>
            <li> Mainly the price is also very satisfied</li>
            <li> This Electric Shaver Cheap and fine.</li>
            <li> The best razor my boyfriend ever had he loves it!.simple to use works great dry or wet.</li>
            <li> it is certainly tempting to consider an electric shaver as a cost effective alternative.</li>
            <li> , I had settled on the Norelco approach to shaving as the best for me and thought there was little else Norelco could do to improve.</li>
            <li> Discount is very good, love family, very to force, hope still to discount next time, I will continue to buy</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, super sharp, no irritation, battery holds an excellent charge.....</li>
            <li> The shave I get was smooth, no nicks, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, comfortable, close shave.</li>
            <li> Light, smooth and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Light weight, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Also its made in the Netherlands \\&quot;NOT CHINA\\&quot; which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> Shaving gel makes a huge difference with this razor.</li>
            <li> This is a huge step backwards.</li>
            <li> They are comfortable and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Loves this shaver recently shaved my head and it does a great job of keeping my head  smooth without irritation .</li>
            <li> The head bends well with the contour of the whole face and shaves nice and smooth without giving a rash.</li>
            <li> That will eventually leave a huge hole.  </li>
            <li> I got this razor for Christmas and still haven&#x27;t used it more than 5 times, but I really liked it so far.</li>
            <li> Light weight.</li>
            <li> The blades are easy to clean too.  </li>
            <li> I get a close shave free of any skin irritation.</li>
            <li> it is a a nice product,specially for people who has much mustache.  </li>
            <li> It cut the hairs easily and is a breeze to clean.</li>
            <li> Purchased this one because I thought it would be a smoother comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Pulls, grabs, pinches and does not deliver a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> The trimmer requires manual attachment, though it&#x27;s worth it since it functions better than the pop-up on the 1250&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> Enjoy.</li>
            <li> He gets a close, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> It is comfortable to use</li>
            <li> and I found the Norelco didn&#x27;t move as smoothly across the skin as the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> /&gt; After the shave the razor was easy to clean and reassemble.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am happy with this norelco and would recommend it.</li>

            <li> Took it for a test run, it is really smooth without getting yanked or pulled, contours to your jaw and shaves every hair, assuming you give it a bit of a circular motion  </li>
            <li> I could not believe how smooth and effortless this razor removed the hair.  </li>
            <li> SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver is nice, shipping fast.</li>

            <li> Since this is an entry-level model, it does not come with the jet clean system, but a quick run under the faucet is more than sufficient to clean the 1150X, unless you&#x27;re Chewbacca.    </li>

            <li> very useful  very useful very useful</li>
            <li> Only takes a couple seconds and does a great job keeping it clean.</li>
            <li> Nice clean shave, haven&#x27;t tested with shaving foam, as it is capable of it</li>
            <li> and you can shave everyday when you take a shower!It looks very nice and handle well!</li>
            <li> He was excited to try it, but immediately commented on how light and \\&quot;chintzy\\&quot; it felt.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase :) It is very practical and very efficient.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with my new shaver&#x27;s smooth cut, quiet operation, and length of retaining its charge.  </li>
            <li> Very fit, I like it hope to be able to have the more preferential activities Fast charging, motion gentle</li>
            <li> Shaves beautifully but is very plastic like compared with old world shavers.  </li>
            <li> He tells me he likes it because it gives him a clean, smooth shave  and doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin.  </li>
            <li> Super smooth save with easy clean up.</li>
            <li> This shaver gives a smooth and clean shave.</li>
            <li> I was slightly bummed but still happy I was able to get it so cheap.</li>
            <li> Easy to grab when in the bathroom and get a quick shave.</li>
            <li> I like it, would buy again, but not as handy as the classic design.</li>
            <li> Cleaning is easy and quick.</li>
            <li> With this easy and quick Norelco I now shave every day.</li>
            <li> and you have to really work at it to get a good shave in the first place.</li>
            <li> (I use a gel), but that may be largely imagined because it glides so much more easily.  </li>
            <li> Very close and nick free and clean up is very easy.</li>
            <li> price is very affordable, very easy to use, he said.</li>
            <li> Good product with reasonable price, there are no reasons not to love it so far!  </li>
            <li> each new model seems to do a better job!</li>
            <li> I received the razor in just a few days and not only that it does a great job for shaving, i love the way it looks and the handling was great too.</li>
            <li> I love it very much and will continue shopping in Amazon.</li>
            <li> The motor does not run very fast, but is still OK.</li>
            <li> i buy it for my father ,he love it very much</li>
            <li> My son love it very much.  </li>
            <li> Great, my husband really like this product, which is his New Year&#x27;s gift.</li>
            <li> I just use it \\&quot;Dry\\&quot; with some &#x27;Lectric Shave lotion, but when I have a little more time in the morning I use it with Edge gel and that is really the best combination.  </li>
            <li> good  very useful ， its  very helpful  for me ,and  whats important is its  very  cheap！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！  </li>
            <li> A good shave is easy to get in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> Works quick, doesn&#x27;t tug and it easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great shaver that allows you a quick shave, if you don&#x27;t have the razor burn problem.</li>
            <li> great feature of this razor is how quick it is to charge (about 30 minutes) and that it maintains that charge for about 5 days with daily use.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to take apart and clean the attachments and is a breeze to use for a quick trim.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, body wash, Thank you such a good product,I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li> Design quality, appearance is very beautiful, very smooth shave, hope can be lasting and reliable quality, hope the blade can be maintained for a long time, also hope to be able to buy the right accessories</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco rotaries for the past 25 years or so, but this one is the best.</li>
            <li> Recommended annual blade replacements add significant cost&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> -- Recommended annual blade replacements add significant cost  </li>
            <li> If you look at the cost over 3 years, the Panasonic would cost $65 whereas the Norelco would cost $117 which exceeds the original cost of the shaver ($100).    </li>
            <li> indicator lights are great, so you know how long of a charge you&#x27;ve got</li>
            <li> also the finish on this thing makes it appear more as a toy than a piece of equipment that real men would like to use!  </li>
            <li> It worked great, it lasted a long time</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself this Christmas past as somewhat of an impulse buy, and it&#x27;s probably one of the best impulse buys I have made.</li>
            <li> Evidently it just gets better from here.</li>
            <li> I upgraded electric shavers for the first time in 20 years, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my dad, and I have used it on occasion, and I am very satisfied with the purchase so far.</li>
            <li> Originally, I had planned on putting it under the Christmas tree but,  with all of the rush of the holidays, it got shoved aside.  </li>
            <li> Okay, it doesn&#x27;t say that exactly, but it does say to use it for 21 days to get your skin used to this electric razor.</li>
            <li> It does not matter how many hot women they put in the commercials.</li>
            <li> love the warranty; it is already dying, exactly 2 year after the warranty expired.  </li>
            <li> It gives a close shave and has a long battery life - which is great if you keep it in you</li>
            <li> It takes many more passes to shave my beard smooth than my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> I was terribly excited as I had wanted to buy this razor after viewing the marketing videos on Amazon.</li>
            <li> but it is sure it slides on your face like cream on hot bread.</li>
            <li> Well, I wanted to try it out because of its unique look.</li>
            <li> I have excited about this product and gone through all the reviews and bought</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pretty pleased with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> Original (MADE IN NETHRELANDS)product,higher quality than its cheaper models which from China.</li>
            <li> This is the first Norelco shaver that I have used in many years.</li>
            <li> I have been using shavers for more than 20 years and  my first one from philips lasted for 14 years.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> My 15-year-old Norelco shaves as well as this one and as close even with the original heads.  </li>
            <li> It is worth buying!</li>
            <li> Also, I found that the trimmer comes as a separate attachement which is not user friendly.</li>
            <li> I like the ability to wash the razer head with hot water, etc., and have been using these models for many years.  </li>
            <li> Dutch original.</li>
            <li> Got one for Christmas and was the first electric in many years.</li>
            <li> worth to buy !</li>
            <li> My first electric razor after many years of using a blade.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a nice looking razor with good features for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a nice looking razor with good features for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Very very sharp, very good battery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable and enjoyable, and really far beyond my expectation.</li>
            <li> When I am in blade shave mode the Schick Hydro5 is my tool of choice, best blade hands down for me, however this new  Norelco 1150x/40 is going to have me using it more than I ever thought</li>
            <li> The shavers are nice, but the company forces you to buy a new one every so-many years.</li>
            <li> I bought two razors are Philips, a 1150 and a 1250.As a New Year gift for my friends, they liked.</li>
            <li> (And yes, I clean my razor&#x27;s and change the heads periodically).  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t done any disassembling to do a thorough clean.   </li>
            <li> I also find it easier to clean.</li>
            <li> Its smooth on th The battery charges quick and holds its charge.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t see myself paying for a Jet Clean that does something I could do myself, plus I don&#x27;t have the counter</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several electric razors before but this razor is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I just want a clean, close shave without having to spend 15 minutes at it.</li>
            <li> I clean the heads by taking it apart and just running the heads under water.</li>
            <li> I clean the heads by taking it apart and just running the heads under water.</li>
            <li> YOU NEED TO CLEAN THE HEADS PERIODICALLY.  </li>
            <li> While the charge time and length of charge per the advertisements seem to be accurate I believe 7 to 10 shaves per charge is more reasonable with shave times closer to 4 minutes of duration.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth to buy and easy to chean.  </li>
            <li> It can shave efficiently and completely clean.</li>
            <li> but I feel unsure if clean.</li>
            <li> I even offered to let my wife use it for her legs and underarms since she can just wash to get it clean.</li>
            <li> , I just shake out the wiskers into the garbage can; and yet it still gives me a great dry shave every day.  </li>
            <li> but then again it is easier to clean too and its still trivial to swap in/out trimmer,</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s fantastic IF your need the quick charge.</li>
            <li> My father-in-law NEVER in 70 years used anything but an electric, and he always seemed clean shaven.</li>
            <li> My father-in-law NEVER in 70 years used anything but an electric, and he always seemed clean shaven.</li>
            <li> It can shave face clean, and is user-friendly and power-save.</li>
            <li> The 1090 is a bit easier to clean.</li>
            <li> With the 1150 you need to remove the cleaning head off the body of the razor in order to clean it out.</li>
            <li> much faster shaving speed than BRAUN and more comfortable feeling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He said its quite and keep the face clean.</li>
            <li> Never had any problems with this razor and always a clean shave.</li>
            <li> but I quickly discovered I needed a preshave lotion to facilitate a smooth shave with the Norelco.</li>
            <li> The 1090 is a bit easier to clean.</li>
            <li> With the 1150 you need to remove the cleaning head off the body of the razor in order to clean it out.  </li>
            <li> For now, I use this for about 20 seconds in the morning and then switch to a 5-blade cartridge razor to clean up the rest.</li>
            <li> This shaver is definitely the best shaver I have owed, by far.  </li>
            <li> very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;much more cheap than HK</li>
            <li> It shaves closely and cleanly.</li>
            <li> and I sometimes have to shave twice a day to stay clean shaven.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, good stuff, thank you very affordable price.</li>
            <li> This razor does a very nice job and seems to hold the charge a long time.  </li>
            <li> The thing worked fine, with no loss of motor torque or any other oddities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Value: Compared with the Braun, the Sensotouch is a great value.</li>
            <li> It does not seem to be very powerful, but appears to be enough for a good shave.  </li>
            <li> It was just over the cost for a new head so very cheap, very quick charging too</li>
            <li> It looks cool to begin with but the most important thing is that it works very well.</li>
            <li> originally got this for my hubby, who has a norelco smart touch XL, which he likes very much, but I don&#x27;t find that it gives me as nice a shave as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My 4401LC is a 20 yr old corded model that still does a very nice job/close shave, with HQ4 heads, but I have to be gentle</li>
            <li> buy your self a good shaving machine \\&quot;Gillette Mach3\\&quot; or simillar that will last for years (i own the same one for more than 8 years</li>
            <li> very good，My husband says it is very comfortable to use, and</li>
            <li> The shaving accuracy is excellent, although I don&#x27;t see it as a marked improvement over my previous Philips/Norelco (which I was perfectly satisfied with)    </li>
            <li> I had a Cool Skin 6700 series which I liked better as well as a Braun which I really liked and a lot more convenient when traveling (but the Braun didn&#x27;t have anything behind the blades to collect the cut stubble).</li>
            <li> but it seems to require a special cleaning device that did not come with it.     </li>
            <li> Because the head is large, you won&#x27;t have to do many circular motions to cover your face.</li>
            <li> This Norelco shaver is great for quick dry shaves in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I did a lot of research and discovered (after a few purchases) that the Women&#x27;s Razors weren&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li> home dad feel very good with it, but the replacement head is a bit of trouble</li>
            <li> This razor is quiet, fits great in my hand while giving a pretty clean shave.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean with hot water.  </li>
            <li> I experienced razor burn for the first week or ten days (I&#x27;ve made a point of using it every morning until I finish the review).</li>
            <li> Electric razors are not for everybody, but they are a great convenience, especially if you don&#x27;t need to get up and shower first thing every morning (another prerogative of retirement).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean by opening it up and running it under hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean by opening it up and running it under hot water.     </li>
            <li> This razor does a great job with absolutely no adverse effects.</li>
            <li> We both agree the wet/dry use is a great option, but he&#x27;s not one to change up his routine and get it &#x27;wet&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I have owned many Philips Norelco razors in the past and they have been great razors for me</li>
            <li> But it is not the most suitable for Asian.</li>
            <li> far as holding a charge, the Phillips is amazing.  </li>
            <li> It is what I expected and does a great job.  </li>
            <li> it works good, but the only matter is the nick line....</li>
            <li> Good as a regular razor.</li>
            <li> Overall, good product.</li>
            <li> Wow, this is a nice shaver.  </li>
            <li> But later it got good....</li>
            <li> (full charge in an hour, but you can use the shaver within minutes of charging)  </li>
            <li> Philips Norelco 1150x/40 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver, Metallic Blue]] is a good electric razor for those looking to buy a SensoTouch model.  </li>
            <li> For a much more reasonable investment of time and funds, you can have an almost equivalent shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For a much more reasonable investment of time and funds, you can have an almost equivalent shaving experience.    </li>
            <li> : It can get hard-to-get hairs around nostrils and unsightly ear hairs, so I&#x27;ve definitely found a good use for my Norelco.</li>
            <li> All in all, I think this rechargeable Philips Norelco razor is a good daily shaver</li>
            <li> I found that both shavers did a relatively good job overall.  </li>
            <li> Love it so much.</li>
            <li> So....the design is nice, but the lack of a close shave and the lack of a direct plug to charge takes off two stars.  </li>
            <li> prefer a wet/dry razor because just being able to rinse it out everyday is my preferred (and most cost effective) cleaning</li>
            <li> They advertised $30.00 rebate that i never received i would not have bought it for full price.</li>
            <li> Also, being able to rinse it with water after the shave makes it much easier to keep cleaner than brushing it alone.    </li>
            <li> My review is based against an old remington 7 series, so this shaver, I believe is a nice upgrade.</li>
            <li> The most thing is it&#x27;s very cheaper.</li>
            <li> This Phillips is more for touch-ups than for a real shave or an all the time shaver.</li>
            <li> Everything they said about it is true.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li> Looks cool though....</li>
            <li> I can still shave much faster, and get a better shave the ol fashion way.</li>
            <li> this 2d is just a cool one to put in the bathroom but not for shaving.</li>
            <li> This shaver is the gift that the first time i send to my husband, he love this shaver very much,the shaver has a nice appearance,it&#x27;s very suit for my husband.</li>
            <li> Because my last model was so good, I do have a couple of complaints.  </li>
            <li> Charged up the unit the night before, to ensure full</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clean and quick.</li>
            <li> Besides, the shape and color all looks cool.</li>
            <li> Just a good solid Norelco.  </li>
            <li> Realistically I wouldn&#x27;t expect this device to do a good job with a three or four day growth of facial hair.</li>
            <li> I did not pay full price for mine - had a $30 coupon and a $30 rebate so the price was unbeatable.  </li>
            <li> If there is a clear link on a listing for a product, there is no way it honest merchandising not to honor what is offered.</li>
            <li> I think if you have a light beard and shave daily with this Norelco, you&#x27;ll get better results and may well love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And, surprise, the Norelco actually does a good job of getting ear hair.</li>
            <li> I think if you have a light beard and shave daily with this Norelco, you&#x27;ll get better results and may well love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And, surprise, the Norelco actually does a good job of getting ear hair.</li>
            <li> I bought it just so I could try a rotary shaver, but really didn&#x27;t expect it to be any better than my others.</li>
            <li> It takes me about 3 minutes for a full shave and the neck hairs are gone.</li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> This is particularly true in those areas underneath the chin and jaw-line.</li>
            <li> This is particularly true in those areas underneath the chin and jaw-line.  </li>
            <li> - I would imagine that some detergent should be used with the blade for more intense cleaning.</li>
            <li> The more important is it&#x27;s suit me better than the last razor I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Not using yet, but this is a good price to buy this product, it&#x27;s a present for farther-in-law.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver so much I am contemplating getting another for travelling.</li>
            <li> and it really did a noticeably better job of getting the chin and neck stubble off.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m gone for more than a week, I really would feel compelled to take the charging stand and AC adapter.</li>
            <li> as a chrismas gift to my boy friend, he love it very much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;will</li>
            <li> It shaves OK for an electric (I have been shaving with a mug and brush and modern blade razor for 50 years)</li>
            <li> The price is fair and I will definitely recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> The order arrived within 5 days, and the product was in good quality, just the same as the description of the seller.</li>
            <li> One full charge and two weeks of use with no recharge till now.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I bought this items was it was a good deal.</li>
            <li> Stay away from this razor, spend the extra $20 or so and get an actually good one.</li>
            <li> Good performance with low price   </li>
            <li> love it very much！It‘s helpful for me and use it everyday！I</li>
            <li> I should start off by saying that this watch takes a reasonable amount of intelligence for you to get the most out of it.</li>
            <li> to clean, and charge is quick.</li>
            <li> If anything a nice light touch and it does the job better than pressing harder.</li>
            <li> electric razors are good only as fill in shavers when there isn&#x27;t time or energy for a shaving cream and razor shave.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am delighted with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Promotions are purchased only $ 60.A good deal.</li>
            <li> I really have enjoyed this shaver.</li>
            <li> so cool ！</li>
            <li> i am not thrilled with the recharging stand, but the shaver is excellent.  </li>
            <li> Nice price to buy a professional razor for my elder brother.</li>
            <li> It works well, my father love it very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hope Philips gets good customer care in future.</li>
            <li> I had to repeatedly go over the same spots to even begin to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> not bad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very smooth and glides easily across the skin, and the head and blades pivot to make easy work of facial contours.  </li>
            <li> easy to shave, like it very much.</li>
            <li> Very nice, the price is Very cheap,I really like it very much,and I hope you can continue to buy it at this price</li>
            <li> It just glides over my face and trims as good or better than the previous two electric razors I have owned.  </li>
            <li> For the price compared to some others, there is good value....and with the current $30 coupon I&#x27;d jump on this quick.</li>
            <li> Perfect goods that we purchased them more due to the low price.</li>
            <li> Just ok no to impressive does the work like any other ones, a bit to pricy for being so simple</li>
            <li> Very comfortable razor, that does a decent job, it just seems supremely under powered.  </li>
            <li> Cuts real close and clean and is easy to wash clean after use.</li>
            <li> This razor gets three out of five because it is comfortable to hold, the head rotates well around &amp;#34;knobby&amp;#34; areas like ankles and knees, seems to charge well and quickly, holds a charge for several days (and legs are a lot more area to cover than faces!), and it is made well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would very much recommend the purchase of this fine razor.</li>
            <li> This electric razor is great for going on, and around, all of the little bumps and irregularities that no one notices, until you try to get a smooth scalp.    </li>
            <li> First of all the razor is OK at best, it cannot be used if your facial hair gets very long</li>
            <li> The shaver charged quickly.</li>
            <li> and how i wish 1240 could be as worthy as this one</li>
            <li> i have owned 2 braun, 1 panasonic, and 1 philips before this one, and this is the best one that i have ever owned even thought it wasn&#x27;t the most expensive one.  </li>
            <li> ] it is best designed for daily use of shorter facial hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;++ Best for daily shaving of shorter facial hair</li>
            <li> Charging is quick</li>
            <li> Alternatives like the 7310 still offer a better value for most of the same features&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> Now many months later, I still love this razor.</li>
            <li> It also allows for a more streamlined, ergonomic, and comfortable-to-hold shaver, compared with older models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All told, the 1150X is an execllent shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought it online and found it is quite and worthy.</li>
            <li> It is close, and it is quick.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> SHAVES QUICKLY.</li>
            <li> The head is very flexible and glides over the contours of the face easily, it is easy to clean too.</li>
            <li> I recommend every one to use this if you not bit choosy on price as its worthy for every penny u spend.</li>
            <li> Compared to Panasonic ES-LA63-S, SensoTouch 2d gives a more comfortable shave for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Once opened, a quick review of the instructions, plugged in the charger w/shaver in the charger and the unit was charging.</li>
            <li> And, most impressively, it even works on my neck, where the Braun was almost useless.  </li>
            <li> convenience to useshave bread on my face neatly and charge quickly.</li>
            <li> I received it quickly.</li>
            <li> The main reason is the $30 rebate :) which I haven&#x27;t received yet.  </li>
            <li> only drawback is that you will need to use some kind of lube or go with shaving cream if you want a smooth glide over your face.</li>
            <li> Charging quickly in 3 min.</li>
            <li> Two minutes for every day, the shaver still runs quickly without charge for 1 month</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t blame the Norelco as I have super sensetive skin.</li>
            <li> Quick charging time.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean, and holds it charge very well.</li>
            <li> This one cuts even better than the older models and ypu can shave in the shower as well.</li>
            <li> So if I&#x27;m looking to pick one to take on a trip or for when I need a quick shave</li>
            <li> Just started to use , but so far I really like it and is doing a good job for me</li>
            <li> So if I&#x27;m looking to pick one to take on a trip or for when I need a quick shave</li>
            <li> Philips claims that the best results will be seen after several weeks of regular use - and I&#x27;m getting close to that, so we&#x27;ll see.  </li>
            <li> I LIKE THE QUIETNESS,EASE OF CLEANING AND QUICK RECHARGE.</li>
            <li> Feels better built and more solid</li>
            <li> But Philips replaced it quickly under the warranty.</li>
            <li> Norelco was quick to send the correct one, however.  </li>
            <li> I am now using an older model which does a better shaving job for me.</li>
            <li> and I think that I&#x27;m now ready to provide an accurate and detailed review.</li>
            <li> I have used cordless razors for many years and was always able to plug in the cord when the battery was low.  </li>
            <li> I am lucky that I have an outlet inside the cabinet under the counter</li>
            <li> It works really quickly and gets to every spot in seconds.</li>
            <li> Well, I can now state that I am no longer a loyal Philips customer.</li>
            <li> I think the older models may be better</li>
            <li> I have the older style Norelco and like it much better.  </li>
            <li> First, the new body: it&#x27;s made of a cool looking metallic material that integrates buttons and lights in a continuous surface, so it&#x27;s very easy to wipe clean.</li>
            <li> It works very good on my coarse beard, easy to clean and when charged, it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> I cannot speak more highly of this Norelco unit:</li>
            <li> Very stylish, quick to charge, and fast delivery, brand new shrink wrapped in the box.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is pretty effective, quiet, and pretty good around the neck!</li>
            <li> Overall, it is pretty effective, quiet, battery lasts more than a week and pretty good around the neck</li>
            <li> I have owned other Norelco Shavers and, though I loved the convience and the smooth shave, I often turned it off accidently while shaving.</li>
            <li> However, the Panasonic performed slightly better on the flat cheek areas whereas the Norelco did slightly better on the curved areas around the jaw bone and neck.  </li>
            <li> In general, it&#x27;s a nice deal.</li>
            <li> I have confirmed with a Philips CS supervisor that they are authorized to do exactly that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Norelco shaving systems for decades and have normally found it to be superb and far better than any other shaver on the market.  </li>
            <li> With the price of $50, overall I&#x27;m very satisfied</li>
            <li> It is worth to buy such a razor.&lt;br /&gt;I will consider to buy one more if there is more discount.</li>
            <li> It took more time to shave than if I were to use a normal Mach 3 razor.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is better for detail work on the 1150x/40, and it looks far more stylish, but in the end that&#x27;s not worth $60 more to me.</li>
            <li> I like it very much!</li>
            <li> first It looks beautiful,and I feel comfortable when I use it.</li>
            <li> I like this products  very much!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied, I hope next time there</li>
            <li> The trimmer is also good, doesn&#x27;t catch or yank on your long beard hairs.   </li>
            <li> Good product, battery lasts long time however cannot shave as the shaver has to be in the supplied cradle to charge.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for quite a long time and is also quite good looking for a razor.  </li>
            <li> I want a philips 1150X for a long time, it&#x27;s good shaver</li>
            <li> Not as good as my Braun 390 Razor, the triple razor head looks good but working really not as it looks,so my next Razor will be a Brauns</li>
            <li> It has a good long battery life, too.</li>
            <li> The 1150X gives a plenty close shave, smoothly and very comfortably glides over the skin with no irritation whatsoever, and is simple to clean with a quick rinse under the tap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> :) total worth the SURPRISE!!</li>
            <li> Was a great deal, and he loves that it can be used in the shower or out, and that he is done shaving so quickly with much less irritation and cuts.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend it to any one young or old,it gives a good close shave.</li>
            <li> The shaver itself is very easy to clean; you can use the small brush or hold it under running warm tap water.  </li>
            <li> While keeping the original traditional 3 circular heads design, it improves radically on many important points.  </li>
            <li> My advice to new users is to make sure you keep your receipt and all of the packing material until the three-week guarantee time has passed.    </li>
            <li> I could buy a new head from Norelco for $40, but I don&#x27;t plan to give them any more of my money.  </li>
            <li> I love this new SensoTouch.  </li>
            <li> I love this new shaver.  </li>
            <li> My friend is so satisfied with his new shaver.</li>
            <li> If they lost it, I can&#x27;t magically make a new one.</li>
            <li> I thought the new technology would give me a better, closer shave.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco electric razors 25 years or more, I decided to try the new format unit.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet cheap and very useful to my lift, it&#x27;s easy to clean and assemble.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has space-age looks and would do the job for anyone:  a great shave in half the time.</li>
            <li> It looks modern and adjusts to curves easily.</li>
            <li> Overall, pretty good product.  </li>
            <li> Close quick shave, easy to clean, with hot water from the faucet, and sits in the recharge cradle so it is always fully charged and ready to shave.</li>
            <li> He says the shave is very close and the shaver is easy for him to use.</li>
            <li> , I can use it easily, it looks very lighting.so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use,charge is for 110v/220v is very helpful.</li>
            <li> It is very ergonomic, easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and doesn&#x27;t need to charging much.  </li>
            <li> Either way, this shaver has never cut me, unlike the Braun, which gave me various scars as I learnt to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Result: On the first pass for me, it cuts fairly close.</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t recommend any product from a company that does this kind of shady business in this day and age.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Hopefully Phillips Norelco can develop a way to make the travel stand foldable so that it will be much easier to travel with because that would make this product an easy 5-star device.</li>
            <li> He used the new Norelco 1150x and it was love at first shave!</li>
            <li> The first month provided a clean shave, as you get with most new electric razors.  </li>
            <li> I just know that if you are considering this shaver, I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> However, this shaver gets pretty darn close!</li>
            <li> In closing, if you are interested in buying an electric razor for about 100 bucks, this is the one!  </li>
            <li> I have not try it myself,but it looks like very awesome  at least!</li>
            <li> He was Absolutely!!</li>
            <li> and it shaves his beard really well!!  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver in over 50 years!</li>
            <li> I got this new, great looking, 1050x 2 days ago and have used it only once.</li>
            <li> I am impressed that this razor is wet/dry although I have only tried it dry.  </li>
            <li> My most recent shaver, an 8140XL, was still going strong after years, but it wasn&#x27;t shaving quite as well, probably because of worn blades.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve buy two Philips Norelco 1150 for both my dad and my boyfriend&#x27;s dad, they love it~  especially the easy clean&amp;travel lock</li>
            <li> The charging stand is quick and easy to use, an improvement over the plug-in charger of the older models.      </li>
            <li> But more importantly, i think the irritation comes from having to do way more passes than I normally would, especially shaving my chin and neck.</li>
            <li> I needed a new shaver and I read several reviews of this one that said it gave a smooth shave and was good for getting those pesky neck</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd shaver, I love it,it is very comfortable and smart.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean, also looks robust enough.</li>
            <li> The first time I took the head apart to clean it, the pieces fell apart on the counter.</li>
            <li> I think this would be an exceptional shaver for those with light to average beards.  </li>
            <li> very good quality,this product for this price, I want to give 5 stars, but,,, shipping is too slow, it&#x27;s takes me almost 1 month to wait, and maybe another month to wait for rebate(hope</li>
            <li> I bought this one is as present for a firend, based on his feedback, It is easy to use, he also recommend his friend to buy this product, the price compared to other product is very good.</li>
            <li> pretty smooth, enjoy it, it is a decent razor.</li>
            <li> Holds the charge very well and gives a nice close shave, plus no mess!  </li>
            <li> time will invest a little more money,  although for $100 you would think you would get a good shave without too much worry.</li>
            <li> This shaver is amazingly fast and smooth.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver for almost 1 month, like it very much, very good-looking outsides, comfortably.</li>
            <li> but that is only because the head is so much more flexible which means it follows facial curves more accurately and comfortably.  </li>
            <li> This was an amazing shave but taking 40 minutes daily to shave was out of the question.</li>
            <li> This shaver provides a fast and smooth shaving.</li>
            <li> We received the razor in just a few days and it looks great.  </li>
            <li> I have had this one for 3 weeks and haven&#x27;t experienced a dead battery yet.</li>
            <li> Charging was reasonably fast, and the razor is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> Along with Absolute Comfort Shave, there&#x27;s just nothing as close or comfortable than a blade.</li>
            <li> The price of this one is reasonable, and it shaves smoothly.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a cheap corded Braun razor and are much happier with it.</li>
            <li> The shave was very close and smooth.  </li>
            <li> The sound is very light&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast, thorough and comfortable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;2.very fast and comfortable</li>
            <li> Shaves smooth as silk and gets very close.</li>
            <li> Very close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it is comfortable and has a fast work</li>
            <li> I think the biggest difference though between this razor and my old Arcitec is that my face feels SOOOO smooth after using the 1150x!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the tradeoff though.</li>
            <li> For that, I like this one so much more than the old razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;++ Smooth and quiet operation compared to most electric razors</li>
            <li> It shaves better than the old one and is not comparable to the foil bladed one.</li>
            <li> As a day to day razor its actually quite nice.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t hold my own butter-fingeredness against the product design, until such a time as I do drop it and it does break...</li>
            <li> The norelco was much more comfortable but left stray hairs as well.</li>
            <li> The product is powerful.</li>
            <li> not only does this have a nice design to it</li>
            <li> I did a good job but who wants to keep putting the shaving blades back in their holder.</li>
            <li> I hope this will be useful to you.</li>
            <li> ** surprised at NORELCO stiffing so many Customers over a Rebate SNAFU.  </li>
            <li> My 12 year old Remington worked much better, but I can&#x27;t find blades for it.</li>
            <li> Worth having.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a nice shaver.  </li>
            <li> Away better than my old shaver, which was brought 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> I think this model worth its price.</li>
            <li> All in all, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, but if you&#x27;re used to electrics its worth a shot.</li>
            <li> My old Norelco 980XL was top of the line and cost me $85 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> Well the first shave was sweet and has been every since.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ever owned, and I can honestly say I wont be going back razor blades.</li>
            <li> It works far better then</li>
            <li> all three together will give you a phenomenal clear face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been not only a nice experience generally, but also the first electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever truly liked.</li>
            <li> As far as i&#x27;m concerned, that&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Con: shaves not as closely as 7310, now I have to take about 10 minutes to shave (before it takes only 30 seconds), looks kind of plastic (in hand)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i have order it three weeks ago, i have to say it works very well, and the price is very competitively.i love it.</li>
            <li> It is worth the money, believe me.</li>
            <li> product itself was OK so far, but the company refused to honor its rebate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An irresponsible company that you won&#x27;t want to do business with.</li>
            <li> it is worth every cent.</li>
            <li> It does have several bells and whistles that are nice, but do not improve the shaver&#x27;s capability.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very goodUse a very greatI think value for moneythere was more then 30 days already</li>
            <li> It is worth buying.</li>
            <li> powerful look</li>
            <li> but sometime I can&#x60;t clear my  beard quickly&lt;br /&gt;I will buy more for giftI</li>
            <li> my old razor was much better</li>
            <li> Wow, better than you think.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It fits comfortably in the hand, and has a rubber ridge that runs around the edge for added grip (especially useful when using the shaver wet).</li>
            <li> Useful, can be recommended, with every morning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> It fits comfortably in the hand, and has a rubber ridge that runs around the edge for added grip (especially useful when using the shaver wet).  </li>
            <li> It has a nice simple stand and indicator lights to show that the razor is charging / charged, etc.</li>
            <li> All that said I feel the razor is worth the cost.</li>
            <li> a nice gift.&lt;br /&gt;i will choose it for next year.</li>
            <li> Worth the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got an old trimmer that I use that works much better, and I guess I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
            <li> It fits comfortably in the hand, and has a rubber ridge that runs around the edge for added grip (especially useful when using the shaver wet).</li>
            <li> I am fair of face, and so don&#x27;t need much in the way of a razor, but the last razor I used did not come close to comparing to a manual razor.  </li>
            <li> it is worth it without one</li>
            <li> It is far more convenient to use.  </li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t  worth the price if there is no rebate.</li>
            <li> Affordable, effective and simple.</li>
            <li> Is worth purchasing, the price is</li>
            <li> ALthough this razor is an excellent piece of equipment all the way around, I am not happy with the shaving.  </li>
            <li> It fits comfortably in the hand, and has a rubber ridge that runs around the edge for added grip (especially useful when using the shaver wet).</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s well worth it.  </li>
            <li> it is a powerful razor, I like it.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s worth the trade-off.</li>
            <li> It is of high quality and easy to operate.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use with high quality.</li>
            <li> I like it very much, beautiful design, ship fast, I would like to get second one if I live in states</li>
            <li> I have found it is very important to clean regularly (about once a week works for me).  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure about the charging aspect when I first unpacked and set up my new razor.  </li>
            <li> Charges fast on a very useful station that suctions to the surface</li>
            <li> For dry shaving this razor is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Also, unlike older designs with a pop-up trimmer of limited usability due to its lack of clearance, on this shaver the trimmer just plugs into the top of the body as a replacement to the shaving heads, so the angle, clearance and visibility are perfect.  </li>
            <li> My other favorite features about this razor and the 8240 is how easy they are to clean.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a step back for electric shavers and there are far better products out there--products that perform better and are easier to charge and clean.</li>
            <li> the shaver is pretty good, but the single track heads miss a bunch of hairs and may take a while to cut.</li>
            <li> When I try,  the device kind of skids around my face abruptly instead of moving smoothly over it.</li>
            <li> It fits my smaller hands perfectly, and has 4 buttons on the body, comprising a main power on/off, travel lock indicator, battery low indicator, and charging indicator.  </li>
            <li> Pretty quick delivery, if I recall.</li>
            <li> I used it everyday, and I found that 1150 is very effective.</li>
            <li> Before this razor, the only way I could be sure to get my neck clean was with a manual safety</li>
            <li> It gives you a nice clean shave with minimal effort, and does not cause any sort of rash or irritation.  </li>
            <li> In person, it is not as vibrant blue as it appears online, and that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Shaves much closer than my old one and is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> He says that it gives a close shave, is comfortable to hold, easy to clean  and holds a charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li> To those who compare any electric to a blade - is this shaver as good as a sharp blade ?</li>
            <li> However, is this razor as good as any other electric I have tried ?  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and am very pleased with the comfortable shave that I get with the Metallic Blue Shaver.  </li>
            <li> And hope to the first time know。&lt;br /&gt;Thanks very  much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned other electric shavers over the years and none of them have given me as good a shave as the Senso Touch 2d has.</li>
            <li> Makes my face break out with razor bump but works well other wise.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews and decided this would be a good one to get.</li>
            <li> and it sounds like it isn&#x27;t charged up as good as some of the other one&#x27;s</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good deal with low price and high quality.</li>
            <li> IT VERY MUCH HAVE USED NORELCO MOST OF MY LIFE ( AND I AM 87 YEARS OLD )  </li>
            <li> Do give it time before your skin adjusts and while you try to figure out the right pressure and shaving motions that suits your face.</li>
            <li> so now, i don&#x27;t even buy shaving cream any more....just shave in the shower and wash my face right after...get 2 things done at once.  </li>
            <li> but if you keep up with shaving it will cut right through with zero irritation.</li>
            <li> At around $80, the price is right.  </li>
            <li> i needed it for one hand shaving because i had surgery on my right hand it worked for this and shaved</li>
            <li> I have always trusted amazon to do the right thing.</li>
            <li> someone should make it right.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco 1150 Senso Touch 2d Electric Shaver is designed for men, it&#x27;s right to have one.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my husband for his birthday (right after Xmas).  </li>
            <li> It looks like a lot of people have called the Philips Customer Service regarding this rebate, since the customer service representative guessed right away that I bought the shaver from Amazon.</li>
            <li> If A rebate is being offered on Amazon, Amazon or the manufacturer need to step up and do the right thing.</li>
            <li> + the price was right.</li>
            <li> It did work right out of the box and give a close shave.</li>
            <li> One being that there&#x27;s no way to \\&quot;lock\\&quot; the head into place, so if you are an aggressive shaver you will eventually end up popping the head right off.  </li>
            <li> He is an electric shaver that runs right corner of the face to remove all the hair and does not damage the skin.</li>
            <li> The shave is clean and smooth and I like how much quieter this motor and the razor heads are than the older one.</li>
            <li> the manual razor is much quicker to clean.</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks your skin *will* acclimate and you&#x27;ll be able to get an accurate and close shave very quickly.     </li>
            <li> I recommend this shaver for anyone that wants a clean, close shave.</li>
            <li> I am wet shaving and my face feels the best it&#x27;s felt in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Highly</li>
            <li> /&gt;it didnt shave clean, and time to time beard stuck and hurt me really much that made me scare to shave at all with this&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Voice is very light,easy to use,shaving is clean.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really give u a clean shave at all.  </li>
            <li> One issue is that, you need to hold in one particular angle from skin to make a smooth painless hair removal</li>
            <li> First, for me, it does not shave better than the 7310, which is considerably cheaper.  </li>
            <li> I certainly would not have purchased this if I knew I would not receive the full mail-in</li>
            <li> I certainly would not have purchased this if I knew I would not receive the full discount.</li>
            <li> While this shaver is very easy on the skin, it doesn&#x27;t seem to get close enough.</li>
            <li> I have only shaved dry, but it did a very good job out of the gate.  </li>
            <li> but i really like the new Norelco better than any others I have tried over the years and</li>
            <li> I replaced an earlier version and the new one is easier to use and does a good job of getting all the whiskers.</li>
            <li> Shaving in the shower has been great and actually gives a better shave with just a little soap to make it glide over your face.</li>
            <li> The price on eBay was 20 less than the best local price.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that was light and had a head that was easy to replace, and which was not a big deal if it got wet.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave two stars is that the battery life seems to be more than adequate.</li>
            <li> A younger person may strongly perfer its streamlined, cobra-head styling, and light feel.  </li>
            <li> Charging is quick though and the charging cradle is simple, but elegant.</li>
            <li> The razor was the quietest one I&#x27;ve owned, it comes with a 45 day money back guarantee, and on top of all that it has a quick charge.  </li>
            <li> This razor doesn&#x27;t do as good a job at capturing longer hairs as my old one did (although the old electric was capable of taking a nip out of my lip if I got too close); if I have skipped a couple of days (gone camping) it really has difficulty making a clean sweep of my face.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic has more difficulty getting a clean shave on some parts of the neck and has a more annoying buzzing sound, but with a shave that is so superior</li>
            <li> The Panasonic has more difficulty getting a clean shave on some parts of the neck and has a more annoying buzzing sound, but with a shave that is so superior</li>
            <li> It works adequately and the battery last for many shaves,</li>
            <li> I cannot say if the higher models are worth the money, because I have not used them.</li>
            <li> not sure if they still make this or not, but for me it wasnt too great experience using this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very convinient and looks cool.</li>
            <li> I wish I could afford the Senso Touch 3D since it has a few more extra features, but this is a great alternative at this price.    </li>
            <li> the gift for daddy , good looking and cleaning by water directly is very useful for our travell  life, I wish the 1250 has the same decline price if it is possible</li>
            <li> It was easy to clean with just a quick rinse as long as you can keep the cats face out of it.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure using a  little lather would be even better.</li>
            <li> matter how soft or how hard you push, I did not get burn, the \\&quot;cushion\\&quot; in the floating heads adjusted for a great shave over all surfaces!  </li>
            <li> it gives me a very close shave (better than the old one when it was new) and is comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a work of art, and delivers an amazing dry shave.  </li>
            <li> He has been quite satisfied with it so far; it gives him a very close shave.</li>
            <li> And you can wash it easily and don&#x27;t need to change the head frequently.</li>
            <li> The included soft case makes it easy to transport</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cleaning and comfortable after used it, The shacer have Line Noise and very save electricity</li>
            <li> I returned this shaver under Norelco&#x27;s 45-day money back guarantee policy, and replaced it with a newer Panasonic ES8243A that shaves even closer and more comfortably than my older Panasonic that beat this Norelco.    </li>
            <li> The feel of the SensoTouch&#x27;s form-fitting grip in my hand, its quiet \\&quot;whirring\\&quot; sound, and fit of its  trimming heads to my neck and face are fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The trimmer actually trims sideburns nicely and straight, but (read CONS)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 1150x had just one tiny light that tells you that you are screwed if it light up.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, a typical razor.</li>
            <li> It takes me significantly less time to get a good, close shave</li>
            <li> The 1140x works fairly well in this regard, but I wish I had my old razor back.  </li>
            <li> and I really have to give myself razor burn, even using gel, just to get a \\&quot;super smooth\\&quot; shave as they boast on their videos.</li>
            <li> This is a well engineered, well designed product, overall feel is good, clean shave and simple removal of head for cleaning.</li>
            <li> I have a Brawn and this shaver is not even half as good as the Brawn.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what manufacturer&#x27;s get by packing such a great product in such a messed up way.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I experienced some razor burn upon initial usage, but after the third or fourth time, the 1150X felt very comfortable.    </li>
            <li> cleaning is so easy, after the shave, just pop open the blade cover and run both parts under water...and its as clean as the first time you use it....</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my father and he seems like it very much</li>
            <li> Lectric shave also works very very well.  </li>
            <li> Lectric shave also works very very well.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend like it very much.</li>
            <li> .BE VERY VERY WARY.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li> It was very gentle though.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> And when I turned it on, the rotary blades didn&#x27;t seem to be turning very fast.</li>
            <li> Because it shaves very smooth and is very quiet.  </li>
            <li> Like it very much to my experience,&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> i like it very much.</li>
            <li> I would very much prefer it if they sold two or three shavers for each crowd, and did it well.</li>
            <li> It turns out he likes it very much.</li>
            <li> He like it very much</li>
            <li> like it very much.</li>
            <li> I bought at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> ,everything is perfect~he like it very much</li>
            <li> Very reasonable product.</li>
            <li> The product is very light, and seems to be a bit fragile.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very fast and leaves no irritation at all.</li>
            <li> My dad and my family like it very much</li>
            <li> like it very much.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> It is a gift and my friend likes it very much.</li>
            <li> Logistics speed very fast.</li>
            <li> My father likes it very much.</li>
            <li> He likes it very much.</li>
            <li> My friend like it very much.</li>
            <li> very very good&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> He likes it very much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the charging speed is very fast.</li>
            <li> This is a step up from most of the other products out there without the huge price tag.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s fine for young people to use.</li>
            <li> My old Norelco was fine but wore out.  </li>
            <li> Claims it gives an excellent shave &amp; is very convenient to use anywhere &amp; wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Cleaning is pretty easy, it&#x27;s easy to open the main attachment, brush with the included cleaning brush and rinse.        </li>
            <li> I received this item new and in the original box.</li>
            <li> I found that I got a very close shave, but the razor was very time consuming to keep clean, if you followed Norelco&#x27;s suggested cleaning methods.  </li>
            <li> This does not give anywhere near the closeness of shave as many of my older models.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the price of blade shaving has been quite a bit higher because of the price of blades (it&#x27;s very much like color printers and ink), but one of the instructions on the Norelco box was to replace the shaving head once a year.</li>
            <li> Nice one, having a sense of high tech, I like the blue one.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> I am comfortable when I using it.50$ is very cheap,but its high quality can still be believed.</li>
            <li> I was also able to find a $30 instant coupon online which made the price very reasonable.</li>
            <li> We had a 15 year old Remington that I threw away thinking this &#x27;high tech&#x27; razor would be better</li>
            <li> This shaver is a handy little tool,and it&#x27;s so cheap to a shaver which has so much functions.</li>
            <li> When I first opened the packaging, I thought the head was flimsy.</li>
            <li> Evidently, the on/off switch was positioned for the places men shave.</li>
            <li> Norelco SensoTouch Razor 1150x may not have all the bells &amp; whistles compared to higher priced models.  </li>
            <li> Since I am a senior citizen, I have used many different wet/dry shavers in my lifetime.</li>
            <li> The 8240 had been my first rotary razor experience</li>
            <li> On the first day, I got the closest electric shave ever using the Norelco.  </li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> Overall, I have been pleased with this razor.  </li>
            <li> so it is a very saitable product to be a gift !</li>
            <li> I tried the Panasonic first and it ripped my hair out and irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even buy it in the first place.</li>
            <li> I followed exactly all steps in submitting the rebate requests.  </li>
            <li> I first puchased a Norelco 7340XL razor and went to work with it.</li>
            <li> at first, i use this with shaving cream, but one time i used it with Nivea face wash for men, and to my surprise....</li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor ever.</li>
            <li> My first electric shaver was a corded Norelco 2-head razor, state of the art at the time.</li>
            <li> In summary, the Panasonic rated higher than the Norelco in all areas with the exception of the warranty.  </li>
            <li> shaving process itself feels smooth, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my face as much as my old one, but it also doesn&#x27;t shave as closely.  </li>
            <li> He shaves first thing in the morning with no pain.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is in the utilization of the separate trimer, I am sure that I will eventually it will be lost during trips.</li>
            <li> I bought this model and a braun 3 series the same day to see which I like better.</li>
            <li> Use a light circular motion and rinse the shaver frequently.</li>
            <li> At the same time, however, I&#x27;ve never been pleased with electric razors.  </li>
            <li> and it is still working as if it were the first day</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for from an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> First impression was,</li>
            <li> I first started with a Norelco razor when i was 17.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> First one I&#x27;ve owned that has come close to shaving like a blade.</li>
            <li> I traversed many times the neck to shave it properly.</li>
            <li> I wish, they would be more transperent in further promotions.</li>
            <li> That said, when used consistently, it works well, and aside from the first use (when i wasn&#x27;t used to it)</li>
            <li> FIRST YOU HAVE TO UNSNAP THE MECHANISM THAT HOLDS THE HEADS, THEN REMOVE EACH HEAD AND BRUSH THEM, THEN REPLACE THEM</li>
            <li> Overall I am pleased.</li>
            <li> I gave the Norelco 1150x/40 Senso Touch shaver to my son as a Christmas gift - he was so pleased with it that he requested the same shaver for his birthday.  </li>
            <li> Very efficient in shaving!  </li>
            <li> I found the shave to be most comparable with a regular stick when I use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> After years of using a Braun electric razor, and finding that it was mediocre at best, I took a gamble and decided to get the Philips Norelco 1150.  </li>
            <li> When I first received it from Amazon, I noticed that the rotary heads had just one ring of blades.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that would make it better is if it came with a case for when you travel.</li>
            <li> This is the first shaver I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I actually find it a bit more cumbersome to handle and am not all that fond of the charging cradle</li>
            <li> First, Norelco does not honor their rebates.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and exactly as shown.</li>
            <li> First electric</li>
            <li> I tried shaving for the first time....</li>
            <li> I have found it works very well for my use and the texture of my beard and skin!</li>
            <li> so I put it in a pretty Valentine&#x27;s bag</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> my first one bought by myself.</li>
            <li> The delievery time is more earlier than  my expection.  </li>
            <li> I was always sceptical about electric shavers since i used my first about 10 yrs ago.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect that, just because you aren&#x27;t using hot water and cream, you&#x27;ll be getting thru your morning shave faster than you would with a blade.</li>
            <li> $20 is ok, $50 is a BIG NO NO.</li>
            <li> I really love the fact that when it needs cleaning i can simply wash it.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s also my first purchase in Amazon.</li>
            <li> first shaver that my Dad bought me was a Phillips.  </li>
            <li> maybe, It is the one of the most famous shaver on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve known this stuff gives extra discount occasionally.</li>
            <li> The shaver- you can do better for the money, especially since the rebate was phony.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my husband for father&#x27;s day in hopes that it might get him to shave more than his standard once per week.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Finally received a postcard, first correspondence since Christmas 2011</li>
            <li> My most recent electric was purchased about 20 years ago, and it&#x27;s a Braun which is all I can compare to this Norelco 1150.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You would do better buying lottery tickets with your money as you might actually pick a winner.</li>
            <li> You still must go over the same area more than once and hold the skin taut in the area you are shaving, but not to the degree where it is a problem.</li>
            <li> First time, I was given a Remington as a gift, which looked like a Norelco..</li>
            <li> ^^*Pretty</li>
            <li> ^^*Pretty</li>
            <li> ^^*Pretty</li>
            <li> will be a lot more hands on with my selection the next time.</li>
            <li> $49, a big bargain.:-)  </li>
            <li> There were a couple of missed hairs on the neck and cheek, but the larger you make the circular motions, the better it shaves.  </li>
            <li> I tried shaving my face with it knowing that I have never been successful in the past with an electric shaver for my beard.  </li>
            <li> This was my first attempt at buying an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> the rebate&#x27;s been denied by the manufacturer; I see many others complaining about the same issue.  </li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my frind, and he really loves it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed the 1090 and use it regularly whenever I use an electric shaver rather than a blade.</li>
            <li> Thanks again Amazon!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot more quiet</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had no problem with soap buildup on the foil since I make sure to briefly rinse it out after each shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning the shaver could not be easier, after each use you simply pull off the top plate of the shaver head and run water through it and the shaver head.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed the 1090 and use it regularly whenever I use an electric shaver rather than a blade.  </li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s at the point where the cost, year over year, is essentially even or better with this razor.    </li>
            <li> I will add more details a while later.</li>
            <li> REALLY!</li>
            <li> This is the first on I have bought in 15 years</li>
            <li> I like the ergonomics of the razor &amp; it shaves better under the jaw , but the shave doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> This is my first battery powered razor.  </li>
            <li> AT FIRST I WASN&#x27;T</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve always been well made and usually last for many years.</li>
            <li> On my first use of the 1150X, I was amazed with how well it followed the neck contours</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stand to shell out enough for the newest top of the class, but I wanted to move up in the price/quality menu.  </li>
            <li> So I bought the top level of the last generation (senso touch 2D --</li>
            <li> After being married to her for 46 years I&#x27;m not going to fight with her now</li>
            <li> just take the razor head off and place the blades under running hot water for about 30 secs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The most recent shaver I had before the 1150x was a Norelco 8140XL which I bought close to five years ago.</li>
            <li> However, I think the 8140XL did a better job on my upper lip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used batteries or electric shavers, razors only, but when I buy the Philips Norelco remain quite satisfied with the results</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning the shaver be easier, after each use you simply pull off the top plate of the shaver head and run water through it and the shaver head.</li>
            <li> (first a Remington, then a low-end Norelco, then the Norelco 1150X),</li>
            <li> This is my first time to may a shaver.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned so take it with that</li>
            <li> first correspondence since Thanksgiving/Christmas 2011 - REBATE COULD NOT BE HONORED!!&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Manufacturer&#x27;s discounts taken at the cash register are not valid for rebate promotions..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Comfort: The SensoTouch offers a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> No expensive foils or assemblies to replace.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that the charge life being shorter with this model might be a disadvantage, but I&#x27;ve been going on the first charge for over a month.  </li>
            <li> I cleaned theold one manually for many years, It&#x27;s not that big</li>
            <li> Battery lasts long enough to leave the charger at home while weekend/business traveling, but is also 110/220 great when leaving the states.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty close shave as well...</li>
            <li> You can buy the higher level models and pay the higher prices</li>
            <li> a rotary blade Norelco has a sort of money-back guarantee deal in the event that it doesn&#x27;t do the job for you, so there&#x27;s no reason not to be confident in the machine&#x27;s ability to dominate your facial hairs.   </li>
            <li> but so far its gone a month without the charge light coming on.    </li>
            <li> For the first time in the Amazon shopping  </li>
            <li> I received this e. razor as a gift and on first use it screwed up my skin.</li>
            <li> I hope to have more such preferential activities.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I have returned this unit for a higher end Norelco.</li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave, it is quiet and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> but I bought my first electric shaver in a pinch at an Army PX store.</li>
            <li> and I have had more razor burn from it than with a simple disposable razor.</li>
            <li> the first person I spoke with didn&#x27;t comprehend anything)  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Have always shaved and this is my husband&#x27;s first electric.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time to buy a electronic razor, my transitional razor worked better for me actually.</li>
            <li> Also, the package looks pretty, said by mum.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and gives the closest shave I&#x27;ve gotten in a long time from an electic model.</li>
            <li> I have used a Norelco triple head shaver for the last 20 years, had many units and replaced the cutters</li>
            <li> A $10 Mach razor is much better and faster, The only thing you get with this razor is the ability to shave on the go but trust me everyone will know.</li>
            <li> My husband used it first</li>
            <li> Go to get a higher end model or Braun.</li>
            <li> Cool blue color and smooth, soft-touch</li>
            <li> and this is my first electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> do not have a higher rating</li>
            <li> My overall feeling is that the unit does an ok job.</li>
            <li> This is actually my first of many before that i finally like it at all !!!</li>
            <li> The first day the plastic shaver head cover broke when I removed it to shave.  </li>
            <li> maybe next Christmas I will buy an even better one, after this first trail.</li>
            <li> but it still is pretty.</li>
            <li> SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver is so good ,my father used it everyday.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used an electric shaver, or if you haven&#x27;t used one in a while, you have to use it for a few weeks before you start getting good results.</li>
            <li> ,it works good, and i use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> Looking for a good replacement, I thought this would do the job and get those spots the Remington had been missing.</li>
            <li> I have used many, many norelco razors that have the conventional look and they have all given closer shaves than this new style.  </li>
            <li> Very surprised by the clean shave I get, even without using a pre-shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving since 1955, and have had everything from an Eversharp Shick Electric Razor to the first two-rotor blade Norelco to a Panasonic that was a wet/dry (which sounds like a vacuum cleaner in more ways than one).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really liked, and used, Braun shavers for decades, but this Norelco shaver is my new standard.</li>
            <li> I gave myself a smooth, quick and almost silent shave.</li>
            <li> the older models do, when you take the screen off to clean, everything falls apart, a real pain.</li>
            <li> It runs very quietly and feels super smooth on the skin.  </li>
            <li> this shaver is brilliant in my books lets you use it wet or dry .</li>
            <li> Not as close a shave as my previous experience with Reming ton and Braun, however it is certainly more comfortable.</li>
            <li> And against my face, the razor just glided across, without the familiar pulling action and grinding sound that I had with my old Braun.  </li>
            <li> Bigger suction cups would be good, but in a bathroom where there is powder and other things that get on the counter, I wouldn&#x27;t leave it out providing I have a drawer that can take a razor that is light</li>
            <li> Bigger suction cups would be good, but in a bathroom where there is powder and other things that get on the counter, I wouldn&#x27;t leave it out providing I have a drawer that can take a razor that is light</li>
            <li> Use it until you feel it begin to shave differently or tug lately, then charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, ok beginner, but that wasn&#x27;t what I thought I was buying, thought this was an advanced model I would used for a long time and get a great deal, neither were true.  </li>
            <li> When I saw this online and found out you could use a shave cream with it, I figured spending a little bit more would be worth it, and boy was I right!</li>
            <li> It is very good with them, that is a little bit big noise.</li>
            <li> With the 8140XL, you just pop the top which is on a hinge, empty any excess hair into the wastebasket, rinse the whole thing under warm water, and close it back.</li>
            <li> It looks very professional and cool.</li>
            <li> Even though it says you have to wait really 21 days to see good results, so far in the 3rd day I am getting a really good-smooth shave.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no significant deficiency with this razor, but it didn&#x27;t offer a noticeably improved, more comfortable shave either.  </li>
            <li> Now I know that user manual said that it is normal to feel skin irritation upto 21 days of normal use, but I wasn&#x27;t satisfied by the fact that the shaving time equaled or exceeded the time required to shave when I am using a normal razor.   </li>
            <li> The battery died on my 8 year old Norelco, and it had the original heads.  </li>
            <li> Nice unit, sleek, no buttons or other items to fill with debris.</li>
            <li> I have veary sensitive skin and was so excited when I purchased the 2D.  </li>
            <li> It has a sleek design , nice looking, but other than that</li>
            <li> I bought this product a week ago , unlike other chinese products this is very good product, functions well and lasts long  very long on battery and easy to operate and very fast and clean ,smooth finish shave/ trim.</li>
            <li> Feel clean and soft when shaving.</li>
            <li> &gt;* easier to keep the handle clean since there are far fewer seams and ridges</li>
            <li> This particular shaver is worth about 20 dollars.</li>
            <li> the price is appropriated。&lt;br /&gt;this item can shave clean than the old one。&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do believe it is splashproof while cleaning in the basin, but I don&#x27;t think it would be wise to use it constantly in water such as in the shower, but not 100% on that.  </li>
            <li> Company is giving 50 days money back guarantee i would like to return the product and get back my money which i think is wise as i am unsatisfied with the performance.   </li>
            <li> I have stopped using it because of is low performance when compared to the cheapest available in markets which are worth putting the money as they perform well balanced with investment.  </li>
            <li> After using the shaver, its ok but not worth the full price.</li>
            <li> It actually gives me an OK shave, and is very convenient for travel, airports, and end of day touch-ups.  </li>
            <li> As for the razor itself, it has done a nice job for me - not perfect, but nice.</li>
            <li> Yeah, it looks stylish, and it charges fast if necessary</li>
            <li> I keep my head shaved everyday, and this shaver is so good that you can get a very close shave for even your head.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t the most expensive model, but it was good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried wet shaving with cream a few times, and it was awesome, but</li>
            <li> It works quietly, efficiently, and almost as good as a regular razor shave.  </li>
            <li> I visited my local Target and fell in love with the look of this razor and the fact that replacement blades were much cheaper than Braun&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> The flex head design works very well fitting facial and neck contours and leaves a close shave.  </li>
            <li> Nice soft grip and is very quiet.</li>
            <li> well we are in China, a place that everything advanced are marked in high price!</li>
            <li> It was very easy on the skin with minimal irritation .</li>
            <li> For the price and for the sweet sexy design of this electric razor, I really thought this would massively out perform the 4 year old plug in electric I was using.</li>
            <li> razor seems to get very, very close without even the benefit of soap or shaving cream, which is really nice!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> very good.it&#x27;s beautiful.thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Very cheap very affordableThe 1150  not has an LED display that shows you how much time is left before recharging</li>
            <li> so you have to spend about 5-7 minutes extra to clean it after each use!  </li>
            <li> I have a fairly light beard with fine hairs plus my skin is not overly sensitive so some one else might get different results than I did.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shaving with the SensoTouch is kind of odd at first.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Shaving with the SensoTouch is kind of odd at first.</li>
            <li> I replaced it with a Norelco because of the brand name and the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> was looking forward to this shaver after seeing all the positive reviews which are now suspect in my mind.</li>
            <li> For some reason I don&#x27;t do particularly well shaving with this thing right after washing and drying my face.</li>
            <li> I shaved with the SensoTouch for the first time yesterday and it did the whole job in about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> The 1150 is a compromise, but unless you really need the detail trimmer give the entry level units a try first.    </li>
            <li> Charging can then be used for a long time, love.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I am not an Electric Razor expert as some of the other reviewers seem to be, however I do know when I have had a smooth, comfortable, close shave.</li>
            <li> at first it was on back order, but within days it became available, and the shipment was fast, my husband likes it!</li>
            <li> the battery charge lasts a long time thru more than 15 shaves.   </li>
            <li> This is a first electric shaver in my whole life.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first real quality shaver I got.</li>
            <li> In my country,this kind of things sold  very  expensive,including other commodities like watchs, powdered milk,and so on.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and maintain (compared to other models that come with jet-clean and shaving capsules and</li>
            <li> love it, and wish it can be used for long time.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers in the past 10 years and they are all good.</li>
            <li> The noise is very small, shaving very clean, face feel very comfortable</li>
            <li> Works great, clean shave, quite, cuts close, can&#x27;t go wrong with this flex head shaver, grat price and quality</li>
            <li> I do like Norelco, and have purchased a pretty standard Norelco rechargeable at about half the cost - and am once again happy.</li>
            <li> did better for first few weeks but quickly ran out of gas.</li>
            <li> Sometimes i have to use the side-burn trimmer real quick to get it short enough for the regular razor to be effective.  </li>
            <li> if amazon is offering a coupon without a rebate by all means take advantage of the item, but if there is a rebate attached to the item as well, make sure its says you can stack both before using both you basically have to choose 1 or the other for most items and specially for phillips/norelco items, after calling and giving them a good piece of my mind for what i believe is false advertising on amazon&#x27;s and phillips part they are sending me a 15% off coupon for future purchases, so again buyer beware...</li>
            <li> I have a good bit of fun shaving my husbands face just because the shaving element was so sharp and it totally rocked as a close shave.  </li>
            <li> The multi angle head and unique shape does not provide a close shave and requires many strokes covering the same area to finally get the job done.  </li>
            <li> But after scoping out the hassle of installing a new battery and the cost of replacement heads, I decided it wasn&#x27;t worth refurbishing.  </li>
            <li> It shaves smooth the first time, and is very quiet.  </li>
            <li> razor works great for my problems and its allot quieter and charges quicker than the old norelco shavers I had in the past.</li>
            <li> its better then the dry ones and has a realy close shave.</li>
            <li> I get a very decent shave out of it</li>
            <li> I liked the previous model, I like this one.</li>
            <li> The higher end shavers might do better with floating heads or multi-pivot as opposed to the two-dimensional pivot of the heads on this razor.  </li>
            <li> The shave itself is pretty smooth but only if you use the cream.</li>
            <li> he is a marine and very particular about his appearance.    </li>
            <li> The replacement heads are easy to find and my local store has plenty of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that  are easy to insert into the back of the razor, the SensoTouch 1150x Electric Shaver does not come so equipped.  </li>
            <li> So the search continues...5 lotion packs by Nivea that  are easy to insert into the back of the razor, the SensoTouch 1150x Electric Shaver does not come so equipped.  </li>
            <li> have purchased several Norelco Shavers over the last thirty years and was always very satisfied.</li>
            <li> The razors inside triple head easily and often fall out if opened or dropped accidentally and within several weeks</li>
            <li> It can be used as a dry shaver but Use it with shaving cream for better results.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Battery holds strong for short travel without need for packing in the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are very easy to use and much more economical than disposable razors and their expensive refills.</li>
            <li> It does ok, so if you&#x27;re able to get it for $20 or less for a first electric, it might be ok as it would be more gentle as your skin gets used to it, but not good overall.  </li>
            <li> The shaver itself feels good but has two design quirks: it flops to the side when you set it down; and the charging cord cannot be plugged directly into the device</li>
            <li> The only way I found to do it was sitting at my desk with a bright light and using a set of picks tiny enough to fit between the individual blades and</li>
            <li> It certainly is a keeper (10 yrs?)</li>
            <li> Purchased the Philips SensoTouch Electric Shaver largely in part because of the $30 Rebate Promotion..</li>
            <li> It certainly isn&#x27;t as close of a shave as a non-electric razor, but of course you wouldn&#x27;t expect it to be.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Purchased the Philips SensoTouch Electric Shaver largely in part because of the $30 Rebate Promotion..</li>
            <li> face  twice weekly with a blade because the shaver just couldn&#x27;t get to certain spots.  </li>
            <li> When a more intense cleaning is needed you can disassemble the entire shaver assembly and clean out each rotary blade individually with the included brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When a more intense cleaning is needed you can disassemble the entire shaver assembly and clean out each rotary blade individually with the included brush  All in all...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving and waxing my legs for a few years (never you mind how many!)</li>
            <li> You have to like totally get this is the right spot and sweet spot on your face.  </li>
            <li> Went to Wal-Mart and purchased a Remington rotary electric razor for half the cost of the Senso Touch which is smooth and comfortable.</li>
            <li> The sound is slight and it is comfortable for my face.</li>
            <li> It shaves wet or dry and does a great job either way.</li>
            <li> Shaves great dry or wet</li>
            <li> long lasting battery life without recharging it- easy to clean!</li>
            <li> There were a couple of points where I thought the design fell a little short, but they&#x27;re small enough that I don&#x27;t think it would be fair to ding the rating of this otherwise excellent shaver by a star:  </li>
            <li> I first tried the 1150 dry,and I was surprised that with several days growth..I was able to get a reasonably close shave..</li>
            <li> I probably have light growing facial hair but the the first charge lasted me an entire month before the battery charge warning light started to blink.  </li>
            <li> While other brands seem to work better for some people, the Norelcos I&#x27;ve used have been far superior compared to any of the other brands I have tried.  </li>
            <li> For emergencies, this is a fine product, but don&#x27;t expect it to replace your daily razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband likes the razor fine, but we only purchased the item because of a promised $30 rebate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of electric shavers, I find them to provide a less than perfect shave - leaving blotches of hair and not being close enough, this electric shaver, however, is in my opinion the closest you can get to a razor shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i have old NORELCO electric shaver for many many years and just about few month ago it did not hold the charge,  but still works great,so i got new one</li>
            <li> the old one seems to have higher RPMs !&lt;</li>
            <li> In addition it is much more fun to shave with than the scary de razor; I have now decided to discard my de razor, brush, and soap; I will not be needing those anymore now that I have this more up to date form of shaving; shaving my face dry is a simpler,  more convinient way to shave.</li>
            <li> The Phillips Norelco Sensotouch (expensive shaver) is very good, however, will not purchase another from Phillips unless I can confirm they include a carry case.</li>
            <li> First, because the shaving heads are mounted on a deported piece with a narrow neck, it&#x27;s very easy to see what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> This is my fifth Norelco razor and I have been happy with all of them, but I would like the blades to last a little longer.</li>
            <li> If you really want an electric razor, stay away from this one--get a decent quality cheaper one or go elsewhere!    </li>
            <li> I would spen a little more money next time on a better razor.</li>
            <li> At this point, I should mention that I&#x27;ve had a beard much of my adult life and so usually shave only my cheeks and my neck, with is both the most sensitive area and the hardest place to get a clean shave with any kind of razor.    </li>
            <li> Have had great success with this shaver, it hasn&#x27;t completely eliminated my use of a straight razor (I have a tough beard) but it using it in combination with my straight razor, I don&#x27;t go through blades as often.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers for several years and have found them all very durable and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> The Norelco 1150x/40 is very quiet and smooth and you don&#x27;t really feel the vibrations.  </li>
            <li> After using this razor for six months, my initial impressions were confirmed--it&#x27;s flimsy, cheaply made, and doesn&#x27;t shave very well--with or without shaving cream.</li>
            <li> The one I bought for my father was at the same amazing price but also was supposeto give a $30 rebate back.  </li>
            <li> Is really fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li> I was really upset with this choice.</li>
            <li> sleek and modern looking.  </li>
            <li> The razor glided very well and gave me the smoothest shave I have ever had with an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> It causes some irritation especially in the neck area and its a bit longer to give a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> It cuts a 3-day beard much faster and cleaner than any shaver that I have ever used before.</li>
            <li> Very nice,I like it.</li>
            <li> Quiet when turned on, the heads seem to float over the skin with an extremely light touch that he enjoys - all with NO pulling or snagging of whiskers or skin.</li>
            <li> I really wanted something I could use in the shower and at the price point I was looking at(I</li>
            <li> it gives a very close shave</li>
            <li> Charging is fast</li>
            <li> The 1150 is a compromise, but unless you really need the detail trimmer give the entry level units</li>
            <li> and he absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> I find it to be both comfortable and quiet.  </li>
            <li> Recommended for teenagers with a hint of stubble on their cheeks, but not for men who need a real shaver.    </li>
            <li> It shaves my face very close and no pulling of the beard like my Remington rotary electric does!Admittedly the Remington cost $35.00 and the Norelco $100.00  </li>
            <li> It is much louder than the Norelco but</li>
            <li> not so much so that I would return it.  </li>
            <li> The shaver is very comfotable to use.</li>
            <li> I used this for about three weeks straight before I was in a hurry one morning</li>
            <li> This shaver gets my face smooth in only 2 traffic lights.      </li>
            <li> This thing just works and for twenty bucks after rebate, you can&#x27;t complain much.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I bought this one because of the updated design, and I thought the price was reasonable.  </li>
            <li> My experience with this razor is that it doesn&#x27;t really shave that close without spending quite a bit of time.  </li>
            <li> but it also works very well</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t want to use as much water in the shower or shaving.  </li>
            <li> Is this really an upgrade?</li>
            <li> heck this may not be much of a difference of a shave.  </li>
            <li> Using the circular pattern (with and against the grain) with this or any Norelco shaver really gives on a close shave.</li>
            <li> This razor is still performing very well.</li>
            <li> This razor is still performing very well.</li>
            <li> Iam now 57 and have used Norelco razors the whole time.</li>
            <li> letter from company refusing it for it didnot apply to the product which I thought was very odd.jay</li>
            <li> Bought this razor thinking it would be a close and comfortable shave, but it was no different than my $20 corded philips razor.</li>
            <li> It was very circular with infinite pastabilities.</li>
            <li> very goog</li>
            <li> (The cheap Norelco razors are like chainsaws-spend the extra).  </li>
            <li> It removes the hair from my face very well which is it&#x27;s core function.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It worked better when wet w shaving cream but still by 12 o clock</li>
            <li> And the deal breaker was that the spinning motion seemed to really irritate my skin and cause razor burn</li>
            <li> I bought is for trial but kept it after product worked better than i expected.</li>
            <li> Thanks Phillips for the non existing customer service.</li>
            <li> It takes forever to shave your whole face and even with wetting the face I would get shaver irritation on my skin.</li>
            <li> It does a closer shave and is much quicker.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really had any razor burn issues.  </li>
            <li> I spent the better part of a hour looking for the bits and never did find them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> * always found them to be very Customer</li>
            <li> off was NEITHER unusual nor a Windfall (as Norelco claims).  </li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li> guess it depends on how close a shave you want and how much you want to spend.</li>
            <li> Normally, I need to use the trimmer first to get to a point I don&#x27;t feel like things are being yanked from my face.  </li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t add anything to those that reviewed this before me (their reviews were the reason I bought it).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so fast to me from amazon  </li>
            <li> I really like it  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> At this point, I think the Amazon.com service is really beyond discussion.</li>
            <li> This razor really works.</li>
            <li> the modeling of the shaver is fashion too,I very like this product.</li>
            <li> very convenient , my christmas gifts .lol~~</li>
            <li> It really does require a 3-4 week break-in period for your face and beard to adjust, just as the directions say.  </li>
            <li> However, because the battery works for three weeks, it&#x27;s not that much of a problem.</li>
            <li> Really this product is a 1 star for me</li>
            <li> but I gave it 2 because I really didn&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco Senso Touch electric shaver is very nice,so clean,so cheap,i like it</li>
            <li> (Thanks for Dragon Sam&#x27;s help )</li>
            <li> Thanks for fixing this problem.</li>
            <li> I really do like that this is a wet/dry razor that can be used with shave creams and in the shower.</li>
            <li> So Thanks to amazon for the coupons and Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> It will leave you smooth, but it has the feel of brushing your teeth - going over the same area again and again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product during Thanks Giving</li>
            <li> when I get it,I am shockedIt is too beautiful,it is a gift for my friend,he is very satisfaction,thank you,amazon...</li>
            <li> I was worried about skin irritation and battery not so much as close shave.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that it gives a really close shave.</li>
            <li> It would beep when to much whiskers were built up in the head and needed cleaning.</li>
            <li> ive had the shaver is quiet and light.</li>
            <li> These are the ones that make it look as though you should be getting a haircut way before you really need</li>
            <li> and I very like it.</li>
            <li> The gel helps the razor get much closer</li>
            <li> and the shave is much smoother.</li>
            <li> Be detailed and specific.</li>
            <li> I tried a wet shave, and it was better than a blade.  </li>
            <li> fast shipment.</li>
            <li> my dad like it so much.</li>
            <li> , his wife appreciated my gift for his hus.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap enough  </li>
            <li> This one is quite reasonable for it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> Now I really regret that I throw away my $20 junk shaver.  </li>
            <li> I like this electric razor,the battery life of a razor very power and  met my expectations.</li>
            <li> So far as what my hubby says it does its job and worth the money.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> I like the blue color and smooth appearance.</li>
            <li> My father is very like it.</li>
            <li> Since this one has a 2D pivot and tilt capability it shaves real close without discomfort.</li>
            <li> I received my Norelco Shaver in two days and the product performs better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> 1150X can shave off Beards fast and well.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t have much effect at all on his neck hair.</li>
            <li> but after a couple of years and head replacements I didn&#x27;t want to spend so much money again.</li>
            <li> I upgraded to this one and not only is it cleaner, its an extremely smooth shave.</li>
            <li> overall, it was worth it to me to upgrade especially since the 7340XL gave me many reliable years of service</li>
            <li> I REALLY wanted to like this electric razor.</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it&lt;br</li>
            <li> that’s what this one’s suppose to be capable of doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much cheaper for a company to just make it removable rather than</li>
            <li> NOPE  just a man who wants to help someone learn from my mistakes</li>
            <li> The shaving head does not cut very well.</li>
            <li> Very noisy.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> shaver is very disapointing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Makes me very distrustful of the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> i bought this elcetic shaver for my husband, when he got it,he was very pleased,it let him fondle admiringly.</li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> and he says it gives him a real close shave.</li>
            <li> I got this razor at a quite reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Just expected it to be more efficient.</li>
            <li> It shaves close and it does it fast.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Takes longer than a straight shave, but that&#x27;s to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like its appearance and performance as described.</li>
            <li> I really recommend it</li>
            <li> The shaver head pivots smoothly in all directions, and the three shaving heads pivot individually as well.  </li>
            <li> The shaver head pivots smoothly in all directions, and the three shaving heads pivot individually as well.  </li>
            <li> One place where this shaver does not work very well at all, is the neck.  </li>
            <li> One comparison I can make is with the much lower priced (~$40) 7310 / 7310XL razors also from Norelco.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve already have one，just bought it for my father，it&#x27;s really good，except one corner of the box was ruined by express</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work very well unless you use the cream that comes with it.  </li>
            <li> REALLY</li>
            <li> and it seems like they really improved the electric shave.    </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s convient and quiet and gives a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> Flick on the power switch, and you&#x27;re ready to go.  </li>
            <li> The 2D is terrific, it&#x27;s smooth, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my face/neck irritated.  </li>
            <li> so the Norelco 1150X/40 really does save the day..</li>
            <li> It is fairly quiet and smooth to use.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite things about the razor is how long the charge lasts - I shave daily and one full charge lasts me around 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have to shave in all directions to get all(most) of the hairs cut, but when it does cut them it is very close.</li>
            <li> They way they pivot really does not contour to you face.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t trim my hair well at all.</li>
            <li> For the price, I expected better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for about 20 years, and using an electric razor the whole time.</li>
            <li> Love that this will shave with a wet face.  </li>
            <li> very much!but</li>
            <li> it really wasn&#x27;t trimming, you don&#x27;t even feel it.    </li>
            <li> but this thing does the job very well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really think of any pros.  </li>
            <li> The shaver head pivots smoothly in all directions, and the three shaving heads pivot individually as well.</li>
            <li> but  only  can  buy  one in the cheap price</li>
            <li> this was a gift for my friend, he loves the 1150 because he feels the shaver works gently</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much easier just to pack a cord.</li>
            <li> Although the shave doesn&#x27;t feel quite as close as my old Braun Series 5,the difference is negligible, and the SensoTouch wins in terms of comfort, ease, and cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As well, in order to hook the charging cable to the cradle, you really need to jam it into the port.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really disappointing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just stay away from Philips and you&#x27;ll be much happier in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is where the my real issue is.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting on the low battery light to come on . . . .</li>
            <li> The head of the razor came apart, springs and all, and I had no choice but to toss the whole thing into the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works well enough and easy enough that my son stays clean shaven--a requirement for his school.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very good&lt;</li>
            <li> very close to a razor except this doesn&#x27;t irritate my face like a razor.</li>
            <li> and everything is ready to go again.  </li>
            <li> With the charger, it does not take up much space.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> This whole \\&quot;2d, 3d senso touch\\</li>
            <li> I think they really do shave just as well as a blade.  </li>
            <li> It charges fast as well.  </li>
            <li> the suction cups don&#x27;t want to stick to it very well</li>
            <li> it’s very nice！I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much space so the station takes up too much room.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> I always use blade as I prefer a much cleaner shave.</li>
            <li> I would recommend scissors and a straight razor before I would recommend this garbage.</li>
            <li> very good。</li>
            <li> THANKS AMAZON:    </li>
            <li> I expected to get more than 1 year of use.</li>
            <li> ,it is very good.it is the one i want.</li>
            <li> Never seemed to get a very close shave</li>
            <li> , modern look&lt;br</li>
            <li> afterwards)&lt;br /&gt;+ nice and intuitive indicator lights (telling you if the battery is low, if the device is charging properly, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;+ seems to be very water resistant</li>
            <li> Now this is a real improvement.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be using my Norelco since I have found a shaver that really works and meets all my needs.  </li>
            <li> It does not shave3 very well and</li>
            <li> It glides really well and doesn&#x27;t keep pulling your hair.</li>
            <li> I have to shave in all directions to get all(most) of the hairs cut, but when it does cut them it is very close.  </li>
            <li> But, well.... the shaving not so much.</li>
            <li> Scratchy&amp;#34; - really, the closeness that I&#x27;ve achieved with the comparably priced Panasonic mid-level razor was no contest.</li>
            <li> Scratchy&amp;#34; - really, the closeness that I&#x27;ve achieved with the comparably priced Panasonic mid-level razor was no contest.</li>
            <li> it is fast and close.  </li>
            <li> Service is also very good。&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very eacy to use.</li>
            <li> It is a very high-quality product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s SOOOOO much cheaper compare with mainland China.</li>
            <li> Really a high-tech capable razor.  </li>
            <li> really like。Well</li>

            <li> and he had to finish up with his foam and straight razor each day.</li>
            <li> said Philips Norelco is very usefull and he like it.</li>
            <li> it finall started operating it sounded  very noiy</li>
            <li> , the price is much lower than BESTBUY.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really seem like it cuts</li>
            <li> packaging is the old timing cut your hand before you open type that most manufacturers have abandoned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone as far as to experiment with having my face waxed, but the sample site explored was enough to convince me that I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;m not going to ever endure the indignity of a bikini</li>
            <li> I was genuinely surprised, thinking that it would be a mediocre shaver at best.  </li>
            <li> I was genuinely surprised, thinking that it would be a mediocre shaver at best.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned at least 5 different electric razors and this is the best one I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> This razor is similar to my old one in closeness of shave and because I can&#x27;t use it if I wait more than a day between shaves.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer being an extra piece is not a problem, and it does a much better job than the pop up one from the old razor.  </li>
            <li> I bought this one last year (January 2012) from Amazon as a present for myself, since it looked like a neat design and had features which I liked.  </li>
            <li> I wish they had been more clear in telling you the only way to charge it is using the stand.</li>
            <li> He like the new shaver very much.  </li>
            <li> Strong buy recommendation especially for the price - not sure how much better higher end, higher priced models could be</li>
            <li> Have used a Norelco Spectra 8894xl  for years bought new when it was first offered.</li>
            <li> My husband was pleased, enjoyed for about 5 months, very clean shave, charging enough for a few weeks, despite the fact that my husband shave every other day.</li>
            <li> The soft pouch is not as nice as the carrying case included with other models</li>
            <li> The battery is not user-replaceable and will limit the unit&#x27;s life  -- Does not include the jet cleaning system  -- The soft pouch is not as nice as the carrying case included with other models    </li>
            <li> If you happen to have to shave everyday like most military then this thing is perfect, no more replacing razor blades or forgetting to buy any</li>
            <li> /&gt;Those who want the Jet Clean system should try the 1250, as long as they are willing to pay the premium and don&#x27;t mind the hassle and expense of changing the fluid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Phillip does a nice clean shave every time and doesn&#x27;t leave any hair behind.</li>
            <li> It is a gift to my uncle, he looks quite like this razor, at least his face is more clean than before.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor after having other Norelco razors and found it did a better job of shaving,(closer shave) than others I have bought.</li>
            <li> Like I said, I&#x27;m not willing to spend much more than $100 on a razor.  </li>
            <li> would I trust them again when we have so many other alternatives?&lt;br /&gt;Zero</li>
            <li> Maybe mine is more contoured than other guys&#x27; necks, but I tried a couple times and just started using a razor.</li>
            <li> Original Holland, work relatively well.</li>
            <li> better than other razor I used.</li>
            <li> Other Norelco&#x27;s I&#x27;ve owned are better with longer hair and with the neck / problem areas.</li>
            <li> This may be due to the curved shaving heads that seems to follow the contours with more efficieny.</li>
            <li> With a better electric razor I don&#x27;t have to shave but every other day.</li>
            <li> This may be due to the curved shaving heads that seems to follow the contours with more efficieny.  </li>
            <li> Better than other razor I used.</li>
            <li> Reading the Amazon forum on this, I can see that this happened to many other people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They were better than the other brands</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I got this, but it&#x27;s been a total letdown from the beginning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got this razor at a reasonable price, and my father likes it very much and replaced the old one.</li>
            <li> Maybe the jet clean system offered on the other models is worth the money, but I really didn&#x27;t want an appliance on my bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li> Again, very minor and it swaps out quite easily.  </li>
            <li> The wet and dry shave were ok, but not as smooth as one would expect for a product at this cost.</li>
            <li> I agree that it&#x27;s not a blade, but it&#x27;s close enough, and I get a clean shave in about 45 seconds.  </li>
            <li> , I think (though, the scientist in me wants to conduct an experiment doing both legs, equal amount of passes with each razor to be truely unbiased...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually pretty generous here with stars, but I expect more from a company like Norelco, so maybe I&#x27;m being a touch harsh.  </li>
            <li> I was using an older Norelco for a number of years and this one is definetly much improved.</li>
            <li> This is great and the price is unbelievable low.</li>
            <li> The product falls apart when you attempt to clean it, and cannot be put back together correctly.  </li>
            <li> even I forgot to clean it and left it there for a week.</li>
            <li> I was thankful it did not come with the massive Jet Clean charger/cleaner system.</li>
            <li> Great little razor gets close shave, battery lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> Then it is not only useful but also very cheep!</li>
            <li> In the future include an indicator to show how much time or power is remaining for a shave after a full charge.</li>
            <li> It takes only minutes to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> I noticed much more irritation than I&#x27;m used to, especially on dry.</li>
            <li> It is not powerful enough to do a good job.  </li>
            <li> husband liked this so much, we purchased a second one for his brother, a stroke victim.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the 3D is all sorts of amazing, but I&#x27;m not super obsessed with getting the most super close shave possible.  </li>
            <li> The Norelco is more comfortable, and there&#x27;s a irresistible urge to go over and over the same spots, especially now that it&#x27;s almost silent.</li>
            <li> The Norelco is more comfortable, and there&#x27;s a irresistible urge to go over and over the same spots, especially now that it&#x27;s almost silent.</li>
            <li> really had high hopes for this</li>
            <li> I want to go back to the old as it was tried and true!  </li>
            <li> When a more intense cleaning is needed you can disassemble the entire shaver assembly and clean out each rotary blade individually with the included brush (I actually throw the blades and heads into the dishwasher on a sanitize cycle to get them extra clean).    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard &#x27;Thank you for the new razor&#x27; several times each day, making this a fantastic gift in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you very much special sales, and hope that the next $ 49 the opportunity to come again</li>
            <li> The high end for Norelco seems to top out around $200, but I&#x27;m not willing to spend that on a razor...</li>
            <li> I have almost 2 years using this product and let me tell you that is good both dry and wet.</li>
            <li> Looks good and compact charger, charges quickly (less then 2 hours) then last for days of shaving.</li>
            <li> Good close shave every time both wet and dry.</li>
            <li> would make a great gift for a new shaver, long time shaver, male of female, in my opinion!</li>
            <li> Smooth, close shave and the battery has lasted a long time...</li>
            <li> They advised a 3 week break in period to get your skin accustomed to this razor but from the first shave I did not have any rash or discomfort just a smooth extremely close shave.</li>
            <li> It almost doesn&#x27;t work at all for dry shaves, does much better with foam/creme, but still not very close or clean.</li>
            <li> The primary downside of the Philips-Norelco is that shaving takes about 3x as long as with my Fusion razor.  </li>
            <li> and amazon i believe knew that phillips would not honor those rebates in the first place because the form clearly states you cannot combine deals, so</li>
            <li> very satisfied with the battery, lasted for a month at least.</li>
            <li> , the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a five was because nothing is perfect, not too sure about the charging base and the suction</li>
            <li> It has a quick-charge feature which is only 3 minutes, and a full charge in 40 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 45, been shaving for ages now, and I have to say, of all the razors I&#x27;ve owned that are of an electric model, this one is the first one to do the complete job.  </li>
            <li> The rechargeable battery here is a much-appreciated Lithium-Ion, which can hold a full charge for 40 minutes of continuous shaving, or about a dozen overall shaves.    </li>
            <li> when I realized, life is good when things are simple rather those so many so called features failed against the olders products.    </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many minutes on average</li>
            <li> Shaver is good but must go over face several times and pull skin  tight.</li>
            <li> : The 1150 is considerably less exepensive without taking any special offers or discounts that may become available into account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The 1150 is considerably less exepensive without taking any special offers or discounts that may become available into account.    </li>
            <li> In many respects - unfortunately other than closeness - there&#x27;s a certain WOW factor to the Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In many respects - unfortunately other than closeness - there&#x27;s a certain WOW factor to the Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Otherwise it shaves fine, and has a longer lasting battery than my old shaver.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelcos for more than forty years and have yet to be let down with a newer product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a New Year gift for my father!</li>
            <li> Hubby loves his new shaver!</li>
            <li> I liked my last Braun enough to have the internal battery replaced when it died the first time.</li>
            <li> The rebate offer is made deliberately misleading - designed to disqualify the rebate based on a loose, &#x27;bait and switch&#x27; wording of the fine print;  (ii)</li>
            <li> I used 6 different Norelco products in the past few years and they were on average good to very good.</li>
            <li> Really like this new razor.</li>
            <li> I when I tried my neck hair with this new razor, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.  </li>
            <li> Also, the new one is very noisey/loud.</li>
            <li> This new razor is quite different as it shaves almost as close a blade when used with water and kept clean.</li>
            <li> have to press many times to turn it on or off right now, and I am sure it will be dead within a week as it no more waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The battery life is much better than my previous razor.  </li>
            <li> I then knew I wanted to purchase another Phillips Norelco shaver because of how pleased I was with my previous model.  </li>
            <li> And now that my beard is half-gray, the gray hairs are even more wiry than the black.</li>
            <li> I have to do less stretching and craning of the neck to make sure the shave is completed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It functions much better than my two previous Norelcos.</li>
            <li> I have to do less stretching and craning of the neck to make sure the shave is completed.    </li>
            <li> better shaver than the previous Norelco....  </li>
            <li> Andit holds charge better (aided by less time shaving).</li>
            <li> I bought this item on black Friday and like so many others had my rebate rejected by Phillips.</li>
            <li> It looks about 5x better then what it delivers, which is a half hearted trim.</li>
            <li> This can be used &#x27;wet or dry&#x27; and is very sturdy and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I have not tried it wet yet, but I like the easy water cleanup when I use it from time to time.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s working well, better than my previous HQ9090.</li>
            <li> You will need to prop it against the wall to steady it.  </li>
            <li> Have been using an older Norelco shaver,loved it....</li>
            <li> This Phillips SensoTouch replaced an older corded electric that I had been using.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I give the edge to Panasonic for a better overall shave.    </li>
            <li> I was fairly satisfied with it but ended up growing my beard back and only periodically using it.  </li>
            <li> Then again, maybe the more expensive models shave better???  </li>
            <li> I use it mainly on my face but have also used it on my head.  </li>
            <li> I use it mainly on my face but have also used it on my head.  </li>
            <li> It is light and quiet compared to my old one.    </li>
            <li> It does not shave good at all, I wasted $100, I will have to go back and buy one of the Power Touch models.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS NOT REQUIRED ON THE OLDER NORELCO SHAVERS</li>
            <li> older model</li>
            <li> The design also seems far more careful in consideration of moving parts</li>
            <li> The main advantage of an electric shaver is the speed to get the shave done.  </li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t pay a premium for it...  buy and older model...  </li>
            <li> The battery lasts through several shaves and recharges quickly.  </li>
            <li> not as quick as with the traditional blade, but is convenient..</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as my older Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> Considering its price, I guess it&#x27;s a decent buy.</li>
            <li> Blue is very beautiful,Very powerful micro motors.</li>
            <li> Since I use my Braun every two or three weeks for quick touch-ups, I didn&#x27;t think this was necessary.</li>
            <li> most likely will not return to blade shaving, even if the medication is no&lt;br /&gt;longer necessary.  </li>
            <li> For the cost that is asked, It is not even remotely as decent as it should be.</li>
            <li> Just has lost a lot of convience compaired to the older design.</li>
            <li> It does not seem to give as close a shave as my older Norelco did.</li>
            <li> and I mainly use them when I travel (about 10~12 times a year).</li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t grab a quick shave if the charge is low.  </li>
            <li> The cutting action isn&#x27;t superb but sufficient.</li>
            <li> This is a decent shaver, but I didn&#x27;t find the shave itself to be particularly close compared to cheaper electric shavers that I&#x27;ve had:</li>
            <li> I have an older Norelco razor that gives me a closer shave.</li>
            <li> This 2D 1150X appears to be able to perform all the mobile functions of the more expensive models.    </li>
            <li> I UPGRADED FROM OLDER NORELCO SHAVER.</li>
            <li> And only one hour quick charge.</li>
            <li> This is for sure my last Norelco product with or without rebate, time to buy quality next time.</li>
            <li> It is super quiet when using.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how the higher models could do much better.</li>
            <li> This shaver gave a good feel for initial few months of use as the shave was close</li>
            <li> This is a decent razor, but I ended up returning it.  </li>
            <li> Most discouragingly, I am currently chatting with a representative from Philips simply named \\&quot;Mack\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> You will be able to see the credit applied on your account at the checkout page while placing the order and it will neither be applied on the items which are sold and shipped by a third party seller or sold by a third party seller and shipped by Amazon.  </li>
            <li> my friend recommended this to me for my boy friend, was expecting more as this is the most expensive one I&#x27;ve bought.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> You can get a fast and clean shave because you can use it with your dry skin.</li>
            <li> Decent price.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It does run quieter than I expected, the impression is that it isn&#x27;t as strong but in fact it does quite well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> all, I&#x27;d have to say this is a fantastic item, and the only minor flaw I see is my own worry that if I dropped it, the small pivoting head, should it land just right, would be damaged...</li>
            <li> Although the trimmer is considerably more useful than the built-in trimmer of previous models, it&#x27;s also another small, easy to lose part.</li>
            <li> Overall, battery life is good and blades last really long.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how people can rate this razor so high</li>
            <li> Id highly recommend the Norelco 1150x/40</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recomend.</li>
            <li> use them while I am taking a shower, so the chances of water getting inside them is high, but</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the 1150 model, depending on features you want.</li>
            <li> High quality.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS RAZOR</li>
            <li> The product is in high quality.</li>
            <li> The circular-pressing motion you&#x27;re asked to do gets a bit tiring at first, my wrist started feeling strange near the end of my second shave, but it&#x27;s not a problem any more.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend  to anyone thinking of going electric.</li>
            <li> I decided to try a high quality electric razor to see how it compares.</li>
            <li> The product has a high cost performance, I have used thisrazor two weeks.</li>
            <li> High quality construction.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> We both highly recommend it for both men &amp; women.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> A wonderful shave that is quick and no longer such a painful chore.</li>
            <li> The other comment he made is that he gets a better shave with the old shaver than with this one.  </li>
            <li> My old one (forgot the model) lasted 15 years with the original battery and only !</li>
            <li> , I read all the fine prints really carefully.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it improves my shaving experience, but certainly doesn&#x27;t replace my old razors.</li>
            <li> The Norelco was comfortable to hold, quiet and had extraordinary battery life - nearly two weeks of long shaves.  </li>
            <li> and it is getting a little better</li>
            <li> I love the 3 head design and the way it pivots, plus the blue is pretty sharp.</li>
            <li> I bought a Philips Norelco SensoTouch Shaver from Amazon on Nov, 2011 with $30 mail-in rebate.&lt;br /&gt;After more than three months, Philips sent me a little rejection card, which says that \\&quot;Manufacturer&#x27;s discount taken at cash register are not valid for rebate promotions\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> &amp; he&#x27;s been shaving nearly 70 years!!  </li>
            <li> This is my first Norelco, after using many other traditional shavers.</li>
            <li> A little more effort there gets it done, though.  </li>
            <li> pay a little more and get quality.</li>
            <li> I find that I have to spend a little more time shaving to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Philips for finally bringing out a product in the market that is pure delight!</li>
            <li> I prefer the older chord capable of plugging directly into the shaver.</li>
            <li> This works fine for him, but, it takes him twice as long to get a close shave as his old razor.</li>
            <li> Shaving is very clean, and hurt less than the face.</li>
            <li> No other electric I have ever owned is as smooth as this, but my current fave electric shaver is the Remongton F5.</li>
            <li> No other electric I have ever owned is as smooth as this, but my current fave electric shaver is the Remongton F5.</li>
            <li> Easily learned but not as convienent as the hinged head assembly on the other models I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> The nice thing is is you dont have to press hard to get the hairs.</li>
            <li> Doesnt shave as close as a wet shave with normal razor, but it shaves close enough and is very easy to use/clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Looking forward its further special offers</li>
            <li> When a more intense cleaning is needed you can disassemble the entire shaver assembly and clean out each rotary blade individually with the included brush (I actually throw the blades and heads into the dishwasher on a sanitize cycle to get them extra</li>
            <li> These are the reasons:  - The razor heads seem to turn at a much slower pace than the 7310, therefore, a complete shave takes almost twice the time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft on the face and really does shave \\&quot;as close as a blade.\\&quot; Cleanup is a breeze.</li>
            <li> Compare my old type Philips shaver this one get much improvements.</li>
            <li> This Norelco worked great in all areas for me, plus got all those difficult neck and chin hairs with ease.</li>
            <li> The action and the technology of the newer Model 1150x is much improved.</li>
            <li> Even then it takes longer to shave than with my old (much cheaper) razor.  </li>
            <li> wow, norelco really came through.  </li>
            <li> Just remember to clean it and dry it off after....</li>
            <li> My husband loves the Norelco &amp; I do also as it truly gives him a close shave &amp; his skin is so smooth with absolutely no stubble.</li>
            <li> I guess only time will tell if that proves to be the case.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;aquatec\\&quot; feature alone is enough to make this razor worth it.</li>
            <li> Overall pleased with the razor, haven&#x27;t tried using it with wet shaving cream yet, but it seems to work fine dry.</li>
            <li> I have ALWAYS used normal razors.</li>
            <li> Shave quality is normal.</li>
            <li> I saw a commercial on TV and then researched reviews online and decided it was worth</li>
            <li> I rinse it with hot water after each use and it is ready to go for the next shave.</li>
            <li> razor is only worth about $20</li>
            <li> but I like it better than the Williams Lectic Shave without the green tea.  </li>
            <li> The product itself worth the money, they were offering $30 rebate when I purchase this shaver, and I followed their instruction and send rebate form back with the bar code</li>
            <li> One of the better razors I have had, had a few over the years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Philips Norelco shavers before, and this one is pretty much the same.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s actually a hole where the plastic has broken off and more cracks spidering from the top of the button as well.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> I may still think it was only worth $10 if that tells you anything.  </li>
            <li> I love it,and use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I normally shave 2-3 times per week.</li>
            <li> I have always found the round tri-head electric shavers from Norelco work much better than the foil syle design from Remington and others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using mine for 6 months now with no complaint.</li>
            <li> A few more days will tell.</li>
            <li> I get in grown hairs all the time from just normal shaving.</li>
            <li> All in all - good, but not great.    </li>
            <li> a Norelco which was good but not great in those days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sometimes it still leaves a good deal of residual hair behind if I don&#x27;t check closely.</li>
            <li> Its good as long as I shave everyday.</li>
            <li> it glides smooth over your face and the tough spots to shave under the chin are easy because it pivots inwards.</li>
            <li> It cuts my beard fine, but so do other shavers.</li>
            <li> The rebate has a fine print saying \\&quot;May not be combined with other offers\\&quot;, but the $30 discount by Amazon is not an offer by Philips.</li>
            <li> This shaver is a much better shaving unit than the previous XL models!</li>
            <li> He had a razor that was 4 years old and really needed a new one.</li>
            <li> The upside is this razor does not cause as much razor burn as his old one did even when it was brand new.</li>
            <li> Amazingly you can wet shave or dry shave with this electric razor.  </li>
            <li> Have 2 other old ones that are years old that are much better.</li>
            <li> This type of shaver, with three heads, doesn&#x27;t allow you to shave right under your nose well, especially if your are shaving around a mustache, as I need to.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE A LIGHT BEARD, AND NORMALLY DO THIS EVERY OTHER WEEK</li>
            <li> Those who want the Jet Clean system should try the 1250, as long as they are willing to pay the premium and don&#x27;t mind the hassle and expense of changing the fluid.      </li>
            <li> Was bought this razor as a christmas gift, I have very sensative skin and this one works great wet or dry, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like other razors do</li>
            <li> Blades still holding strong and sharp after 2 years of regular usage (Note: Not daily usage but twice a week on average)&lt;br /&gt;- Comfortable grip, head swivel movement and wet-use&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wet shave was also smooth and the unit easy to clean but still not quite as close as a typical 3 to 5 edge safety razor and probably should not be expected to.</li>
            <li> it got his neck smooth, smoother than any other shaver he has tried.  </li>
            <li> and Philips sent me a new handle within a week.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is the cheapest out of all of these new style Norelco&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> A week ago i saw the new sensotouch, which was 50 dollars cheaper and water proof, so i returned the 8000 series and bought this one.</li>
            <li> I bought a new Norelco 1150X and have had it for 3 months now.</li>
            <li> I bought a new Panasonic ES-GA-21S razor in October 2010 and regretted it.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for a new razor.</li>
            <li> so I was in the market for a new shaver.  </li>
            <li> , so I get my new 1150.</li>
            <li> Well, wait, now the 1150x has this new neck pivot device.</li>
            <li> The item arrived just in time and as described, brand new.</li>
            <li> New blades are over $40.  </li>
            <li> I purchased tis electric shaver after trying my college bound sons new one that his Mother bought for him for school.</li>
            <li> new one</li>
            <li> (model varied over time) and did not have any problems, just wanted to try the fancy new \\&quot;blue\\&quot; electric shaver.      </li>
            <li> Now Norelco has made a new version that cuts almost as close as the blade.</li>
            <li> In may 2011 I purchased a new Norelco 1150 model...</li>
            <li> When I need new one, I choice Philips too.</li>
            <li> I may not have gotten used to this new shaver.</li>
            <li> &quot; brings increasing prices of the blades and lessening durability along with the \\&quot;new, 23 blades and shaves your dog too!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> New Senso Touch(2D) is the one WE got for him.</li>
            <li> They sent me a new shaver head which I am still evaluating.  </li>
            <li> I have used Norelco for years and felt it was time for a new razor.</li>
            <li> After months of unsatisfactory shaving with a safety razor, I&#x27;ve heard nothing but praise from him about this new razor.  </li>
            <li> but this new one is so updated.  </li>
            <li> Eventually, the battery begins to lose charging capacity or a new \\&quot;must-have\\&quot; feature is introduced that compels me to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> I guess that I learned to live with it.</li>
            <li> new class is the 3D).  </li>
            <li> I suppose I could crack the new one</li>
            <li> My face needed no adjustment time for this new razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the 8260XL for a couple of years now and switched to the 1150x/40 SensoTouch for something new.  </li>
            <li> With this unit once the batteries start to die it is basically time to get a new one.</li>
            <li> While I was waiting to get the new Norelco</li>
            <li> This new razor gives a close shave.  </li>
            <li> I thought a new  razor would be quieter.</li>
            <li> will my new one to my dad.</li>
            <li> , so I&#x27;m on the prowl for a new razor.</li>
            <li> live in LA</li>
            <li> I have to remove the shaver head and attach a separate trimmer head on my new shaver.  </li>
            <li> Also, the new shaver requires a separate charging stand.  </li>
            <li> If you are at your ends wit for shaving and want something new, try this.</li>
            <li> When I got the new razor</li>
            <li> decided to give the new shaver a quick try at a dry shave, with five days of growth on my face.  </li>
            <li> I never thought it was important, but I found out how much I had been missing.  </li>
            <li> Used it dry and the shave is very close, left my face smooth.</li>
            <li> I like the way you clean the rotary blades, and I have not tried using it as a wet shaver.  </li>
            <li> The dry or wet feature makes it even more readily usable.</li>
            <li> I still get a comfortable and quiet shave, and the shave is still close enough even with year-old shaving head blades.</li>
            <li> older Norelco&#x27;s plugged in directly for recharging, but this model comes with a charger stand.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really speak to the effectiveness of the trimmer, as three days&#x27; growth isn&#x27;t enough for it to really make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My facial hair doesn&#x27;t really grow THAT fast, statistically speaking...</li>
            <li> The razor ended up being shipped way earlier than expected and I am now able to give it as a gift for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Not a big deal, it&#x27;s easy to do, but it&#x27;s still an extra step that I didn&#x27;t have to do with my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> However, the Norelco 1150x did NOT shave nearly as close and comfortably as my older Panasonic ES8103S that it was intended to replace.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few and this one just feels more comfortable and irritates my skin less.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, re-assembling the heads isn&#x27;t terribly difficult, and you get better at it with practice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After all, a charge lasted for weeks, no nicks, cuts or razor burn while getting a close quick dry shave.  </li>
            <li> The low battery light alerts you when there are 5 minutes of shave time left.  </li>
            <li> but I really didn&#x27;t notice much of a change in closeness of shave, just a change in overall comfort.    </li>
            <li> The same rebate that was good only on Black Friday and advertised on the Amazon website as being valid on the razor.</li>
            <li> The low battery light alerts you when there are 5 minutes of shave time left.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave as fast as my old 12 year old Norelco did.</li>
            <li> I forget the model, but it would leave stray hairs here and there and would give me tons of irritation as I have kind of a thick beard and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Nothing exceptional, but nothing irritating in any way.  </li>
            <li> My husband has very sensitive and irritable skin.</li>
            <li> its not convenient to travel with and the contacts are very sensitive.</li>
            <li> Shaving is very soft.</li>
            <li> Thus, it happened with me that 2 times the shaver got on by itself in the shaving kit bag given that the button are very sensitive to touch (thus name \\&quot; Sensotouch\\&quot;)</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for such products.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Almost completely misses the hair on my upper lip right under my nose.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Enjoy.al attachment, though it&#x27;s worth it since it functions better than the pop-up on the 1250  -- The battery lasts less time than all other SensoTouch models  </li>
            <li> I am Chinese buyers, this robot is too great, you deserve it, although we Chinese made, but you America price than our domestic prices cheaper by half</li>
            <li> If you buying an electric shaver for the first time, skip this section and read the next     Electric shavers basically come in 2 types - Rotary (philips norelco) &amp; foil (braun &amp; panasonic)     </li>
            <li> so far!  </li>
            <li> As some reviewers have already stated, the first thing you notice is it is very quiet.</li>
            <li> Amazons price and shipping as usual was outstanding.</li>
            <li> I have been a Norelco user for the past 15 years and have always  been satisfied with their shavers.</li>
            <li> The first time I shaved, the shaver left crease marks on my neck all over.</li>
            <li> Over the last year I have been obsessed with having the perfect daily shave.</li>
            <li> This is the third Norelco I&#x27;ve owned, although it is my first higher-end shaver.</li>
            <li> In addition, either the motion or the heat (not that it felt hot) from the head made my skin red and sore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You have to take the stand with you because you can&#x27;t plug into the shaver directly!</li>
            <li> While it wasn&#x27;t completely their fault, I can&#x27;t believe they did it!</li>
            <li> I think it will be better if the price can be lower to 49.99 as in the past.</li>
            <li> This shaver has just amazed me, better than any  electric or blades that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually take time to review products, but thought I would because I&#x27;ve been so pleased.  </li>
            <li> It shaves pretty close to a regular blade.  </li>
            <li> * slightly more expensive to replace blades (+$5) since 1150X replacements include the entire flex head and drive shaft/springs, not just the blades, however this means more of the unit is \\&quot;new\\&quot; each time, so eh&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I guess I need to be aware next time</li>
            <li> I had to go over the same area many times and it still left hairs, especially in the neck area.</li>
            <li> SmartTouch has a wheel that has 3 positions for Normal and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> And the first charge lasted for almost a month, after daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The razor itself is pretty basic.</li>
            <li> It is his first electric razor, he has only tried it once.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers I want to say that philips did not honour our rebates and they give different reasons by mail and when you call them.</li>
            <li> design.&lt;br /&gt;- Not really quiet but a better timbre than other shavers makes it seem quieter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The facial part it works great at but the attatchment for trimming overall sucks.</li>
            <li> Always blood after shaving now no more ,specially I love shaving with Electric Razor specially&lt;</li>
            <li> Other wise, this was certainly a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll still use the new one, but wished I&#x27;d just bought new blades for the old one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Prices in Phillips keep getting higher and higher to a point that it is becoming ridiculous, so it is time to give a chance to my Chinese friends, and try one of theirs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first few shaves were spotty and left many random stragglers, but after about 5 days of shaving daily, I began getting the best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten with a DRY electric.  </li>
            <li> He had to use the shaver multiple times at the same area to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> Older one was much cheaper and did same job as this one.</li>
            <li> It shaves reasonably well, but the increased articulation of this design still isn&#x27;t enough to cut around the angles of my jaw, which was the reason I bought this particular model.</li>
            <li> You have to shave back forth several times to be clean.  </li>
            <li> It did not shave of the hairs on my neck cleanly, and I had to rotate it back and forth and around multiple times before it shaved the hair on my face.  </li>
            <li> The 1150x is more difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is the neck problem also where i need to use a razor to finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;The hair storage capacity is very low and you need to open it and clean after each use for optimal</li>
            <li> You might as well go with a cheaper electric razor as the blades will last just as long and most likely longer than the blades on this high priced razor.</li>
            <li> Clean and sharp on shaving.</li>
            <li> It delivers a very close, comfortable shave, especially, using some hot water and a small amount of shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a replacement for my old Norelco, which wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge and needed new heads.  </li>
            <li> I shave every weekday; my old shaver needed a new blade every 14 months or so.</li>
            <li> Old Norelco needed new batteries and shaving head.  </li>
            <li> Do not feel very easy to use, yet my old clean shaven, the other is only charging cradle too much trouble</li>
            <li> Combined with my Amazon Prime free shipping, I paid much less than my price</li>
            <li> Secondly, the shavers have come a long way in getting a comfortable and closer shave.  </li>
            <li> It gives me close smooth shave compared to the previous one arcitec.</li>
            <li> It may sound odd, but I can move the shaver around my face faster with the soap/wather greasing the skids, so to speak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned to use the SensoTouch with a light touch, and the payoff is a close shave with less irritation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned to use the SensoTouch with a light touch, and the payoff is a close shave with less irritation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned to use the SensoTouch with a light touch, and the payoff is a close shave with less irritation.</li>
            <li> I only ever used it dry, as I had no need to attempt a closer shave, and liked the convenience of a dry shave.  </li>

            <li> I only ever used it dry, as I had no need to attempt a closer shave, and liked the convenience of a dry shave.</li>
            <li> quiet, fast and clean shave, not very comparable to manual shaver though.</li>
            <li> It has been more convenient in the past to plug in the old Norelco&#x27;s   using the power cord, and let it charge overnight.</li>
            <li> product is ok, but not powerful enough.</li>
            <li> The blade-head is also pretty abusive to skin--maybe I&#x27;m extra sensitive--</li>
            <li> There are several customers having the same issue and Amazon has issued them full refunds:  </li>
            <li> I always shave wet (usually in the shower) and I use a good, non-foaming gel (King of Shaves).</li>
            <li> Nice little razor, I don&#x27;t care for dry shave, irritates my skin, but using it with shaving cream is assume.  </li>
            <li> , you can&#x27;t get a good grip on it because it feels like you could easily damage the cutting foils, and that it could go flying out of the hand when it snaps loose.  </li>
            <li> In fact, having become used to the raucous hum of older electric razors, the Norelco doesn&#x27;t SOUND powerful enough to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My most recent Braun shaver&#x27;s battery would no longer hold a long enough charge and it was time for a replacement.  </li>
            <li> No Neha, I am due the full $30.  </li>
            <li> I must say; up until now, I thought safety razors with double edge blades were the most economical razors since there was hardly any waste other than your own blood.</li>
            <li> But for the \\&quot;20%\\&quot; of smaller hairs, it takes a very long time to get a smooth shave with this.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I&#x27;ve owned one other shaver (Foil) that shaved much faster BUT irritated my face very much.</li>
            <li> the XL is more solidly built, but gives less of a close shave</li>
            <li> If you look back at some of my previous reviews, you&#x27;ll see I&#x27;ve tried most things out there for shaving.</li>
            <li> I have used many electric razors, both dry, and wet &amp; dry.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> (Black men are more susceptible to razor bumps than white men because of the course curly nature of our hair).</li>
            <li> Traditional razors tend to irritate my skin the most, and through experimentation over the years, I have found that Norelco brand razors tend to irritate my skin much less than all the others.  </li>
            <li> but i love the fact that its a wet dry razor.</li>
            <li> It might work better for someone with less facial hair.</li>
            <li> thin and comfortable ,it is very cheap and I strongly suggest every man should buy one thin and cothin and comfortablethin and comfortablethin and comfortablethin and comfortablemfortable</li>
            <li> the most important reason I bought is the low price, which is one-third price of China selling price.&lt;br /&gt;However, after using this, it is not good as I thought, and I found the cleaning effect is same as the cheaper one which made in China.</li>
            <li> RIght side of face, dry shave eh</li>
            <li> This shaver gives a really close smooth shave, whether wet or dry</li>
            <li> Also, a quick shave cleans up the stubble, but if I don&#x27;t use extra time (and effort/pressure), the stubble&#x27;s back by early afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> first time (and only time) using it he tried to shave with a dry face first.</li>
            <li> , I think the point is his beard grows slowly, as for me, I ordered a la63 in 2013, and ordered a 790cc last year, I think these shavers work more efficiently!</li>
            <li> After about a month I can honestly say that I am not very impressed.</li>
            <li> I have shaved with a Norelco razor for several year, this is my first bad one it is noisyier than my other razor&#x27;s and does not shave as good, I recharged my old one and it shaved much better than the new model 1150X</li>
            <li> I would guess that this rebate practice is by an &#x27;opportunistic&#x27; marketing idea from a &#x27;smart&#x27; US Norelco division to increase next quarter sales by &#x27;any&#x27; means.  </li>
            <li> but....the Lectric Shave smelled like pure alcohol, and the Afta left me smelling like an old man, like something my grandpaw wears.</li>
            <li> Still not that hard, but more troublesome than the 8140XL.    </li>
            <li> Since I found this out, I have been using it every other day with somewhat adequate results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;price is surprizingly low while it has very high performace</li>
            <li> The razor and trimming attachment are a little larger than expected but do a good job.</li>
            <li> The razor and trimming attachment are a little larger than expected but do a good job.  </li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned, the shaves from the 1150 come in a very close second to shaves from a blade.  </li>
            <li> Also, the rebate form was clearly offered in the listing of the item on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I like the old one so much that I recently replaced it with another one.</li>
            <li> After using it for a few days, I was surprised how smooth it is.</li>
            <li> Given the fact that I&#x27;m only in my early twenties, I don&#x27;t have that much shaving experience.</li>
            <li> This is a clear example of bait and switch</li>
            <li> He has no complaints with it so far</li>
            <li> and the razor comes alive.  </li>
            <li> However, it  provides soft smooth,quiet shave without irr.itation.  </li>
            <li> I bought this razor after my 3 year old Arcitec decided to die, and I wanted to stay in the Norelco line of razors.  </li>
            <li> I would finish a shave with the old razor, and invariably there would still be 20-30 straggler hairs that I would have to go over a second/third time to catch them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost as if the razor head/foils cut the hair even deeper than the old Arcitec did...</li>
            <li> I dropped the old one when I got it.  </li>
            <li> Cons:  Slow/weak operating action  </li>
            <li> Its cheaper and water proof, which i must say feels so much closer to the traditional shaving experience with a shaving gel and everything.</li>
            <li> I really like the design of it and actually prefer that the heads interchange for shaving and trimming.</li>
            <li> i bought this shaver because my braun 5 series stop charging completely.  </li>
            <li> so this product completely eliminated that problem for me....</li>
            <li> -- There are instructions included showing how to completely disassemble the head, if you need to do so.    </li>
            <li> I was also surprised by razor</li>
            <li> Also, if you really want to do a thorough job, I find that it&#x27;s actually quicker to use a razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks now and its very thorough.  </li>
            <li> It may have been a symptom of my aging razor, but the old one made quite the hum as it went about its business, and I was pleasantly surprised by the SensoTouch.  </li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t had a need to pop off the daily head, so I can&#x27;t comment about the transition to the trimming attachment.  </li>
            <li> Who needs that racket early in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> I am yet to find any shaver that gets as close as a fixed blade and won&#x27;t ever expect to either.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic has an A/C adapter that can be plugged directly into the shaver and the shaver can be used with the cord attached.  </li>
            <li> The closest shave I have got using an electric razor by far.</li>
            <li> This razor replaced a Remington that wasn&#x27;t that old, but it was an inexpensive model and was wearing out fairly early, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I have one gripe with a design issue...there is no way to plug the charger directly into the razor.  </li>
            <li> My old Norelco died and I went online to find a replacement.  </li>
            <li> They work well for my daily routine and work fast.</li>
            <li> It makes the heads last much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> wow factor there.</li>
            <li> After using this shaver, I then took a blade and went over the same spots to see if I could get any closer.....not really.  </li>
            <li> I have to say, so far, it rocks in every way.  </li>
            <li> My old Norelco is about 7 years old (6XXX series) and was about $140 when purchased.  </li>
            <li> I can see that getting old.  </li>
            <li> But so far, I didn&#x27;t receive $30 mail rebate.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not as close a shave as my old Remington&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> but if you should happen to drop it it flies completely to pieces.  </li>
            <li> Cheap waste of time.  </li>
            <li> Buyers should have been told by Amazon if the two offers were mutually exclusive.  </li>
            <li> Having sensitive skin I decided to go with a rotary instead of a foil.</li>
            <li> He is away from home frequently in his work and wanted one for home and another for his  travel bag.  </li>
            <li> While the Norelco was close, it just could not match my old Panasonic in any respect.    </li>
            <li> another day--not the same day--I tried it as part of a wet shave routine only to yield slightly better results (because of the gel, I imagine)</li>
            <li> what it cost me is the razors) and do not waste your money on this trash....</li>
            <li> DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN.</li>
            <li> I was surprised</li>
            <li> In fact I bought this item for one of my friends, he has already bought one for his relative and he really likes it and asked me to but another for him.</li>
            <li> I have a light beard but still need to shave everyday unless I am going hiking or working in the yard on the weekend.     </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem as sturdy as the old one but time will tell.</li>
            <li> It shaved quite well on the straight away&#x27;s, but around the curves and my neck area \\&quot; where I have hairs going in 3 different directions</li>
            <li> far as the trimmer goes, I have no problem with clicking in the separate trimmer blade maybe every week or so</li>
            <li> almost seems as though it&#x27;s not running fast enough to do the job, but it does.</li>
            <li> almost seems as though it&#x27;s not running fast enough to do the job, but it does.</li>
            <li> The contour-following shave heads yield a considerable improvement in comfort and closeness over lower end Norelcos.</li>
            <li> my five year old electric shaver I use.</li>
            <li> my old razor would leave hairs on my neck and struggle to provide a close shave.</li>
            <li> I am moving on from a Norelco 7775x, which is about 7 years old.</li>
            <li> I replaced a 6 year old Norelco with this unit, and have been using this razor for about 1 month.  </li>
            <li> I would have to shave for everyday with the foil one whereas with this one I can go about a day or two without shaving and still have a fairly smooth face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought to replace old, reliable Norelco 7340XL.  </li>
            <li> In the old days, for me this would have led to ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> If he were still alive, I might well have given him this Norelco for Christmas.</li>
            <li> If he were still alive, I might well have given him this Norelco for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I did not have to recharge it until early January, so the battery lasted for about 3.5 months.  </li>
            <li> I paid enough for this product to work much longer ......</li>
            <li> My old one did not need a stand for a charge.</li>
            <li> Old unit had charger built into cord, and cord plugged into unit.</li>
            <li> I use Edge shave cream for sensitive skin and use it in and out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> either party suppose to responsible for such mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He has been using a really old electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, Blue Ridge Books N Gifts!</li>
            <li> A complete charge takes 1 hour, and lasts 40 minutes.  </li>
            <li> So far no complaints.</li>
            <li> and It is lighter and easier to use than my old one.  </li>
            <li> and even he was surprised at the close shave.  </li>
            <li> I bought this on at the time thinking that it would be an improvement to my old electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> Foil shavers such as Braun provide a much eaiser and closer shave.</li>
            <li> I have always used electric razors for ease of use, and this one by far cuts the closest, when compared to the others (but the others were also cheaper x.x).</li>
            <li> IT DOES TAKE SEVERAL PASSES TO GET A REALLY CLOSE SHAVE, BUT MY FACE IS NOT IRITATED FROM THE CLOSENESS AS IT WOULD BE WITH A FOIL HEAD SHAVER.</li>
            <li> Although not purchased here, I am submitting this review because I am a frequent Amazon</li>
            <li> The unit recently developed a crack in the area around the push button that turns it on.</li>
            <li> I have an old Remington 3 Head rotary.</li>
            <li> The blades on the Remington are 6 months old too&lt;</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS RAZOR FOR MY 90 YEAR OLD BROTHER---</li>
            <li> HE TOLD ME TO GIVE HIM MY 2 YEAR OLD NORELCO FOR THIS</li>
            <li> Instead, the 1150x/40 shaved me so well and so comfortably that it has replaced my Braun shaver for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, I can use the neoprene case that came with my old razor.</li>
            <li> and I got feedback that it does not perform very well either after a short period of time.</li>
            <li> So far I did not receive refund.</li>
            <li> you are attempting to combine offers which is not allowed under phillips policy basically stating you cannot stack your coupon with a rebate to get $60 bucks off the item, now amazon did not state anything at the time i purchased the item that you couldnt use the rebate after accepting their coupon upon purchasing the item</li>
            <li> It offers a hassle-free, idiot-proof shave.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s smooth to the eye, it&#x27;s not smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old shaver and after about 3 uses</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now over the years I have tried a number of razors--any number of traditional one-to-four blade straight (disposable) handles, as well as electric units from Remington and Norelco.  </li>
            <li> I have submitted the rebate in early Jan. 2012.</li>
            <li> So far no issues with the product,it have been a year now since this purchase.</li>
            <li> Meaning, you can&#x27;t plug the cord directly into the unit and use it as a corded shaver.</li>
            <li> Purchased to replace old Norelco that was 10 years old.  </li>
            <li> The next will come back to buy bath just sound big</li>
            <li> I do have a really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Like it so much and use it at daily basis.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of facial hair but one charge lasted me almost eight months with 2 or 3</li>
            <li> Shaving with this seems to take a lot longer than my old shaver</li>
            <li> is I have not got the rebate so far.</li>
            <li> I dug out a 10 year old Remington Titanium shaver that I had stopped using.  </li>
            <li> I would have preferred a direct cable connection to recharge the razor</li>
            <li> A complete charge takes 1 hour, and lasts 40 minutes.</li>
            <li> With my old razor, all I had to do was trip the trimmer</li>
            <li> As far as functionality goes, there is nothing that I can complain about.</li>
            <li> If I have to complete a survey like this everytime</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shaver nearly as close as a Brawn, or the Panasonic for that matter.</li>
            <li> I have used Braun shavers for many years (at least since 1988).  </li>
            <li> He has always used Norelco but it far.</li>
            <li> I kept  my old Panasonic shaver and  use its trimmer when needed (it is built in to the shaver)  and do not bother with the swap out.  </li>
            <li> ; that also meant it didn&#x27;t actually shave those areas very well and there was always stubble.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , wich is a complete piece of garbage, in consequence I had my doubts about this one.  </li>
            <li> You figure out how old it is.</li>
            <li> I felt like I was using an experimental Razor.</li>
            <li> Philips refused to honor my complete and on-time rebate submission.  </li>
            <li> I miss my old one.  </li>
            <li> The product is is not worth the full price.</li>
            <li> the plus side, battery life lasts long if, as true with any shaver, you don&#x27;t constantly charge it.  </li>
            <li> Glad I didn&#x27;t waste the extra $100 for the 3D.  </li>
            <li> The charging base that it sits in didn&#x27;t seem to be of the best construction.  </li>
            <li> Not perfect but still a good shaver.</li>
            <li> I have thick course neck hair, a lot more course than the stuff on my cheeks, and</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the items themselves good</li>
            <li> This shaver takes care of neck hair and  fine facial hairs that my other shavers missed.</li>
            <li> It most certainly did get a much nicer cleaner shave, almost as clean a blade, but I was left with a shredded up neck line and bad irration.</li>
            <li> I would rate this shaver average mainly because it leaves hairs mainly around neck and no matter how much you move this around it wont pick those.</li>
            <li> But this razor doesn&#x27;t cut any closer than my old Norelco, a 73--XL, which is about 10 years old and needs new heads, and cost about only 40% of this new one.</li>
            <li> For half the price, you get as good of, if not a better shave from the cheaper product, with almost none of the inconveniences.  </li>
            <li> do like the fact that because the unit is water tight I can quickly clean the razor under the sink faucet.</li>
            <li> basically, my usage feedback after couple months are  -  it is not standing out while comparing with other low end Philips shaver, it is quite stylish, but considering the actual shaving performance, I just gave 3 starts.</li>
            <li> But, when you come right down to it, I can shave with a blade and clean up faster than with the Norelco (or any other wet/dry</li>
            <li> But, when you come right down to it, I can shave with a blade and clean up faster than with the Norelco (or any other wet/dry</li>
            <li> just right for it to make the connections &amp; be careful not to bump it.</li>
            <li> The razor fits easily into the hand and while running the SensoTouch 1150x Electric Shaver is quieter than the unit it replaces, the motor is underpowered and I could actually hear the blades slowing down if I pressed the razor to closely to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The razor fits easily into the hand and while running the SensoTouch 1150x Electric Shaver is quieter than the unit it replaces, the motor is underpowered and I could actually hear the blades slowing down if I pressed the razor to closely to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The recharging station/stand is a slim cradle with a small footprint, which easily fits in any bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I say shaving dry with an electric razor is only slightly better than shaving dry with a blade.</li>
            <li> I have not given it the full month and a half trial yet.</li>
            <li> He likes to shave in the shower, and until recently, it was difficult to find a good rechargeable shaver that would hold up to true wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> All my previous dry razors would catch and stick and my skin was even the slighest bit most.  </li>
            <li> Cheap feel  Difficult to clean blades  </li>
            <li> On top of this they refuse to honor the advertised rebate, because of the fine print which is very vague.</li>
            <li> as smooth as using a conventional razor!!</li>
            <li> Very comfortableto use,  buy not sharp enough,  </li>
            <li> The other thing I am not crazy about it</li>
            <li> The more expensive models also include a larger capacity battery with shaving time up to 1 hour on a full charge, and a standby duration of up to 20 days.  </li>
            <li> that charger doesn&#x27;t take up much space at all on the vanity and that the contact points are high, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about a wet countertop causing problems.  </li>
            <li> For an extra $20, I bought the sexy blue razor instead of the stripped down model.  </li>
            <li> With this new razor, I notice maybe 5 stragglers, and they will sweep up on my second pass usually, making this razor easily 5 minutes faster than using my old Arcitec.  </li>
            <li> I recently replaced my older Norelco with a foil shaver.</li>
            <li> the shave is a vast improvement over my older norelco (which has been discontinued).  </li>
            <li> Decent enough electric razor, bought anticipating the Philips $30 rebate offer, should have made the razor $19.95 after Amazon coupon and Philips rebate.  </li>
            <li> Putting it back together is sometimes problematic because the plastic piece that holds the heads together must face a particular way or the head won&#x27;t stay in one piece.</li>
            <li> The shaver manages that funny, difficult area just under the nostrils well too -- in fact, much better than my Mach 3 does.</li>
            <li> I recently got this for my teenage son as his first shaver.  </li>
            <li> However upon purchasing this nice device I have found this to be even more economical than my safety razor; it not only reduces the risk of nicks or cuts but also unnecessary products, ie., shaving cream, soaps, and  brush; needless  with this tool.</li>
            <li> Powerful and battery can last long time.</li>
            <li> the shave is close (and that is why you buy a razor), but the overall construction feels flimsy comparison to my 3 older Norelco.</li>
            <li> the older models also last longer on a substanially longer charge.</li>
            <li> so sure how this will effect the long term usability of the blade (we all produce oils and dead skin cells that the razor will pick up and lodge into the blades)</li>
            <li> I had an older Norelco that finally quit.  </li>
            <li> There was initially some razor burn, but this quickly subsided by the time I used it a third and fourth time.    </li>
            <li> When this happens (like it did with my last older style)</li>
            <li> his prior (older)</li>
            <li> the older model left my face burning...</li>
            <li> Both wet and dry shaving are supported; cleaning and taking apart the shaving head is very easy, just rinse under the tap and air dry.    </li>
            <li> I like this model because I&#x27;m not willing to pay the extra money for the jet clean system.  </li>
            <li> Overall highly recommend for a purchase.</li>
            <li> so that is a great outcome, but there is a considerable amount of stubble left behind, shaving wet (in the shower) or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My 10 year old Norelco Advantage Wet/Dry razor finally broke, so it was time to get a new razor.  </li>
            <li> The wet shave is so comfortable that I wouldn&#x27;t even think of using it as a dry shaver.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit longer to shave than a straight razor as previously mentioned, but the shave is very close.  </li>
            <li> Smooth as silk in using it, dry or wet alike.</li>
            <li> Some people complain but for under a 100 bucks, it easily compares to some of the other more expensive shavers out there.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy having the ability to use it in the shower which is where I usually shave.</li>
            <li> The razor charges fast and the charge lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> This one feels cheap, sounds weak, and doesn&#x27;t cut thicker hair very well.</li>
            <li> burn this morning when I used it wet for the first time (with a shaving gel)</li>
            <li> The base is fantastic, I love it!</li>
            <li> The shaver would have been worth the $20, but not worth it without the rebate being honored as stated.  </li>
            <li> Only other thing is that it doesn&#x27;t do a great job if you go several days in between shaves (unless your beard grows slow).  </li>
            <li> The 1150X is missing a replace shaving heads indicator, cleaning indicator, and full numeric battery level indicator.  </li>
            <li> Even though it is not updated technical advances and&lt;br /&gt;fancy gadgets, the price is reasonable and it costs more than half less compared with Sensor Touch 3.</li>
            <li> Fabulous shave, wet or dry!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It need multiple times for clean shave, not worth to money</li>
            <li> While at the bottom of the razor isn&#x27;t a huge issue, my razor has actually had the plastic broken right by the on/off button.  </li>
            <li> The last time I used an electric shaver was over 20 years ago and things have certainly changed yet some remain the same.  </li>
            <li> and this one first impression was not as clean shave as previous ones, also it says change blades after 1 year, when previous ones i used without changing blades.</li>
            <li> means I can shave my chin areas easily, which is something I found hard to do with the Braun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few 3-head rotary razors over the past few years, and for the most part, they do okay.  </li>
            <li> and I was excited to give it a spin because it is a wet and dry shaver.</li>
            <li> After several Panasonic Linear shavers (which I use primarly wet with shaving cream), I was excited to try the Norelco 1150x because of its similar ratings and wet/dry capability.      </li>
            <li> Now three decades later, I try the new Norelco SensoTouch Electric and I have to say with a lot of shaving a wetting the beard</li>
            <li> I investigated the new shavers and watched the corporate video for this one.  </li>
            <li> Even new, that one&#x27;s battery only lasted 3 or 4 shaves.  </li>
            <li> I opted to try the 1150 given a replacement head for the 1060 cost $50 and the new razor was only $89.  </li>
            <li> He repairs versus buying new, but I convinced him to give this one a try after telling him about the screamin&#x27; deal I got with Amazon which included a hefty mail-in rebate - making this razor ultimately 75% off.</li>
            <li> With every razor I have, the *only* reason I have purchased a new one is because I can&#x27;t get replacement blades for the one I have.</li>
            <li> this is the second one i bought,this time i want to buy a new one for my friend.so</li>
            <li> I want to buy a new one if necessary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely getting a smoother shave with the new shaver, but</li>
            <li> However, the new razor has clipped the skin at the corners of my mouth a couple of times and left me bleeding - ouch!  </li>
            <li> I returned this Norelco and ordered a new Remington R5130xlp (about the same price).  </li>
            <li> I am considering sending the new razor back.  </li>
            <li> My husband is on blood thinners for a medical condition, loves the new shaver.</li>
            <li> you can easily pop the cutting heads off of and then just run it under some water to clean.  </li>
            <li> For me it gives better results than my previous foil shaver, and makes far less noise.</li>
            <li> My unit is currently cracking the plastic on the on/off switch and so much for potentially using this in the shower, anymore.  </li>
            <li> It is super quiet - not even half as loud as the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> Have a basic old Norelco shaver which I like but is getting old.</li>
            <li> Back then I used a straight blade electric Remington which I definitely did not care for and</li>
            <li> My last electric shaver was a Norelco Quadra action and it&#x27;s about 15 years old.  </li>
            <li> My next Norelco will have a charging meter to tell me how much shaving time I have left.</li>
            <li> It seems it is much easier to use from former model from same company.</li>
            <li> It has an LED display that shows you how much time is left before recharging is necessary.</li>
            <li> It has an LED display that shows you how much time is left before recharging is necessary.  </li>
            <li> I do not have beard, have only light mustache which I shave everyday.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed that the foil heads had nowhere near the same number of holes as my old shaver.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It would also be much better if the clipper were somehow &amp;#34;built-in&amp;#34; ... or at least if Philips was providing a proper case for storage.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of this shaver in terms of how well it works and its battery life, but one area where it really falls short is its travel-friendliness.</li>
            <li> Provides and excellent shave, but my only quibble is that you need to use a base to recharge the shaver.</li>
            <li> the blade speed is a little slow, but in general, my rate is GOOD, 3 stars.  </li>
            <li> and it is very apparent</li>
            <li> My very old Philips Norelco, which was similar in design, had just died.  </li>
            <li> Look is very sleek and the blue color is a nice change from the standard silver or black on his past</li>
            <li> holy moley, this 1150 contours my scalp/and head like no other razor or blade</li>
            <li> I thought it could be due to the first shave..</li>
            <li> They contended that the qualification for the rebate offer specified &#x27;no other discounts&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Each of the past ones has simply worn out after many years of regular use.  </li>
            <li> 1150 takes me less time and less efforrt to shave, which is very important.</li>
            <li> Using for a few days now and so far the ONLY problem is that below the chin its hard to maneuver and get a good shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The new Philips Norelco 1150x is one slick shaving device that looks right out of Star Trek.</li>
            <li> The large head means that it&#x27;s harder for me to miss an errant, bit of stubble.</li>
            <li> Sorry Norelco/Amazon, but time moves on and so have I.  Moral: never change a design that has worked for many years just to sucker in some new shavers in the youth crowd who don&#x27;t know better.  </li>
            <li> I had to go over everything multiple times to get a clean shave, and I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> And that for me is the main disadvantage of the razor; while the Advantage 7735X shaves closely, without lotion, and even better with it, without some sort of moisturizer the SensoTouch 1150x Electric Shaver fails to shave as closely</li>
            <li> And that for me is the main disadvantage of the razor; while the Advantage 7735X shaves closely, without lotion, and even better with it, without some sort of moisturizer the SensoTouch 1150x Electric Shaver fails to shave as closely</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to press as hard to get a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> plan to file my complaints with other customer right agencies like BBB or FTC.&lt;br /&gt;For those who have been denied rebate by Phillips, you could do the same.</li>
            <li> Braun foil systems worked well for me, but, as I have gotten older and my facial hair has gotten more random in its orientation and curvature, problems developed.</li>
            <li> Works much better with water (I&#x27;ve been using mine for a week now), but I spent 20 minutes dry shaving the other day and still had \\&quot;strays\\&quot; all over my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> I used previous \\&quot;standard\\&quot; norelco razor for many  years but this surpasses it for closeness of shave, shaving in tight areas (e.g. under nose), quickness and duration of charge, and effectiveness of trimmer (separate attach).</li>
            <li> My husband uses it for general shaving purposes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We have reported this to Amazon, State Attorney general and BBB.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I just reported this issue to PA State Attorney General.</li>
            <li> But, this is all secondary: my face is, for all intents and purposes, as smooth as if shaved with a blade.</li>
            <li> , when clearly it does not cut hair properly around the neckline.</li>
            <li> only issue I had with the purchase is Philips declined my rebate request even though Amazon clearly stated it&#x27;s eligible for the rebate.</li>
            <li> For cutting long hairs, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> &quot; Clearly, that meant that you cannot use two rebates from Norelco on the same item, not that you cannot receive a discount from the seller and still be eligible for a rebate.</li>
            <li> You have to shave multiple times to have clear shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so convenient and small enough to fit anywhere.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is you have to charge it in the cradle and can&#x27;t plug the charger directly into the shaver.</li>
            <li> The razor barely cut his beard.</li>
            <li> Because the last one was almost 2 years old.</li>
            <li> No regrets on my purchase...</li>
            <li> I like the wet shave feature of this shaver so much, that i stopped using Gillette fusion.</li>
            <li> but with 3 day growth, it actually hurt to shave as my face is somewhat sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Starting with a Fusion I had by far the closest shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband since his 20 year old Braun is finally failing.  </li>
            <li> I have used various Norelco and Panasonic shavers for nearly 25 years.  </li>
            <li> they will reject mail-in rebate offers simply because you buy it at a discounted price from Amazon.</li>
            <li> As for the neck, I can barely shave it.</li>
            <li> I just bought this electric shaver in early janurary, after by last norelco was lost.</li>
            <li> It is definitely different in style and features than my old one.     </li>
            <li> We will see if it last me 10 years like the old one</li>
            <li> This shaver gives a close shave even though you barely feel the shaver against your face.  </li>
            <li> This razor works very well with shaving cream and a wet shave.</li>
            <li> also, if you have tried a Braun razor you  know what a loud razor sounds like.its like starting an outboard motor..  </li>
            <li> It is not as close as a razor, but the sensitive areas of my neck don&#x27;t hurt any longer from the razors after only one week.  </li>
            <li> We finally get it fixed.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t given me any razor burns and the shave is much smoother and closer than I expected from an electric razor</li>
            <li> I have a young teenager who was starting to look a bit scruffy until I purchased this razor from Phillips Norelco for him.  </li>
            <li> As the product documentation says, try to use it on every shave instead of switching back to your old razor in between.</li>
            <li> I did only once with the old shaver</li>
            <li> The 1150x has potential, but so far, has not provided as close a shave as the 8260XL.  </li>
            <li> I going back to my old shaver</li>
            <li> I returned the razor and went back to my old model.  </li>
            <li> A month after submitting the paper work, I got a notice back from Phillips saying that they don&#x27;t do dual offers (I&#x27;m paraphrasing).  </li>
            <li> I ended up going back to the old shaver.</li>
            <li> After about 10+ years, I finally had to replace m old Norelco electric shaver and replaced it with the 2d 1150/40 SensoTouch 2d.  </li>
            <li> every angle possible before i get a complete shave.  </li>
            <li> Fast charging of the accumulators, the possibility of wet shaving</li>
            <li> :-O-:</li>
            <li> i opened box and there was no trimmer O.O</li>
            <li> I can only recommend this razor for perhaps 15 year-olds with only a few whiskers or others who have light beards.</li>
            <li> I can only recommend this razor for perhaps 15 year-olds with only a few whiskers or others who have light beards.</li>
            <li> I used the same Norelco for nearly 25 years.</li>
            <li> The trimmer on this razor barely cuts hair.</li>
            <li> It simply vibrates and doesn&#x27;t do anything as far as trying to even up sideburns or even shaping my stash.</li>
            <li> I am returning this and asking for a refund and going back to my old Remington.</li>
            <li> After about a year of using it, he stopped using it and went back to his old razor.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s had far more expensive razors that haven&#x27;t worked nearly as well.  </li>
            <li> Rotaries are good for cutting longer hairs</li>
            <li> Note that I also shave my head with this razor, and again, it does okay, but not great.  </li>
            <li> All in all, I  would have to say that I am satisfied and they are standing behind their product.</li>
            <li> And even then, it still misses spots and is more frustrating than anything else.  </li>
            <li> A bit more irritating than the competition.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Design is nice and it comes with a cool charging base which needs to be used maybe every the weeks.</li>
            <li> Panasonic E8103 is a very very powerful shaver, if you have lots of hard beard, you may want to go for E8103S.</li>
            <li> Sounds a little big, the other better.</li>
            <li> The product itself is a little better than my other low priced shavers.</li>
            <li> Since I was going from a top of the line razor 3 years ago, to a middle of the line razor today, I expected that the quality would be similar but perhaps not exactly the same.  </li>
            <li> Not much better or worse than old unit, but shaving is not all that pleasant.  </li>
            <li> I had been using a Philips Norelco 1060X for a few years and was getting ready to buy new blades.</li>
            <li> This item does not travel well due to large bulky charging tray required to charge the battery.  </li>
            <li> What Amazon or norelco don&#x27;t really tell you is you half to take the head of the razor completely off to attach the mustache trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, the more expensive models supposedly have a better cutting mechanism, and a jet clean washing system for automatically cleaning the shaver.    </li>
            <li> The side burn trimmer does a poor job and is not as easy to use as the old pop-up trimmer.</li>
            <li> It is a very much improved shaver over the older, former units I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> charging cradle makes it easy to recharge (compared to tight cord plug on other shavers).&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shave is terrific, provided an extremely close shave the veru first time..</li>
            <li> It is a pretty good electric shaver but little awkward while woking around adam apple.  </li>
            <li> And really the only reason I&#x27;m taking off a star is because this one is a little harder to get right under my nose.  </li>
            <li> no matter how hard i press it against my face or neck, i just can&#x27;t feel the pressure and yet it shaves clean...</li>
            <li> it is sharp and very comfort for ..</li>
            <li> and I have to press hard to get it clean.</li>
            <li> The Senco Touch 2d is also really hard to clean, the blades and screans don&#x27;t lock in like</li>
            <li> There are other shavers out there that will shave much closer</li>
            <li> my friend likes the shaver so much, now he changed his used habit shaving the other day for everyday!additionally</li>
            <li> The other razors would not shave my throat/neck area very well.</li>
            <li> But the rebate thing is really cheating me and other customers.</li>
            <li> The recharger is a real pain in the neck it doesn&#x27;t sit in the stand as other electric razors</li>
            <li> : I was not sure if the reputed longer battery life of the more expensive models was important, but I took a chance on this.  </li>
            <li> First, the compartment to hold shavings leaves much to be desired unless you want to empty this everyday.  </li>
            <li> I decided that due to the age, the battery was probably going to go out sooner or later, so rather than pay $30 for new blades, I&#x27;d invest in a new shaver.</li>
            <li> At the end of the second round, I&#x27;m smooth to the touch and will generally not need to shave until two days later.</li>
            <li> Philips razor has been synonymous with speed and efficiency, it is not exceptional also, and the price is very cheap, but a bit less than is generally work, the color is too young to charge some instability</li>
            <li> B001AJ6YS2 Philips Norelco 7310XL Men&#x27;s Shaving System]] offers a decent shave for less.  </li>
            <li> i had one old electric shaver from Philips which did same job, just looked different.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is going straight back to Amazon with no thanks.</li>
            <li> My old Norelco electric razors used to last and last.</li>
            <li> It does a good job cutting the hairs along the jaw, above the lip, and under the neck.  </li>
            <li> takes forever to cut hair, I have to run it SLOWLY over one patch of hair for minutes to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> I found the Norelco shaving head somewhat difficult to remove whereas the Panasonic foil was very easy to remove/replace.    </li>
            <li> Second, this shaver has a major flaw, the shaver head keeps falling off and will eventually break from hitting the floor.</li>
            <li> the online price was much less than my local target store even with shipping which was very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> The blades on this get dull sooner than the Cool Skin as well.</li>
            <li> A quick dry shave that was quiet and as close or closer than any of the Brauns, Schicks, Remingtons and other numerous Norelcos</li>
            <li> My model has automatic voltage selection, so was able to use it in Australia (240 volt) by using a small black US-AU pin adaptor plug.</li>
            <li> The only problem with the new one is the noise is little high.</li>
            <li> of all, it&#x27;s whisper quiet, which makes a big difference early in the morning, so different from foil shavers which are so noisy that it seems like shaving with a hedge trimmer.</li>
            <li> Minor drawbacks (and non-dealbreakers) all, as far as I&#x27;ve been concerned.  </li>
            <li> I got the 2d mixed up with the 3d and other higher (and more expensive) models in this line and couldn&#x27;t take advantage of the $10 manufacturer rebate.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if this product is worth without the rebate.</li>
            <li> First of all let me say that my husband is not a shave everyday guy.</li>
            <li> It feels as if without shaving cream you&#x27;re constantly dragging your skin and irritating it more then necessary.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the manual is unclear in describing how to remove the heads to clean them.</li>
            <li> I use it on my knees and down by my ankles since I seem to cut myself with a real razor.</li>
            <li> After 3 very long phone calls on a long distance number, with CSR&#x27;s who don&#x27;t speak English very well, we are still out a shaver and out the money.  </li>
            <li> But A little defective, outsides doesn&#x27;t match completely, don&#x27;t know what cause this issue, i try to fix it by myself, work normal.</li>
            <li> I added the 1150X to my shaving thinking that due to the newer design, that it would be beter than my older Speed model.  </li>
            <li> wet and dry shave, i recommend wet shave using minimal shaving cream, but dry is just as good, its well built and charges relatively fast, not faster than using a blade but at least you aren&#x27;t buying blades all the time.</li>
            <li> (quick charge feature in a few minutes allows it to be used at full strength for a bit), but it feels unnecessarily cumbersome.  </li>
            <li> Is a little clumsy to clean out after a shave, but I use canned air from computer supplies and it makes the job much easier.</li>
            <li> As usual, Amazon delivered right on time.</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d try this Razor out due to all the high review marks it&#x27;s been getting on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Frustrated with shaving irritation, I thought I&#x27;d drop $80 on a \\&quot;good\\&quot; razor, but never expected anything this good.</li>
            <li> It shaves much closer than my previous unit</li>
            <li> Even the trimmer on it won&#x27;t really trim my hair that well, much less the three shave heads.</li>
            <li> But generally I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s about the same overall.</li>
            <li> and I finally had enough of complaints from my inspector general wife that she could still see the hairs after a shave.  </li>
            <li> The material have poor quality and the plastic peels easily.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to upgrade from a cheapo unit I would go even higher than this one and spend a few extra bucks.</li>
            <li> Over the past few months I figured that electric razors have to be much better now days.</li>
            <li> Havent tried it wet yet, but no complaint just regular shaving.</li>
            <li> The first few times I used it, my skin was red.</li>
            <li> I would reccomend it to anyone, especially those who are becoming annoyed by the rising cost of blades.</li>
            <li> the suction cups on the base were not doing such a splendid job of keeping the unit stable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would have to say from the moment I switched it on (after it was fully charged), the super quiet motor, or should I say slow sounding motor, gave me some doubts even before I put it to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very comfortable, but unfortunately they cut prices!Now 30</li>
            <li> Sorry, but the Norelco 1150 simply could not shave neck hair that was more than a quarter- to a half-inch long, and it was not good in what is becoming a NECK with creases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only drawback is used time not long enough after charging.</li>
            <li> works for dry and wet shave, i  usually use it just before going to office so its pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Some minor, and some major.</li>
            <li> It is still a lot better than some of the old shavers that I used to have, but the neck are is still a little tough.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare this razor to any other new ones out there -</li>
            <li> I shaved one side with this new one and shaved the other with my crappy Remington and the Remington gave me a closer shave.</li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s probably due to the new blade rather than the shaver itself.</li>
            <li> I only changed the head once two years ago and although its probably due for a new head, it still serves its purpose for me each day.</li>
            <li> all of this big mess lasted on my face for more than a week.&lt;br /&gt;- 2nd time and last time i use it, same senario happened and i knew for sure that i am not that stupid</li>
            <li> Since i have a thick growth, i prefer clean shaving everyday and this is where philips wins hands down.</li>
            <li> Only down side I would say is the trimmer isn&#x27;t as powerful as I would like, takes several cuts and still not a very clean trim.</li>
            <li> /&gt;3- Nerelco makes good product, this will get them bad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad as this was otherwise a good shaver.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m fairly sure I have a handle and at least one or two blades for nearly every Gillette model going back to at least the 80&#x27;s).    </li>
            <li> but I found that the inside construction had cheap feel using small plastic to hold down the blades in place.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased the Panasonic ES8109S Vortex Wet/Dry Shaver after its high recommendation for black men, but I found that I had to shave with a stick after to get all the hair it couldn&#x27;t pick up.</li>
            <li> I decided to try it as a wet shaver, using a foamy soap, a high quality shaving cream, and also dry.  </li>
            <li> the item should have been discounted $60 bucks total as AMAZON was offering it, but because myself and several other customers naturally used their coupon and submitted the rebate we screwed ourselves out of $30</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t tell me that for a few more dollars Norelco could not make a tougher blade that would stay sharp longer than a few  months.  </li>
            <li> I finally broke down and got a new one.</li>
            <li> Both of these shavers rated nearly the same amongst other Amazon reviewers and were the top-2 rated shavers under $100.  </li>
            <li> bought the Philips Norelco QT4070 Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Mustache Trimmer Pro.  </li>
            <li> After struggling with a similar model that was state-of-the-art a few years ago, the new model is a revelation!</li>
            <li> Phillips razor was a decent device, and would have lasted much longer than the 10 years I&#x27;ve owned it, if I hadn&#x27;t dropped it while cleaning and broken one of the rotators.  </li>
            <li> Now that I have used it, I am surprised by the other reveiwers who felt that that one had to get used to the shaver.</li>
            <li> this razor &amp; I can go every other day with my old Philips  7810 XL ( I think that&#x27;s the model #) and</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have the option to use the station to charge or directly charge with the cord (as other products offer).</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a more expensive Norelco that had finally, after a long life, died.  </li>
            <li> The base has three small suction cups, two of which did not hold on our marble top even after cleaning the top.</li>
            <li> The base has three small suction cups, two of which did not hold on our marble top even after cleaning the top.</li>
            <li> Second one was worst than first one, but still good.</li>
            <li> its a good thing that you can&#x27;t press hard against your skin, because with my previous shaver, i tend to press hard and get some skin burn after the shave....</li>
            <li> My husband has used the philips norelco shavers for years and when he decided to get a new style he ordered the 1150x/40 Senso Touch (he gave his previous one to our grandson who loves it)  </li>
            <li> My husband has used a lot of different brands of electric shavers over the years, and this one stacks up about average as far as closeness of the shave.  </li>
            <li> long story short, if your neck hair grows fairly low, this shaver won&#x27;t get it at all.</li>
            <li> Amazon only give a 2 day money back guarantee with this product (strange policy)</li>
            <li> Then I finally decided I had to because I got to where I put off shaving for as long as possible.  </li>
            <li> Only gave it 4 stars because the shave doesn&#x27;t last as long as a blade</li>
            <li> The razor itself works decently, but I&#x27;ve found a few flaws.  </li>
            <li> Since the 1150X is the entry-level model of the SensoTouch line of shavers, I was curious as to what features are missing from the 1150X as compared to the higher end models.    </li>
            <li> I highly recommend \\&quot;wet\\&quot; using a heavy (what used to be called \\&quot;brushless\\&quot;) shaving cream which with electrics can be messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not giving this el. shaver a 5-stars only because it&#x27;s somewhat more noisy compared to older Norelco models, which disappointed me.</li>
            <li> I was forced to buy new shaver, because cap on my old one broke (and Norelco no longer makes it as a spare part).</li>
            <li> It operates just as well as the old razor, buuuuuuut this one I can shave wet or dry and even rinse the head under running water.</li>
            <li> I had a Norelco wet dry shaver that I had bought in the early 90&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> It shaves much closer and with less drag on my face.</li>
            <li> But for half the investment, this unit is worth consideration despite the missing features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this purchase and shocked that I have not even had to recharge the battery yet</li>
            <li> I had been using Gillette sensor razor for the last 10+ years, but it is harder and more expensive to find replacement cartridges, so</li>
            <li> not sure if i would pay this much again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the unit at least 15 times and haven&#x27;t recharged it since the first time i used it.</li>
            <li> I had been using a combo of Braun and regular razor shave when the Braun shave kept whiskers too long.  </li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t last for long.</li>
            <li> The blades last for a long time.</li>
            <li> It actually leaves pieces of stubble a quarter inch long which you have to remove with tweezers.    </li>
            <li> this shaver lasts as long as the last ones I would say this is 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The bettery last long of one charge.</li>
            <li> Not too short and not too long.</li>
            <li> Cuts long and short hairs with ease.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t rip my face up, it holds its charge a long time, it&#x27;s fairly quiet ...</li>
            <li> The one drawback, which is minor, is that on my last Norelco the trimmer was built in.</li>
            <li> I have been using the regular Gillette razor and after a long time tried this product</li>
            <li> Replaceable head ensures long lasting use.</li>
            <li> I made a big mistake buying it, but it took too long to find that out.</li>
            <li> It remains to be seen how long it will last.</li>
            <li> long or short hairs</li>
            <li> I looked at the different models of the cordless Norelco shavers, I finally decided that spending big bucks on a fancy razor was not money well spent.  </li>
            <li> The battery can lasting a long time if you are not hairy.</li>
            <li> The charge seems to last a really long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I shave everyday with the razor, it is just okay, it leaves hairs behind, especially on my neck.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, starting with the first impression of the item out of the box - it looked very cheap and made of low quality materials - and continuing with the very bad shave, there was nothing that could make me keep it, not to mention justify the price.  </li>
            <li> this is the first one I&#x27;m not very happy with.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Motor a little bit rusting, but it is working.&lt;br /&gt;Battery still good&lt;br /&gt;Electronic board has some corrosion but no short circuits / no salts have developed between terminals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that the shaving head is a little harder to remove to knock out the hair bits than my older norelco</li>
            <li> No major complaints.  </li>
            <li> I also have a clef chin which made it difficult for most other razors to shave properly.</li>
            <li> When the new battery gave out a few years ago, I started looking for a replacement and found a Norelco arcitec 1050 on  sale at Target (shopping hint:</li>
            <li> After a few years, they stop making replacement blades and force me to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> but it does not last very long.</li>
            <li> And the blades last very long.</li>
            <li> Better than my old one, which wasn&#x27;t bad either, which is why I&#x27;m giving it four stars.</li>
            <li> It seems that when I go even 2 days without shaving, it&#x27;s like starting over, irritation and kind of bad shave again.  </li>
            <li> Before I give my review, let me just say, I have tried all kinds of electric shavers, cheap ones, moderate ones, and expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only use it dry, haven&#x27;t tried to use it with shaving foam.</li>
            <li> I only use the 1150x dry</li>
            <li> Besides the rotor heads, which really should take years to wear out, there isn&#x27;t much that could go wrong.</li>
            <li> My previous shaver plugged directly into an outlet for charging.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t usually write reviews (except for classical music CDs), and am not a fanatic about shaving.</li>
            <li> husband has used it several times now and he has a heavy wiry beard plus his skin can be sensitive.</li>
            <li> I still have to go over some spots a few times to get every last hair, but nowhere near like my cheapy model.  </li>
            <li> It provides a relatively close shave with minimal effort and is very quiet.  </li>
            <li> This is the only razor that hasn&#x27;t left rough places on my skin.</li>
            <li> It did not work as expected and could not cut 2 days growth of beard on an African American.</li>
            <li> It comes with a nice charging base and clearly indicates on the shaver itself when it is charging and turns off when completed.</li>
            <li> he has very sensitive skin and trouble shaving until we found this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble with longer hairs missing, and my beard grows pretty flat against the skin, so this is likely my issue.  </li>
            <li> and I have no regrets buying it, even though the run time on the battery charge is lower than other SensoTouch models.  </li>
            <li> This new 1150x/40 has been performing just as well if not better in the actual shave department.  </li>
            <li> I think the closeness of the shave is about the same, too - maybe the 1150x slightly closer, but again I&#x27;d bet that is due to the new blade and not the shaver.    </li>
            <li> why, but apparently it is generally believed that someone with naturally coarse, curly hair (i.e a Black man) should never invest in a rotary or foil electric razor because they don&#x27;t work on that type of person&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> this is very bad item that i second time ordered, first one was better</li>
            <li> - Uneven areas are much more difficult to shave closely requiring several aims at different positions.    </li>
            <li> this expensive razor worked fine for 3 weeks, now it doesn&#x27;t shave at all.  </li>
            <li> But it is smooth and less irritating to the upper lip area.   </li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think I was pushing hard enough to get a close shave, but it was shaving just as close as any other electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think I was pushing hard enough to get a close shave, but it was shaving just as close as any other electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I needed an electric razor and being female, it&#x27;s hard to find a decent one, so I ordered this &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34; razor.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting an exceptional shave from this shaver, however, I am somewhat disappointed.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s face was soft with little or no stubble.  </li>
            <li> My experience has been that the 1150 gives me a much cleaner shave and does so in less time and with less effort than the 1090.</li>
            <li> My experience has been that the 1150 gives me a much cleaner shave and does so in less time and with less effort than the 1090.  </li>
            <li> This one borders on the fragile side and is difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave closely and you have to go over and over areas to get a somewhat decent result, meaning i still have unwanted stubble left but at least it did something.</li>
            <li> Foil shavers are faster and easier to adapt to, since they are very much like your gilette razors, but there are a few downsides - foils are difficult to clean since the hair gets trapped in the inner chamber and foil shavers</li>
            <li> another thing that i like about this shaver is that you can&#x27;t really press hard against your skin....</li>
            <li> think this product works somewhat well, but as my title implies, it&#x27;s hard to get a very close shave.</li>
            <li> It has a large footprint: The base for the razor isn&#x27;t huge, but it does take up enough counter space.</li>

            <li> I did not want to write a bad review about this product, but it was meant to be a nice gift for a friend</li>
            <li> I know lot of you came here to get an honest review on this shaver and are probably frustrated reading about this \\&quot;rebate\\&quot; issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> like the design of the unit, it is cutting edge and stylish.  </li>
            <li> like the design of the unit, it is cutting edge and stylish.  </li>
            <li> and I am sure the crispy is not because of cold weather.</li>
            <li> I asked the clerk if this was unusual and he said he had seen this at least 1 time before.</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointing with how much it costs.</li>
            <li> The old one finally quit accepting a charge which is what all my past razors have done.</li>
            <li> I generally shave in the morning and leave the shaver in the charger after I finish shaving until the next morning, so never have trouble with charging.</li>
            <li> Not really that big of a deal though.</li>
            <li> Not too long to wait</li>
            <li> Does not tug/snag on long stubble  </li>
            <li> If you let your hairs get too long</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long to produce noticeable neck irritation.  </li>
            <li> The battery holds a charge for a long time too.    </li>
            <li> One of the closest shaves I have had in a long while.  </li>
            <li> The battery holds a charge for a long time as well.  </li>
            <li> The shaver is made well and charge lasts for long time.</li>
            <li> On the plus side I do like the long battery life between recharging.</li>
            <li> The shaver turned complete dead after 6 months of use.</li>
            <li> This shaver takes just as long as a Bic razor and a can of Foamy.</li>
            <li> Long Handled Safety Razor]]</li>
            <li> Long Handled Safety Razor]]</li>
            <li> i wish it can company a long time with me.</li>
            <li> If and when I let my beard go that long, I&#x27;ll break out the Mach 3 and the shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Its a complete waste</li>
            <li> Just look for something else if you want a shave that lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before I get to the negatives, please take into consideration that I&#x27;ve always had a heavy beard and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> That was a long time between charges.  </li>
            <li> Long ago (35 yrears)</li>
            <li> My earlier electric shavers were rough and it gave me a sense of iritation</li>
            <li> /&gt;Suffice to say that if you&#x27;re a long time rotary electric shaver user, or stuck thinking that a blade is the closest shave you can get, think again.</li>
            <li> After a long &amp; agonizing wait of 3 months, I got a postcard with my Rebate rejected &amp; reason given \\&quot;Manufacture&#x27;s dicount taken at cash register are not valid for rebate promotions\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> At home I use a standard wet shave (Dollar Shave Club razors with the Dr Carver&#x27;s Shave Butter.</li>
            <li> issue is this: How long before you can&#x27;t get the replacement blades for this model?</li>
            <li> My old shavers used to snag when I didn&#x27;t shave every few days.</li>
            <li> I had one a long time ago</li>
            <li> In comparison to the 8140XL, it&#x27;s roughly the same amount of space.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not loud at all</li>
            <li> I have used Philips Razor for a long time now</li>
            <li> As long as I use the circular-pressing motion they recommend in the manual, I get no irritation.</li>
            <li> For a long time, I was wondering why the charging cable would keep on getting disconnected.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, I have no issues on how long the battery charge lasts.  </li>
            <li> Depilatories would remove some hair, but not nearly all of them, and require me to wait 36 hours before trying again without damaging already tingling skin.</li>
            <li> As I said, I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for a long time.</li>
            <li> but it is a minor inconvenience.  </li>
            <li> I have had Norelco for a long time.</li>
            <li> I am a long time</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t know how long I have to wait for my $30 rebate for this purchase.</li>
            <li> It will do the job eventually, but misses long strands of hair on the face and neck.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done and holds a charge for a long time, sometimes longer than the advertised 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> i barelly remember i bought this,,, because it is long long time ago...</li>
            <li> Wow, I didn&#x27;t realize what I was missing.</li>
            <li> And the battery is a long life one.</li>
            <li> Charge lasts  for long time.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it, but not for long.</li>
            <li> But then i am blessed with long slender neck so the razor still might work for you.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Had this for a long time and it still runs like a champ.  </li>
            <li> I am back to using 8894 since the model 6100 stopped dead one morning and only started operating again after several trys.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> One charge can use for a long long long time.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work with my father&#x27;s thick beard.  </li>
            <li> I have a thick beard and it grows fast.</li>
            <li> I have a thick beard and it grows fast.  </li>
            <li> hate it or would not give him a good close shave.  </li>
            <li> Besides, one week later after my order, the price was down to $49.97 with additional $30 cash back.</li>
            <li> and until I was diagnosed I had hair down to the middle of my back.</li>
            <li> For some reason with my beard, I only get average results with a dry shave and this razor was no different.</li>
            <li> He has been very abrupt with me, not answering questions really only giving me the same line.  </li>
            <li> The shave didn&#x27;t come out as smooth as when I use it dry, but I might have been doing something wrong.  </li>
            <li> (now I feel made wrond desicion) but in less than year the top blade mechanism broke in two pieces and making the shaver useless.</li>
            <li> The big difference is in is water proof design allowing me to wet or dry shave.</li>
            <li> others stated, I only bought this because of the final Black Friday price after all the rebates.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> one only lasted for 2 and a half year.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic cover of the on/off switch broke after 2 years and now the battery does not hold charge after 3 years of daily use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have only used this as a dry shaver, so no info on the cream or wet shave.</li>
            <li> Shipping is fast as usual!  </li>
            <li> Not very useful, can not get the same quality shaving as using a blade.</li>
            <li> My skin feels great after a wet shave with some cream and this bad boy!</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re an African American male, with sensitive skin, and tired of the unsightly razor bumps and burns, then try this shaver.</li>
            <li> It was a braun that didnt has the three blades but just a single long blade.</li>
            <li> I also did not get a rebate, similar to other respondents.</li>
            <li> NOT A FIXED BLADE!  </li>
            <li> Close shave,no neck irritation which has always been a big issue for me with other products.</li>
            <li> Close shave,no neck irritation which has always been a big issue for me with other products.</li>
            <li> I sent all the paper work to the Philips and learnt recently that the rebate is not going to be honored due to the discount taken by Amazon at the cash register.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> of the past models lasted 7 to 10 years with only a simple daily cleaning (brushing it out with supplied brush),&lt;br /&gt;if</li>
            <li> so other customer don&#x27;t get into the trap in the future.    </li>
            <li> I have only had one other electric razor and did not like that one either.</li>
            <li> I find it more difficult to remove the shaving blade assembly for cleaning than what it should be!</li>
            <li> restocking fee future shopping will check  other  possibilities</li>
            <li> Same as other peoples brought this product and \\&quot;No</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t difficult by any means but it does take just a little more time for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t difficult by any means but it does take just a little more time for cleaning.    </li>
            <li> I prefer the simple &#x27;plug in&#x27; charger on other models.    </li>
            <li> So it turns out that the mail-in-rebate is invalid if your purchase came with ANY other discounts, even if they aren&#x27;t traditional discounts (in my case, I got a Wal-Mart gift card), something which is not explicitly stated on the rebate form.</li>
            <li> several thousand other people who purchased this item in dec 2011...</li>
            <li> Other than the charging dock and cord, I can see the SensoTouch lasting for years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned three other Norelco razors, and the only one that shaves as close as the Advantage 7735X was the Advantage 5655.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned three other Norelco razors, and the only one that shaves as close as the Advantage 7735X was the Advantage 5655.  </li>
            <li> think Philips has not made this shavers as sturdy as their other shavers and further screwed up in the design.</li>
            <li> I have just now (4 months later) received a reply postcard which states that my rebate will not be honored due to the discount taken by Amazon at the cash register.  </li>
            <li> After sending all the paper work to the Philips and learnt recently that the rebate is not going to be honored due to the discount taken at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Upon calling them, I was given a different reason, that the rebate form said, \\&quot;May not be combined with other offers.\\</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One particularly praiseworthy aspect of the Norelco SensoTouch is that your shaving performance is hardly degraded when it&#x27;s turned off.</li>
            <li> In this head-to-head comparison, the Panasonic came out the clear winner every time, with the Norelco running second in closeness, comfort and reaching hard to shave areas.  </li>
            <li> The battery also holds a charge although I don&#x27;t use it for very long each day.</li>
            <li> Granted, I&#x27;ve been using the Braun singlefoil style shaver for a very long time, and I suspect that matters.  </li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that I have replace the head to be able to use the razor, but I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I can not comment on it as a dry shaver.</li>
            <li> I have used the Norelco dry.  </li>
            <li> I have elected to use it in dry mode for convenience.</li>
            <li> I almost always shave dry</li>
            <li> In my opinion prefer use dry.</li>
            <li> Works well, but the part on the neck is bit difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> Then let it dry.</li>
            <li> I tried using it dry, with shaving cream, and in the shower.</li>
            <li> I use another Norelco for dry.</li>
            <li> I like it dry myself.</li>
            <li> but now I use it dry</li>
            <li> After, I take a tissue to pat dry</li>
            <li> but now I use it dry</li>
            <li> I recieved this razor for christmas, my old Norelco was getting old, and tired.</li>
            <li> Of course, I&#x27;ve only owned it a week, let&#x27;s see if it can last a few years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you want an everyday electric - get a unit with the cleaning unit and spend the money on a more expensive unit.</li>
            <li> I got this product last year, as I wanted to have a wet shaver as previously I have used Norelco dry shavers only and felt that after a year the blades get blunt and the need replacing.</li>
            <li> It was not nearly as bad or long-lasting as when I first used the 1050, but annoying nonetheless.</li>
            <li> My husband shopped long &amp; hard for a new shaver &amp; read all reviews.  </li>
            <li> I have a very tough, fast growing beard, and my job requires frequent evening events.  </li>
            <li> I must say that the triple track system of the 8000 series and the single track of the 1150 has made no difference in my shaving experience.</li>
            <li> I had used a single foil electric shaver a couple years ago that wasn&#x27;t anything to write home about.</li>
            <li> Now I didn&#x27;t use it every single day, I&#x27;m a \\&quot;shave</li>
            <li> That means that the plastic has to flex every single time you turn it on and off.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a limited</li>
            <li> It is not good where you have to trim, like making a straight line on the sideburns.  </li>
            <li> Overall I would say an average product.</li>
            <li> I will post back here if it improves but for now I&#x27;m having to go over the same spot at least three times to get the last stray whiskers.</li>
            <li> I would say its not powerful enough,, blades turn slower than a $20 norelco.</li>
            <li> buying this item on amazon was no good   prise was much higher than other locatoions  </li>
            <li> No more nicks from the old one.</li>
            <li> My old shavers used to snag when I didn&#x27;t shave every few days.enough to get a close shave, but it was shaving just as close as any other electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been a big problem, but I think it is probably holding it back from that truly close shave - or at least from not having to do multiple passes.    </li>
            <li> In the past, you could plug the charging cable directly into the shaver.</li>
            <li> With the regular price, not worth buying.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an old Remington dual foil that I&#x27;ve been using for the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> I too am a victim of not getting the $30 rebate from Phillips as advertised by Amazon; I paid $50 bucks for this razor.</li>
            <li> Overall I am not happy and now I am even more annoyed since the rebate issue came up.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m a victim of one of those \\&quot;come-on\\&quot; scams.</li>
            <li> They just did not get close enough, and you caused such abrasion that the face felt raw.  </li>
            <li> You have to keep going over the same spot until it leaves your face raw just to get the last remaining hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously thinking about going back to my old Norelco shaver and just replace the blades.</li>
            <li> You only need to charge it when the razor runs down.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just looking down the road at a possible flaw, and thought I&#x27;d mention it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Actually I don&#x27;t recommend any razor that goes up and down while shaving as I told the reason.</li>
            <li> The only down side is swapping out the head for the trimmer.</li>
            <li> and it totally let me down.</li>
            <li> Now, it takes twice as long as my old razor when it was dull.  </li>
            <li> It also had more drag across my face than the Rem due to all the rubber surrounding the cutting heads.  </li>
            <li> I have used several different Norelco electric razors as well as a few made by other manufacturers.  </li>
            <li> It was just different from my previous Norelco.</li>
            <li> I have used it in both wet mode and dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;++ Can be used wet or dry, and with or without shaving cream or gel&lt;</li>
            <li> I tried shaving both wet &amp; dry and found no difference.</li>
            <li> My initial reaction is that the 6100 outperforms all  that I have previously used.</li>
            <li> If anyone actually gets the rebate or fights the refusal, please post what you did here, because many are gonna be disappointed to not get the $30 from Philips.</li>
            <li> It performed well in both the wet and dry modes, providing the closest shave I have received from a Norelco.  </li>
            <li> product itself isn&#x27;t as solid as the higher-end models or the previous models.</li>
            <li> This one works well for wet or dry shaving.  </li>
            <li> A razor review reflects personal priorities as well as previous experience and likes/dislikes.  </li>
            <li> Works wet or dry</li>
            <li> I have tried it wet and dry and still gets stuck in spots and have to twist or go in a circular pattern.  </li>
            <li> It can be used wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I bought Philips Norelco SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver, Metallic Blue in Black Friday when Amazon was offering a $30 off.</li>
            <li> Can be used wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Then I remembered it was a Wet / Dry shaver and decided to give it a try in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shaver can be used wet or dry or with shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> The shaver can be used wet or dry or with shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> WET or Dry..........</li>
            <li> The system is described as \\&quot;2D\\&quot;, but I&#x27;m not sure how it differs from the more expensive \\&quot;3D\\&quot; models.  </li>
            <li> you like shaving for a half hour and shaving the same spot 30 times</li>
            <li> You can use this unit either wet or dry.</li>
            <li> The pivoting head is definitely a step up from my previous razor.</li>
            <li> The shaver can be used wet or dry or with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Works dry and wet.</li>
            <li> works well dry or wet .....  </li>
            <li> Purchased this Norelco only because of $30 Rebate during Black Friday.&lt;br /&gt;However today a card from Philips sent to me instead of check:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> wet or dry</li>
            <li> There is only one slight problem is to cut the moustache underneath the lips.  </li>
            <li> This makes it difficult to quickly drop the shaver in.</li>
            <li> After a couple months, I started getting lax on it and stopped shaving everyday since my beard grows pretty slowly and now am suffering.  </li>
            <li> A lot of my previous electrics were \\&quot;hard heads\\&quot;, which didn&#x27;t contour much - if at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used left me anxious to try a wet shave which was performed the next day.</li>
            <li> face was a red, swollen, and bleeding mess after using the SensoTouch.&lt;br /&gt;I had to use [[ASIN:B000RIAD0W Proraso Pre and Post Shave</li>
            <li> after having used it dry a few hours earlier.    </li>
            <li> dry and wet (with shaving cream), and prefer wet</li>
            <li> If anything, a little worse than other Norelcos because it&#x27;s harder to clean the heads.    </li>
            <li> While although there are not much high end technology and looks a little bit simple.</li>
            <li> I have used the 1150x for a while, my shave time is getting less and less, and it is very apparent</li>
            <li> I was a little surprised that it does not come with a travel case, but that is not a significant feature for a razor for me.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco Shavers for 40 years and the previous model that was 9 years old just wasn&#x27;t cutting as well as it used to and the new replacement blades were almost half the price of the new shaver.  </li>
            <li> I found little or no difference relative to closeness of shave in either mode.</li>
            <li> but it requires a little extra time and patience and leaves stray hairs if I am not diligent.  </li>
            <li> the Philips Norelco 1150x/40 Senso Touch 2d Electric shaver is quite beautiful,though a little big for my hand; and the shipment is also in time.</li>
            <li> and finally there is something that leaves little rashes on the neck post shaving.</li>
            <li> a little surprise with low humming noise from the wall charger.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> &gt;* easier to clean since the head unit is far less complex internally and the base it attaches to is practically flat (not a deep bowl) with nearly flat drive nubs</li>
            <li> The biggest benefit of this to me though is that I can shave when my face is anything other than perfectly dry.  </li>
            <li> Cream - 3.6 oz]] to reduce the swelling of my face, and later go back and finish the mess this razor left behind with my trusty Merkur Double Edge Razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He had an old Norelco razor that he just seemed to have a hard time parting with.</li>
            <li> Wet or dry use, even though my husband doesn&#x27;t wet-shave other than splashing a bit of water on his face from time to time before he shaves.</li>
            <li> Bad product, Panasonic shaver is must better.  </li>
            <li> I mostly resolved to using a beard trimmer, but that would always be a painful scratching experience.</li>
            <li> Light, but plenty of cutting ability.   </li>
            <li> What he did like about the SensoTouch was that the shaver is quite comfortable, both the cutting surface and the shape in the hand.</li>
            <li> When it actually just ruined my whole face and caused acne 30XS worse on my face!</li>
            <li> This is the most delicate, expensive and breakable one yet and I get delivery and NOOOOOO carry case for it.</li>
            <li> Since I shave my head and face at least three times a week, it is important to me that any razor I use shave closely without, again, irritating my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried moving my neck in all sorts of ways, gone over the trouble areas multiple times, and it still leaves batches of hairs.</li>
            <li> so I decided I would give this razor a try as I wanted to see what the wet shaving experience was all about.      </li>
            <li> The result is that longer whiskers get jammed up inside the heads and no amount of rinsing or compressed air will dislodge them.</li>
            <li> My husband, in his 60s, was complaining that shaving was getting harder as his skin ages.</li>
            <li> I have not tried to WET shave with it, but it does have that capability as well.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t got a chance to use wet.</li>
            <li> For the last few years I have been using a Phillips Norelco shaver.  </li>
            <li> After careful review of both models, I purchased the 2D model.  </li>
            <li> They were out of stock at the time of purchase and it wasn&#x27;t expected to come until after Christmas.</li>
            <li> While it did trim the hairs it did not provide a close shave which I expected.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it yet as a wet shaver, but I can&#x27;t wait.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I expected it wouldn&#x27;t be any improvement, but figured I had nothing to lose.  </li>
            <li> 10 months in, the metal housing that holds the blade heads in place broke as I was trying to empty out the beard shavings.  </li>
            <li> it does a lot help when you travel, the battery last for a few times shave.</li>
            <li> Also if you prefer a wet shave</li>
            <li> recommend it wet or dry/</li>
            <li> Now, after 8 weeks, I received a card from Philips Fulfillment Center stating  that manufacturers discounts were taken at the cash register  are not valid for rebate promotions.</li>
            <li> Three heads design looks fancy but not much of a value.</li>
            <li> I would replace the blades, tried a few models over the years, and I&#x27;d still have to do cleanup work (if not all the work depending on the specific unit) with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And suppose to also be wet /dry</li>
            <li> I will try to shave wet to see if it gets any closer.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s on loads of blood thinners and has to be careful not to cut himself.</li>
            <li> Not a very honorable business.</li>
            <li> Anyway, back to the review... I have a heavy beard and they never have any problems with mowing the grass.</li>
            <li> I would not buy something like this again unless they changed a few things for the next generation.</li>
            <li> This will certainly be necessary if you plan to use it everyday.     </li>
            <li> Tricks you into pressing harder then you should for</li>
            <li> I used it for wet shaving (but lost it and did not replace it).</li>
            <li> I FIND THAT THE WET SHAVE FEATURE IS NOT FOR ME</li>
            <li> AS THE SHAVER ALWAYS FEELS WET, EVEN AFTER OVERNIGHT.</li>
            <li> The stand looks like it could get crushed and break in my luggage.</li>
            <li> / wet</li>
            <li> I had been using a micro screen shaver for the last few years.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the worse one i have ever owned.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Effectiveness: I have a very angular face with a slow-growing, thin beard.</li>
            <li> I have used for the last few months,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can also use shaving cream with the SensoTouch 1150x Electric Shaver, but that can get a bit messy (I only tried it once)  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You can also use shaving cream with the SensoTouch 1150x Electric Shaver, but that can get a bit messy (I only tried it once)  </li>
            <li> Also, I have had minimal irritation while using this razor.  </li>
            <li> (i prefer a wet shave with shaving gel...much smoother).</li>
            <li> But the style is not much great as much as photo.  </li>
            <li> I think i will visit amnozon everyday in the future.</li>
            <li> Further the charger needs to have the base for charging which no one can carry when on travel as it is too big to fit in shaving kit bag.</li>
            <li> I tried a non-Norelco and ended up replacing it sooner that I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pity that I didn&#x27;t get it at its lowest price.</li>
            <li> When wet shaving with this unit it comes closer to a blade shave than anything i&#x27;ve used in my 67 years.</li>
            <li> senso touch 2 Electric Razor is not a very impractical or efficientv product.</li>
            <li> expected this to allow me to shave in a matter of 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> / wet</li>
            <li> This product can also be used in the shower which is convenient if you like a wet shave.  </li>
            <li> Considering the price paid for this I expected this shaver to do better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also went missing after a get together at my home last week.</li>
            <li> so your skin will adjust and then shaving is a pleasure - (beginings are rough)</li>
            <li> Was actually very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;-  Not great for the hair around neck region and gives razor burns.</li>
            <li> It was a bit harsh and irritating compared to my previous shavers, particularly on the neck where it produced frequent razor burn and some cuts.  </li>
            <li> I think Philips and amazon both cheating consumer via rebate promise and both are responsible for the false advertising.</li>
            <li> And the rebate is only availabe during the black friday!</li>
            <li> I do hope there&#x27;s a black or dark blue one!</li>
            <li> Due to medical reasons, he is no longer allowed to shave traditionally (with razors/cream) and is being forced to use electric.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also been an odd decision to have the razor drain water down through the middle of its length.</li>
            <li> I do not understand this type of behavior by manufactures: They may have saved $30 this time, but the cost to them is much higher when I do not purchase their products in the future in lieu for another brand because of the bad taste they have left in my mouth.</li>
            <li> no real reason other than I like variety, and in the summer I water my lawn</li>
            <li> - You can only recharge the unit placing it on its base (no direct cord connection available).</li>
            <li> My only minor complaint is I wish a travel case had come with the razor.</li>
            <li> Philips-Norelco and Amazon have marked it up to a ridiculous level.</li>
            <li> Thus, by eliminating unneccessary shaving products and just using this razor to shave my face dry, it leaves less of a carbon footprint on the planet.</li>
            <li> I will say that the battery does last a long while at least.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the secret is to the Philip Norelco, but I won&#x27;t argue with success.  </li>
            <li> Battery life could be a little longer, but I might just take long shaves.</li>
            <li> I have relatively thick hair (Mediterranean) and it barely caught any of the hair!  </li>
            <li> Yes, you can get a decent shave going over your stubble as little as 9 times, but you&#x27;ll be forced to bear down on the adjustable head mechanism until it bursts apart.  </li>
            <li> Only one short-come is the cap on the shaver, little hard to take off, not a big deal.</li>
            <li> very much .great chioce ,but a lit expensive</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the internal batteries no longer would hold a charge and it time for a new one.</li>
            <li> The old Norelco units I had did not have the amount of give that the new ones do in the motion of the cutting heads.  </li>
            <li> shaver is very quiet, the charging base is stable, the suction cups hold well, the on/off button is convenient and it is easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> Another flaw in my opinion is not having a direct connect charge, again a cradle that will have connectors go bad in the near future.  </li>
            <li> For those living in PA - here is the link to Attorney General complaint site:  </li>
            <li> other thing -</li>
            <li> This shaver is unlike any other Norelco shaver that I have owned  and it took a while to understand how to remove the shaving heads for cleaning.</li>
            <li> I used both shavers for 3 weeks, shaving one side of my face with the Panasonic and the other side of my face with the Norelco.  </li>
            <li> -- Other:  </li>
            <li> The only reason I won&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I still need to sometimes \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; with a razor - I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s an electric out there that deserves 5.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, when holding the two side by side, I have to agree that if I dropped this razor, the small pivoting head part makes me nervous in that it looks so fragile it might break...</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because it is not better than a blade</li>
            <li> not interested.  </li>
            <li> Was pointless to register for extra warranty as would not recognize overseas purchases yet we are consumers too!</li>
            <li> It does say on the rebate form that it was not to be used with other discounts.</li>
            <li> The 2D gives such a close, smoothe shave that I would say the 3D model would just be excessive.  </li>
            <li> They are still sharp and performing well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are still sharp and performing well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (b) I interpret &#x27;no other discount&#x27; to mean no additional discounts from Norelco towards purchase price,</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s $30 rebate, got a postcard \\&quot;Manufacturer&#x27;s discounts taken at the cash register are not valid for rebate promotions\\&quot; refusing because the Amazon coupon is considered \\&quot;other offer\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> figured one was Amazon&#x27;s dime and the other was Norelco&#x27;s (the justification and mechanics of rebates are beyond me, anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> AS WELL AS OTHER TYPES OF SHAVES.  </li>
            <li> I just received a letter from Philips which denied my mail in rebate, which seems happened to thousands of other people.</li>
            <li> They claim it \\&quot;may not be combined with other offers\\&quot; because I used a promotional certificate provided by the retailer, Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a blade for almost all of my shaving for the past several years, and wanted to try out an electric, hoping it would give me fewer razor bumps around the neck.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco razors for years , stopping at times to check out other razors.</li>
            <li> I used it to trim the bottom of my mustache and sideburns and it worked extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just got a postcard from Philips saying the rebate is invalid due to other offer.</li>
            <li> But I just got a postcard from Philips saying the rebate is invalid due to other offer.</li>
            <li> I have other shave before, compar Philips Norelco.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I Was called by Philips yesterday to tell me that my rebate will not be honored because of the \\&quot;May not be combined with other offers\\&quot; clause on  the rebate.</li>
            <li> Not sure needed for facial hair,etc though.</li>
            <li> After using it for a month I am extremely dissapointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Left a rug burn, just like in the past.</li>
            <li> And it is cheaper than other site.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m extremely please with this Philips Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li> Reading other reviews was helpful.  </li>
            <li> None of my other electrics have ever done well on my neck, yet this 1150x has no problem.</li>
            <li> One other qualm is the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I finally purchased one of those small shavers for goatees, and shaving around the ears and stuff...</li>
            <li> Some other reviews mentioned the amount of counter space the shaver takes up.</li>
            <li> All other razors needed 3 weeks to phase in.  </li>
            <li> But the other 2D model comes with a pouch.</li>
            <li> In fact, I bought 2 pieces just in case there is no more stock of this in the future.</li>
            <li> However, as you&#x27;ve probably seen from other reviewers, the $30 rebate got rejected.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazon on the other hand stepped up as always, took up the issue on themselves and issued me a $30 credit without an hassle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to try one of the higher powered versions, they are just SO expensive.</li>
            <li> usually use Mach 3 or above on head and face..</li>
            <li> which can be long, messy, and I always have a cut or two..</li>
            <li> i should have believed the other reviews.</li>
            <li> Aesthetically, this machine stands out from the other mid-range rotaries and foils.</li>
            <li> I purchased tw, one for my self and the other as a gift.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well.  </li>
            <li> I cannot provide any &amp;#34;rave&amp;#34; for this as the past several Norelco&#x27;s I&#x27;ve purchased have not held up well.</li>
            <li> Have use other product brands and they did not cut as well and irritated my face.</li>
            <li> However, after 6 months, Philips won&#x27;t valid the coupon due to  purchase @ Amazon.  </li>
            <li> ii would recommend this shaver to other people</li>
            <li> I used the slick blue shaver for three weeks -</li>
            <li> This one seems to work as well as every other one I have owned.</li>
            <li> so not sure how well it will last over the years.</li>
            <li> I have tried Remington, Panasonic and other Norelco brand shavers over the years.  </li>
            <li> Anyone that says they can get a week on one charge is either shaving every few days, or has so little facial hair they should not be bothering with the razor and just smear cream on their face and let the cat lick it off.  </li>
            <li> Be very careful with promotion for Philips products...</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m being very careful handling it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this model at SAMS and it has turned dull in less than 6 months, New blades are not cheap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also annoyed that the new design requires one to use the charging stand when charging the shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought a new senco touch 2D about 2 months ago, after my older Norelco went bad.</li>
            <li> I feel sorry that I bought it at first place, not worth for almost 100 bucks.</li>
            <li> The only complaint he&#x27;s had is the frequency of having to empty the hair from the heads -</li>
            <li> crispy skin above the only ON/OFF button is broken</li>
            <li> Never let you disappointed, I will buy some more after it break down</li>
            <li> As someone who doesn&#x27;t grow much of a beard (asian!), it&#x27;s a little absurd that I have to pass this thing over my face and chin 7-10 times to cut the few hairs on my face off--</li>
            <li> The shave is very close and can even get the hairs on my neck that other shavers have been unable to eliminate.</li>
            <li> Also, as a little note to those inexperienced with electric shavers, your skin has to get used to the fact that you have changed from a fix blade to an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> But when I used it I found this razor a little noisy than expected at this price.</li>
            <li> Previously I had been shaving every other day.  </li>
            <li> The battery lasts less time than all other SensoTouch models&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> I think the blades finally were getting dull because it seemed like I wasn&#x27;t getting the shave I used to get.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Remington that had a self-cleaning base, but you had to buy special cleaning fluid and filters, and cleanup was a pain.  </li>
            <li> I hate doing this, I want something easy to handle with and not to loose my time for cleaning them or assembling them.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have the time or energy to follow thru with wherever to take the complaint to actually get the Philips rebate.  </li>
            <li> This is not worth of buying...</li>
            <li> Only complaint is the washing system doesn&#x27;t allow you to see if you&#x27;ve cleaned well.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing is you have to change the head every year per manufacturer&#x27;s recommendation.</li>
            <li> I will not write a negative review but this time I will make an exception I ordered the Norelco 1150x shaver because there was a specific offer in the ad that appeared in Amazon at the time for a rebate.</li>
            <li> I am trying to file a complaint through BBB and will update later.</li>
            <li> The product itself is not worth $50 (which is what it would be without the rebate).</li>
            <li> The only complaint he had was that the proteective razor head cap  is flimsy and already broke after two months of use.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that you have to take out the shaving unit to insert the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t take the charger with me and they all last at least a week.</li>
            <li> It is mostly definitely not worth its premium price.</li>
            <li> The quality of this one is below what we consider average.</li>
            <li> : I took this shaver on holiday for a week using it for a total of at least 30 minutes without recharging it.</li>
            <li> Without $30 rebate, $50 for the shaver is not worth.</li>
            <li> This shaver is just an average product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ITS AN AVERAGE SHAVER</li>
            <li> Well see you again in 20 years when they sucker me back into another one.</li>
            <li> On average they are between $40 and $50.</li>
            <li> Amazon has always let me have much to look forward to, quality needless to say.</li>
            <li> Finally called them, they were fairly rude and told me there was no rebate as I got it on sale.</li>
            <li> I hate spending more for replacing the blades than purchasing the razor.  </li>
            <li> complete false advertising</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a pity that the coupon is not available</li>
            <li> You will either love it or hate it.</li>
            <li> and he really hate electric shavers more than i do.  </li>
            <li> when my Norelco Advantage 7735X broke I was forced to find a comparable replacement, only to discover that Norelco no longer makes the 7700 series of lotion dispensing electric razors.  </li>
            <li> First off, let me say that I have thick stubble that is somewhat thin (as opposed to dense) on my face.  </li>
            <li> I bought this after I got tired of my old shaver.</li>
            <li> worse than my old two-head Philips</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, some weeks later I have to say I am not pleased at all with this new model.</li>
            <li> Considering that while I absolutely hate shaving, but don&#x27;t feel clean without having shaved, I&#x27;ll stick to the soap and lather and my trusty blades which now last a little longer than they used to.</li>
            <li> Considering that while I absolutely hate shaving, but don&#x27;t feel clean without having shaved, I&#x27;ll stick to the soap and lather and my trusty blades which now last a little longer than they used to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black male with a thick, curly beard</li>
            <li> I like its ability to work in the shower or with shaving cream/gel, but it&#x27;s just not effective at removing hair (wet OR dry), and isn&#x27;t that what this thing is meant to do?</li>
            <li> Another $90 down the tube.</li>
            <li> space)I narrowed it down to the 1150x or the Nivea For Men Shaver.</li>
            <li> I did like the fact that the 980XL could be plugged in to shave when the battery ran down.</li>
            <li> The shaving head on the 1150x is designed to swivel (up and down) with the contour of to shaving pattern.</li>
            <li> Beat all the others hands down.</li>
            <li> It lifts hair up off your face, down to the smallest stub.</li>
            <li> I promised I will do if its price goes down again.</li>
            <li> I narrowed down my choice to the Philips 2D and 3D.  </li>
            <li> and I should say it let down.</li>
            <li> Down sides:  </li>
            <li> I have to move this thing around my face up, down, in, out,</li>
            <li> But the price&#x27;s cut 10 dollars down just after my order.</li>
            <li> you forget and let it run down.</li>
            <li> I have owned other brands of electric shavers and this one seems to feel a little cheaper in your hand but still does the job.</li>
            <li> I gave this shaver three out of four because it does work (with a little effort) and is somewhat cheaper than the other models.</li>
            <li> Shaving is too long and not very good.</li>
            <li> I have had Norelco shavers in the past and they did a decent shave job, I bought this after I got tired of using the manual shaver I was using.</li>
            <li> Removal and cleaning is not a smooth process as other models.</li>
            <li> I do have to spend an extra minute in a few places that are hard to reach for the blades around my neck, but it&#x27;s still faster and easier than a manual razor.</li>
            <li> not very strong.</li>
            <li> I find the trimmer that must be swapped with the regular shave heads to be very annoying, much better to have a pop-out style.</li>
            <li> This is because your face is slightly swollen when you get up from sleeping.</li>
            <li> The user manual says to give my face three weeks to get used to it, and the shave has gotten slightly closer/smoother...</li>
            <li> For less than $20 after Amazon coupon and Norelco rebate this razor did work well for that purpose. .</li>
            <li> The price is less than 60% in china.</li>
            <li> Purchased this one day after black Friday 2011 with $30 rebate.</li>
            <li> The box of the product said that it was supposed to cause less razer irritation.</li>
            <li> My previous razor was a Braun.</li>
            <li> I do, but I&#x27;ve owned four or five previous versions and prefer the smoother gliding metal head compared with the one on this razor.    </li>
            <li> My previous one (which I still have) lasted for 20+ years.</li>
            <li> Get yourself a double edge razor if you are serious about it.</li>
            <li> I bought it during black friday, it show on Amazon website eligible for a $30 coupon and $30 rebate.</li>
            <li> Bought it in black Friday.</li>
            <li> this shaver from amazon and paid less than i could find it anywhere else</li>
            <li> * a faster, slightly closer shave since the drive motor seems to run at twice the rpm of the 7340 (slightly louder maybe)&lt;br</li>
            <li> &gt;* slightly less convenient, separate trimmer</li>
            <li> It was not as severe as my previous electrics, but it still was a .... pain in the neck.</li>
            <li> which is over in 30 seconds or less.</li>
            <li> BUT THIS RAZOR SHAVES CLOSER WITH LESS EFFORT.</li>
            <li> It was on sale on Black Friday 2011</li>
            <li> As for doing this with or without shaving cream, the difference is slight to none.</li>
            <li> I have owned previous Norelco shavers and they all seemed to work</li>
            <li> My previous shaver was also a Norelco</li>
            <li> /&gt;After less than 6 months of use, a part of the drive mechanism in the lower half of the head fell off in the sink when I took the cutters off to wash then.  </li>
            <li> It provides a closer shave in less time (less passes).  </li>
            <li> hope it will come in half a year....</li>
            <li> The slight arch outwards in the head design</li>
            <li> I found it helpful to slightly pull-tight my skin as the shaver went over the area.</li>
            <li> I bought it during black Friday, it show on Amazon website eligible for a $30 coupon and $30 rebate.</li>
            <li> I opted to wet shave and was a bit hasty about it, missing a few hairs on my cheek, but it seems every bit as close as manual shave.</li>
            <li> I am working overseas in a location that does not suit the typical razor and cream, so I thought I would try this out.</li>
            <li> none the less (p.s.</li>
            <li> This shaver is lighter and easier to hold and maneuver  than the previous model I&#x27;ve used for 10 years.  </li>
            <li> I prefer my previous shaver because it had a built in trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Brought it on Black Friday sale.</li>
            <li> I had less irritation when using soap or shaving cream, but that&#x27;s probably because i did less passes</li>
            <li> Some additional comments: the movable shaving head is actually quite stiff, so it doesn&#x27;t follow contours of the face unless you pres really hard, in which case it starts hurting and pulling the skin.</li>
            <li> Amazing shave - guaranteed, anyone who purchases this razor will not be disappointed ..!</li>
            <li> I looked long and hard before I purchased the 1180X razor.</li>
            <li> Second, it doesn&#x27;t travel very well: the head tends to separate from the body in one&#x27;s bag, and the charging stand is bulky and awkwardly shaped (and thus hard to pack).</li>
            <li> What a mess that Norelco cause...</li>
            <li> The first few times you use the shaver, you&#x27;ll likely be disappointed with the shave.</li>
            <li> I feel that paying over $200 for a few extra features that aren&#x27;t necessary is silly.  </li>
            <li> But the shave is close, not sure how long the shaver head will last, again thin plastic replaced metal.</li>
            <li> no cuts or mess...</li>
            <li> No cords to mess with in the hotels.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;3.battery is long life for common use&lt;</li>
            <li> And the only thing is not good</li>
            <li> The only thing that I could see improved on this shaver is that when it is charging it tends to lean as the base is not heavy enough to support the weight of the dangling cord.  </li>
            <li> I dont&#x27; really have much of a beard,so I&#x27;d hate to see someone with a thick beard trying to work this thing.  </li>
            <li> Philips, you are not right!</li>
            <li> I am using the shaving cream I already had, that means no special product to buy.</li>
            <li> Some of them are probably new to electric razors and had unrealistic expectations.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they just don&#x27;t live up to the advertising hype.</li>
            <li> I was weighing the option of buying replacement foils and blades (and expensive proposition) or going for a new model.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to try one for the first time or you have one that needs to be replaced, the Philips Norelco 1150x/40 SensoTouch is one of the least expensive ways to give Norelco technology a tryout.</li>
            <li> I had a thick, 4 day beard and dry shaved each side of my face with both.</li>
            <li> Now it has been one year and a half and the battery is dead.  </li>
            <li> I tried a Panasonic once, and yes it&#x27;s a little closer shave.</li>
            <li> I think it is a little pricey for what it does.</li>
            <li> 1st time i thought i am not familiar with it</li>
            <li> just takes a little time getting used to it.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to open the box and not find the travel pouch is not included in the 1150x/40 model, but is included with more expensive models.</li>
            <li> He has had issues with razor burns from other electric razors in the past and this one hasn&#x27;t cause that.</li>
            <li> I kept seeing little spots of blood emerge as he went over his cheeks and jawline.</li>
            <li> A little powder has always been soothing, and I sometimes recommend using powder BEFORE using an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My father have had this shaver for a little over three months</li>
            <li> It even removed 6 days of head hair with little effort.</li>
            <li> , the shower is where this little puppy shines.</li>
            <li> I use a little hand soap lather on my face and voila, this shaver works like a champ.</li>
            <li> Instructions are a little unclear</li>
            <li> The cleaning method has taken a little time to get used to</li>
            <li> I have used other Norelco razors in the past and like them all.</li>
            <li> It is however a little on the noisy side.  </li>
            <li> Took me a little bit to get used to it because I&#x27;ve been using razors since I could grow a beard.</li>
            <li> A little bit noise than I had one before.</li>
            <li> but when it comes to the little hairs on the neck is just doesnt work.</li>
            <li> The little beard trimmer attachment is garbage.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I am more than disappointed with this entire experience.    </li>
            <li> A little pricey</li>
            <li> You should be ashamed for marketing this to a senior citizen who has little access to help in returning or even figuring out how to.</li>
            <li> Even short neck hairs can be tough to remove with this product.    </li>
            <li> Tough to shave the upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I only have every shaved in the shower because I have a very thick beard with very thick hairs (like coarse sand paper</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very slow for legs and circle motions in the bikini area actually drew blood from me.</li>
            <li> I tried other electric razors years ago, but they were never very good.</li>
            <li> It was also a bit difficult to shave accurately in harder to shave areas, such as the chin, neck and around sideburns.  </li>
            <li> But I miss the straight cutting edge to cut sideburns, mustache, etc..</li>
            <li> I could never shave everyday with a blade, which would leave me with cuts all over my face.</li>
            <li> The foil is a combination of slots and round holes, instead of just slots.</li>
            <li> the 8251XL (not available at the moment on Amazon).</li>
            <li> If the battery in the Norelco goes dead you&#x27;ll need to recharge it before you can use it.  </li>
            <li> I shave my face and head everyday.</li>
            <li> These two shavers could not handle a stoud beard or the \\&quot;workload\\&quot; a heavy shaver like me</li>
            <li> I got this shaver a few weeks ago to replace a Panasonic Vortex unit.  </li>
            <li> trouble on the neck hairs</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and skin....</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and have had no problems with product.</li>
            <li> Which is what I prefer any way, so for me, it was a waste of $$.</li>
            <li> I NEVER HAD THIS KIND OF BAD ACNE!!!</li>
            <li> I use the shaver for everyday now and will recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a broken earlier model Norelco.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> miss hairs and give slightly uneven results&lt;</li>
            <li> and you can get in a shave after charging just a few minutes from a zero battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> car for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> It requires going over areas multiple times and it still leaves stubble behind.</li>
            <li> After a few days I will send it to my father,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> Well my dog did me a favor by destroying it.  </li>
            <li> My only complain is that I still need a groomer to thin out my goatee.  </li>
            <li> few days</li>
            <li> You will need to shave few times to cut to the end</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this shaver that brings nothing noteworthy to the table.</li>
            <li> Then found out the 45 day risk free warrantee is worthless since they can&#x27;t seem to email, snail mail, or fax a form to return the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All my colleagues gathered round me when the parcel was sent to my office.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few razors and the triple head</li>
            <li> I bought this because I got tired of regular razors.</li>
            <li> things I disliked about it:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> I bought the Norelco shaver thinking I would use it instead of the blade every few days to get those longer hairs.</li>
            <li> The cleaning part is a breeze, just run it under the faucet for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> Now he shaves everyday and looks forward to it.  </li>
            <li> is a bit messy</li>
            <li> waste your money.</li>
            <li> If there is, go over it a few times and the hairs are gone.</li>
            <li> While clinging to this notion, Blacks have the choice of contending with those relentless razor bumps produced by manual razors (the propensity of our hair to curl facilitates this) or turning to messy harsh, depilatory cremes/powders that produce offensive odors.  </li>
            <li> I have had the shaver for a few months now, it took a while to get used to</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m from china,oh,my poor english..</li>
            <li> The women&#x27;s electric seeemed too flimsy and broke within a few months -</li>
            <li> and he&#x27;s never had any trouble with it.</li>
            <li> that I&#x27;ve been using for few years.&lt;br /&gt;from</li>
            <li> I bought this because I got tired of regular razors.  </li>
            <li> I used it there everyday through the heat and sand storms.</li>
            <li> I have had noreclco products for decades and none of them had such poor quality.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard and</li>
            <li> I am used to them feeling heavy and this one feels almost like there is nothing inside</li>
            <li> i decided to buy this shaver when it went on sale a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> but it still left his face looking gray from the poor cut.</li>
            <li> a few years ago I bought a 9060xl one</li>
            <li> It requires going over areas multiple times and it still leaves stubble behind.</li>
            <li> Not a big issue as I don&#x27;t use the trimmer much but it could get annoying for those who do.</li>
            <li> 4 weeks in, I find this shaver to be no better (or worse) than the standard Philips Norelco electric razor that i paid considerably less for.</li>
            <li> Did cut my shaving time in half if not more, no irritation at all either.</li>
            <li> It is too small and too flimsy to be of use and worse--it makes the unit _less_ stable.</li>
            <li> bought it during black friday, it show on Amazon website eligible for a $30 coupon and $30 rebate, however the rebate can not be combined with the coupon!</li>
            <li> We charged it and it worked, for less than a month!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately we could not honor your request due to the following reason:&lt;br /&gt;Manufacturers discounts taken at the cash register are not valid for rebate promotions.</li>

            <li> What is the daily clean shave but a form of dermatological torture, as well as a thoroughly boring process?</li>
            <li> I Hate it&#x27;s original package.</li>
            <li> is a plain cheating!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Extremely stiff on 1150x  </li>
            <li> The disadvantage is that the packaging is not strong.</li>
            <li> After a while the batteries will stop accepting a charge and they are not easily replaced.</li>
            <li> But in the process or to be submitted, a little place have some small burr.  </li>
            <li> 12/26/2011 - I would not recommend this razor; it&#x27;s over priced and does not perform as well as less expensive models from the same manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> Before, I was using the Gillette fusion razors but even those irritated my skin pretty badly.  </li>
            <li> My only real complaint with the Panasonic would be the noise.  </li>
            <li> I find electric shavers take too long in comparison to a blade and are much worse at shaving the neck, but I do like to use one around lips and chin between blade</li>
            <li> I am not sure what green tea does for a shaving lotion</li>
            <li> Yet over the past few years I have become increasingly disenchanted with the cost of the disposable blade systems - every iteration in the disposable razor \\&quot;blades  race\\</li>
            <li> face was raw and hurt.</li>
            <li> This new design is awkward for travel.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like 2d feature and the the property of razors going up and down when shaving because it becomes a hard work while trying to cut the small hairs.</li>
            <li> My current Panasonic shaver (my 2nd) has a bad cell, so the indicator goes from 60 to zero in about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> I have an extremely coarse beard, to the extent that my attempts years ago to use a foil-type electric shaver failed - beard hairs would not fit into the slots.</li>
            <li> Even the amount of facial hair left after shaving leaves me frustrated and ending up using my razor.</li>
            <li> it is not happy as a purely dry shaver.  </li>
            <li> With a dry shave, the shaver works alright but not great.  </li>
            <li> That said, the razor sits down into the base pretty well and charges using contacts at the sides and bottom.    </li>
            <li> Its not a long tedious chore like it was.  </li>
            <li> I tested his face once he returned from work and his beard had grown very little during the day.      </li>
            <li> This razor causes very little irritation.  </li>
            <li> The shaver puts very little pressure on your face.  </li>
            <li> The shaver puts very little pressure on your face.</li>
            <li> but it will get the job done with very little to no missed spots.</li>
            <li> The only major cons that I have for this razor is that the charger makes an annoying squealing noise while it is charging (like a CRT TV being turned on) and the trimmer is an add-on.</li>
            <li> Also, I question the recommendation to rinse the shaving head under water because I&#x27;ve heard the tap water will cause the blades to dull prematurely unless they&#x27;re scrupulously dried (and who&#x27;s got time for that?).  </li>
            <li> Indeed, you can push as hard as you like, but it never feels like you&#x27;re pushing down hard.  </li>
            <li> Indeed, you can push as hard as you like, but it never feels like you&#x27;re pushing down hard.  </li>

            <li> However the system came with a small how-to maintain the razor manual.  </li>
            <li> For the past 8 months I had been using a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Obviously, removing the power connector from the shaver&#x27;s body improves its water resistance, but still, it&#x27;s unfortunate.  </li>
            <li> No more Phillips for me...when I use all my sonic brush heads up, I will find another tooth brush etc.</li>
            <li> usually use a blade during the winter months and an electric during the summer months....</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re done, no more brushing out hairs.  </li>
            <li> Ordered this and it came in in just a few days!</li>
            <li> Pointless for travel.</li>
            <li> For the past 30 years every Phillips I bought had a case.</li>
            <li> and he finished the rest of his face with his usual Gillette blade.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Use a small scissors.)</li>
            <li> Use a small scissors.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned 4 Electric Shavers in the past 30 years and they all suck.</li>
            <li> It does not matter how slick</li>
            <li> At the time I bought this I owned a low price Braun and a rather expensive Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Its slick, and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;this</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied with it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> philips small appliances</li>
            <li> You can do a \\&quot;speed charge\\&quot; in a few minutes - but that just adds time and if you&#x27;re running late...</li>
            <li> Gave as a christmas gift, not sure of a review at this time.  </li>
            <li> I can see the crack continuing to open up till the plastic fails all around the switch.  </li>
            <li> NO MORE PURCHASE FROM IT.</li>
            <li> Note, I&#x27;m not the hirsute type, and I usually use a Gillette Fusion every 1.5 days or so.  </li>
            <li> I usuallywet shave, by applying the usual shaving cream, and running the shaving unit under the faucet.  </li>
            <li> Having used cheaper electric shavers in the past, I was amazed at how close of a shave I could get with the SensoTouch 2d.</li>
            <li> The part was a small triangular piece that is pressed on to a drive shaft that spins the cutters.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I can now</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have anywhere near the cutting capability; leaving a lot of hair unshaven on my face.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable</li>
            <li> But the price, but you are not satisfied with it?</li>
            <li> That process is a thing of the past now that I have this shaver.  </li>
            <li> my wife checked for places I usually miss</li>
            <li> usually don&#x27;t review items however when you feel you have gotten what you&#x27;ve paid for(for a change)why</li>
            <li> So, I have stuck with Norelco for the past fifteen years</li>
            <li> and the shave was not much better and the reason I use an electric razor is so I do not have to use shaving gel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and the shave was not much better and the reason I use an electric razor is so I do not have to use shaving gel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This base model SensoTouch was worth buying.</li>
            <li> but they are sort of small.</li>
            <li> i got the amonzon for a long time but have not trial,  when my friend troduced the shavel to me,  i was shocked by it deeply.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is how expensive the replacement heads are to buy.</li>
            <li> I like five 1150xs,but not better than 7310.noise</li>
            <li> Not sure what they call those.</li>
            <li> and I still have to shave in the shower to get the small hair on my neck.</li>
            <li> just past</li>
            <li> :-S-:</li>
            <li> Still not completely satisfied with the closeness or lack of the the shave, but am getting used to it.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if blades need replacing...</li>
            <li> no more razor burn or buying shaving cream.</li>
            <li> This model I would rate average or lower due to the removal of the head issue and the plastic charge base with no other options for charging.</li>
            <li> It was a bad investment, as, over the 4-5  months I owned it, the shaving result was less close than the old Norelco.</li>
            <li> The shaving head&#x27;s design is not suitable to shave the upper lip area (difficult to manoeuvre).</li>
            <li> I liked the performance of the old shaver, but it too suffered from some seriously questionable design flaws (like an atrocious charging base which was just plain unstable for the shaver, but at least stood where it was planted on my granite countertop).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to use the Nivea Norelco, which was a bit of a pain and very messy.</li>
            <li> The only thing is the sideburn trimmer is a little awkward to use.</li>
            <li> This is really not fair and a little shady since the rebate time frame corresponded with the discount.</li>
            <li> I note that the more expensive Norelco models have a cleaning base....</li>
            <li> The package is not very good.</li>
            <li> (what it would have cost if I got the rebate), it is not very good and would not have bought it otherwise.</li>
            <li> That is OK,But is not very good.</li>
            <li> That is OK,But is not very good.</li>
            <li> I think some people can be a little quick to complain sometime with items and also don&#x27;t understand that unfortunately you do run into the occasional defected item which is sometimes why people seem to lose their minds and post a terrible review which often discourages people.</li>
            <li> I was sadly disappointed at how much less closely it shaved me over the 10 year old Remington.  </li>
            <li> I could hear the razor cutting those tough little neck hairs that were always so hard to get with my old razor.</li>
            <li> When I recently forgot my shaver and came back after 3 days with this one, I expected the worst.</li>
            <li> and I just rinse the blade holder part and the base under hot water as instructed.  </li>
            <li> &quot; bull crap is just another way of keeping people interested in their products.</li>
            <li> The shaver does a decent job on the obvious places (the cheeks, around the jawline, etc.), but it is HORRIBLE around the neck.</li>
            <li> I give the sensotouch a thumbs down for poor engineering.</li>
            <li> What I mean by that is with electric razors of the past, I&#x27;d shave my cheeks and moustache area, and that&#x27;d all go well.  </li>
            <li> To its credit, when it is used for the neck it is less irritating to this area as well and does yield fewer razor bumps.  </li>
            <li> had become dull and the battery couldn&#x27;t hold the charge.  </li>
            <li> After two months of use the blades seem as dull as a razor that has twelve months of use on it.  </li>
            <li> Since that time, using it was like using a dull saw to hack at whiskers.  </li>
            <li> you hardly know it is on.  </li>
            <li> The blades on it are getting dull.  </li>
            <li> you have hard to shave neck hair, I suggest trying this razor -</li>
            <li> This may make it hard to travel with, although this is somewhat mitigated by a 40min battery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve replaced the blades before, and the blades were getting dull again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just to hard to get one of the heads in there with out risking shaving parts of your mustache, you are not trying to shave.  </li>
            <li> so it sort of slides around and makes it hard to keep in one place.</li>
            <li> bought it to get a closer shave, could hardly get it to shave anything</li>
            <li> It just does not remove the hairs from those hard to shave places, like under my nose, along the sides under the shin and even under my lower lip.  </li>
            <li> Removes all the hair from the hard to shave areas and it passes the Wife Test.  </li>
            <li> Unless you are a die hard Norelco fan I would stay away from this shaver.</li>
            <li> But if I miss a day, it has a hard time with the longer hair.</li>
            <li> Late in 2010 I decided it was time to shave my beard and the shaver</li>
            <li> Philips CSR was rude and refused to listen and disconnected the line.</li>
            <li> The newer Panasonic do have larger cutting surfaces that I may have to try someday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Is this a common problem with this purchase?</li>
            <li> Three day old growth was a (lierally) painful experience.</li>
            <li> But as I said you need to go over your face at least 2-3 times.  </li>
            <li> Philips customer service is so rude.</li>
            <li> I also encourage others to file a complaint with their AGs.    </li>
            <li> Noticed it barely cutting my beard hair on the sides of my face, and had to make multiple passes to get all the hair.</li>
            <li> and Philips sent me a postcard rejecting my rebate in late May.</li>
            <li> Negative -1 stars, but</li>
            <li> At least it never took me 10 minutes to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li> Also the shave (at least for me) is not as close as from a blade razor.      </li>
            <li> Philips&#x27; customer service sucks....</li>
            <li> My two reviews were rejected and it seemed that this website does not want to publish any negative comment.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I can even take it in the car if I&#x27;m running late.</li>
            <li> Only drawback is awkward charging setup.</li>
            <li> Complained to company.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is that you cannot use the shaver when plugged in, which can be inconvenient if you forgot to charge the shaver.  </li>
            <li> I have nothing negative to say about it.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find anything negative about it</li>
            <li> What makes this such a pain to travel with is the charger: it is a rigid stand about 3/5ths the height of the shaver, and while it has suction cups on the bottom of it that give it the ability to stick to mirrors and some surfaces, the stand is bulky and EXTREMELY awkward to carry anywhere.</li>
            <li> This product needs training and you need to use it for at least 2 weeks to get accustomed to it.  </li>
            <li> but it is soooooooooooooo slow.</li>
            <li> It was the time of year when discounts were flying thick through the air. .</li>
            <li> Tips: Be patient and shave slowly.</li>
            <li> I stay away from posting negative reviews but am forced to do this.</li>
            <li> Slow and ineffective.</li>
            <li> I have thick body hair</li>
            <li> oh so slowly.</li>
            <li> Just logistics slowly.</li>
            <li> However, this has really helped my shaving, since I hate to do it, and manual shaving</li>
            <li> But he also has a thick beard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the less expensive models in the past and found them to be reliable and dependable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very happy with this razor.  </li>
            <li> The 1050 still has one annoying drawback: it is difficult to throughly clean.</li>
            <li> , HOWEVER, I didn&#x27;t get their rebate back, Philips just send me a paper saying I am not qualified for this rebate, this is ridicules and make me sad!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately we could not honor your request due to the folling reason: Manufacturer&#x27;s discounts taken at the cash register are not valid for rebate</li>
            <li> I mean I like it since I receive the package.</li>
            <li> The floating head arrangement is cheesy and doesn&#x27;t float as well as other rotary shaver I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Pressing down hard on your face with the shaver will irritate your skin and deliver a lousy shave.</li>
            <li> It still is in working order, however in order to not be without a shaver in case of failure, I purchased the 1150x/40 as a standby.</li>
            <li> You need to match the corners to the thin part so that the corners are not going down and cuts the thin part.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this shaver, and if you are, Norelco offers a 45 day guarantee.</li>
            <li> the down side, using it when you haven&#x27;t shaved in a while makes for an uncomfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I have used other brands and get really bad razor burn, and even the lesser expensive Norelco.</li>
            <li> Also, if the base malfunctions you have to buy a new expensive part while with the previous razors you could just interchange the power cords.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was slightly beyond the time period when it could be returned or exchanged where I bought</li>
            <li> But my rebate was not honored by a ridiculous reason.</li>
            <li> If you need a razor you need to seriously look at this one.</li>
            <li> Difficult in tight places, like under the nose.</li>
            <li> The reason is due to poor design destined to fail, and it did.  </li>
            <li> until I bought the Phillips shaver, I was using an electric shaver to shave a couple times a week and then would do a close shave with a razor Blase once a week, too to get the hard to cut and thin hairs that the razor didn&#x27;t catch.  </li>
            <li> After several days of use I can report that I am very disappointed in the SensoTouch 1150x Electric Shavers&#x27; performance; after I shave my scalp is often dry and somewhat flaky in need of lotion.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t bad enough that I feel like I need to touch it up with a \\&quot;real\\&quot; razor.  </li>
            <li> Plus occasionally I would get a duff blade and tear my face up before I realized it was a bad blade.</li>
            <li> Actually bough tit for myself (legs) because the size made it easier for my bad hands to hold..</li>
            <li> One bad thing is that you can&#x27;t shave with the plug, only with charged battery.</li>
            <li> The charger have no portability and is not good to travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Difficult to shave neck or any uneven skin surface  </li>
            <li> So maybe its not a fair comparison,</li>
            <li> (Never a good</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not entirely fair to ask ME if I would recommend the Norelco 1150.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not entirely fair to ask ME if I would recommend the Norelco 1150.</li>
            <li> I upgraded to the 3D afraid it would be another dissapointment thinking not much</li>
            <li> This product is no good.  </li>
            <li> However is is NOT good for legs..</li>
            <li> No good.</li>
            <li> This poorly designed shaver falls apart at least two times per shave.</li>
            <li> The batteries were about gone which was not surprising considering its age.  </li>
            <li> But is not good like 3D items.</li>
            <li> It is really NOT a good design.</li>
            <li> all but one are missing making it useless and how can you do anything about it.</li>
            <li> I hated shaving every day with a blade; too much work</li>
            <li> I hate that you can&#x27;t plug the cord directly into the razor...</li>
            <li> If you have hard to shave neck hair, I suggest trying this razor - it worked for me!</li>
            <li> - Long battery charge  - Li ion rechargeable batteries  - Compact design and small footprint base cradle  </li>
            <li> I must say that the initial 2 weeks were horrible with weird cuts on my face that left me with irritation.</li>
            <li> My conclusion of this behavior from Norelco is the following:  (i)</li>
            <li> My first impression is just terrible!   </li>
            <li> /&gt;Philips really sucks!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dumb that the sideburn-trimmer isn&#x27;t built-in</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s the first rebate fraud I got and the worst shaver I have ever got.  </li>
            <li> Carry shaver and a small part with it is absurd.  </li>
            <li> Weak battery and rotation cut,&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the second Norelco we have bought and been disappointed, but I couldn&#x27;t bother to make a return.</li>
            <li> some design seems too weak.</li>
            <li> One thing I have always hated about an electric razor is that if I go too long between shaves, It is difficult to shave the long hairs.</li>
            <li> On balance I am very disappointed in the SensoTouch 1150x Electric Shaver, so much so that I returned in to Amazon.com where I purchased it for $79.97.</li>
            <li> On balance I am very disappointed in the SensoTouch 1150x Electric Shaver, so much so that I returned in to Amazon.com where I purchased it for $79.97.</li>
            <li> I still cannot believe that an electric shaver can shave my tough beard sooo close.  </li>
            <li> In the area of cost, the edge - so to speak - goes to blades depending upon how tough a beard you have and how often you have to shave and change blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> By the way, I don&#x27;t have a really tough beard.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco 1150X/40 SensoTouch 2D Electric Razor ,Tough the package seems old,the product is still well.</li>
            <li> but Philips customer service was very rude, told me \\&quot;You&#x27;re</li>
            <li> They do not work and the stand is unstable due too a small base.  </li>
            <li> The shave quality of this unit was terrible, not up to Norelco standards certainly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s disgusting that a company as large as Philips would try to dodge its obligations on a flimsy pretext like that.</li>
            <li> after all, it is not a great shaver...</li>
            <li> The lights appear behind transparent areas of the surface.  </li>
            <li> Leaves longer hairs behind when shaving&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> Poor shave, bumps, and rash was the experience at that time.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still not great at getting the neck hairs.  </li>
            <li> And if I skip a day or two, the experience is worse.  </li>
            <li> and I was NOT happy at all with it.  </li>
            <li> like electric shavers because they don&#x27;t cause bumps at the base of the back of my neck like blade shaving</li>
            <li> Also, the head base seems to flex the same as my 7145...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to mention about the trimmer because it cuts like scissors even worse.</li>
            <li> So I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to you whether your beard is thin or not.</li>
            <li> so they are not as easily broken.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced this before using any electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco shaving products for approximately 25 years.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to upgrade unnecessarily to the 3d.</li>
            <li> The ergonomics are worse.</li>
            <li> This is so poorly designed that I want to give the engineer who designed it an anti-award.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me started about the actual base.</li>
            <li> Bought this about 3 months ago:&lt;br /&gt;- worse than Panasonic for sure.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The quality is poor.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with the charger stand that is required to charge the shaver.</li>
            <li> The stand is made of plastic and would be easily broken making the shaver unusable.</li>
            <li> &gt;* easier to shave along sideburn lines because the head is a thin unit separate from the battery</li>
            <li> I would recommend this razor to everyone that is tired of the nicks and cuts from using a blade.</li>
            <li> and it is broken.</li>
            <li> Not really happy with either.</li>
            <li> Although I can not say that 1150x shaves worse.</li>
            <li> It is still irritating to my skin.</li>
            <li> It leaves alot behind, and I end up having to use a blade razor to get the rest.</li>
            <li> We went through at least three rounds with customer service people and changed every part of this product to figure out what wrong with.</li>
            <li> Metal is switched for thin and flimsy plastic.</li>
            <li> Only plus is the rechargable base.</li>
            <li> The charging base looks and functions like it was designed by a middle school student.</li>
            <li> You just have to remember to place the shaver back in the charging base if you have to stop mid-shave.</li>
            <li> You just have to remember to place the shaver back in the charging base if you have to stop mid-shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fact is worse because now the circuit board is exposed.  </li>
            <li> What is even worse is that the shaving gel goop builds up inside of the razor head</li>
            <li> They have become progressively worse over the years.</li>
            <li> This was a poor design choice, though I suspect that Norelco went in this direction to enable the shaver to withstand water when cleaning.    </li>
            <li> You need the base if you&#x27;re traveling because it&#x27;s the only way to charge it.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> It had always been a fairly irritating shave.</li>
            <li> The sideburn trimmer is of even worse quality--it rips hairs rather than trims them.    </li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t charge this razor without the stand (The AC cord plugs into the stand only) which is annoying.  </li>
            <li> not great.</li>
            <li> I like electric shavers because they don&#x27;t cause bumps at the base of the back of my neck like blade shaving</li>
            <li> I was tired of bumps, messes, and nonsense, so I invested in this shaver(the</li>
            <li> With a manual blade, shaving without missing the patch of hairs adjacent to the trachea and on my chin without cutting myself was a challenge.</li>
            <li> made the thing worse is that this company</li>
            <li> , I called Philips support line, but Philips customer reps are even worse, they could not solve your issues but kicked the ball around until you had the products for over 90 days, then they said you could not return the product.</li>
            <li> seems quality is getting worse and worse.</li>
            <li> it was broken when I used it for 4 months.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m done with it&#x27;s poor performance</li>
            <li> You just have to remember to place the shaver back in the charging base if you have to stop mid-shave.</li>
            <li> The charging base is convenient for daily use , however cumbersome for traveling purpose&lt;</li>
            <li> Poor design.</li>
            <li> , This means Amazon is \\&quot;FALSE ADVERTISING PRODUCTS ON THEIR WEBSITE\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom Line \\&quot;FALSE ADVERTISING\\&quot; , Don&#x27;t ever trust Nerelco or Philips rebate ever again,</li>
            <li> Seriously!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately we are past the 30 day return window and my father has a useless pile of plastic and blades instead of a razor.  </li>
            <li> Frankly, I am disappointed in the shave, it&#x27;s not very close.</li>
            <li> Come on man less than 4 yrs , Contact NORELCO talked to online Rep was instructed the Head in unit was bad .</li>
            <li> It gives me a close shave and it is less painful / iritation.  </li>
            <li> The shaver&#x27;s base has three very terribly designed rubber suction cups presumably to make the unit hold better on slippery surfaces.</li>
            <li> Such a bad company, no trust!</li>
            <li> Out of all the electric razors I have had (3), this is by far the worst.</li>
            <li> When I opened the box I was a little disappointed that this one did not come with a storage/travel case and the charging cradle did not appear rugged.&lt;br /&gt;After charging the electric razor</li>
            <li> And their price matching policy would not give me money back, which drive me crazy!!</li>
            <li> sucks sometimes!!  </li>
            <li> Though this negative experience was unpleasant it helped me get into DE Shaving (using safety razors).</li>
            <li> charging base is slightly cumbersome to get the product in and out of &amp;</li>
            <li> slight problem is that you have to charge the razor before shaving, or you have to hold a base to shave while charging.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this shaver is very weak, and flimsy,.</li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> Trimmer is not built in, you have to replace shaver to operate  Useless for trimming sideburns  </li>
            <li> its weird how they designed it....</li>
            <li> Razors are expensive</li>
            <li> I think it is unfair for my family</li>
            <li> sorry, Norelco.  </li>
            <li> Awful, there&#x27;s a reason why this is the only place I shop online.</li>
            <li> such a horrible shaver!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> He said that the attachment is useless, which is a problem for him since he used the attachment on his Braun to shave his head.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I would say this razor is awful.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to get angry just because of $30, but I have to post my experience here</li>
            <li> since my face has several regions of hair that grows in all directions, my neck is the worst</li>
            <li> Useless for anyone travelling</li>
            <li> On my face and with my beard, my shave was lousy and my face got abraded.</li>
            <li> Removing the head of the shaver seems a bit difficult until you get use to removing the shaving head from the body.</li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t really go wrong giving this one a try.</li>
            <li> But Philip and Amazon both failed to abide with promise on rebate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, since day 1, I&#x27;ve had to go over shaving areas 9-30 times in order to get an even, acceptable shave.  </li>
            <li> missed the coupon,so sad.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, he likes it but found the there is something wrong with charger.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to stay upright.</li>
            <li> The second one, which is the worst in my eyes, is that the plastic on the body can break or flake off.  </li>
            <li> It shaves closely, but does have a few annoying design</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the plastic is not up to the task and the plastic cracked.  </li>
            <li> The 1150X also comes with a trimming accessory for trimming sideburns and beards, but I found the trimmer to be completely useless.  </li>
            <li> - Shaving takes longer  - Trimmer useless  - No travel pouch    </li>
            <li> It shaves closely, but does have a few annoying design elements.</li>
            <li> Meh, this is expensive and doesn&#x27;t work that well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry purchased my 11/28 2011 from Wal Mart &amp; Had 21/2 year warranty ,</li>
            <li> Routine cleaning of the shave head is difficult since disassembly of the blades is too cumbersome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m use to a rotary head shaver and this one is sad.</li>
            <li> However, I did notice that while it&#x27;s charging it makes a faint high-pitched hum.</li>
            <li> -You won&#x27;t have to buy an expensive razor again.  </li>
            <li> If philips thinks it is a marketing tactics then are very much wrong here.    </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the charging station is a T-style cradle that is made of the cheapest, lightest plastic in the world.</li>
            <li> Read the directions on how to take it apart rather than doing it wrong and breaking it which results in you</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve never owned a shaver that has a cleaning process that is as tedious as this one.</li>
            <li> I go through blades like you wouldn&#x27;t believe; that gets expensive and still cannot get the results I want.</li>
            <li> I think there is nothing wrong with my choice.</li>
            <li> The on/off switch is difficult to use, the power and charging indicators not intuitive.</li>
            <li> Is that accessories is too expensive.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> unfortunately, I now remember why i stopped using the norelco shavers.  </li>
            <li> It shaves closely, but does have a few annoying design elements.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be no problem adapting, but I had painful razor burn and seriously considered taking Norelco up on its money-back guarantee.</li>
            <li> like I do, or very thin beard</li>
            <li> I like the charging base, and I like the way the razor slips into it, but I don&#x27;t believe the base is stout enough structurally to survive travel in a suitcase.  </li>
            <li> One annoying aspect of the shaver&#x27;s design, however, is that it is close to impossible to lay the shaver down without it turning on its side, and then dumping out some shavings onto the counter.</li>

            <li> About six months ago for some unknown, insane reason, I was convinced to try a braun shaver..</li>
            <li> Sorry I was unfaithful.</li>
            <li> If this is Phillips Norelco engineering I am not impressed and am out the purchase price because I am afraid to us it.</li>
            <li> in fact the razor is  not excellent and not too bad...</li>
            <li> bad thing is that the manufacturer failed to fund the $30 mail-in rebate on this product which is included in the mail-in rebate list.</li>
            <li> That makes this shaver unnecessarily inconvenient to pack.</li>
            <li> I have it, but still need to work at cutting some hairs.   </li>
            <li> My husband was unhappy with its shaving capability.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it cutting me in any way.</li>
            <li> I am totally unhappy with the performance of this product as i am feeling that the things which have been focussed in demos over websites is untrue as per my view.</li>
            <li> Awkward to use and have to change heads to use trimmer.</li>
            <li> Shaving isn&#x27;t uniform as to cutting all whiskers.</li>
            <li> I have been so disappointing in this item.</li>
            <li> This one, my fifth Norelco, is clunky, noisy, and inconvenient.</li>
            <li> I need to replace the cutting blades but the unit still charges up and the charge lasts quite some time.</li>
            <li> He said it rips out the hair instead of cutting it.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Have used the 1150 for about three months now and am every unhappy with the product.</li>
            <li> Failed: [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Wrong!  </li>
            <li> There was, however, one unpleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> It is very expensive in my country.</li>
            <li> The worst problem with this design is the shoddy construction.</li>
            <li> This item came with the wrong charging base, not Amazon&#x27;s fault.  </li>
            <li> charging stand is rigid, bulky, and VERY difficult to travel with&lt;br /&gt;-  </li>
            <li> The thing I&#x27;ve found really annoying about the Panasonic razors is that the batteries fail to hold charge after about two years.</li>
            <li> The worst spot is around the adam&#x27;s apple, where I actually got a nasty in-grown hair because of the way I had to go about trying to shave the hair there.  </li>
            <li> But badly needs a pop-up trimmer.</li>
            <li> After checking, I found the shaver&#x27;s Charging Cord is bad.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;y bad blades...</li>
            <li> am getting a bad feeling about the rebate claim.</li>

            <li> The product is not that bad.</li>
            <li> BAD  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t glide on the skin as another reviewer noted - the friction is quite bad.</li>
            <li> giving a unwarranted bad review.</li>
            <li> This shaver gave my face a bad case of the feels.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Norelco razor for years but always had a problem when trying to shave my neck hair with painful results.</li>
            <li> The build quality is atrocious.</li>
            <li> Making a terrible razor worse, I bought this with the idea of getting a rebate.</li>
            <li> and I have always been disappointed by the not-close-enough job done by electric razors, so I always resort to the disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> am disappointed as neither Amazon nor Philips warn about this rebate trap.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in both Philips and Amazon, will assume this is on Philips and not buy their products</li>
            <li> Oh and you need to change the head if you need the trimmer :(((</li>
            <li> I have bought them without question, because until this one I&#x27;ve never purchased one that disappointed me.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> But I was never so disappointed of it...  </li>
            <li> Each time I have tried to go Shaver it failed miserably.  </li>

            <li> You can use it with either foam or water base shaving solutions.  </li>
            <li> The charging base is compact and has suction cups for mounting&lt;</li>

            <li> I also find it annoying that you need the stand to charge it.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;--razor makes an annoying high-pitched noise when charging</li>
            <li> It was my attempts to get these longer hairs at the base of the neck and between my lower lip and chin that culminated in a rash.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My husband uses it for general shaving purposes. He has been quite satisfied with it so far; it gives him a very close shave. He has no complaints with it so far (we purchased it within the last 4-6 weeks).</li>
            <li> Good product, eas to use!</li>
            <li> Not very useful, can not get the same quality shaving as using a blade.</li>
            <li> I bought it when it on deal, the price is good and item is better than my old electric razor, I would like to buy another one for my friend.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent razor. You can use it with either foam or water base shaving solutions.  You only need to charge it when the razor runs down.  I made the misstate of continually charging it and burned it out.  It was under warranty and Philips sent me a new handle within a week.  Great customer service. Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.It is a very cheap and Superior quality.Is really fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;Next time I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> My husband thinks this razor is the best he has ever had.  He simply loves it and uses it every day.</li>
            <li> it is very good staff, i bought it for friend&#x27;s birthday, he loves it. Good product, and also i got it on time</li>
            <li> The material have poor quality and the plastic peels easily. The shaver head drops out of the device during shaving. The charger have no portability and is not good to travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  No durability&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I was really upset with this choice. I think I&#x27;ll move to Brawn</li>
            <li> Good things, the use of down feeling good, and the price is very cheap, hope Amazon continues to launch cheap goodies.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco electric razors for 40 years. This is the best razor I have had and my first cordless. It is as close a shave as you get with a blade. The battery holds a charge for over a month. This was the best investment I have made in a long time.</li>
            <li> in fact the razor is  not excellent and not too bad... it works good, but the only matter is the nick line....</li>
            <li> Shaves great. Light weight. Battery hold charge over a week. But badly needs a pop-up trimmer. The changeable one that comes with it already broke.</li>
            <li> Thought it would be good for shaving my head, no so.  Good as a regular razor.</li>
            <li> When I first opened the packaging, I thought the head was flimsy. Wrong. It was just different from my previous Norelco. It looks modern and adjusts to curves easily. I have owned other Norelco Shavers and, though I loved the convience and the smooth shave, I often turned it off accidently while shaving. Evidently, the on/off switch was positioned for the places men shave. This razor seldom turns off and works well in my hand.     The shaver charged quickly. Interestingly, the razor must be in the holder to recharge. This means an extra thing to carry when traveling.      I haven&#x27;t yet cleaned it but it seems to require a special cleaning device that did not come with it.     Overall, good product.</li>
            <li> Wow, this is a nice shaver.  It provides a close shave and it sleek and modern looking.  Not that the look is THAT important, but it kind of is in marketing the product.  The blades are easy to clean too.  The only thing that I could see improved on this shaver is that when it is charging it tends to lean as the base is not heavy enough to support the weight of the dangling cord.  You will need to prop it against the wall to steady it.  Not really that big of a deal though.</li>
            <li> I have to admit before I start that I mistakenly thought that this razor was to shave my legs.  I didn&#x27;t realize that it was a beard and hair trimmer until I received it in the mail.  Because of this, I felt the need to use the Philips Norelco 1150x/40 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver on my husband&#x27;s beard.  I didn&#x27;t think using it on my legs, even if it would have worked, would have been suffice for the information I need for this review.    The charging time is optimal.  Not too long to wait and the razor comes alive.  I have a good bit of fun shaving my husbands face just because the shaving element was so sharp and it totally rocked as a close shave.  Then I used the hair trimmer and voila! I fell in love with this razor! My husband&#x27;s face was soft with little or no stubble.  I tested his face once he returned from work and his beard had grown very little during the day.      This is an awesome product that men definitely need in their bathrooms to use with grooming.    Natalie S.</li>
            <li> it is very good and nice shoping at amazon</li>
            <li> This is an experiment as I am used to a tri-blade razor. The price of blades has gone out of sight. If this animal can replace 80 or so blades before having to replace the heads, I will be ahead of the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is the old timing cut your hand before you open type that most manufacturers have abandoned. However the system came with a small how-to maintain the razor manual.  It was easy to plug in the stand and wait for the razor to charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to use it over the same surface several times but eventually it did its job.  It was easy to clean with just a quick rinse as long as you can keep the cats face out of it. It sort of looks like an electronic lotus in its stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried any pre-shave lotion, and may never, but I am looking for one that is not smelly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mean time I have not calculated the amount of electricity this uses.  I will be unplugging the stand with charging is complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This  system has a two year warranty but it is so inexpensive that it would be easier to toss it if anything should happen.</li>
            <li> Norelco SensoTouch Razor 1150x may not have all the bells &amp; whistles compared to higher priced models.  However, it  provides soft smooth,quiet shave without irr.itation.  Easy to clean with hot water.  Fritz from Camano,WA      ..</li>
            <li> It is a pretty good electric shaver but little awkward while woking around adam apple.  It leaves a severe burning sensation after shaving below chin and around adam apple.  Look - A+  Design - A+  Ease of Use - A+  Price - A+  Charge - A+  Shaving Experience - B</li>
            <li> Since I am a senior citizen, I have used many different wet/dry shavers in my lifetime. This senso touch tilts and moves to the countours of the face for the smoothest and most comfortable shave ever.</li>
            <li> Have been using this shaver for over a month now - haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet!  The trimmer isn&#x27;t great, but other than that I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> My husband likes this shavor-he said he is still getting used to it, but does a nice close shave. Difficult in tight places, like under the nose.</li>
            <li> The shaver does a decent job on the obvious places (the cheeks, around the jawline, etc.), but it is HORRIBLE around the neck. I&#x27;ve tried moving my neck in all sorts of ways, gone over the trouble areas multiple times, and it still leaves batches of hairs. The worst spot is around the adam&#x27;s apple, where I actually got a nasty in-grown hair because of the way I had to go about trying to shave the hair there.  That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m returning this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So long story short, if your neck hair grows fairly low, this shaver won&#x27;t get it at all. Maybe go with one of the 3D models that might change their angle to get that area better, a foil shaver, or the trusty blade.</li>
            <li> I bought it last week as my father&#x27;s gift.  looks good,but I never try.  Why the price goes up, I bought it as $84,but it&#x27;s $90 now...  I intend to buy another for myself...</li>
            <li> For the past 8 months I had been using a [[ASIN:B001AMRQ2W Philips Norelco Speed 8240 Men&#x27;s Shaving System]] but recently forgot it at a family members house and found myself in need of a temporary razor solution.  The 8240 had been my first rotary razor experience and I had been very pleased with it, so I decided I would give this razor a try as I wanted to see what the wet shaving experience was all about.      For dry shaving this razor is pretty good.  The quality of the shave seems just as good as the 8240, although the 8240 was the \\&quot;Speed\\&quot; model and I do think provided for a quicker shave.      For wet shaving I was really impressed with this razor.  I used it with Edge shave gel and it was an absolutely pleasant shaving experience.  The razor glided very well and gave me the smoothest shave I have ever had with an electric razor.  The biggest benefit of this to me though is that I can shave when my face is anything other than perfectly dry.  All my previous dry razors would catch and stick and my skin was even the slighest bit most.  But with this razor if my skin is wet( like after a shower) and I can just use some shave gel and get a perfect shave.      My other favorite features about this razor and the 8240 is how easy they are to clean.  Either razor you can easily pop the cutting heads off of and then just run it under some water to clean.  Only takes a couple seconds and does a great job keeping it clean.</li>
            <li> This Philips Norelco 1150x/40 is in my opinion one of the best rotary wet shavers I have used. I have been using Norelco rotaries for the past 25 years or so, but this one is the best. I even tried a foil shaver from a competetor but this Norelco is way better. I can not comment on it as a dry shaver. The wet shave is so comfortable that I wouldn&#x27;t even think of using it as a dry shaver. I would also would like to say I have no shaving irriatation and the battery charge stays for over two weeks. Great shaver for the money!</li>
            <li> I got this razor after having another phillips razor for four years. the difference was amazing. it glides smooth over your face and the tough spots to shave under the chin are easy because it pivots inwards. if your looking for a new razor and one that&#x27;s fairly priced with a great shave and clean up this is the one to go with.</li>
            <li> I had been using a combo of Braun and regular razor shave when the Braun shave kept whiskers too long.  I bought this Norelco since a friend of mine had been using one.  I planned on using the return privilege, if I didn&#x27;t get a close shave. I have used the Norelco dry.  On the first day, I got the closest electric shave ever using the Norelco.  The same on the second, third etc.  I will not be returning the shaver as it is that good.  Previously I had been shaving every other day.  Now, it&#x27;s every day, because it&#x27;s so easy and so good.  This is a great product and the price was right using a $30 coupon.  As usual, Amazon delivered right on time.</li>
            <li> It is great. I have bought 3. It is very expensive in my country. I will continue to focus on it.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor after my 3 year old Arcitec decided to die, and I wanted to stay in the Norelco line of razors.  Since I was going from a top of the line razor 3 years ago, to a middle of the line razor today, I expected that the quality would be similar but perhaps not exactly the same.  Razors have changed a lot in 3 years.  This cheaper razor runs circles around my Arcitec.  I would finish a shave with the old razor, and invariably there would still be 20-30 straggler hairs that I would have to go over a second/third time to catch them. (And yes, I clean my razor&#x27;s and change the heads periodically).  With this new razor, I notice maybe 5 stragglers, and they will sweep up on my second pass usually, making this razor easily 5 minutes faster than using my old Arcitec.  I think the biggest difference though between this razor and my old Arcitec is that my face feels SOOOO smooth after using the 1150x!  It&#x27;s almost as if the razor head/foils cut the hair even deeper than the old Arcitec did... and I&#x27;m not complaining!  Great Job Norelco, this one will be a great Christmas present for dads this year!</li>
            <li> The shaver I received is good, but cannot be charged. After checking, I found the shaver&#x27;s Charging Cord is bad.</li>
            <li> I received it last week ,it&#x27;s beatful,and smooth to the skin, very good. I like it.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it with an code,so it is cheap,just aford with me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a year since I&#x27;ve purchased this, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it. It gives a very clean shave, and it&#x27;s very easy to clean. I rinse the head after every shave and I haven&#x27;t done any disassembling to do a thorough clean.   Very good for its price</li>
            <li> This shaver is the cheapest out of all of these new style Norelco&#x27;s. That being said, it provides an incredible shave! I cannot say if the higher models are worth the money, because I have not used them. I just know that if you are considering this shaver, I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> The Philips 1150x is very worth 55 USD ;)  My husband is satisfied with the effort of the product. I will buy another one for my father if the price is as good as 55 USD.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s over rated and this is all I can say.  I bought two last Christmas and these are the drawbacks:  First, the compartment to hold shavings leaves much to be desired unless you want to empty this everyday.  This comment came from my son.  Also, you don&#x27;t have the option of plugging it into a wall outlet if the battery suddenly dies.  My unit is currently cracking the plastic on the on/off switch and so much for potentially using this in the shower, anymore.  I want to go back to the old as it was tried and true!  I give the sensotouch a thumbs down for poor engineering.</li>
            <li> great deal. Although I bought it one month before thanksgiving deal and cost a little more than the biggest deal, still it is a great deal for this good product</li>
            <li> Well I had a lot of expectations from this product, but a bit dissapointed with its outcome. The wet and dry shave were ok, but not as smooth as one would expect for a product at this cost. It causes some irritation especially in the neck area and its a bit longer to give a smooth shave. Good thing is that it charges up quickly and has a very good grip to hold on to. Cleaning is also quite easy. Overall I would say an average product.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1ZF76BRQ1O5F2]]</li>
            <li> Good and not expensive  worthy and nice deal  if I could buy another 1150x, I will do.  and how i wish 1240 could be as worthy as this one</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco SensoTouch electric shaver is very nicely designed !  Overall, it is pretty effective, quiet, and pretty good around the neck!</li>
            <li> pretty smooth, enjoy it, it is a decent razor.Beat traditional razor. Besides, it is 3D product. And you can wash it easily and don&#x27;t need to change the head frequently. Just try it</li>
            <li> The shave I get was smooth, no nicks, easy to clean.Like the stand has plungers so sticks easy. I like how you can change razor head to regular to uzz cut. Makes it more versatile. The device has a good grip on it as well, which is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing is still haven&#x27;t gotten rebate check but will wait and see.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric shavers for many years. The Senso 2d is the best I have used so far. I get a close shave free of any skin irritation. I also find it easier to clean.I have used it in both wet mode and dry. I found little or no difference relative to closeness of shave in either mode. I have elected to use it in dry mode for convenience.</li>
            <li> Overall, I have been pleased with this razor.  I had been using Gillette sensor razor for the last 10+ years, but it is harder and more expensive to find replacement cartridges, so I thought that I would try the electric razor again.  I am impressed that this razor is wet/dry although I have only tried it dry.  It does a great job on my face.  Nice, clean shave.  It, like every other electric razor that I have tried, is not the greatest at shaving the neck.  It is okay on the neck but it requires a little extra time and patience and leaves stray hairs if I am not diligent.  I would give it a 5 star rating if not for difficulty shaving the neck, hence four stars.</li>
            <li> This shaver is amazingly fast and smooth. It cuts a 3-day beard much faster and cleaner than any shaver that I have ever used before.</li>
            <li> Very nice,I like it.I dropped the old one when I got it.  It&#x27;s so beautiful and shinning.  great thing!  There is nothing to say any more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good deal with low price and high quality. I bought it for my father and he seems like it very much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to used, can be wash directly by water, good good good good good good good!It&#x27;s easy to used, can be wash directly by water</li>
            <li> it is a a nice product,specially for people who has much mustache.  and its appearance looks good  so it is a very saitable product to be a gift !</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver, gives a clean shave with very light pressure. For me it gives better results than my previous foil shaver, and makes far less noise. The shaving head clicks off, and is interchangeable with the seperate trimmer head. Sleek looking ergonomic design, charges through side contacts while on its stand. Ordered from Australia and it arrived very quickly with tracking available. My model has automatic voltage selection, so was able to use it in Australia (240 volt) by using a small black US-AU pin adaptor plug.</li>
            <li> Very good design and functions! Good touch feeling ,voice is very light,easy to clean. Most important is this Shaver cheap</li>
            <li> I too am a victim of not getting the $30 rebate from Phillips as advertised by Amazon; I paid $50 bucks for this razor. I have used this razor for two months; it&#x27;s a marginal razor at best. I should have kept my trusty Panasonic three blade screen razor and bought replacement blades.  1150x/40 Cons:  Slow/weak operating action  Cheap feel  Difficult to clean blades  Trimmer is not built in, you have to replace shaver to operate  Useless for trimming sideburns  Difficult to shave neck or any uneven skin surface  Does not provide a close shave without multiple passes  Pros:  Does not tug/snag on long stubble  Quite operation  Replacement blades are inexpensive</li>
            <li> I had purchased one in Sep. 2011, and the product in damage, rigth now.&lt;br /&gt;The technical service worker said me, motherboard is damaged and is irreparable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use to use like the manual indecated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any better than my 10years old shaver, but I thought it was still a great buy for $20. I don&#x27;t think I would purchased this shaver if i would have known that the rebate was a scam. after all, it is not a great shaver... I use just manual shaver now.</li>
            <li> Shaver is really easy on my skin. I tried the Panasonic first and it ripped my hair out and irritated my skin. I shaved with the SensoTouch for the first time yesterday and it did the whole job in about 3 minutes. That&#x27;s one of the biggest reasons it doesn&#x27;t hurt my skin. I didn&#x27;t have to shave the same areas over and over especially the neck and chin area. It cut the hairs easily and is a breeze to clean. The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is you have to charge it in the cradle and can&#x27;t plug the charger directly into the shaver. It&#x27;s well worth the tradeoff though.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because there is a discount showing on Amazon, plus a manufacture&#x27;s rebate, which makes it a good deal. After 4 months I received a postcard from Norelco saying that they could not honor the rebate because it already has a discount... but there is no fine-print on the rebate form showing this. It is still in the box but now I miss the window to return it - without rebate I wouldn&#x27;t even buy it in the first place. And with no bar code on the box, I can&#x27;t even sell it or give it as a gift. What a mess that Norelco cause...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based upon this experience, think it twice when you want to buy anything from Philips Norelco... especially when they say they have a rebate.</li>
            <li> I have used Phillips/Norelco for over 30 years. Purchased this one because I thought it would be a smoother comfortable shave. Turns out it is the worst Philips razor I hve ever used. Have 2 other old ones that are years old that are much better. Went to Wal-Mart and purchased a Remington rotary electric razor for half the cost of the Senso Touch which is smooth and comfortable. Do not have to rake it over my face for 15 to 20 minutes to get a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will package up the Senso Touch and send it to Philips coustomer service. Another $90 down the tube.</li>
            <li> Last November I bought two Philips Norelco 1150x/40 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver, Metallic Blue as it was advertised to have a manufacturer $30 dollars. I followed exactly all steps in submitting the rebate requests.  I&#x27;ve been waiting for the rebate checks for months. I feel I was cheated by Philips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d think that it would be nice for Amazon to take some actions to protect its own image as those products were sold on your site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way the product itself is mediocre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,</li>
            <li> I also did not get a rebate, similar to other respondents. The rebate is the reason I selected this one. It cuts my beard fine, but so do other shavers. I find the trimmer that must be swapped with the regular shave heads to be very annoying, much better to have a pop-out style. Also the shape and size makes this razor unwieldy, a bit big for traveling. Overall I am not happy and now I am even more annoyed since the rebate issue came up.</li>
            <li> I bought this last Dec, when I see there is promotion for $30 off and an extra $30 rebate. But today, I received a post card from Philips says: Manufacture&#x27;s discounts taken at the cash register are not valid for rebate promotions. However, I&#x27;ve checked the rebate form, their did not say this on their form. And I found their are a lot of people get cheated and bought it last Dec and did not get the rebate. I will not buy Philips product any more.</li>
            <li> Razor has performed up to the hype.  Battery life is shorter than I estimated.  Anyone that says they can get a week on one charge is either shaving every few days, or has so little facial hair they should not be bothering with the razor and just smear cream on their face and let the cat lick it off.  No major complaints.  This is my fifth Norelco razor and I have been happy with all of them, but I would like the blades to last a little longer. I hate spending more for replacing the blades than purchasing the razor.  Don&#x27;t tell me that for a few more dollars Norelco could not make a tougher blade that would stay sharp longer than a few  months.  If they want a 4 star reputation, have them produce a replacement blade that lasts longer than the drive home from the store.</li>
            <li> Have been using an older Norelco shaver,loved it....Bought this one to replace it.. Works great, clean shave, quite, cuts close, can&#x27;t go wrong with this flex head shaver, grat price and quality</li>
            <li> the product is as advertised. It works pretty good. Its smooth on th The battery charges quick and holds its charge. The price on Amazon was better than I could find it anywhere else. Would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Excellent shave every time!</li>
            <li> The package is not very good.</li>
            <li> Sounds a little big, the other better.</li>
            <li> Pulls, grabs, pinches and does not deliver a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Ok so, i was an owner of Philips norelco 8000 series with the triple track system and a cleaning station and everything. That gave me a smooth shave and was very happy with it. I must say that the initial 2 weeks were horrible with weird cuts on my face that left me with irritation. But later it got good.... really good. A week ago i saw the new sensotouch, which was 50 dollars cheaper and water proof, so i returned the 8000 series and bought this one. I must say that the triple track system of the 8000 series and the single track of the 1150 has made no difference in my shaving experience. Its cheaper and water proof, which i must say feels so much closer to the traditional shaving experience with a shaving gel and everything. It shaves wonderfully around the neck region, with minimal irritation. Since i have a thick growth, i prefer clean shaving everyday and this is where philips wins hands down. I could never shave everyday with a blade, which would leave me with cuts all over my face. Over all i am very happy with my purchase and recommend it to everyone who is considering this shaver. Btw, when the manual recommends you to use it for couple of weeks to get used to the shaver, they are not kidding. Do give it time before your skin adjusts and while you try to figure out the right pressure and shaving motions that suits your face. Ciao.</li>
            <li> This item replaced my husband&#x27;s Norelco from 20+ years ago and boy is he impressed! Charges fast on a very useful station that suctions to the surface it&#x27;s on and is easy to remove and replace. Quiet when turned on, the heads seem to float over the skin with an extremely light touch that he enjoys - all with NO pulling or snagging of whiskers or skin. A wonderful shave that is quick and no longer such a painful chore. Great shaver!</li>
            <li> My partner was in need of one and according to him it works better than what he was expecting.  He loves it.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with my new shaver&#x27;s smooth cut, quiet operation, and length of retaining its charge.  It is very easy to clean and delivers a very smooth shave</li>
            <li> Shaving has always been an issue with my face and I loathed doing it. Blade shaving almost always resulted a nick or cut that would take forever to stop bleeding as well as some razor burn. I had used a single foil electric shaver a couple years ago that wasn&#x27;t anything to write home about. I mostly resolved to using a beard trimmer, but that would always be a painful scratching experience. So after years of this I decided to find myself a good rotary shaver.     I first puchased a Norelco 7340XL razor and went to work with it. It most certainly did get a much nicer cleaner shave, almost as clean a blade, but I was left with a shredded up neck line and bad irration. I gave it a week until I decided to find a preshave. I&#x27;ve used Remington&#x27;s Face Saver before and found it worked well, but stores around here no longer carry it. So I figured some Lectric Shave, or Afta would do the trick but....the Lectric Shave smelled like pure alcohol, and the Afta left me smelling like an old man, like something my grandpaw wears. Either was a no go, so I decided to bite the bullet and return the 7340XL and find a much better shaver.    I really wanted something I could use in the shower and at the price point I was looking at(I couldn&#x27;t see myself paying for a Jet Clean that does something I could do myself, plus I don&#x27;t have the counter space)I narrowed it down to the 1150x or the Nivea For Men Shaver. I choose the 1150x because the Nivea cartridges would get pricey over time, and had read that without it it can lead to  irritation. First off, this is a really nice razor. I really like the design of it and actually prefer that the heads interchange for shaving and trimming. The popout trimmer of the 7340XL just felt akward. Upon first use the 1150x gave me as close as a blade shave, with no nicks, no cuts, no burn and no irritation,,,SUCCESS!!!! I then decided to get some foam and shave in the shower with it and without a doubt, it&#x27;s the best shave I have found yet. I&#x27;ve found theperfect shave...for me!!!!</li>
            <li> This razor blew me away when I was shopping for a gift for my husband. He was very impressed when he opened it but it didn&#x27;t last for long. The razor barely cut his beard. I had to return it.</li>
            <li> I was happy that this electric shaver would work best as I was expecting.  But its not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes longer to shave my beard than the Razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned this product and got a Gillete razor.</li>
            <li> For the price and for the sweet sexy design of this electric razor, I really thought this would massively out perform the 4 year old plug in electric I was using. It operates just as well as the old razor, buuuuuuut this one I can shave wet or dry and even rinse the head under running water. For that, I like this one so much more than the old razor. And by looking at it, you expect the head to swivel, wouldn&#x27;t you?</li>
            <li> i bought this shaver because my braun 5 series stop charging completely.  i have owned 2 braun, 1 panasonic, and 1 philips before this one, and this is the best one that i have ever owned even thought it wasn&#x27;t the most expensive one.  it gives a very close shave and i can shave in the shower.  I love the look, and the design.  its charging time is only 1 hour and it lasts me almost 3 weeks before i have to charge it again.( i shave once every three days).  at first, i use this with shaving cream, but one time i used it with Nivea face wash for men, and to my surprise....it works just as well...so now, i don&#x27;t even buy shaving cream any more....just shave in the shower and wash my face right after...get 2 things done at once.  another thing that i like about this shaver is that you can&#x27;t really press hard against your skin....its weird how they designed it....no matter how hard i press it against my face or neck, i just can&#x27;t feel the pressure and yet it shaves clean...its a good thing that you can&#x27;t press hard against your skin, because with my previous shaver, i tend to press hard and get some skin burn after the shave....so this product completely eliminated that problem for me....cleaning is so easy, after the shave, just pop open the blade cover and run both parts under water...and its as clean as the first time you use it....so i don&#x27;t suggest people to buy the more expensive model of this product( i think its senso touch 3D or something like that) because there is no need.  this product&#x27;s performance exceeds my expectation and its the best bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> The new Philips Norelco 1150x is one slick shaving device that looks right out of Star Trek. While keeping the original traditional 3 circular heads design, it improves radically on many important points.  First, the new body: it&#x27;s made of a cool looking metallic material that integrates buttons and lights in a continuous surface, so it&#x27;s very easy to wipe clean. The lights appear behind transparent areas of the surface.  Then, the convenience of the design: top notch. First, because the shaving heads are mounted on a deported piece with a narrow neck, it&#x27;s very easy to see what you&#x27;re doing. I never thought it was important, but I found out how much I had been missing.  Also, unlike older designs with a pop-up trimmer of limited usability due to its lack of clearance, on this shaver the trimmer just plugs into the top of the body as a replacement to the shaving heads, so the angle, clearance and visibility are perfect.  Both wet and dry shaving are supported; cleaning and taking apart the shaving head is very easy, just rinse under the tap and air dry.    The shaving accuracy is excellent, although I don&#x27;t see it as a marked improvement over my previous Philips/Norelco (which I was perfectly satisfied with)    Charging is fast (full charge in an hour, but you can use the shaver within minutes of charging)  The 1150x/40 is also very quiet for an electric shaver.    The box contains the shaver body, shaving head, trimmer attachment, cleaning brush, brush head cover, charging stand and world-capable charging adapter (110-240V). The charger is considerably smaller than the ones Philips/Norelco used to bundle, which is an excellent improvement especially for travelers.    There were a couple of points where I thought the design fell a little short, but they&#x27;re small enough that I don&#x27;t think it would be fair to ding the rating of this otherwise excellent shaver by a star:  - The power adapter only connects to the stand, not the shaver; the only way you can charge the shaver is by using the charging stand, which does not fold up. That makes this shaver unnecessarily inconvenient to pack. Obviously, removing the power connector from the shaver&#x27;s body improves its water resistance, but still, it&#x27;s unfortunate.  - Although the trimmer is considerably more useful than the built-in trimmer of previous models, it&#x27;s also another small, easy to lose part. It would have been nice to have a place to store it on the charging stand.  - No carry case.    Still, considering its excellent performance and convenience, I think this shaver deserves 5 stars. Definitely one of the best I&#x27;ve used, and its great head clearance and trimmer make it perfect to maintain a nice trimmed beard. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor ever. Razors are expensive so I figured I would invest instead of spend. It&#x27;s a pretty fairly priced razor and it gets the job done. My face definitely took about a month to adjust to it but now it&#x27;s much better.     I do have to spend an extra minute in a few places that are hard to reach for the blades around my neck, but it&#x27;s still faster and easier than a manual razor. If you&#x27;re looking to upgrade from a cheapo unit I would go even higher than this one and spend a few extra bucks. If you&#x27;re starting out like I was then I would recommend this unit, I plan on keeping it for years to come.</li>
            <li> The [[ASIN:B003V360NY Philips Norelco 1150x/40 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver, Metallic Blue]] is a good electric razor for those looking to buy a SensoTouch model.  For those who don&#x27;t need the better detail trimmer, the [[ASIN:B001AJ6YS2 Philips Norelco 7310XL Men&#x27;s Shaving System]] offers a decent shave for less.  The trade-offs are the better features and longer battery life.  The 1150 operates faster and quieter than the 7310, and it has a better trimmer than either the 7310 or the 1250.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1150 is the best value you can get in the SensoTouch line.  Like the [[ASIN:B003V37Z9W Philips Norelco 1250cc/42 SensoTouch 3d]] it is best designed for daily use of shorter facial hair.  If you let your hairs get too long it requires too many passes to get them all.  It doesn&#x27;t take long to produce noticeable neck irritation.  The discomfort did subside with longer term use.  However, there was always some discomfort when shaving the neck area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1150x doesn&#x27;t include the 3D heads of the 1250x and the cleaning station of the 1250cc.  The battery also lasts for 40 minutes instead of 60.  But for half the investment, this unit is worth consideration despite the missing features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;++ Good performance for an electric shaver&lt;br /&gt;++ Best for daily shaving of shorter facial hair&lt;br /&gt;++ The attachment trimmer works better than the 1250&#x27;s pop-up trimmer&lt;br /&gt;++ Smooth and quiet operation compared to most electric razors&lt;br /&gt;++ Charging is quick&lt;br /&gt;++ Can be used wet or dry, and with or without shaving cream or gel&lt;br /&gt;++ The shaving heads can be cleaned under water&lt;br /&gt;++ The included soft case makes it easy to transport&lt;br /&gt;++ The charging base is compact and has suction cups for mounting&lt;br /&gt;++ The device is attractive and sleek&lt;br /&gt;++ Comprehensive manual covers a lot, including usage, maintenance and parts replacement&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-- Leaves longer hairs behind when shaving&lt;br /&gt;-- Alternatives like the 7310 still offer a better value for most of the same features&lt;br /&gt;-- The trimmer requires manual attachment, though it&#x27;s worth it since it functions better than the pop-up on the 1250&lt;br /&gt;-- The battery lasts less time than all other SensoTouch models&lt;br /&gt;-- Recommended annual blade replacements add significant cost&lt;br /&gt;-- There is no indicator for blade replacement or cleaning&lt;br /&gt;-- The battery indicator includes 2 stages instead of the 5 on the 1250&lt;br /&gt;-- The battery is not user-replaceable and will limit the unit&#x27;s life&lt;br /&gt;-- Does not include the jet cleaning system&lt;br /&gt;-- The soft pouch is not as nice as the carrying case included with other models&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For most users, lower end models like the 7310 will work sufficiently well.  The 1150 is a compromise, but unless you really need the detail trimmer give the entry level units a try first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who want the Jet Clean system should try the 1250, as long as they are willing to pay the premium and don&#x27;t mind the hassle and expense of changing the fluid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would still recommend this over the 1250.  For a much more reasonable investment of time and funds, you can have an almost equivalent shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy.al attachment, though it&#x27;s worth it since it functions better than the pop-up on the 1250  -- The battery lasts less time than all other SensoTouch models  -- Recommended annual blade replacements add significant cost  -- There is no indicator for blade replacement or cleaning  -- The battery indicator includes 2 stages instead of the 5 on the 1250  -- The battery is not user-replaceable and will limit the unit&#x27;s life  -- Does not include the jet cleaning system  -- The soft pouch is not as nice as the carrying case included with other models    CONCLUSION     For most users, lower end models like the 7310 will work sufficiently well.

            <li> My first electric shaver was a corded Norelco 2-head razor, state of the art at the time. Since then, I&#x27;ve bounced back and forth between Norelco, Braun, and whatever the current generation of Gillette happen to be (I&#x27;m fairly sure I have a handle and at least one or two blades for nearly every Gillette model going back to at least the 80&#x27;s).    I liked my last Braun enough to have the internal battery replaced when it died the first time. When the new battery gave out a few years ago, I started looking for a replacement and found a Norelco arcitec 1050 on  sale at Target (shopping hint: the weeks before Father&#x27;s Day are the best time to find a deal on an electric razor).    I thought it would be no problem adapting, but I had painful razor burn and seriously considered taking Norelco up on its money-back guarantee. At this point, I should mention that I&#x27;ve had a beard much of my adult life and so usually shave only my cheeks and my neck, with is both the most sensitive area and the hardest place to get a clean shave with any kind of razor.    I toughed it out with the arcitec 1050 and eventually got used to it. The 1050 still has one annoying drawback: it is difficult to throughly clean. The 1050 is one of the models with flip-out heads which makes it easy to rinse but is not designed for disassembly. The result is that longer whiskers get jammed up inside the heads and no amount of rinsing or compressed air will dislodge them. The only way I found to do it was sitting at my desk with a bright light and using a set of picks tiny enough to fit between the individual blades and un-clump the whiskers.    Naturally, I was curious to see if the Philips Norelco 1150x/40 SensoTouch had any improvements.    The head of the 1150 is a completely different design and is an improvement over the 1050 head:    -- The foil is a combination of slots and round holes, instead of just slots. I think I&#x27;m getting a closer shave and it&#x27;s doing a better job of catching longer whiskers (Idon&#x27;t always shave every day - one of the prerogatives of retirement).    -- There are instructions included showing how to completely disassemble the head, if you need to do so.    There was, however, one unpleasant surprise. I had just assumed that, because I had been using the 1050 for several years, the migration to the 1150 would be painless. This was not the case. I experienced razor burn for the first week or ten days (I&#x27;ve made a point of using it every morning until I finish the review). It was not nearly as bad or long-lasting as when I first used the 1050, but annoying nonetheless. I was also surprised by razor burn this morning when I used it wet for the first time (with a shaving gel) after having used it dry a few hours earlier.    I&#x27;m willing to accept that these incidents are a trade off for a perceptibly closer shave and my own experience tells me that my beard growth will adapt. I won&#x27;t be going back to my 1050 and will still be using my Gillette Fusion occasionally. My advice to new users is to make sure you keep your receipt and all of the packing material until the three-week guarantee time has passed.    Electric razors are not for everybody, but they are a great convenience, especially if you don&#x27;t need to get up and shower first thing every morning (another prerogative of retirement). If you&#x27;re looking to try one for the first time or you have one that needs to be replaced, the Philips Norelco 1150x/40 SensoTouch is one of the least expensive ways to give Norelco technology a tryout.</li>
            <li> Electric shavers   ----------------   If you buying an electric shaver for the first time, skip this section and read the next     Electric shavers basically come in 2 types - Rotary (philips norelco) &amp; foil (braun &amp; panasonic)     Rotaries are good for cutting longer hairs let us say you skip to shave over a holiday then start shaving on Monday morning. Foil shavers are faster and easier to adapt to, since they are very much like your gilette razors, but there are a few downsides - foils are difficult to clean since the hair gets trapped in the inner chamber and foil shavers give you more burn compared to rotary blades.     This is a rotary shaver     About Philips 1150x/40   -------------------------   This is an excellent shaver for this price level, it is rechargeable, comes with battery power display and can be used with/without shaving cream, but I would recommend using some kind of a moisturizer to stop getting razor burns.    Overall, it is pretty effective, quiet, battery lasts more than a week and pretty good around the neck</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve cut back on shaving my face (ha ha ha), I decided to let my husband review this one for me and he absolutely loves it.  Here&#x27;s his thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great handle, nice contouring.  Smooth, close shave and the battery has lasted a long time... so far!  Look is very sleek and the blue color is a nice change from the standard silver or black on his past models!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A definite!</li>
            <li> very easy to use and gives a close comfortable shave. only drawback is having to change heads to trim. all in all a good shaver and a good value.</li>
            <li> I recently replaced my older Norelco with a foil shaver. It was a bad investment, as, over the 4-5  months I owned it, the shaving result was less close than the old Norelco. At the end, the foil began to shred, and I gave up on it. I bought a new Norelco 1150X and have had it for 3 months now. It shaves better than the old one and is not comparable to the foil bladed one. Why did I ever leave the fold. I agree that it&#x27;s not a blade, but it&#x27;s close enough, and I get a clean shave in about 45 seconds.  Now many months later, I still love this razor. I&#x27;ve replaced the blades once in the time I&#x27;ve had it...not because they needed it necessarily, but because I thought maybe it was time. The blades last for a long time. The battery is excellent. I charge it every couple of weeks whether it needs it or not.   Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a Norelco electric shaver since I was a teenager in the 1970s. Poor shave, bumps, and rash was the experience at that time. Now three decades later, I try the new Norelco SensoTouch Electric and I have to say with a lot of shaving a wetting the beard you can get rid of a lot of beard, enough to use if you don&#x27;t have a razor but the shave won&#x27;t be as close. Also, if you really want to do a thorough job, I find that it&#x27;s actually quicker to use a razor. But for convenience, rechargeable battery, fit and finish, and light weight, this Norelco has a lot of appealing features. For emergencies, this is a fine product, but don&#x27;t expect it to replace your daily razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered that the Norelco does things my razor doesn&#x27;t: It can get hard-to-get hairs around nostrils and unsightly ear hairs, so I&#x27;ve definitely found a good use for my Norelco.</li>
            <li> This Phillips SensoTouch replaced an older corded electric that I had been using.  I wasn&#x27;t too sure about the charging aspect when I first unpacked and set up my new razor.  The charging base that it sits in didn&#x27;t seem to be of the best construction.  I guess only time will tell if that proves to be the case.  That said, the razor sits down into the base pretty well and charges using contacts at the sides and bottom.    As a day to day razor its actually quite nice.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks now and its very thorough.  It does a good job cutting the hairs along the jaw, above the lip, and under the neck.  I find it to be both comfortable and quiet.  It may have been a symptom of my aging razor, but the old one made quite the hum as it went about its business, and I was pleasantly surprised by the SensoTouch.  I really haven&#x27;t had a need to pop off the daily head, so I can&#x27;t comment about the transition to the trimming attachment.  It appears as though others have addressed this aspect, and I will entrust you to their reviews.  All in all, I think this rechargeable Philips Norelco razor is a good daily shaver and I&#x27;m looking forward to continued use.</li>
            <li> UPDATE Feb 2012&lt;br /&gt;The battery of the 8251XL proved to be okay. I still get a comfortable and quiet shave, and the shave is still close enough even with year-old shaving head blades. Fine shaver - five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE Feb 2011&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I continued to be pleased with the shaver&#x27;s performance, the battery died after just three months. Unfortunately, it was slightly beyond the time period when it could be returned or exchanged where I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;I replaced it with another Norelco - the 8251XL (not available at the moment on Amazon). This seems to be more robust, gives an even better shave and is even quieter, but I&#x27;ll have to see if the battery holds up better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t usually write reviews (except for classical music CDs), and am not a fanatic about shaving. However, this shaver is so good that I felt compelled to write this. I&#x27;ve always owned Norelco&#x27;s. I tried a Panasonic once, and yes it&#x27;s a little closer shave. But so noisy. And just how close does a shave need to be anyway? The 1150X gives a plenty close shave, smoothly and very comfortably glides over the skin with no irritation whatsoever, and is simple to clean with a quick rinse under the tap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, it&#x27;s whisper quiet, which makes a big difference early in the morning, so different from foil shavers which are so noisy that it seems like shaving with a hedge trimmer. Who needs that racket early in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing - older Norelco&#x27;s plugged in directly for recharging, but this model comes with a charger stand. Sure, that&#x27;s one more thing to pack when traveling. But it also means that the shaver is lighter, because the charging mechanism is in the stand, not the shaver. It also allows for a more streamlined, ergonomic, and comfortable-to-hold shaver, compared with older models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All told, the 1150X is an execllent shaver. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is just an \\&quot;ok\\&quot; razor.   I had a Braun 5 series before this which worked much better.   I&#x27;ve had the Norelco for about 3 weeks and it is getting a little better the longer I have it, but still need to work at cutting some hairs.   Love the extra trimmer attachment which works great.</li>
            <li> Nothing to write home about. Just another shaver that doesn&#x27;t do the job easily. You have to pass it over the same area several times.    If anything, a little worse than other Norelcos because it&#x27;s harder to clean the heads.    It actually leaves pieces of stubble a quarter inch long which you have to remove with tweezers.    Recommended for teenagers with a hint of stubble on their cheeks, but not for men who need a real shaver.    Save your money. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> It shaves my face very close and no pulling of the beard like my Remington rotary electric does!Admittedly the Remington cost $35.00 and the Norelco $100.00  So maybe its not a fair comparison, but i really like the new Norelco better than any others I have tried over the years and would recomend spending the extra money for a quality shave!  B.R. Bell-Mt City,Tn.</li>
            <li> As a very long-time Norelco/Philips user I am pleased to say this new model is the best electric shaver I have used yet. As some reviewers have already stated, the first thing you notice is it is very quiet. It also charges very quickly and holds that charge for well over a week. It does a great job on the neck area, and is the first electric shaver I can say this about. A good shave is easy to get in a short amount of time. Only down side I would say is the trimmer isn&#x27;t as powerful as I would like, takes several cuts and still not a very clean trim. To those who compare any electric to a blade - is this shaver as good as a sharp blade ? No, but, then again, NO electric razor ever is. However, is this razor as good as any other electric I have tried ?  Yes, and for those times when a non-blade shave will do this is an excellent shaver.</li>
            <li> perfect. I left this comment after 5 years!!</li>
            <li> I had used the base model 3 head Norelco electric shaver for years. I always ended up with that stinging after shave feeling. When I saw this online and found out you could use a shave cream with it, I figured spending a little bit more would be worth it, and boy was I right! The \\&quot;aquatec\\&quot; feature alone is enough to make this razor worth it. My skin feels great after a wet shave with some cream and this bad boy! Not to mention I haven&#x27;t had to charge it again yet and I&#x27;ve had it for a month! All in all a great purchase.</li>
            <li> I now have 2 of them. One for home and one for my truck.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> They are cheater, seller didn&#x27;t give us rebate as they promised.</li>
            <li> My husband is very satisfied with the Norelco 1150/40.   He gets a close, smooth shave.  I can attest to that !</li>
            <li> My husband has used the philips norelco shavers for years and when he decided to get a new style he ordered the 1150x/40 Senso Touch (he gave his previous one to our grandson who loves it)  He says the closeness of the shave is wonderful and he wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to continue buying the Philips shavers.  Amazons price and shipping as usual was outstanding.</li>
            <li> My husband said the electric razor does a good job.  Only drawback is the recharging stand is a bit flimsy.  You have to have it set in just right for it to make the connections &amp; be careful not to bump it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll state the obvious and then explain.. IT IS AN ELECTRIC RAZOR! NOT A FIXED BLADE!  People buy Electric shavers and expect it to cook dinner too!  Well this shaver won&#x27;t conduct a cookout or wash your back in the shower, but it still does a real good job at shaving!  I am in the U.S. Army and I shave every day. So, to keep up with military appearance, I feel that this shaver does and excellent job!  I am yet to find any shaver that gets as close as a fixed blade and won&#x27;t ever expect to either.  However, this shaver gets pretty darn close! Also, as a little note to those inexperienced with electric shavers, your skin has to get used to the fact that you have changed from a fix blade to an electric shaver.  That will take about 1-2 weeks.  Also, it is best if you wait approx. 15-20 mins. after you wake-up and are walking about to decide to shave.  This is because your face is slightly swollen when you get up from sleeping. (Not going into why, just believe me)  In closing, if you are interested in buying an electric razor for about 100 bucks, this is the one!  OH! AND IT&#x27;S GOT AN AWESOME DESIGN! It is comfortable to use and I especially like the stand-up charger!</li>
            <li> Good!!!!!Like it~~~~~</li>
            <li> An 1 hour charge and lot of time shaving, adjustable to the face, easy to clean and great price. Don&#x27;t forget to register in Phillip&#x27;s web page it gives to you an extra year of warranty.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and am very pleased with the comfortable shave that I get with the Metallic Blue Shaver.  My only complaint is that the manual is unclear in describing how to remove the heads to clean them. This shaver is unlike any other Norelco shaver that I have owned  and it took a while to understand how to remove the shaving heads for cleaning.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Panasonic ES8103S and the Norelco 1150x at the same time and this review is a comparison of these 2 shavers side-by-side.  I used both shavers for 3 weeks, shaving one side of my face with the Panasonic and the other side of my face with the Norelco.  I didn&#x27;t switch sides during the test to allow time to adapt to each shaver.  Both of these shavers rated nearly the same amongst other Amazon reviewers and were the top-2 rated shavers under $100.  I evaluated both shavers on a number of criteria:    -- Shaving Performance:  I found that both shavers did a relatively good job overall.  However, the Panasonic performed slightly better on the flat cheek areas whereas the Norelco did slightly better on the curved areas around the jaw bone and neck.  I found that the shavers required different shaving techniques.  The Panasonic, being a foil shaver, required an up-and-down or side-to-side motion whereas the Norelco, being a rotary shaver, required a circular motion.  No matter how I shaved with the Norelco I could not get quite as close as the Panasonic.  After some time I did find a technique with the Panasonic that allowed me to shave my neck and jaw bone area as close as the Norelco.  I tried shaving both wet &amp; dry and found no difference. I almost always shave dry and I found the Norelco didn&#x27;t move as smoothly across the skin as the Panasonic.  Overall, I give the edge to Panasonic for a better overall shave.    -- Return Guarantee:  The Panasonic has a 30-day return policy, the Norelco is 45 days.  I actually purchased the shavers from Target and they offer a 90-day return policy.    -- Warranty:  The Panasonic has a 1 yr warranty, Norelco is 2 years.    -- Cutter Replacement:  both shavers recommend replacing the cutters at specific intervals.  Panasonic recommends replacing the foil every year ($24) and the blade every 2 years ($17).  Norelco has only one replaceable part which they recommend you replace every year ($39).  If you look at the cost over 3 years, the Panasonic would cost $65 whereas the Norelco would cost $117 which exceeds the original cost of the shaver ($100).    -- Charging:  The Panasonic has an A/C adapter that can be plugged directly into the shaver and the shaver can be used with the cord attached.  The Norelco can only be charged in the included charging cradle.  If the battery in the Norelco goes dead you&#x27;ll need to recharge it before you can use it.  Also, the Panasonic has a digital LCD battery gauge whereas the Norelco simply uses LEDs.    -- Cleaning:  Both shavers can be rinsed under water for simple cleaning.  I found the Norelco shaving head somewhat difficult to remove whereas the Panasonic foil was very easy to remove/replace.    -- Price:  Both shavers sell for under $100.  Best price I found on the Panasonic was $80 @ Target.  I saw the Norelco for $90 @ WalMart.    -- Other:  The Panasonic has a built-in trimmer, the Norelco requires that you remove the shaving head and pop on the trimmer head.  The Panasonic includes a carrying case, the Norelco does not.    In summary, the Panasonic rated higher than the Norelco in all areas with the exception of the warranty.  My only real complaint with the Panasonic would be the noise.  It is much louder than the Norelco but not so much so that I would return it.  Based on my experience, I will be returning the Norelco and keeping the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I had a Norelco wet dry shaver that I had bought in the early 90&#x27;s.  I had a beard for many years but took a position in sales that required a clean-cut look.  I was fairly satisfied with it but ended up growing my beard back and only periodically using it.  Late in 2010 I decided it was time to shave my beard and the shaver had become dull and the battery couldn&#x27;t hold the charge.  I investigated the new shavers and watched the corporate video for this one.  I decided to give it a shot and am very pleased with the results.  It is very smooth and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  If I&#x27;m in a hurry I just use it \\&quot;Dry\\&quot; with some &#x27;Lectric Shave lotion, but when I have a little more time in the morning I use it with Edge gel and that is really the best combination.  The battery holds a charge for a long time too.    The only reason I won&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I still need to sometimes \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; with a razor - I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s an electric out there that deserves 5.</li>
            <li> I bought a new Panasonic ES-GA-21S razor in October 2010 and regretted it.  Too noisy.  I&#x27;ve had this Phillips razor for a month and I love it.  It&#x27;s quieter, more comfortable, smooth on the face and does a good job on neck hair.  Some reviewers did not like the snap-on trimmer but it&#x27;s easy to switch heads and the trimmer works great.  Love it.&lt;br /&gt;July 2013 update.  This is a great razor.  Holds a charge for about 3 weeks so no need to take the charger on trips.  Easy to clean, comfortable, close shave.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband and he says it is the best electric shaver he has ever had. It is easy to clean and does a great job shaving.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver for almost 1 month, like it very much, very good-looking outsides, comfortably. But A little defective, outsides doesn&#x27;t match completely, don&#x27;t know what cause this issue, i try to fix it by myself, work normal. In general, it&#x27;s a nice deal.</li>
            <li> I had seen this type of razor before. Several people I know have one. They all said it was great. I had used several Norelco razors and like each one. I try this model and really liked it. Great shaves. The only thing is the sideburn trimmer is a little awkward to use. Good purchase for the money.</li>
            <li> This is a good razor from Norelco, I have been using their razors for many, many years. I love the 3 head design and the way it pivots, plus the blue is pretty sharp. Battery life could be a little longer, but I might just take long shaves.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after watched a famous website&#x27;s suggestion. I bought it online and found it is quite and worthy.</li>
            <li> i bought 4 Philips Norelco SensoTouch 3D when the price list in amazon,com is $72.97($82.97, REBATE $10 off ),but they only REBATE me $10 for my four Philips Norelco SensoTouches. How can i do? I think it is unfair for my family and they should retrun $40 check instead of $10 for my purchased four items?</li>
            <li> I needed a new shaver and I read several reviews of this one that said it gave a smooth shave and was good for getting those pesky neck hairs.&lt;br /&gt;The shaving process itself feels smooth, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my face as much as my old one, but it also doesn&#x27;t shave as closely.  The user manual says to give my face three weeks to get used to it, and the shave has gotten slightly closer/smoother... but it&#x27;s still not great at getting the neck hairs.  Also, a quick shave cleans up the stubble, but if I don&#x27;t use extra time (and effort/pressure), the stubble&#x27;s back by early afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really speak to the effectiveness of the trimmer, as three days&#x27; growth isn&#x27;t enough for it to really make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I tried using it in the shower, but didn&#x27;t really have a good experience.  The shave didn&#x27;t come out as smooth as when I use it dry, but I might have been doing something wrong.  Possibly you&#x27;re supposed to use shaving cream if you do that (which I didn&#x27;t) but I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s pretty good.  Better than my old one, which wasn&#x27;t bad either, which is why I&#x27;m giving it four stars.</li>
            <li> I like it because it&#x27;s very good and the price is also good. Now I use it every day. ha!</li>
            <li> Though in the package I can  not  find the trimmer and the adapter,but the customer Service sned me 20% refund to buy it locally or search for it on amazon.The shaver is very comfotable to use.</li>
            <li> This thing is absolutely fantastic! I&#x27;ve been shaving and waxing my legs for a few years (never you mind how many!) and I have always been disappointed by the not-close-enough job done by electric razors, so I always resort to the disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor seems to get very, very close without even the benefit of soap or shaving cream, which is really nice!&lt;br /&gt;I originally got this for my hubby, who has a norelco smart touch XL, which he likes very much, but I don&#x27;t find that it gives me as nice a shave as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when holding the two side by side, I have to agree that if I dropped this razor, the small pivoting head part makes me nervous in that it looks so fragile it might break...the XL is more solidly built, but gives less of a close shave, I think (though, the scientist in me wants to conduct an experiment doing both legs, equal amount of passes with each razor to be truely unbiased...heh)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, I&#x27;d have to say this is a fantastic item, and the only minor flaw I see is my own worry that if I dropped it, the small pivoting head, should it land just right, would be damaged...and I&#x27;m fairly butter-fingered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t hold my own butter-fingeredness against the product design, until such a time as I do drop it and it does break...I&#x27;m just looking down the road at a possible flaw, and thought I&#x27;d mention it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The indicator lights are great, so you know how long of a charge you&#x27;ve got left.&lt;br /&gt;This would make a great gift for a new shaver, long time shaver, male of female, in my opinion!</li>
            <li> My husband, in his 60s, was complaining that shaving was getting harder as his skin ages. More cuts; more discomfort.  I purchased this Norelco for his birthday and he is a happy man. He shaves first thing in the morning with no pain. Nice and smooth too.  Philips Norelco 1150x/40 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver, Metallic Blue</li>
            <li> Bought this for my dad, he loves it! It works great and there&#x27;s no problems. It&#x27;s a great value compare to other more expansive Philips.</li>
            <li> I got this new, great looking, 1050x 2 days ago and have used it only once. Nevertheless, I was impressed with how well it shaved. I used  Edge shaving gel with the razor. I use the gel for two reasons. One to prevent razor burn and two, to lubricate and extend the blade life.&lt;br /&gt;  I could hear the razor cutting those tough little neck hairs that were always so hard to get with my old razor. Before this razor, the only way I could be sure to get my neck clean was with a manual safety razor.&lt;br /&gt; After the shave the razor was easy to clean and reassemble. I have had over 10 Norelco shavers during  my lifetime and this razor has given me the closest shave yet.&lt;br /&gt; At this price this a great razor. I recommend it.(no I don&#x27;t work for Norelco). My only minor complaint is I wish a travel case had come with the razor.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor after having other Norelco razors and found it did a better job of shaving,(closer shave) than others I have bought.</li>
            <li> I have been a Norelco user for the past 15 years and have always  been satisfied with their shavers.My initial reaction is that the 6100 outperforms all  that I have previously used. It gives a smooth and comfortable shave, is easy to use and a good value. The only drawback is in the utilization of the separate trimer, I am sure that I will eventually it will be lost during trips.</li>
            <li> I used this for about three weeks straight before I was in a hurry one morning and I simply had to grab the razor. This device gives me a nice shave but it is soooooooooooooo slow. I am going to keep using it because the instructions say that it improves over time as your skin gets used to it. I will post back here if it improves but for now I&#x27;m having to go over the same spot at least three times to get the last stray whiskers.</li>
            <li> I love it this item!!!   Because this item is a good price! and a good quality!    Thank you very much!!!  Have a great day!</li>
            <li> I tried a norelco once about 10 years ago that I received as a Christmas gift. I forget the model, but it would leave stray hairs here and there and would give me tons of irritation as I have kind of a thick beard and sensitive skin. Over the past few months I figured that electric razors have to be much better now days. I did some research and was undecided between a braun and the norelco. I bought this model and a braun 3 series the same day to see which I like better. I had a thick, 4 day beard and dry shaved each side of my face with both. The braun gave me irritation almost instantly, left stray hairs, and I have not used it since. I will be returning it. The norelco was much more comfortable but left stray hairs as well. The next morning, I used the norelco again with shaving cream and eliminated all the stray hairs. My shaves did get better the more I used the norelco but I attribute that to me learning how to use it more than my face getting used to it. I am very happy with this shaver. I would like to share my technique that gives me the best results. I shower twice a day and I shave twice a day in the shower with cream. Use a light circular motion and rinse the shaver frequently. This razor does not do well with longer hairs but if you keep up with shaving it will cut right through with zero irritation. If you miss a day or two, expect to shave with cream twice to get it close again. I dont think it is quicker or closer than a blade, but It is much more comfortable and does not irritate my skin at all. The shave is close enough to get through a work day with no problem. I assume that the 3D will shave quicker because it has more blades but I dont buy into the cleaning systems because this one washes easily under the faucet once you remove the cutters. Overall, I am happy with this norelco and would recommend it. You just have to change your shaving habits a bit to get the best results. I only gave it 4 stars because it is not better than a blade, it&#x27;s justa more comfortable alternative.</li>
            <li> i ordered the shaver at the price of $79.97 on November, up till now,  i have not received the cash back. Besides, one week later after my order, the price was down to $49.97 with additional $30 cash back. i will never buy philips&#x27;s shaver.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product. Bought on Nov, it is good and convinent. Love it so much. The product is powerful. I bought it for a new razor. Because the last one was almost 2 years old.</li>
            <li> i got this shaver at a great price, although the online forum (deal of the day at amazon) made me belive that i would get another $30- off, but i did not!!  the shaver arrived after some time, and does a great job.  however its been 20-25 days since i started using it and already see that its not doing as great a job when i first bought it. also the finish on this thing makes it appear more as a toy than a piece of equipment that real men would like to use!  i am reading the return policy on this one...</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift and He loves it , great price , norelco has always been a grat product and this new razor was  no exception  Same great product</li>
            <li> We are happy with this item. It works well, and the most important we purchased during thanksgiving, there are $30 rebate from amazon and $30 from phiplips too. Even though I have not received the rebate yet. It&#x27;s really a good deal</li>
            <li> This was purchased for me as a Christmas present. I have been using older models of Norelco for 15 years, all with excellent success.  The newer model 1150X is the entry level product for the SensoTouch line.  This shave is terrific, provided an extremely close shave the veru first time.. Quick charge, and has a nice comfortable feel in my hand.  Light, but plenty of cutting ability.   I was ALSO able to apply for a $30 SensoTouch rebate, still waiting for the rebate check from Norelco, hope they make goon on that offer.    I have not tried to WET shave with it, but it does have that capability as well.  I end up shaving at traffic lights, on the way to work in the morning.  This shaver gets my face smooth in only 2 traffic lights.      Overall, an excellent shaver, comfortable sooth shave, sleek design lines.  Only disadvantage that this line of shavers must be recharged in the stand-up recharger.  It has been more convenient in the past to plug in the old Norelco&#x27;s   using the power cord, and let it charge overnight. Very happy for the price paid, less than $90 on the internet, and if the $30 rebate comes, that makes it an even better bargain.</li>
            <li> I purchase it at price $49, Very good for the price! Also the produce is excellent, you will never regret!</li>
            <li> This thing just works and for twenty bucks after rebate, you can&#x27;t complain much. Havent tried it wet yet, but no complaint just regular shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several electric razors before but this razor is by far the best. The closest shave I have got using an electric razor by far. I really enjoy having the ability to use it in the shower which is where I usually shave. Still maintains a close and smooth shave. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Muy suave y delicada con la piel, corta muy bien y se adapta al contorno de la cara.&lt;br /&gt;Lo mejor es que es (Made in Netherlans), no m&amp;aacute;s chinos de porqur&amp;iacute;a.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few 3-head rotary razors over the past few years, and for the most part, they do okay.  I never have liked shaving with a blade, because doing so seems to irritate my skin, no matter what I do.  This razor replaced a Remington that wasn&#x27;t that old, but it was an inexpensive model and was wearing out fairly early, in my opinion.  I bought this one because of the updated design, and I thought the price was reasonable.  The high end for Norelco seems to top out around $200, but I&#x27;m not willing to spend that on a razor...sorry, Norelco.  CONS  My experience with this razor is that it doesn&#x27;t really shave that close without spending quite a bit of time.  And if I skip a day or two, the experience is worse.  My facial hair doesn&#x27;t really grow THAT fast, statistically speaking...it takes me a day or two to develop a \\&quot;5-o&#x27;clock shadow.\\&quot;  So I wonder how guys whose hair grows out faster are satisfied with the product.  Note that I also shave my head with this razor, and again, it does okay, but not great.  I have one gripe with a design issue...there is no way to plug the charger directly into the razor.  If you happen to run out of charge, you have to put it in its stand to charge.  My experience is that a charge lasts about two weeks.  What if you go out of town for, say, 3 weeks??  It appears that you have to take the charging base with you in that case.  I like the charging base, and I like the way the razor slips into it, but I don&#x27;t believe the base is stout enough structurally to survive travel in a suitcase.  PROS  At around $80, the price is right.  Like I said, I&#x27;m not willing to spend much more than $100 on a razor.  Then again, maybe the more expensive models shave better???  I LOVE that the unit can be cleaned under running water.  The heads pop off easily for cleaning.  I&#x27;ve had a Remington that had a self-cleaning base, but you had to buy special cleaning fluid and filters, and cleanup was a pain.  And the electrodes that ensured you had enough cleaning fluid corroded after 18 months and the unit ceased to function.  I note that the more expensive Norelco models have a cleaning base....not interested.  The battery life is much better than my previous razor.  Even new, that one&#x27;s battery only lasted 3 or 4 shaves.  This one is lasting a couple weeks.  The design of the charging stand is elegant, and the razor slips in and out easily.  But like I said, it would be good to be able to plug in directly and not have to carry the stand when doing extended travel.  So....the design is nice, but the lack of a close shave and the lack of a direct plug to charge takes off two stars.  I&#x27;m usually pretty generous here with stars, but I expect more from a company like Norelco, so maybe I&#x27;m being a touch harsh.  I just want a clean, close shave without having to spend 15 minutes at it.</li>
            <li> Thank you for such a quality product. My husband was pleased, enjoyed for about 5 months, very clean shave, charging enough for a few weeks, despite the fact that my husband shave every other day. I advise everyone without hesitation.</li>
            <li> It is a very nice shaver. Its shape is very smooth and magic. Its color and picture are very beautiful.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent Shaver. Easy to operate and smoth. Battery life is good and easy to clean. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I wanted a high-quality electric razor.  I don&#x27;t like using a regular razor because they irritate my skin.  For some reason, electric shavers don&#x27;t do that.  At the same time, however, I&#x27;ve never been pleased with electric razors.  That said, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.  It shaves very clean everywhere except for my jawline--really just under my jaw/upper neck area. It isn&#x27;t bad enough that I feel like I need to touch it up with a \\&quot;real\\&quot; razor.  Besides, the attachment does a pretty good job doing touch up work.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy shaving with this razor    ITS VERY SMOOTH ON YOUR SKIN AND A BREEZE TO CLEAN</li>
            <li> not only does this have a nice design to it but it also works very well --- i have had this for months and it is still working as if it were the first day --- i have not even thought of changing the blades yet...</li>
            <li> gift for my papa, hope he likes it</li>
            <li> Shaves beautifully but is very plastic like compared with old world shavers.  Was pointless to register for extra warranty as would not recognize overseas purchases yet we are consumers too!</li>
            <li> I appliciate it. that is the good thing I have get it...  it is sharp and very comfort for ..</li>
            <li> Great shaver fantastic price, I couldn&#x27;t have  asked for a closer shave. It was just over the cost for a new head so very cheap, very quick charging too</li>
            <li> Not perfect but still a good shaver. Feel clean and soft when shaving. Haven&#x27;t got a chance to use wet.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for from an electric shaver.  The battery life is fantastic, its easy to use and shaves close and very smooth, it contours nicely to your face.  Easy to take apart and clean.  Best shaver I&#x27;ve owned, no complaints at all.</li>
            <li> Bought this when Amazon had a $30 coupon. Also there was advertised a $30 dollar rebate. Just found out that the $30 was the one and only discount and the rebate is void. this was never mentioned on Amazon.com and from what I can see on the net this was a Phillips practice to let people believe they were also going to get the rebate. I would not have bought this shaver having known this. Now I will not buy any Phillips products.&lt;br /&gt;Actually the shaver is great and does a great job but I feel deceived by both Amazon and Phillips about the rebate. Why was the rebate sent with the product? It does say on the rebate form that it was not to be used with other discounts. I take that meant that if I got $5 off the msrp then the rebate would have been void. That is like a car company offering a thousand dollar rebate and after signing the papers they say that since the dealer gave me $500 off,I wouldn&#x27;t be getting the rebate. Who pays msrp? So how many customers are going to be angry when they start learning that they were deceived. I buy a lot of stuff and when a company says that you are allowed only one discount you figure that it means one of theirs but once again it was not stated that the coupon was a Phillips coupon and that took the place of the rebate. A lot of web sites were touting the $19.99 shaver deal....still can see it on the web. Therefore someone was playing with the consumer. No more Phillips for me...when I use all my sonic brush heads up, I will find another tooth brush etc.</li>
            <li> I bought it with 49.99 dollars. but it took more than 15 days to ship it.  However, it&#x27;s great shaver. I love it.</li>
            <li> I think this is the best looking razor on the market!  I bought it to replace a two-head Norelco that I had for years and I like the slim shaving head as it is not too much bigger than the two-head.  This razor is also easy to clean.    It does not seem to be very powerful, but appears to be enough for a good shave.  I also do not care for the charging stand.  It would be better if it had another option for charging (i.e. a side plug in) also because I travel a lot and would like just a charger to use for those trips.</li>
            <li> I got two for my friends. It looks very professional and cool. Hope they would like it. Actually I would recommend Norelo 7310XL as well, which I got for my father. He likes it a lot and said it&#x27;s very easy to use and cleans well.</li>
            <li> I bought two of this as Xmas gift to my father and brother.they both like it.it has very good design and functions!</li>
            <li> Rebate was denied by Philips for applying coupon from Amazon, not Philips. Philips CSR was rude and refused to listen and disconnected the line. Will never touch Philips rebate!</li>
            <li> Great close shave, the head adjust to the curve of the face.  One of the closest shaves I have had in a long while.  The battery holds a charge for a long time as well.  Very nice product.  So glad I own this</li>
            <li> My old Norelco died and I went online to find a replacement.  A discount offer popedup while considering this so I ordered it.  I provided a good shave; is easy to handle and holds a charge well.  Also, charing only takes about an hour.  I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric razors of all types for 40 years. This razor is the best one I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Before I give my review, let me just say, I have tried all kinds of electric shavers, cheap ones, moderate ones, and expensive ones. For the last few years I have been using a Phillips Norelco shaver.  It worked great, it lasted a long time and I never needed to replace the blades.  Eventually, after years of use, it stopped working so I was in the market for a new shaver.  I purchased a Braun shaver (priced over $200) and I was NOT happy at all with it.  It did not get a close shave, it hurt, it was crap.  I then knew I wanted to purchase another Phillips Norelco shaver because of how pleased I was with my previous model.  The question was, do I get the Sensotouch 2D or Sensotouch 3D?  I decided on the Sensotouch 2D and here is why.  The 3D model, as explained by the name 3D, has blades that move in 3 different directions.  The 2D model, of course, moves in 2 directions.  After careful review of both models, I purchased the 2D model.  My rating, 5 out of 5 stars.  The 2D model has a very VERY close shave, it is very comfortable, and it is made with very good quality.  I am extremely satisfied with the 2D model and would recommed this shaver to anyone!  I would only recommed getting the 3D shaver if you need all the extras that come with it.  The 2D gives such a close, smoothe shave that I would say the 3D model would just be excessive.  Thank you Amazon for having such a great price for the shaver and thank you to Phillips Norelco for making such a great product!</li>
            <li> I shave my face and head everyday. I have done this for MANY years. If you look back at some of my previous reviews, you&#x27;ll see I&#x27;ve tried most things out there for shaving. Just off the top of my head I have used Atra, Sensor, Tracer, Headblade, Mach 3 , Proglide, Hydro5 and yes even Bic and \\&quot;Good News\\&quot; razors. I have also used Braun, Norelco and Panasonic electrics. One can get a pretty good shave out of most items out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use a blade during the winter months and an electric during the summer months....no real reason other than I like variety, and in the summer I water my lawn so I don&#x27;t want to use as much water in the shower or shaving.  We can make electricty, but we can&#x27;t make more water. :-). When I am in blade shave mode the Schick Hydro5 is my tool of choice, best blade hands down for me, however this new  Norelco 1150x/40 is going to have me using it more than I ever thought possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just so you know, I have used the following electric razors:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco 4401LC, 7145XL--Overall I am a Norelco fan.  They work well for my daily routine and work fast. My 4401LC is a 20 yr old corded model that still does a very nice job/close shave, with HQ4 heads, but I have to be gentle or I&#x27;ll get razor burn on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic EA-SA40, ES7037 and ES 7103---Panny makes really, really nice razors. Great wet/dry use. With the amount/type of surface area I have to cover, the rotary seems to be a better fit for my shaving routine.  The newer Panasonic do have larger cutting surfaces that I may have to try someday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun Syncho5, 1-150-----Braun just DOES NOT work for my beard and head. Gives me the worst shave ever. Missed hairs everywhere, cheeks, neck, razor burn, you name it. I will never buy another Braun. These two shavers could not handle a stoud beard or the \\&quot;workload\\&quot; a heavy shaver like me demands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI--I also brush out my shaving heads every week no matter what shaver I use. It makes the heads last much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like electric shavers because they don&#x27;t cause bumps at the base of the back of my neck like blade shaving does. I also like to shave on the go.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer a wet/dry razor because just being able to rinse it out everyday is my preferred (and most cost effective) cleaning method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so I get my new 1150. First impression was, oh wow it looks amazing!!!!! 100% wow factor there. The base is fantastic, I love it! No tossing this razor in a drawer or cabinet. Having a lithium battery is a big plus as well! AND MADE IN THE NETHERLANDS, not China!  COOL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Um wait a minute, the Series 8 heads look JUST LIKE my 7145XL! Is this really an upgrade? Also, the head base seems to flex the same as my 7145...heck this may not be much of a difference of a shave.  Well, wait, now the 1150x has this new neck pivot device. Hmmmm.  This razor was charged when it arrived and I had some stubble so, HERE IS THE IMPORTANT PART-- I gave it a test run. For some reason with my beard, I only get average results with a dry shave and this razor was no different. RIght side of face, dry shave eh, okay....but my preshave of choice is Afta Pre-Electric (better than Lectric Shave or Face-Saver for me), and on the left side of my face with the Afta...WOW, nano-near as close as a blade!!!!!  So put some Afta on my scalp...holy moley, this 1150 contours my scalp/and head like no other razor or blade I have ever used!!!  SO CLOSE and SO COMFORTABLE! Also ZERO razor burn on my neck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter how soft or how hard you push, I did not get burn, the \\&quot;cushion\\&quot; in the floating heads adjusted for a great shave over all surfaces!  After using this shaver, I then took a blade and went over the same spots to see if I could get any closer.....not really.  Using the circular pattern (with and against the grain) with this or any Norelco shaver really gives on a close shave. I have used the 1150x for a while, my shave time is getting less and less, and it is very apparent, this is a big step up in comfort and overall shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---September 2011....I see some folks have gotten this razor for @ $50!!!  What a deal on a great razor. This razor is still performing very well. I use it mainly on my face but have also used it on my head.  I found that on my face, using Afta preshave makes a nice shave even better.  Lectric shave also works very very well.  I tried the Remington shave stick which produced a really nice shave, but gosh the residual powder gummed up the razor.  I have to say this is still the best electric I have ever used.  Close shave,no neck irritation which has always been a big issue for me with other products. I clean the heads by taking it apart and just running the heads under water. They are still sharp and performing well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--- Dec 2014 No other electric I have ever owned is as smooth as this, but my current fave electric shaver is the Remongton F5. 5800.s, and it is very apparent, this is a big step up in comfort and overall shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---September 2011....I see some folks have gotten this razor for @ $50!!!  What a deal on a great razor. This razor is still performing very well. I use it mainly on my face but have also used it on my head.

            <li> It just doesnt do its job,,,need to use razor on top of it for a uniform shave. I would say its not powerful enough,, blades turn slower than a $20 norelco.</li>
            <li> I like it, I bought it to give my father to congratulate him on his 60th birthday, he received very happy.</li>
            <li> I bought it because $30 online and $30 mail-in rebate. I sent all the paper work to the Philips over 2 months, but get nothing back. I would not trust Philips again and I would not buy any philips&#x27; stuff.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t count on you will get your rebate if you are buying this because it is cheap after the rebate</li>
            <li> I have not been sent a rebate as stated by Amazon and Norelco.  The shaver would have been worth the $20, but not worth it without the rebate being honored as stated.  Is this a common problem with this purchase?</li>
            <li> No wonder they ran the promotion the end of last year to make it $20. It not even worths the $20.</li>
            <li> I bought it just because of $30 mail-in rebate. I sent all the paper work to the Philips and learnt recently that the rebate is not going to be honored due to the discount taken by Amazon at the cash register.&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed as neither Amazon nor Philips warn about this rebate trap. I certainly would not have purchased this if I knew I would not receive the full mail-in rebate.&lt;br /&gt;I will not trust Philips again and I will not buy anying from Philips.</li>
            <li> I first started with a Norelco razor when i was 17. Iam now 57 and have used Norelco razors the whole time. This razor is by far the best. It floats through my face without having to go over and over. I highly recommend this razor</li>
            <li> muy bueno.. very good buena compra sin ningun problema tod muy bien lo recomiendo a todo el que la quiera comprar</li>
            <li> Shaver works fine i needed it for one hand shaving because i had surgery on my right hand it worked for this and shaved close enough though not as close as a blade.They advertised $30.00 rebate that i never received i would not have bought it for full price.</li>
            <li> I liked the shaver and it performs well.I applied for $30.rebate that was advertised .Recieved  letter from company refusing it for it didnot apply to the product which I thought was very odd.jay</li>
            <li> The shaving blades fall out of the head they are attached to.  I did a good job but who wants to keep putting the shaving blades back in their holder.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as I was fed up about replacing the Gillette razor every month. Read the review here and thought it will be good. Started using the shaver after reviewing the video on Phillips site. The first time I shaved, the shaver left crease marks on my neck all over. I thought it could be due to the first shave..Did not use for a week and used the blade. Came back to use the razor and the same thing. Also the shaver lot of hairs around the chin area and I have to press hard to get it clean. In some instances I had to use the shaver 2 times (after using a shave cream both times) and also then go back and use the blade. I stopped using the shaver now. I should have got a Braun or Panasonic. The rebate from Phillips I hear is also not being honored with the discount from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This review is NOT on the performance of the 1150x/40 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver (which is performing well).  I am writing this review to draw attention to the &#x27;Buyer Beware&#x27; Norelco Rebate Offer - which, in my opinion, is deceptive.  I bought the shaver in Nov. 2011 when there was a $30.00 rebate offer from Norelco.  Amazon had dropped the price as a &#x27;daily deal&#x27; to $49.97 that day. Deal finding sites like [...], [...] had picked it up as a great value at a seemingly out of pocket cost of $19.97.  After sending my rebate, I never got ANY acknowledgement from Norelco.  So, I checked rebate status online after ~ 90 days.  There was no on line information.  I talked to the Norelco Rebate Customer Service (agent &amp; a supervisor) in March 2012.  They contended that the qualification for the rebate offer specified &#x27;no other discounts&#x27;.  Since Amazon had a daily deal coupon for $20.00, therefore, the rebate was disqualified.  I argued that (a) Norelco did not send me rebate rejection else I would have returned the product to Amazon, (b) I interpret &#x27;no other discount&#x27; to mean no additional discounts from Norelco towards purchase price, (c) Amazon had the rebate form link on the same page with no rebate disqualification disclaimer about using the daily deal coupon.  They disagreed.  I pointed out that (i) their interpretation is non industry standard, (ii) their rebate disqualification does not explicitly state that even retailer&#x27;s sale/coupon would invalidate the rebate, (iii) they did not notify me of rebate disqualification to allow me to return it back to Amazon.  I argued in vain.  My conclusion of this behavior from Norelco is the following:  (i) The rebate offer is made deliberately misleading - designed to disqualify the rebate based on a loose, &#x27;bait and switch&#x27; wording of the fine print;  (ii) They choose not inform the customer of rebate disqualification - counting on customer forgetfulness and expiration of merchandise return period;  (iii) It is at best an attempt to control customer&#x27;s end purchase price with a third party vendor.  Standard industry rebate programs are typically independent of end use&#x27;s purchase price from a third party vendor.  I called Amazon&#x27;s customer service.  They found this practice non standard.  Amazon&#x27;s Customer Service supervisor offered to provide feedback up the chain of command since it impacts their customers.  I would guess that this rebate practice is by an &#x27;opportunistic&#x27; marketing idea from a &#x27;smart&#x27; US Norelco division to increase next quarter sales by &#x27;any&#x27; means.  OK.  Let me see how Norelco HQ executives react to this &#x27;poop the customer&#x27; antics.</li>
            <li> Bought this razor on cyber Monday for a great deal. They were out of stock at the time of purchase and it wasn&#x27;t expected to come until after Christmas. I was slightly bummed but still happy I was able to get it so cheap. The razor ended up being shipped way earlier than expected and I am now able to give it as a gift for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Bought this razor thinking it would be a close and comfortable shave, but it was no different than my $20 corded philips razor. Ended up making my face and neck break out as well.</li>
            <li> I like it,I fell good when I shaving!!This is the best shaving I have ever use.I hope this will be useful to you.</li>
            <li> This razor works well. I was using an older Norelco for a number of years and this one is definetly much improved. The shave is clean and smooth and I like how much quieter this motor and the razor heads are than the older one. Also, being able to rinse it with water after the shave makes it much easier to keep cleaner than brushing it alone.    I was a little surprised that it does not come with a travel case, but that is not a significant feature for a razor for me. Still satisfied with Norelco electric razors. No reason not to buy this one.</li>
            <li> I got this shaver a few weeks ago to replace a Panasonic Vortex unit.  I have to say, so far, it rocks in every way.  It is super quiet - not even half as loud as the Panasonic.  It is close, and it is quick.  It shaves closely even when I have two days&#x27; growth, which is much more than I could say for the Panasonic. They have some very good deals on this item now - shop around and do a Google search for a rebate.  You won&#x27;t regret buying this item.</li>
            <li> I got it today (dec 20, 2011) ordered last week (dec 16, 2011).  Took it for a test run, it is really smooth without getting yanked or pulled, contours to your jaw and shaves every hair, assuming you give it a bit of a circular motion  The trimmer is also good, doesn&#x27;t catch or yank on your long beard hairs.   Nice clean shave, haven&#x27;t tested with shaving foam, as it is capable of it (dry/wet)...  The cleaning is a breeze, run both trimmer and shaver head through some warm water and you&#x27;re done, no more brushing out hairs.  I do believe it is splashproof while cleaning in the basin, but I don&#x27;t think it would be wise to use it constantly in water such as in the shower, but not 100% on that.  My review is based against an old remington 7 series, so this shaver, I believe is a nice upgrade. No regrets on my purchase...</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd shaver, I love it,it is very comfortable and smart. The most thing is it&#x27;s very cheaper.</li>
            <li> This razor does a very nice job and seems to hold the charge a long time.  I have owned other brands of electric shavers and this one seems to feel a little cheaper in your hand but still does the job.</li>
            <li> I shaved my face and it was gggggggrrrrrrreeeaaatttttt!  I was impressed by the angular cut while shaving on an obtuse angled face at right angles. It was very circular with infinite pastabilities.</li>
            <li> Ordered this and it came in in just a few days! Overall pleased with the razor, haven&#x27;t tried using it with wet shaving cream yet, but it seems to work fine dry.</li>
            <li> I like the wet shave feature of this shaver so much, that i stopped using Gillette fusion. Would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> This razor is very easy to use for me  Thank  Philips thank the Amazon  I will buy next time  very goog</li>
            <li> the online price was much less than my local target store even with shipping which was very reasonable.  it arrived promptly.  the shave is a vast improvement over my older norelco (which has been discontinued).  shaver is very quiet, the charging base is stable, the suction cups hold well, the on/off button is convenient and it is easy to hold.  Cleaning is simple.  The only drawback is that the shaving head is a little harder to remove to knock out the hair bits than my older norelco but that is only because the head is so much more flexible which means it follows facial curves more accurately and comfortably.  very comfortable shave.  a great deal imho.</li>
            <li> this is excellent product.very quite and smooth.i gave 5 star.and the price is unbeatable.i recommend to everyone who needs the shaver.</li>
            <li> I saw a tv ad on this product and checked it out in store. Looked like a well made and good looking shaver so I decided to try it based on rising costs of blades. The shaver is made well and charge lasts for long time. Shaves close, although your skin has to get use to electric shaver versus blade (takes couple of weeks). No problems and feel I made a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I have used Phillps/Norelco shavers since I was kid.  I&#x27;ve owned the old corded ones, cordless, cheap and expensive ones. (The cheap Norelco razors are like chainsaws-spend the extra).  This is hands down the best electric razor I&#x27;ve owned.  I&#x27;m Italian so my 5 o&#x27;clock shadow shows up around noon.  Three day old growth was a (lierally) painful experience. No longer.  My old Norelco is about 7 years old (6XXX series) and was about $140 when purchased.  It did a really good job but with 3 day growth, it actually hurt to shave as my face is somewhat sensitive.  When I recently forgot my shaver and came back after 3 days with this one, I expected the worst. I could not believe how smooth and effortless this razor removed the hair.  Even the tricky neck hairs were no match.  I would recommend this razor.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the detachable trimmer and removing the heads to dump the stubble.  You have to take the entire head off and snap on the trimmer attachment.  I can see that getting old.  And to get the stubble out you need to do this 3 fingered push and pull thing.  Easily learned but not as convienent as the hinged head assembly on the other models I&#x27;ve used.  It removes the hair from my face very well which is it&#x27;s core function.</li>
            <li> If u r a man, this is one of the best choice for shaving. Nice price and good quality. U r not repent of this purchasing. :)</li>
            <li> Would not have purchased except for the Philips rebate.  Decent enough electric razor, bought anticipating the Philips $30 rebate offer, should have made the razor $19.95 after Amazon coupon and Philips rebate.  Philips will NOT honor it&#x27;s $30 rebate, got a postcard \\&quot;Manufacturer&#x27;s discounts taken at the cash register are not valid for rebate promotions\\&quot; refusing because the Amazon coupon is considered \\&quot;other offer\\&quot;.  Tried to explain that the Amazon coupon was not a manufacturer&#x27;s discount but Philips customer service was very rude, told me \\&quot;You&#x27;re not gonna get a $20 razor, that&#x27;s not gonna happen.\\&quot;  Seems a Philips scam to me but I don&#x27;t have the time or energy to follow thru with wherever to take the complaint to actually get the Philips rebate.  If anyone actually gets the rebate or fights the refusal, please post what you did here, because many are gonna be disappointed to not get the $30 from Philips.</li>
            <li> very good .my dad like it</li>
            <li> so wonderful, so powerful, my husband loves it. it is a nuce product, thx amazon. if i got chance ,i will buy more.</li>
            <li> The very best shaver I have ever owned.  Very stylish and great battery life.  Feels great in your hand and gives the best shave I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco 1150x/40 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver is nice, shipping fast. But so far, I didn&#x27;t receive $30 mail rebate.  Thanks. Haihong Zong</li>
            <li> Tried this shaver for two months hoping that my face would get used to it, but even after two months, it still caused a lot of irritation on my face.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver and gave it 2 weeks but it didn&#x27;t seem to get everything and left stubble. It worked better when wet w shaving cream but still by 12 o clock I had a 5 o clock shadow. And the deal breaker was that the spinning motion seemed to really irritate my skin and cause razor burn</li>
            <li> This shaver is very good and it surpass over your payment for it. My boyfriend like it very much. What&#x27;s more, he sent this type shaver to his friends as gifts and share this convenience.</li>
            <li> I have used this razor for two months.  The first month provided a clean shave, as you get with most new electric razors.  After two months of use the blades seem as dull as a razor that has twelve months of use on it.  On the plus side I do like the long battery life between recharging. You might as well go with a cheaper electric razor as the blades will last just as long and most likely longer than the blades on this high priced razor.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I bought is for trial but kept it after product worked better than i expected.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Quick delivery. And very good price! It is very good gift too. My dad likes it. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I had assumed Phillips is a reputable company. i am wrong.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product with a mail in rebate on reading all the fine print plus asking an amazon rep about its validity. To our surprise Phillips rejected our rebate without proper explanation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have reported this to Amazon, State Attorney general and BBB.&lt;br /&gt;This is not a review of their product.&lt;br /&gt;But I would never purchase another Phillips product.&lt;br /&gt;Why would I trust them again when we have so many other alternatives?&lt;br /&gt;Zero star rating if this were a review of Phillips customer service. Two star .. overall.&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t purchase their products if you come across a rebate offer. Even if there is no promo, i wouldn&#x27;t trust any company who don&#x27;t stand by their words.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Phillips Norelco SensoTouch razor on 12/29/2011. It came with a 45 day money back guaranty, after using it for 25 days I contacted Phillips customer service for a return authorization form. I was told they would email me the form. After three weeks and four phone calls, where I was told that I would get the form, still no form.  Now I will never buy a Phillips product and I will post this to every review of Phillips products that I can find.  Thanks Phillips for the non existing customer service.</li>
            <li> I used to have a Remington until it finally died (5 years of use). I replaced it with a Norelco because of the brand name and the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has wonderful battery life (haven&#x27;t charged it since I got it in August) with almost everyday use&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not as close a shave as my old Remington&lt;br /&gt;Does tug some longer hairs&lt;br /&gt;Has trouble on the neck hairs (always a pain)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very happy. The battery life alone is why I love it. Can shave all the time and never have to charge it</li>
            <li> The shaver turned complete dead after 6 months of use. Great experience when it works. I had a BRAUN which serves for 10 years flawlessly. Should keep away from Philips next time.</li>
            <li> My new Norelco Sensotouch shaver gives me the best shave since forever.&lt;br /&gt;Buy one, You&#x27;ll like it. \\&quot;I guarantee it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the less expensive models in the past and found them to be reliable and dependable. When I opened the box I was a little disappointed that this one did not come with a storage/travel case and the charging cradle did not appear rugged.&lt;br /&gt;After charging the electric razor I gave myself a smooth, quick and almost silent shave. Wow,this thing gave me a great shave!&lt;br /&gt;All of the past models lasted 7 to 10 years with only a simple daily cleaning (brushing it out with supplied brush),&lt;br /&gt;if this shaver lasts as long as the last ones I would say this is 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Really like this new razor. First one I&#x27;ve owned that has come close to shaving like a blade. As always Amazon has the best price.</li>
            <li> My first impression is just terrible!   I didn&#x27;t like 2d feature and the the property of razors going up and down when shaving because it becomes a hard work while trying to cut the small hairs. You need to match the corners to the thin part so that the corners are not going down and cuts the thin part.  I traversed many times the neck to shave it properly. I don&#x27;t think it is something that will change in time (as it is said it takes 3 weeks to adjust)  I don&#x27;t want to mention about the trimmer because it cuts like scissors even worse. I paid attention to it and saw that it has two metal part and the upper part is stable, bottom part is moving. However because bottom part is not forward enough, trimmer can&#x27;t cut as I want.    One of the good parts can be smooth shaving that doesn&#x27;t require to much power. But as I said you need to go over your face at least 2-3 times.  It is light and quiet compared to my old one.    So I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to you whether your beard is thin or not. Actually I don&#x27;t recommend any razor that goes up and down while shaving as I told the reason.</li>
            <li> I was expecting an exceptional shave from this shaver, however, I am somewhat disappointed. It takes forever to shave your whole face and even with wetting the face I would get shaver irritation on my skin. I&#x27;m going back to the Mach 3 razor. It does a closer shave and is much quicker.</li>
            <li> Nice one, having a sense of high tech, I like the blue one.&lt;br /&gt;And The packaging is right good. See u next time</li>
            <li> I had given this as a gift to my husband. My husband was unhappy with its shaving capability. I had to return it. He had to use the shaver multiple times at the same area to get a clean shave. Not an efficient product.</li>
            <li> Was prmoised a rebate while purchase, after 6 months got a rebate rejection stating the reason that manufacturer&#x27;s discounts taken at cash register are not valid for rebate promotions. I wish, they would be more transperent in further promotions. Will never buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Overall, pretty good product.  I hate that you can&#x27;t plug the cord directly into the razor... stupid and makes no sense that you can&#x27;t do that.  So if traveling, you have to cram the stand into your bathroom kit as well.  Only other thing is that it doesn&#x27;t do a great job if you go several days in between shaves (unless your beard grows slow).  Sometimes i have to use the side-burn trimmer real quick to get it short enough for the regular razor to be effective.  That said, when used consistently, it works well, and aside from the first use (when i wasn&#x27;t used to it) I haven&#x27;t really had any razor burn issues.  Pretty quick delivery, if I recall.</li>
            <li> It is very good!I love it ,Product is very easy to use , very suitable for me !&lt;br /&gt;I hope next time there will be preferential</li>
            <li> Look out.  They recommend removing the head for cleaning but if you should happen to drop it it flies completely to pieces.  I spent the better part of a hour looking for the bits and never did find them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I owned a $20 shaver created by some fly-by-night company that lasted 12 years.  It was more portable and did a fine job shaving.  I&#x27;ve only had this product two months and dropping the head from two feet has ruined it.  I could buy a new head from Norelco for $40, but I don&#x27;t plan to give them any more of my money.  Cheap waste of time.  Look elsewhere or stick with the safety razor and shaving cream.</li>
            <li> When I bought it, I was told that I would receive a rebate, however, I receive nothing after more than three months.</li>
            <li> I was promised a rebate. Never received the rebate. The product is is not worth the full price. Don&#x27;t buy it. Buy Panasonic instead. I have both and the Philips is a toy when compared to the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Promised rebate. But after 4 months, I was told in mail my purchase is not eligible for the rebate...&lt;br /&gt;Philips really sucks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big Elec. Shaver Fan...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I find electric shavers take too long in comparison to a blade and are much worse at shaving the neck, but I do like to use one around lips and chin between blade shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  For less than $20 after Amazon coupon and Norelco rebate this razor did work well for that purpose. . .until I was STIFFED today by Norelco on the rebate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** ...UPDATE 3/20/2012 - My problem was addressed to my satisfaction so I&lt;br /&gt;***** re-rated based on merits of the Razor rather than demerits of the Rebate.  I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;***** surprised at NORELCO stiffing so many Customers over a Rebate SNAFU.  I&#x27;ve&lt;br /&gt;***** always found them to be very Customer oriented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I saw nothing that led me to think the Amazon coupon and Norelco rebate were connected. . .I figured one was Amazon&#x27;s dime and the other was Norelco&#x27;s (the justification and mechanics of rebates are beyond me, anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Buyers should have been told by Amazon if the two offers were mutually exclusive.  It was the time of year when discounts were flying thick through the air. . .$60 off was NEITHER unusual nor a Windfall (as Norelco claims).  Norelco usually is better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  If this Razor is advertised with Discounts. . .BE VERY VERY WARY.&lt;br /&gt;  ******************&lt;br /&gt;  ******************  ...I REPEAT. . .If advertised with Rebate and another Offer, BE WARY.&lt;br /&gt;  ******************</li>
            <li> I bought a new senco touch 2D about 2 months ago, after my older Norelco went bad. It does not shave good at all, I wasted $100, I will have to go back and buy one of the Power Touch models. The Senco Touch 2d is also really hard to clean, the blades and screans don&#x27;t lock in like the older models do, when you take the screen off to clean, everything falls apart, a real pain.</li>
            <li> I HAVE HAD SEVERAL TYPES OF NORELCO SHAVERS AS WELL AS OTHER TYPES OF SHAVES.  WITHOUT DOUBT THIS IS THE  CADILLAC OF SPEED RAZERS.&lt;br /&gt;THIS THING MOVES/SHAVES QUICKLY. I DOUBT IT TAKES ME MORE THAN 20-30 SECONDS. THE SHAVE IS GOOD/CLOSE, NO PROBLEMS.&lt;br /&gt;WITH THAT SAID, YOU NEED TO CLEAN THE HEADS PERIODICALLY.  I HAVE A LIGHT BEARD, AND NORMALLY DO THIS EVERY OTHER WEEK OR SO.&lt;br /&gt;THE REMOVAL PROCESS OF THE HEADS REQUIRES MORE EFFORT THAN NOT. FIRST YOU HAVE TO UNSNAP THE MECHANISM THAT HOLDS THE HEADS, THEN REMOVE EACH HEAD AND BRUSH THEM, THEN REPLACE THEM THEN RESNAP THE MECHANISM.  THIS WAS NOT REQUIRED ON THE OLDER NORELCO SHAVERS GOING BACK 20 YEARS OR SO.  IF NORELCO IMPROVED THIS ISSUE WOULD GIVE IT A FIVE STAR RATING.</li>
            <li> While this shaver is very easy on the skin, it doesn&#x27;t seem to get close enough. I had to try it out before I handed it over to my husband to use. I tried it on my legs, most men&#x27;s shavers don&#x27;t do well on legs so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. While it did trim the hairs it did not provide a close shave which I expected. It was very gentle though.&lt;br /&gt;My husband has used it several times now and he has a heavy wiry beard plus his skin can be sensitive. The shaver was very comfortable on his skin and didn&#x27;t irritate it or make a rash or redness. He did enjoy using it because of the comfort factor. The head is very flexible and glides over the contours of the face easily, it is easy to clean too. It takes longer to shave with this than it does with a razor and shaving cream and the manual razor is much quicker to clean. This Phillips is more for touch-ups than for a real shave or an all the time shaver. I think it is a little pricey for what it does. There are other shavers out there that will shave much closer but they aren&#x27;t as easy on the skin as this is.&lt;br /&gt;I guess it depends on how close a shave you want and how much you want to spend.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Philips Norelco SensoTouch electric razor through Amazon.com. I received the razor in just a few days and not only that it does a great job for shaving, i love the way it looks and the handling was great too. The razor and trimming attachment are a little larger than expected but do a good job. It&#x27;s lightweight and easy to clean. The wireless feature will be good for travel. Overall, it&#x27;s a nice looking razor with good features for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for a number of decades and as approach it as a dreaded task.  I&#x27;ve gone as far as to experiment with having my face waxed, but the sample site explored was enough to convince me that I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;m not going to ever endure the indignity of a bikini wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I digress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My older model Phillips razor was a decent device, and would have lasted much longer than the 10 years I&#x27;ve owned it, if I hadn&#x27;t dropped it while cleaning and broken one of the rotators.  Since that time, using it was like using a dull saw to hack at whiskers.  Ouch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a great deal of time searching for a suitable replacement, but really had a price point of being practical.  While I like the 3D SensoTouch shaver infomercial, I can&#x27;t see myself spending $200 on a shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked for nearly a month before deciding to get the 2D SensoTouch, and it&#x27;s a good thing.  Amazon.com had a great deal of $30 off the razor.  Combined with my Amazon Prime free shipping, I paid much less than my price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit trepidatious about it considering about a quarter of the reviews were below 3 stars on various sites I read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, out of the box I liked the design and ease of removing parts to clean.  The design also seems far more careful in consideration of moving parts so they are not as easily broken.  I wish I didn&#x27;t have to change the head to the trimmer, but that issue seems to be resolved in the 3D model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give the new shaver a quick try at a dry shave, with five days of growth on my face.  Normally, I need to use the trimmer first to get to a point I don&#x27;t feel like things are being yanked from my face.  However, this was by far the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced for five day stubble.  It was amazing.  My face was as smooth as ice and it wasn&#x27;t irritated or hot, which is usually the case.  I haven&#x27;t tried it yet as a wet shaver, but I can&#x27;t wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally, I can&#x27;t shave day after day since my skin gets irritated, but I tried today and it was just as smooth and comfortable.  I was genuinely surprised, thinking that it would be a mediocre shaver at best.  What a great decision on my part.as smooth and comfortable.  I was genuinely surprised, thinking that it would be a mediocre shaver at best.  What a great decision on my part.</li>
            <li> Like others, I bought this in November because of an Amazon coupon and a manufacturer&#x27;s rebate, and it was advertised as such to take advantage of this.  Of course 4 months later Philips states the coupon invalidates the rebate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto the shaver, I wouldn&#x27;t give this a good rating even had the rebate check arrived.  It is not powerful enough to do a good job.  I&#x27;ve owned lots of Norelco&#x27;s and must say this is my last.  They just don&#x27;t contain the power they used to in order to give a close shave.  It does ok, so if you&#x27;re able to get it for $20 or less for a first electric, it might be ok as it would be more gentle as your skin gets used to it, but not good overall.  Another flaw in my opinion is not having a direct connect charge, again a cradle that will have connectors go bad in the near future.  That&#x27;s a peave of mine, may not matter to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, battery life lasts long if, as true with any shaver, you don&#x27;t constantly charge it.  Use it until you feel it begin to shave differently or tug lately, then charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, ok beginner, but that wasn&#x27;t what I thought I was buying, thought this was an advanced model I would used for a long time and get a great deal, neither were true.  Disappointed in both Philips and Amazon, will assume this is on Philips and not buy their products again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update - Amazon &#x3D; Awesome, Philips &#x3D; Awful, there&#x27;s a reason why this is the only place I shop online.</li>
            <li> such a horrible shaver!&lt;br /&gt;I thought if I give a second chance to a more expensive Philips shaver its gonna work. fat chance!&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy a thing from Philips again ... ever</li>
            <li> This product is crap.. Doesn&#x27;t give you smooth shave. Once you use it, your skin will burn like anything.   This is not worth of buying... Don&#x27;t waste your time and skin....</li>
            <li> I bought this product a week ago , unlike other chinese products this is very good product, functions well and lasts long  very long on battery and easy to operate and very fast and clean ,smooth finish shave/ trim. works for dry and wet shave, i  usually use it just before going to office so its pretty fast.Apart from this its very easy to clean and very handy.I had many trimmers  but this is very good.I recommend every one to use this if you not bit choosy on price as its worthy for every penny u spend.</li>
            <li> Over the last year I have been obsessed with having the perfect daily shave. Starting with a Fusion I had by far the closest shave. But it was so close I would have ingrowns. Then I used a double edge razor (Merkur 37C, Feather blades, Proraso cream) for 11 months. This was an amazing shave but taking 40 minutes daily to shave was out of the question. Plus occasionally I would get a duff blade and tear my face up before I realized it was a bad blade. Having sensitive skin I decided to go with a rotary instead of a foil. I just had my second daily shave this morning, wow what a great shave. Almost as close as the DE shave but finished in 12 minutes versus 40. My face wasn&#x27;t sore from yesterdays shave, all around comfortable. However I did have to use a blade to line up my side burns(that&#x27;s why I gave a 4 rating). If you are unsure about buying this shaver remember there is a 45 day trial. They just ask you give it 21 days.</li>
            <li> This is a nice electric shaver, and I believe it&#x27;s worth the price.  It gives you a nice clean shave with minimal effort, and does not cause any sort of rash or irritation.  However, much like the product insert states, your skin will need a few weeks to adjust.  The first few times you use the shaver, you&#x27;ll likely be disappointed with the shave. You&#x27;ll feel like you have to go over and over the same spot, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like the shave is quite close enough. However, don&#x27;t lose heart! Within a few weeks your skin *will* acclimate and you&#x27;ll be able to get an accurate and close shave very quickly.     The charger is sturdy and the shaver settings are easy to figure out.</li>
            <li> The item arrived just in time and as described, brand new. About the shaver, I already had an old Philips Norelco shaver, but this one is really good for a perfect shaving!</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t add anything to those that reviewed this before me (their reviews were the reason I bought it). Everything they said about it is true. It is by far the best razor I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> I have always trusted amazon to do the right thing. this rebate promotion was advertised by amazon, it was shipped and sold by amazon. norelco rejected the $30 MIR and amazon will not respond. someone should make it right. complete false advertising when consumer think they are getting it at the advertised price and they do not.</li>
            <li> This is my fourth or fifth razor from Norelco.  They never die.  Most of the time I replace just to replace.  I use this everyday and have had no problems with product.</li>
            <li> Have a basic old Norelco shaver which I like but is getting old. Tried this one and assumed newer design meant better shave...I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s true.  Shave takes longer and seems not as close.  Looks cool though....</li>
            <li> The product is a good part, renamed but, i mistake the sensor touch, I though it was automated touch and the part should turned on by self and the blade speed is a little slow, but in general, my rate is GOOD, 3 stars.  I like and satisfied.</li>
            <li> As a happy owner of a Norelco 7310XL which already has some years of usage I decided to upgrade to the 2d technology when a $ 30 discount for the 1150x became available at Amazon. Unfortunately, some weeks later I have to say I am not pleased at all with this new model. These are the reasons:  - The razor heads seem to turn at a much slower pace than the 7310, therefore, a complete shave takes almost twice the time.  - Uneven areas are much more difficult to shave closely requiring several aims at different positions.    - You can only recharge the unit placing it on its base (no direct cord connection available). That means that if you travel frecuently you have to carry the base with you which obviously is not foldable and looks quite fragile. Also, if the base malfunctions you have to buy a new expensive part while with the previous razors you could just interchange the power cords.  The only reason I gave two stars is that the battery life seems to be more than adequate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the 1150 for about a month or so.  I bought it as a replacement for my old Norelco, which wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge and needed new heads.  The 1150 gives a nice smooth shave, is easy to clean, and comes at a not so high price.  The only thing I wish it had was a built-in trimmer, instead of having to exchange the head with the trimmer.  Not a big deal, it&#x27;s easy to do, but it&#x27;s still an extra step that I didn&#x27;t have to do with my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend it to any one young or old,it gives a good close shave.</li>
            <li> I have ALWAYS used normal razors. Never thought I would like a electric razor. Got this one for $20 when it was on sale, so I figured i would give it a shot. Glad I did. Its a good lil shaver. Doesnt shave as close as a wet shave with normal razor, but it shaves close enough and is very easy to use/clean. Easy to grab when in the bathroom and get a quick shave. Did take me a week or two to really figure out how to get a good shave with it. Not a downside, just not used to a electric shaver. Overall I am pleased. I didnt give it five stars simply because there is still nothing better than a good ol razor shave :)  EDIT: Dropped from 5 stars to 2. Quit using it. Im not someone who shaves every day. So it irritates my skin if I dont use it every day. If I do you is every day, it dries my skin out. I can still shave much faster, and get a better shave the ol fashion way. Which is what I prefer any way, so for me, it was a waste of $$.</li>
            <li> I have been a luke warm fan of electric shavers over the years until now.  Excellent close shave esp if you use the wet option with shave cream.  I love it. Oh and it looks great also.</li>
            <li> This shaver provides a fast and smooth shaving. I am using the shaving cream I already had, that means no special product to buy. A good purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband since his 20 year old Braun is finally failing.  He was excited to try it, but immediately commented on how light and \\&quot;chintzy\\&quot; it felt.  He said that the attachment is useless, which is a problem for him since he used the attachment on his Braun to shave his head.  The other comment he made is that he gets a better shave with the old shaver than with this one.  So... we returned it. But after over a week we are still waiting for Amazon to refund the money.  After 3 very long phone calls on a long distance number, with CSR&#x27;s who don&#x27;t speak English very well, we are still out a shaver and out the money.  VERY disappointed in Amazon!</li>
            <li> I brought this shvaver for 50 dollar. The price is less than 60% in china. What a bargain it is.</li>
            <li> My husband has very sensitive and irritable skin. Compared to Panasonic ES-LA63-S, SensoTouch 2d gives a more comfortable shave for people with sensitive skin. It also gives a cleaner shave especially around the neck area (curves of your face). It is a lot quieter, too. It&#x27;s a winner!</li>
            <li> The unit came packaged as described &amp; pictured. Once opened, a quick review of the instructions, plugged in the charger w/shaver in the charger and the unit was charging. The unit is very stylish, rounded edges but easy to hold. A quick dry shave that was quiet and as close or closer than any of the Brauns, Schicks, Remingtons and other numerous Norelcos I have used left me anxious to try a wet shave which was performed the next day. The wet shave was also smooth and the unit easy to clean but still not quite as close as a typical 3 to 5 edge safety razor and probably should not be expected to. The unit for the price is a quality, good performance, easy and comfortable product to use. While the charge time and length of charge per the advertisements seem to be accurate I believe 7 to 10 shaves per charge is more reasonable with shave times closer to 4 minutes of duration. For the price range it is a very good unit and I would recommnend it to anyone for a quality shave, trimming and daily useage.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco electric razors for the last 30+ years. The 1150 is the best one ever. Easy to clean, super sharp, no irritation, battery holds an excellent charge.....no complaints!!! Buy one! You&#x27;ll never regret it!!</li>
            <li> i got this shaver last year during the thanksgiving time. It said we can get 30 dollar rebate but this year april i got the letter from philips said Thank you for ....Unfortunately we could not honor your request due to the following reason:&lt;br /&gt;Manufacturers discounts taken at the cash register are not valid for rebate promotions.</li>
            <li> I gave the Norelco 1150x/40 Senso Touch shaver to my son as a Christmas gift - he was so pleased with it that he requested the same shaver for his birthday.  He is away from home frequently in his work and wanted one for home and another for his  travel bag.  Made my gift shopping much easier and he is happy, too.  Thank you Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Light, smooth and comfortable. Very efficient in shaving!  The design is so good that you won&#x27;t hurt your skin. And the battery seems very good.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so good thing  it&#x27;s so fast to me from amazon  I really like it  that is the best shaver i&#x60;ve seen</li>
            <li> Works much better with water (I&#x27;ve been using mine for a week now), but I spent 20 minutes dry shaving the other day and still had \\&quot;strays\\&quot; all over my face and neck.  My 12 year old Remington worked much better, but I can&#x27;t find blades for it.</li>
            <li> Shaver is good but must go over face several times and pull skin  tight. I got it at a great price if my rebates arrive. Fast shipping although it was back ordered arrived in a week.</li>
            <li> Good product, battery lasts long time however cannot shave as the shaver has to be in the supplied cradle to charge. Cannot shave as it is charging. Gives a good clean, close shave.</li>
            <li> At this point, I think the Amazon.com service is really beyond discussion. I&#x27;m a black male with a thick, curly beard and I wanted to get away from the triple and quadruple blade sticks. I actually purchased the Panasonic ES8109S Vortex Wet/Dry Shaver after its high recommendation for black men, but I found that I had to shave with a stick after to get all the hair it couldn&#x27;t pick up. The sensotouch worked great the first time i used it, and every time since. My wife commented on the disappearance of my razor bumps over the month or so I&#x27;ve been using this product. I found the shave to be most comparable with a regular stick when I use it in the shower. My new routine is to shave at the end of my shower and my shaves are flawless. This is my greatest electric ever.      Winner: [[ASIN:B003V360NY Philips Norelco 1150x/40 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver, Metallic Blue]]    Failed: [[ASIN:B000VKZMHK Panasonic ES8109S Vortex Wet/Dry Shaver with Nano Technology and HydraClean System]]</li>
            <li> After years of using a Braun electric razor, and finding that it was mediocre at best, I took a gamble and decided to get the Philips Norelco 1150.  I expected it wouldn&#x27;t be any improvement, but figured I had nothing to lose.  When I first received it from Amazon, I noticed that the rotary heads had just one ring of blades.  I wondered if that would be sufficient.  And when I turned it on, the rotary blades didn&#x27;t seem to be turning very fast. In what seemed like a third strike, I placed the running razor against my hand and it felt like the blades weren&#x27;t doing anything. And against my face, the razor just glided across, without the familiar pulling action and grinding sound that I had with my old Braun.  Yet when I finished shaving, my face was as smooth as I could ever remember.  This razor really works. And, most impressively, it even works on my neck, where the Braun was almost useless.  I&#x27;m not sure what the secret is to the Philip Norelco, but I won&#x27;t argue with success.  There&#x27;s no razor burn and the results are the best I&#x27;m experienced.  The only open question is how durable the blades are, and time will tell on that score.</li>
            <li> It is a great product for the price.  This is the second one I bought.  I heard form several of my friends they also bought this item.</li>
            <li> convenience to useshave bread on my face neatly and charge quickly. the modeling of the shaver is fashion too,I very like this product.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco 1150 Senso Touch 2d Electric Shaver is designed for men, it&#x27;s right to have one. I like this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cleaning and comfortable after used it, The shacer have Line Noise and very save electricity .handfeelanddrape.It have really nice color.</li>
            <li> very convenient , my christmas gifts .lol~~ thank you. wish all have a happy new year!  Good price, good quality!</li>
            <li> I bought two Philips Norelco in December, one this and another 1150x/40 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver and 7310 which was three times cheaper. although 7310 is cheaper, it is better, more convenient, shaves better, much much better. this 2d is just a cool one to put in the bathroom but not for shaving. Oh and you need to change the head if you need the trimmer :((( I hate doing this, I want something easy to handle with and not to loose my time for cleaning them or assembling them. I feel sorry that I bought it at first place, not worth for almost 100 bucks.</li>
            <li> I have used various Norelco and Panasonic shavers for nearly 25 years.  I have a very tough, fast growing beard, and my job requires frequent evening events.  So, my measure of performance is whether or not I have to shave again before heading out for the night.     After several Panasonic Linear shavers (which I use primarly wet with shaving cream), I was excited to try the Norelco 1150x because of its similar ratings and wet/dry capability.      The Norelco was comfortable to hold, quiet and had extraordinary battery life - nearly two weeks of long shaves.  It performed well in both the wet and dry modes, providing the closest shave I have received from a Norelco.  It was a bit harsh and irritating compared to my previous shavers, particularly on the neck where it produced frequent razor burn and some cuts.  It was also a bit difficult to shave accurately in harder to shave areas, such as the chin, neck and around sideburns.  All in all - good, but not great.    However, the Norelco 1150x did NOT shave nearly as close and comfortably as my older Panasonic ES8103S that it was intended to replace.  While close, my beard was already back by mid-afternoon and required a second pass for evening events.  After several weeks of exclusive use of the Norelco, I pitted it head-to-head against the Panasonic for two weeks, shaving one side of my face with each shaver daily.  I even alternated sides to avoid bias.    In this head-to-head comparison, the Panasonic came out the clear winner every time, with the Norelco running second in closeness, comfort and reaching hard to shave areas.  While the Norelco was close, it just could not match my old Panasonic in any respect.    I returned this shaver under Norelco&#x27;s 45-day money back guarantee policy, and replaced it with a newer Panasonic ES8243A that shaves even closer and more comfortably than my older Panasonic that beat this Norelco.    I think this would be an exceptional shaver for those with light to average beards.  It really does require a 3-4 week break-in period for your face and beard to adjust, just as the directions say.  Be sure to save your original receipt if you&#x27;re thinking or taking advantage of the 45-day trial.</li>
            <li> two days ago i bought this, the price was $89.00. one day after, it became $79.00. then today it is now $69.00. And their price matching policy would not give me money back, which drive me crazy!!</li>
            <li> I recieved this razor for christmas, my old Norelco was getting old, and tired. This razor does a great job. I have yet to try it with shaving lather, but the shave without is just as close as a regular razor so I&#x27;m sure using a  little lather would be even better. The only thing that would make it better is if it came with a case for when you travel.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, good service and exellent produt.  Just still haven&#x27;t got the rebate.  It&#x27;s been 3,4 weeks, don&#x27;t know when can receive the rebate.</li>
            <li> This is the first shaver I&#x27;ve used. I think it shaves great, my skin is not irritated, unlike as with razor blades, and it shaves smoothly. The only problem is charging the power. The recharger is not convenient to take with me when I&#x27;m travelling. However, because the battery works for three weeks, it&#x27;s not that much of a problem.</li>
            <li> Gives a close, smooth shave.  Holds a charge exceptionally well!  Shaves every day and has only charged it the one time.</li>
            <li> Perfect goods that we purchased them more due to the low price. WE LIKE IT.  That&#x27;s great if my friends and I get the rebate from the Philips&#x27; company soon!  THUS,-----YOU MAY UNDERSTAND   http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003V360NY/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title</li>
            <li> While the 1150x is not the top of the line, for just shy of $100. I was hoping for more. The multi angle head and unique shape does not provide a close shave and requires many strokes covering the same area to finally get the job done.  I have used Norelco Shavers for 40 years and the previous model that was 9 years old just wasn&#x27;t cutting as well as it used to and the new replacement blades were almost half the price of the new shaver.  The main advantage of an electric shaver is the speed to get the shave done.  This shaver takes just as long as a Bic razor and a can of Foamy.</li>
            <li> 4 weeks in, I find this shaver to be no better (or worse) than the standard Philips Norelco electric razor that i paid considerably less for. I actually find it a bit more cumbersome to handle and am not all that fond of the charging cradle it comes with.  I guess they got me on the sleek design and hype (from their online video).  It does the job, but just costs a bit more than it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 12/26/2011 - I would not recommend this razor; it&#x27;s over priced and does not perform as well as less expensive models from the same manufacturer.  10 months in, the metal housing that holds the blade heads in place broke as I was trying to empty out the beard shavings.  Overall, I would say this razor is awful.  I do like Norelco, and have purchased a pretty standard Norelco rechargeable at about half the cost - and am once again happy.</li>
            <li> I can go over my face and neck three times with this and there are still stray hairs; doesnt matter the pressure or direction I move it. Also it nicks me more than an electric shaver should. Going to have to toss this and just get a panasonic foil shaver.</li>
            <li> This item is absolutely fantastic! It&#x27;s everything I wanted and more! Great price for a great item, so I definitely suggest buying this item to anyone!</li>
            <li> This shaver is quite the upgrade from my husband&#x27;s last Phillips Norelco. It gives a much closer shave and looks great on the bathroom counter. The only complaint he&#x27;s had is the frequency of having to empty the hair from the heads - I guess that&#x27;s a pretty small price to pay for the smoother skin.   Food for thought: Purchased on Amazon while on sale and with a coupon code. Got it for just over $50 - he said he probably wouldn&#x27;t pay the full-price for it unless it came with a second set of heads.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth to buy and easy to chean.  i already have two. hope get a gift card from philips.  i will give more information .</li>
            <li> Philips doesn&#x27;t honor their rebates.&lt;br /&gt;Never get any information about the rebate I suppose to get with the order placed in thanksgiving last year.</li>
            <li> I have almost 2 years using this product and let me tell you that is good both dry and wet. In my opinion prefer use dry. I like the automatically adjusts volts and the best with one charge for me is 8 times shaver around 8 minutes each. Then the indicator of recharge never fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2015: I have 1 year using the replacement RQ12 and can say I&#x27;ve transformed my Norelco 1150x2D literally in 3D shaver. Personally i&#x27;m very glad for this choice</li>
            <li> This is the third Norelco I&#x27;ve owned, although it is my first higher-end shaver. This works better than the lower-end models, as it moves around more easily and fits in my hand better. It also doesn&#x27;t leave any afterburn as my prior shaver occasionally would, possibly caused by the blade&#x27;s age, and actually can hold a battery charge. If you&#x27;re looking to get a Norelco, I would suggest to go the extra yard to get this one. It gets the job done better than the lower-end models and won&#x27;t blow a hole in your wallet.</li>
            <li> Really this product is a 1 star for me but I gave it 2 because I really didn&#x27;t like it that when I moused over the 1 star the caption read \\&quot;I hate it.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this as a gift for Christmas and I was excited to give it a spin because it is a wet and dry shaver. I would have to say from the moment I switched it on (after it was fully charged), the super quiet motor, or should I say slow sounding motor, gave me some doubts even before I put it to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sad to say, my faith (or lack of it) was rewarded. When I was finished shaving I still had stubble and I still needed to shave with a blade. In addition, either the motion or the heat (not that it felt hot) from the head made my skin red and sore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another day--not the same day--I tried it as part of a wet shave routine only to yield slightly better results (because of the gel, I imagine) but I still needed to shave when I was finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize everyone&#x27;s facial hair and skin differs, but this was not the product for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because Amazon only give a 2 day money back guarantee with this product (strange policy), I called Philips as there is a 45 day money-back with them.  Beware it has to be postmarked 45 days from the day it was ordered--it&#x27;s not try it for 45 days and then call us to initiate your exchange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging base is slightly cumbersome to get the product in and out of &amp; the suction cups on the base were not doing such a splendid job of keeping the unit stable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apart from my dislike of the product performance, I do like the concept of a wet/dry shaver and it is designed well, feels nice to hold and looks attractive as a device.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco Senso Touch electric shaver is very nice,so clean,so cheap,i like it so much.thanks.  I can buy it next times</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver and received this package before the Chinese spring festival.I have used this shaver for two day,and  I love it.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric shaver that I&#x27;ve ever owned. It&#x27;s soft on the face and really does shave \\&quot;as close as a blade.\\&quot; Cleanup is a breeze. The recharging stand is rather flimsy but it doesn&#x27;t detract from the shaver&#x27;s qualities.</li>
            <li> This is really a good stuff what I want. Compare my old type Philips shaver this one get much improvements. I feel comfortable while using it. While although there are not much high end technology and looks a little bit simple. But simple is the best I believe so. It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean, also looks robust enough. That&#x27;s sufficient. I&#x27;m satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Bad product, Panasonic shaver is must better.  Purchased this one day after black Friday 2011 with $30 rebate. Never receiver anything from Philips. Called Philips but they said they can&#x27;t honor it. The rebate has a fine print saying \\&quot;May not be combined with other offers\\&quot;, but the $30 discount by Amazon is not an offer by Philips. Never buy Philips brand again.  I&#x27;d never buy this product if not for the $30 rebate.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my husband for his birthday (right after Xmas).  Works well, looks good on the counter. Light weight, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I have not received $30 rebate after sending mail-in offer last Nov. it has been over 3 months. Please tell me how to do?</li>
            <li> i received it and tried ti use it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- 1st time i thought i am not familiar with it and this is why it is not shaving, turned out to be vert&#x3D;y bad blades...&lt;br /&gt;had to go through the same area like 10 times just to trim th ehair and not shave it. after like 30 minutes of trying to shave my chin.......guess what, it is all red and have marks and scratches everywhere. all of this big mess lasted on my face for more than a week.&lt;br /&gt;- 2nd time and last time i use it, same senario happened and i knew for sure that i am not that stupid and it was not me who did not know how to shave?!! if i ever known that it will be that horrible i would never ever buy it. buy your self a good shaving machine \\&quot;Gillette Mach3\\&quot; or simillar that will last for years (i own the same one for more than 8 years annd all what it cost me is the razors) and do not waste your money on this trash....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they did not even honor the Mail in Rebate...........</li>
            <li> I just received a letter from Philips which denied my mail in rebate, which seems happened to thousands of other people. That&#x27;s my end of purchasing anything from Philips.</li>
            <li> Always wanted to buy a razor to my father, this is too fit, refined and efficient, the most suitable as a gift, the price is perfect, a perfect shopping experience, and thank Amazon!</li>
            <li> It is all about the REBATE trap.    when I made the purchase, amazon provides $30 coupon and $30 mail in Philips rebate.    After 10 weeks waiting, Philips doesn&#x27;t want to honor the rebate. In the meantime I cannot return it to Amazon because I cut the UPC code from box and send it to Philips along with the rebate form.    Philips customer service is so rude. They disconnected the conversation before I finished!!    I don&#x27;t want to get angry just because of $30, but I have to post my experience here so other customer don&#x27;t get into the trap in the future.    I will never trust Philips or buy their product anymore.    ----Added on Mar. 6th---  I just reported this issue to PA State Attorney General.I also encourage others to file a complaint with their AGs.    For those living in PA - here is the link to Attorney General complaint site:  [...]    I wrote this:    Philips is not honoring the $30 rebate for SensoTouch Shaver.  I send my rebate form and all required stuff to Phillip on December 16th 2011. After 10 weeks waiting, I didn&#x27;t receive anything from Phillip. I contacted their CSR yesterday. They claim it \\&quot;may not be combined with other offers\\&quot; because I used a promotional certificate provided by the retailer, Amazon.com.  Nowhere in the rebate form says anything about discounts received by retailer invalidates the $30 rebate. This is consumer FRAUD.    (Thanks for Dragon Sam&#x27;s help )</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the rebate either! Terribly misleading! I know Walmart had the same product push for both a Walmart gift card and the rebate... I wonder if they got screwed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself isn&#x27;t as solid as the higher-end models or the previous models. You have to take the stand with you because you can&#x27;t plug into the shaver directly! Pointless for travel. It&#x27;s easy to clean but I wouldn&#x27;t pay a premium for it...  buy and older model...  They work the same!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I REALIZE The problem is with Phillips but... I called CUSTOMER SUPPORT, AND TOLD THEM ABOUT THE ISSUE AND POINTED THEM TO THE PROBLEMS EVERYONE HAS HAD AND ALL THE REVIEWS... HE CREDITED MY CREDIT CARD FOR $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOW amazon! Thanks for fixing this problem. While it wasn&#x27;t completely their fault, I can&#x27;t believe they did it! I hope Phillips pays them back!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very loving, very satisfied. Worth having. Color is also very good, I&#x27;ve always wanted. Charging can then be used for a long time, love. Mainly the price is also very satisfied</li>
            <li> The box of the product said that it was supposed to cause less razer irritation. When it actually just ruined my whole face and caused acne 30XS worse on my face! HORRIBLE PRODUCT!! DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN. TOTALLY RUINED MY FACE. I NEVER HAD THIS KIND OF BAD ACNE!!!</li>
            <li> wonderful father&#x27;s day&#x27;s gift.it has a good shape and cool colour.</li>
            <li> This shaver is the gift that the first time i send to my husband, he love this shaver very much,the shaver has a nice appearance,it&#x27;s very suit for my husband.</li>
            <li> I got this from amazon in dec thinking i will get 30 rebate which i never got. I am not sure if this product is worth without the rebate. i had one old electric shaver from Philips which did same job, just looked different. Older one was much cheaper and did same job as this one. I think Philips and amazon both cheating consumer via rebate promise. Amazon should have known that no rebate will be given at the time of selling it.</li>
            <li> Be very careful with promotion for Philips products...they will reject mail-in rebate offers simply because you buy it at a discounted price from Amazon. I have confirmed with a Philips CS supervisor that they are authorized to do exactly that.</li>
            <li> My husband wanted it for Father&#x27;s Day.  It shaves smooth the first time, and is very quiet.  Does not pull or snag at the hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Philips Norelco 1150x/40 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver on Nov 24, 2011. This shaver comes with a $30 mail-in-rebate which Amazon says it could be combined with Amazon&#x27;s $30 off coupon. But today I got a rejection from PHILIPS on a postcard writes: \\&quot;Manufacturer&#x27;s discounts taken at the cash register are not valid for rebate promotions\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I feel get scammed by both Amazon and PHILIPS, as Amazon promised we could combine the rebate at that time, they even list both the coupon and MIR on the product page during the promotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now, if you are still expecting the rebate, just forget it!</li>
            <li> I bought it in last year, and it said this product will give 30 dollar rebate. But, until now, I don&#x27;t receive the rebate. Would you tell me when the rebate will be supplied?</li>
            <li> last month i got it ,my father\\&quot;s birthday was coming.so it is a gift for him,he like it so much,you know his whiskers is so great .the Philips Norelco 1150x/40 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver is so good ,my father used it everyday.NOW everytime i meet him,he always said it is God gift.</li>
            <li> Good,actually it&#x27;s a present for my dad,and he like it.I think it will be better if the price can be lower to 49.99 as in the past.</li>
            <li> This product is very perfect.I am comfortable when I using it.50$ is very cheap,but its high quality can still be believed.Best regards.</li>
            <li> Nice little razor, I don&#x27;t care for dry shave, irritates my skin, but using it with shaving cream is assume.  My previous razor was a Braun. The Philips razer shaves a lot closer, just give it a week or two for your skin to adjust.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice razor that does great job on my face and neck.  It runs very quietly and feels super smooth on the skin.  The charge lasts for weeks before it needs to be recharged.  Prior to this model, I had been using the Norelco 8171XL.  The 8171XL has been great and I have had no complaints or problems.  This new 1150x/40 has been performing just as well if not better in the actual shave department.  Because my last model was so good, I do have a couple of complaints.  I don&#x27;t like how you have to fully remove the razors with your hands when cleaning the unit.  The later model had a button that would flip up the razors on a hinge to allow rinsing.  The other thing I am not crazy about it the the trimmer requires you to remove the entire razor head and snap on the trimmer attachment.  Again, the later model had the trimmer attached to the razor and would just flip up off the back of the unit.  I really do like that this is a wet/dry razor that can be used with shave creams and in the shower.</li>
            <li> My husband has used a lot of different brands of electric shavers over the years, and this one stacks up about average as far as closeness of the shave.  What he did like about the SensoTouch was that the shaver is quite comfortable, both the cutting surface and the shape in the hand. It&#x27;s very smooth and glides easily across the skin, and the head and blades pivot to make easy work of facial contours.  He likes to shave in the shower, and until recently, it was difficult to find a good rechargeable shaver that would hold up to true wet shaving.  This one works well for wet or dry shaving.  I like that that charger doesn&#x27;t take up much space at all on the vanity and that the contact points are high, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about a wet countertop causing problems.  The battery lasts through several shaves and recharges quickly.  Overall, it&#x27;s a nice shaver.  If you&#x27;ve never used an electric shaver, or if you haven&#x27;t used one in a while, you have to use it for a few weeks before you start getting good results. The user guide will tell you that your beard needs to acclimate, but I suspect that learning how to use the shaver plays a big part of that, too.</li>
            <li> It is a nice deal at the price when I brought. Very smooth shave. Away better than my old shaver, which was brought 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> en ,shuo dian  shenme  ne ?hai bu cuo ,sheng zai gou pian yi ,bushi  tebie gajin de ganjue ,fanzheng maile bu houhui</li>
            <li> It can shave efficiently and completely clean. However the button does not feel good. And the battery life is about 15 days (I use it daily).  I think this model worth its price.</li>
            <li> I have had Norelco shavers in the past and they did a decent shave job, I bought this after I got tired of using the manual shaver I was using. I was surprised since my face has several regions of hair that grows in all directions, my neck is the worst spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor works great for my problems and its allot quieter and charges quicker than the old norelco shavers I had in the past. Plus amazon had a 30 dollar off coupon making it 55 bucks instead of 85 so that helped. I would suggest that anyone and everyone use the coupons even if its 50 cents off. I would us it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So thanks to norelco for a good shaver, And I have been a customer of amazon for years, So Thanks to amazon for the coupons and Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco 1150X/40 SensoTouch 2D Electric Razor is a keeper. I still cannot believe that an electric shaver can shave my tough beard sooo close.  I can even use it in the shower since it is waterproof.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a blade for almost all of my shaving for the past several years, and wanted to try out an electric, hoping it would give me fewer razor bumps around the neck.  Honestly this electric razor does OK on the face. It will leave you smooth, but it has the feel of brushing your teeth - going over the same area again and again. But it is smooth and less irritating to the upper lip area.   As for the neck, I can barely shave it. Maybe mine is more contoured than other guys&#x27; necks, but I tried a couple times and just started using a razor. To its credit, when it is used for the neck it is less irritating to this area as well and does yield fewer razor bumps.  All in all, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, but if you&#x27;re used to electrics its worth a shot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco razors for years , stopping at times to check out other razors. This unit was recommended by their customer service and I love it. Smooth, cuts close, just a pleasure. Only complaint is the washing system doesn&#x27;t allow you to see if you&#x27;ve cleaned well. Run under the faucet but I feel unsure if clean.</li>
            <li> First, Norelco does not honor their rebates. I submitted all the required paper work timely, but they still did not send the rebate. Second, this shaver has a major flaw, the shaver head keeps falling off and will eventually break from hitting the floor. JUNK!</li>

            <li> Friends,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t fall for the $20 Mail In Rebate from Philips - as Philips won&#x27;t give you that $20. Instead Philips will send you a card saying that \\&quot;Our Cash reduction has been closed\\&quot; probably after 2/3 months. By that time you will also lost your return period. This is my personal experience for this product. I bought this product during Thanks Giving and I got the card saying \\&quot;we can&#x27;t pay you\\&quot; around Feb 2012 and with that my return period also expired and I paid $20 extra for this product.....already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;********....MY REQUEST IS NOT FALL FOR THE MAIL IN REBATE FROM PHILIPS.......******</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d try this Razor out due to all the high review marks it&#x27;s been getting on Amazon. People said it was the closest shave they ever got, and it even shaved their neckline. (Something no electric I&#x27;ve ever used has done before)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought it and gave it a shot. This is what happened:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Charged up the unit the night before, to ensure full power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. After my shower in the morning I used [[ASIN:B0015UWUFM Proraso Shaving Soap 5.2 oz (147 g)]] and applied it to my face. Let it sit for about 5minutes to soften my iron hair beard up. I had not shaved in three days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Began to use the shaver in a circular motion as suggested by the manufacture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Noticed it barely cutting my beard hair on the sides of my face, and had to make multiple passes to get all the hair. I could here the motor struggling to shave my face. (Never a good sign)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. I then tried to shave my neckline. What a nightmare it was.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver spun away and I immediately saw my neckline turn red and start to bleed.  I&#x27;ve never experienced this before using any electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. I immediately stopped using the razor, turned it off, cleaned it and packaged it back up and sent it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face was a red, swollen, and bleeding mess after using the SensoTouch.&lt;br /&gt;I had to use [[ASIN:B000RIAD0W Proraso Pre and Post Shave Cream - 3.6 oz]] to reduce the swelling of my face, and later go back and finish the mess this razor left behind with my trusty Merkur Double Edge Razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now a week later, my neckline is still recovering after the beating it took at the hands of the SensoTouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous electric razors I&#x27;ve used always gave me some form of razor burn. Some minor, and some major. But I&#x27;ve never in my life had an Electric Razor cause bleeding before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how people can rate this razor so high, when clearly it does not cut hair properly around the neckline. Perhaps the people this works for don&#x27;t have iron strong beard hair like I do, or very thin beard hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not fall for the hype surrounding this product. If you have strong beard hair and neckline hair, save yourself the pain and discomfort, and avoid this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pickup a [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor]] instead. You&#x27;re face will thank you for it.surrounding this product. If you have strong beard hair and neckline hair, save yourself the pain and discomfort, and avoid this product.

            <li> Very cheap very affordableThe 1150  not has an LED display that shows you how much time is left before recharging is necessary.I think inadequate on this point.</li>
            <li> Very good razor.  Haven&#x27;t used an electric razor in years and now I&#x27;m glad I tried it again. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Like so many others; I never received the $30 rebate. Bought shaver in December 2011 and Philips sent me a postcard rejecting my rebate in late May. I will never again purchase Norelco products. Company cannot be trusted.</li>
            <li> I got this from amazon in dec thinking i will get 30 rebate which i never got. I think Philips and amazon both cheating consumer via rebate promise and both are responsible for the false advertising.</li>
            <li> when I get it,I am shockedIt is too beautiful,it is a gift for my friend,he is very satisfaction,thank you,amazon...OK,i will shop in amazon more times...</li>
            <li> I was worried about skin irritation and battery not so much as close shave.  this one performs well in all departments.  gives a close shave and battery works sufficiently well.  not as quick as with the traditional blade, but is convenient.. just takes a little time getting used to it.</li>
            <li> I bought one bcz they offered rebate during Xmas. However, once I submitted the rebate form, never got back. Called the company, they denied my claim just bcz I used an Amazon coupon which has nothing to do with this product. I will never buy anything from the company gain.</li>
            <li> Works well, but the part on the neck is bit difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> A great quality shaver for it&#x27;s price. As an additional bonus, with the Tron Legacy discount, this product got an even sharper price-quality ratio.</li>
            <li> good waterproof shaver. its better then the dry ones and has a realy close shave. there was more then 30 days already and the battery still running  great product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for 35 years. I have bought them without question, because until this one I&#x27;ve never purchased one that disappointed me. The worst problem with this design is the shoddy construction. The first time I took the head apart to clean it, the pieces fell apart on the counter. Putting it back together is sometimes problematic because the plastic piece that holds the heads together must face a particular way or the head won&#x27;t stay in one piece. It shaves reasonably well, but the increased articulation of this design still isn&#x27;t enough to cut around the angles of my jaw, which was the reason I bought this particular model. I also find it annoying that you need the stand to charge it. One more bulky thing to pack if you travel with it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my father on 9/2.  On 11/14, it self destructed. It literally just fell apart in the middle of a shave.  Unfortunately we are past the 30 day return window and my father has a useless pile of plastic and blades instead of a razor.  Will definitely not be purchasing this brand again. Ever.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and exactly as shown.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Philips Norelco SensoTouch electric razor for my son through the Amazon web page.  We received the razor in just a few days and it looks great.  The razor and trimming attachment are a little larger than expected but do a good job.  They work just fine as a vanity top appliance.  The wireless feature will be good for travel.  Overall, it&#x27;s a nice looking razor with good features for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Does&#x27;nt fit my face ??</li>
            <li> In fact I bought this item for one of my friends, he has already bought one for his relative and he really likes it and asked me to but another for him. Good deal</li>
            <li> I just bought this electric shaver in early janurary, after by last norelco was lost. I have to say that it gives a really close shave. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it cutting me in any way. I&#x27;ve only use it dry, haven&#x27;t tried to use it with shaving foam. Its also easy to clean, takes about 2 minutes to rinse after each shave.</li>
            <li> I have shaved with Norelco shavers for 40 years and love them. My old Norelco 980XL was top of the line and cost me $85 10 years ago. I have never changed the heads in it. It says self sharpening so why change them. The old one finally quit accepting a charge which is what all my past razors have done. My 980XL had a LCD display panel and displayed minutes of shaving time remaining. It would beep when to much whiskers were built up in the head and needed cleaning. The rotary heads were made of metal. It had a great side burn trimmer attached. It was and has been my all time favorite. I looked long and hard before I purchased the 1180X razor. It is definitely different in style and features than my old one.     Well the first shave was sweet and has been every since. I love the fact that you can just wash it out after each use. Shaving in the shower has been great and actually gives a better shave with just a little soap to make it glide over your face. I even offered to let my wife use it for her legs and underarms since she can just wash to get it clean. My face was already conditioned to the Norelco rotary blades so it was great from the first day. I have a light beard but still need to shave everyday unless I am going hiking or working in the yard on the weekend.     We will see if it last me 10 years like the old one but right now it has certainly impressed me. I did like the fact that the 980XL could be plugged in to shave when the battery ran down. I have had this one for 3 weeks and haven&#x27;t experienced a dead battery yet. It doesn&#x27;t seem as sturdy as the old one but time will tell. It certainly is egonomically designed and looks great. The big difference is in is water proof design allowing me to wet or dry shave. That is really nice.  It certainly is a keeper (10 yrs?)</li>
            <li> Best electric razor you can buy.  Good looking and the smoothest shave ever.  as smooth as using a conventional razor!!</li>
            <li> First electric I&#x27;ve ever owned, and I can honestly say I wont be going back razor blades. Did cut my shaving time in half if not more, no irritation at all either. Smooth, comfortable, and efficient.</li>
            <li> A good shape shaver. It is cool and beautiful. It shaves well. The bettery last long of one charge. Great to have it!</li>
            <li> You have to shave back forth several times to be clean.  But with promotion, I think it is ok to have it. Just hope it will last longer.</li>
            <li> The product is pretty good, and so is the price after $30 discount. It is easy to use. Most of all, I like the feature that it can be water cleaned.</li>
            <li> Ive always had norelco shavers and this ones the best ive had so far.Not only the closet shave ive had the shaver is quiet and light.Id highly recommend the Norelco 1150x/40 Also its made in the Netherlands \\&quot;NOT CHINA\\&quot; which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> Ordered this as a gift for my husband. He loves it.</li>
            <li> I tried shaving for the first time.... well needles to say I had spots on my face razor would not cut so I had to use a trusty ole mack 3 .... face was raw and hurt. I have only had one other electric razor and did not like that one either. I guess I will stick with shaving cream and razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself this Christmas past as somewhat of an impulse buy, and it&#x27;s probably one of the best impulse buys I have made. This shaver has just amazed me, better than any  electric or blades that I have used in the past. They advised a 3 week break in period to get your skin accustomed to this razor but from the first shave I did not have any rash or discomfort just a smooth extremely close shave. Evidently it just gets better from here. I have a fairly light beard with fine hairs plus my skin is not overly sensitive so some one else might get different results than I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I am not an Electric Razor expert as some of the other reviewers seem to be, however I do know when I have had a smooth, comfortable, close shave. I have not used an electric razor for over 30 years, never did care for them. Back then I used a straight blade electric Remington which I definitely did not care for and a Norelco which was good but not great in those days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until receiving this Norelco I was using the Schick Quattro Razor. It&#x27;s a good blade razor with 4 titanium blades. It shaved quite well on the straight away&#x27;s, but around the curves and my neck area \\&quot; where I have hairs going in 3 different directions \\&quot; it did not do well. I had to go over and over again in different directions to get all the hairs. I also have a clef chin which made it difficult for most other razors to shave properly. This Norelco worked great in all areas for me, plus got all those difficult neck and chin hairs with ease. Just started running the razor around the back of my neck when I shave. It&#x27;s easy to reach and seems to do a good job of getting the pesky, unsightly hair that grows there. These are the ones that make it look as though you should be getting a haircut way before you really need one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the trimmer goes, I have no problem with clicking in the separate trimmer blade maybe every week or so since that is all I will probably be using it. I used it to trim the bottom of my mustache and sideburns and it worked extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is quiet almost seems as though it&#x27;s not running fast enough to do the job, but it does. It&#x27;s easy to clean by opening it up and running it under hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all this is a great razor the best I have used;::: EVER.ttom of my mustache and sideburns and it worked extremely well.

            <li> I have been using Norelco shaving products for approximately 25 years. Recently, I chose the newer Model 1150x to be an upgrade to my shaving experince. I prevously used the Model 8842XL which is also a very good shaver! The action and the technology of the newer Model 1150x is much improved.I have found it works very well for my use and the texture of my beard and skin! The shaving head on the 1150x is designed to swivel (up and down) with the contour of to shaving pattern. It is a very much improved shaver over the older, former units I have used in the past.The one factor that I don&#x27;t like is the way the actual blade assembly clips on to the shaving head! I find it more difficult to remove the shaving blade assembly for cleaning than what it should be! This problem is caused by the way the blade assembly \\&quot;unclips\\&quot; or releases from the shaving head. Otherwise..the newer model 1150x is a definite improvement. This shaver is a much better shaving unit than the previous XL models!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no significant deficiency with this razor, but it didn&#x27;t offer a noticeably improved, more comfortable shave either.  I like it, but I wouldn&#x27;t go out of my way to recommend it.  A razor review reflects personal priorities as well as previous experience and likes/dislikes.  A younger person may strongly perfer its streamlined, cobra-head styling, and light feel.  An older person may like the heft and metal head of the previous model.  I do, but I&#x27;ve owned four or five previous versions and prefer the smoother gliding metal head compared with the one on this razor.    It fits the hand well, and the cutters conform to the face.  Nothing exceptional, but nothing irritating in any way.  It has great battery life, and the recharge/recharging indicators are useful and not garish.  The charging stand is quick and easy to use, an improvement over the plug-in charger of the older models.      I like the razor - for me, it&#x27;s not five-star gotta-have but it&#x27;s definitely better than three-star mediocre.</li>
            <li> This is the most comfortable shaver I have ever used. Now that I have used it, I am surprised by the other reveiwers who felt that that one had to get used to the shaver. The incredible comfort was from the very first shave.    I shave my head, as well as my face. This electric razor is great for going on, and around, all of the little bumps and irregularities that no one notices, until you try to get a smooth scalp.    I could not be happier with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers for several years and have found them all very durable and comfortable.  This shaver is tops.  Close quick shave, easy to clean, with hot water from the faucet, and sits in the recharge cradle so it is always fully charged and ready to shave.</li>
            <li> I am totally unhappy with the performance of this product as i am feeling that the things which have been focussed in demos over websites is untrue as per my view. Company is giving 50 days money back guarantee i would like to return the product and get back my money which i think is wise as i am unsatisfied with the performance.   Reason for DisSatisfaction: The blades are pinching as i am gliding for the shave. I have stopped using it because of is low performance when compared to the cheapest available in markets which are worth putting the money as they perform well balanced with investment.  Personal Note: If company is listening to my review then i would like to remind that i want to return the prodcut as today its only 31st day out of 50 days given for reimbusment of my money ( IN MONEY BACK GUARANTEE )</li>
            <li> This razor gave me the best shave with such a light touch.  It just glides over my face and trims as good or better than the previous two electric razors I have owned.  I&#x27;ve been using them for 15 years and this is the best yet.  I don&#x27;t usually take time to review products, but thought I would because I&#x27;ve been so pleased.  Of course, I&#x27;ve only owned it a week, let&#x27;s see if it can last a few years.&lt;br /&gt;oh, the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a five was because nothing is perfect, not too sure about the charging base and the suction cups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 9/18/2012 - still like this razor best of all that I have had.  I have not sharpened the blade or properly cleaned this, I just shake out the wiskers into the garbage can; and yet it still gives me a great dry shave every day.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Provides an incredible shaving experience that almost feels like a massage. The contour-following shave heads yield a considerable improvement in comfort and closeness over lower end Norelcos. Frustrated with shaving irritation, I thought I&#x27;d drop $80 on a \\&quot;good\\&quot; razor, but never expected anything this good. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The razor was good but when i went to my neck it tore me up gave me a rash, and made me bleed! I went my the instructions!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good razor and it works well, and it cleans easily. Also, we received the product in a very quick manner.</li>
            <li> I upgraded electric shavers for the first time in 20 years, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  This shaver gives a close shave even though you barely feel the shaver against your face.  I like this model because I&#x27;m not willing to pay the extra money for the jet clean system.  The shaver itself is very easy to clean; you can use the small brush or hold it under running warm tap water.  I was disappointed to open the box and not find the travel pouch is not included in the 1150x/40 model, but is included with more expensive models.</li>
            <li> It just cut clean and very easy to use and cleaning is very easy  My last Norelco lasted for over 9 years.</li>
            <li> the Philips Norelco 1150x/40 Senso Touch 2d Electric shaver is quite beautiful,though a little big for my hand; and the shipment is also in time.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift for my son and he loves it.  Works quick, doesn&#x27;t tug and it easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I bought a Philips Norelco 1150x/40 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver, Metallic Blue last December. It is very good and I very like it. I use the shaver for everyday now and will recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> Because it shaves very smooth and is very quiet.  An excellent value...  It is easy to clean.  Would recommend to others...  But I miss the straight cutting edge to cut sideburns, mustache, etc..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; TO US GALS (from his wife)....THIS one is GREAT for OUR LEGS!!!  So I steal it. Will order another though, so as not to have to share with beard, mustache hairs, etc.......:)</li>
            <li> I have been using a similar one for about two years. The only problem with the new one is the noise is little high. But overall I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned at least 5 different electric razors and this is the best one I&#x27;ve tried so far. I had never used shaving cream/gel with an electric razor before. Shaving gel makes a huge difference with this razor. The gel helps the razor get much closer and the shave is much smoother. Great overall razor.</li>
            <li> This is very good. Effective and comfortable. But I dont get my rebate as promised by Philips. If the rebate is done, this is perfect product with perfect price.</li>
            <li> 1150 is a good razor, I like it very much, the Amazon price is very good, quality is very good!</li>
            <li> This is great and the price is unbelievable low. I received it quickly. I hope I can buy more as gifts.</li>
            <li> The Phillips Norelco Sensotouch (expensive shaver) is very good, however, will not purchase another from Phillips unless I can confirm they include a carry case. For the past 30 years every Phillips I bought had a case. This is the most delicate, expensive and breakable one yet and I get delivery and NOOOOOO carry case for it. Useless for anyone travelling so I cannot recommend it.</li>
            <li> Provides and excellent shave, but my only quibble is that you need to use a base to recharge the shaver.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my dad, and I have used it on occasion, and I am very satisfied with the purchase so far. It works far better then my five year old electric shaver I use.</li>
            <li> Works great, and saves time when I need a quick shave.  Works wet or dry so the shower is no problem.  Would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Shaver is light weight and comfortable in your hand.  It also has a nice mustache and sideburn trimmer.  Good value for price.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item because of the rebate. After using the shaver, its ok but not worth the full price. For the price after rebate, I would have given it more stars. But then I get the rejection notice in the mail stating that discounts taken at the register are not valid for rebate promotions. So how then does one qualify for the rebate when purchasing off of this website? I feel like I&#x27;m a victim of one of those \\&quot;come-on\\&quot; scams. I don&#x27;t recommend purchasing this item, but if you do, don&#x27;t count on any rebates!</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco 1150x/40 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver, Metallic Blue,i like it,it works good, and i use it everyday.  Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?  Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my husband back in December.  Originally, I had planned on putting it under the Christmas tree but,  with all of the rush of the holidays, it got shoved aside.  I found it in my holiday bin in mid-January so I put it in a pretty Valentine&#x27;s bag ;)  He opened it and LOVED it except for the fact that there was NO CHARGING DOCK.  I am going to see if Amazon can send me the DOCK vs having to ship the entire product back.  I still give it a star though cuz it is all bright and whiney.</li>
            <li> My husband likes this gift. It&#x27;s clean and quick. Charging is easy.&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I had with the purchase is Philips declined my rebate request even though Amazon clearly stated it&#x27;s eligible for the rebate.</li>
            <li> Like it very much to my experience,&lt;br /&gt;This a great science and technology&lt;br /&gt;I use it in Asia&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fast, very easy to clean and provides a good shave</li>
            <li> The actual razor is great quality. If you don&#x27;t want to upgrade unnecessarily to the 3d. It was perfect for my boyfriend&#x27;s birthday and it was delivered on time and well packaged! Overall it was excellent!</li>
            <li> I have used many, many norelco razors that have the conventional look and they have all given closer shaves than this new style.  Norelco seems to be going backwards instead of forwards regarding smooth shaving.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a most awesome electric razor from Phillips as it has changed the appearance of my face. my old razor would leave hairs on my neck and struggle to provide a close shave. This new razor is quite different as it shaves almost as close a blade when used with water and kept clean. I am very satisfied with this purchase and shocked that I have not even had to recharge the battery yet and I  have had the razor almost a month. well designed and a pleasure to use it has redefined my morning shave for the better. I would very much recommend the purchase of this fine razor.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been close to 15 weeks since filing the manufacture rebate and it hasn&#x27;t yet been acknowledged. am getting a bad feeling about the rebate claim.</li>
            <li> Same experience as reported by others.&lt;br /&gt;Received card today saying They will not honor the $30 rebate.&lt;br /&gt;Takes longer to shave with this razor and it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as my older Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;As others stated, I only bought this because of the final Black Friday price after all the rebates.&lt;br /&gt;No more Norelco for me!</li>
            <li> my first one bought by myself. i like it very much. i wish it can company a long time with me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Norelco shaving systems for decades and have normally found it to be superb and far better than any other shaver on the market.  I do not go back and forth from blade to shaver, using the shaver 100% of the time.  I added the 1150X to my shaving thinking that due to the newer design, that it would be beter than my older Speed model.  Wrong!  This does not give anywhere near the closeness of shave as many of my older models.  I&#x27;ve had it for a year and the blades are shot.  New blades are over $40.  I&#x27;d think again before purchasing this model.  I&#x27;m not changing from Norelco as they truly are the best.  Beat all the others hands down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Norelco razor for years but always had a problem when trying to shave my neck hair with painful results. This razor does a great job with absolutely no adverse effects. If you ever wanted a razor that you could throw away your blades for this one fits the bill.</li>
            <li> it does a lot help when you travel, the battery last for a few times shave. Besides, the shape and color all looks cool.</li>
            <li> i think the product is very good and help for me. and the services is very good and person is very kindly for me to reslove my problem, thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a broken earlier model Norelco.  For the price, this is a great razor.  Shaves much closer than my old one and is very easy to use.  It holds a charge for quite a long time and is also quite good looking for a razor.  I didn&#x27;t want to pay a fortune for an electric and I&#x27;ve found this one to be great for the price.</li>
            <li> This Norelco shaver provides a really smooth and close shave.  It&#x27;s lightweight and easy to clean.  The razor charges fast and the charge lasts a long time.  A good buy.</li>
            <li> It is a gift for my brother. I have not try it myself,but it looks like very awesome  at least!</li>
            <li> This razor is really good, very domineering..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is very cheap.. Recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope the next days more&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for leadership.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible electric shaver. Negative -1 stars, but I cannot do that on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design is terrible. The ergonomics are worse. The build quality is atrocious. I won&#x27;t take this shaver if it was offered free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me explain. I am moving on from a Norelco 7775x, which is about 7 years old. I shave every weekday; my old shaver needed a new blade every 14 months or so. The only reason I am replacing my old shaver is because the old shaver is showing signs of wear--it does not turn on every so often, and requires to be on the charging stand for a few minutes before it can turn on again. I liked the performance of the old shaver, but it too suffered from some seriously questionable design flaws (like an atrocious charging base which was just plain unstable for the shaver, but at least stood where it was planted on my granite countertop).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking forward to this shaver after seeing all the positive reviews which are now suspect in my mind. The shaver&#x27;s base has three very terribly designed rubber suction cups presumably to make the unit hold better on slippery surfaces. This is so poorly designed that I want to give the engineer who designed it an anti-award. It is too small and too flimsy to be of use and worse--it makes the unit _less_ stable. What was the point? Don&#x27;t get me started about the actual base. Flimsy, and very easy to tip it. On that score, Norelco won&#x27;t get any points from me for the 7775x either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stop making mens products resemble rocket ships. I don&#x27;t need a rocket ship. I need a shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last straw was that the shaving performance was insipid, and doesn&#x27;t feel like the shaver works at all--indeed, it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips and Norelco should stop making half-a-million types of shavers. I would very much prefer it if they sold two or three shavers for each crowd, and did it well. They are not fooling me with this piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is going straight back to Amazon with no thanks.</li>
            <li> This is a very good one compared to ones I used prevously. It works quite and smooth. I like it!</li>
            <li> I bought a Philips Norelco SensoTouch Shaver from Amazon on Nov, 2011 with $30 mail-in rebate.&lt;br /&gt;After more than three months, Philips sent me a little rejection card, which says that \\&quot;Manufacturer&#x27;s discount taken at cash register are not valid for rebate promotions\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;It is a plain cheating!&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy Philips Shaver on-line!</li>
            <li> This is a superb product.  Philips have proven that they are one of the best brands in the area of electric personal grooming devices.</li>
            <li> this is a really great deal! very useful and cheap! if u wanna buy a good shaver, it is one!</li>
            <li> Bought this about 3 months ago:&lt;br /&gt;- worse than Panasonic for sure.&lt;br /&gt;- Never got the rebate. The only reason that I tried this product was rebate promotion. However, they refused the rebate after return period. The quality is poor. Norelco cannot compete with Panasonic that I am using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommend this for anyone.</li>
            <li> The battery died on my 8 year old Norelco, and it had the original heads.  But after scoping out the hassle of installing a new battery and the cost of replacement heads, I decided it wasn&#x27;t worth refurbishing.  I was going to buy a cheapie replacement, but stumbled over the $30 off coupon for the 1150x.  For an extra $20, I bought the sexy blue razor instead of the stripped down model.  It&#x27;s a work of art, and delivers an amazing dry shave.  Don&#x27;t let the boo birds scare you away from this exceptional bargain.  Some of them are probably new to electric razors and had unrealistic expectations.  As far as I&#x27;m concerned, the shaves from the 1150 come in a very close second to shaves from a blade.  Edit: I tried a wet shave, and it was better than a blade.  The 1150x is remarkable!</li>
            <li> I purchased tis electric shaver after trying my college bound sons new one that his Mother bought for him for school. It is one fantastic shaver!!!! Cuts real close and clean and is easy to wash clean after use. I would advise anyone who is looking for an inexpensive, quality shaver to purchase this one.</li>
            <li> The delievery time is more earlier than  my expection.  The product is prefect ,I will  recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> It is of high quality and easy to operate. The sound is slight and it is comfortable for my face.</li>
            <li> Norelco electric shavers have been my shaver of choice for more years than I can remember. My previous one (which I still have) lasted for 20+ years. It still is in working order, however in order to not be without a shaver in case of failure, I purchased the 1150x/40 as a standby. I would recommend a norelco to anyone who wants a good reliable razor.</li>
            <li> I was always sceptical about electric shavers since i used my first about 10 yrs ago. Was left with patches of stubble and a burn. The Philip shaver took a while to reach me but first impressions are great. Beautiful design, easy to charge and an awesome shave. Used it dry and the shave is very close, left my face smooth. Found it very easy to use and clean. Overall, very impressed. Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> Great shaver, one of the best I&#x27;ve used...and for a great price too, recommended item.  Cuts long and short hairs with ease.</li>
            <li> very good shaver for its cheap price. I bought several and gave some friends as a gift. I also use this every day.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver. I prefer a smooth shave but started getting razor bumps. I did a lot of research and stumbled across this one. This shaver gives a really close smooth shave, whether wet or dry it don&#x27;t matter. It does not cause irritation, and its easy to clean. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and I love it. Some people complain but for under a 100 bucks, it easily compares to some of the other more expensive shavers out there. So if you&#x27;re an African American male, with sensitive skin, and tired of the unsightly razor bumps and burns, then try this shaver. You will not be disappointed. But please try it yourself. Some of these reviews are misleading, and I purchased it anyway. Look at the video&#x27;s, and check out phillip&#x27;s website to get more detailed information about the shaver. It lifts hair up off your face, down to the smallest stub. My skin looks so much better. Also if you prefer a wet shave I suggest getting the Tend Skin shaving gel, and Tend Skin liquid to get rid of razor bumps, all three together will give you a phenomenal clear face.</li>
            <li> I have owned Norelco shavers for many years but this one is superb. It is so quiet you hardly know it is on.  I only use the 1150x dry but you can use it in the shower also.  I recommend this shaver for anyone that wants a clean, close shave.</li>
            <li> Recommend to anyone. Light and does a wonderful job around the jaw and neck areas because of the flex head.</li>
            <li> Just a good solid Norelco.  I&#x27;ve had a few and this one just feels more comfortable and irritates my skin less.  I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, than my original HQ560 shave clean  But in the process or to be submitted, a little place have some small burr.  With the price of $50, overall I&#x27;m very satisfied</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for a month and so far I&#x27;m very happy with it. I get a very decent shave out of it, it doesn&#x27;t rip my face up, it holds its charge a long time, it&#x27;s fairly quiet ... It&#x27;s been not only a nice experience generally, but also the first electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever truly liked. Four or five years ago I tried one of the highly-rated Panasonic shavers and hated it. On my face and with my beard, my shave was lousy and my face got abraded. Mucho blood flowed from my Adam&#x27;s apple area. This Norelco is gentle and effective -- no blood yet -- though you should know that an electric razor&#x27;s shave will never be as close as a blade&#x27;s. As far as i&#x27;m concerned, that&#x27;s OK. I don&#x27;t need a shave that leaves my face shiny-smooth.  Pluses: One battery-charge gives me two weeks of shaves -- impressive. The shave itself (my face, my skin, my beard) is very good. The floating circular heads manage even my Adam&#x27;s apple area well. It took no time at all for my facial skin to adapt to the shaver. The shaver manages that funny, difficult area just under the nostrils well too -- in fact, much better than my Mach 3 does. A bonus for the aging among us: the shaver is even effective on ear hair.   Minuses: The shaver performs well but it feels plascticky and cheap. It&#x27;s dumb that the sideburn-trimmer isn&#x27;t built-in (it&#x27;s a separate attachment). There&#x27;s also been an odd decision to have the razor drain water down through the middle of its length. That means that some drops of water can run out of the shaver and up your sleeve as you use it. Minor drawbacks (and non-dealbreakers) all, as far as I&#x27;ve been concerned.  Tips: Be patient and shave slowly. Don&#x27;t expect that, just because you aren&#x27;t using hot water and cream, you&#x27;ll be getting thru your morning shave faster than you would with a blade. Keep the pressure very light. Pressing down hard on your face with the shaver will irritate your skin and deliver a lousy shave. I get my best shaves with this device by making slow circleswhile barely touching the skin. For some reason I don&#x27;t do particularly well shaving with this thing right after washing and drying my face. When I try,  the device kind of skids around my face abruptly instead of moving smoothly over it. So I just wait ten or fifteen minutes after my morning face-wash to use the shaver. It works fine then.  Realistically I wouldn&#x27;t expect this device to do a good job with a three or four day growth of facial hair. If and when I let my beard go that long, I&#x27;ll break out the Mach 3 and the shaving cream. But for a basic everyday shave, this thing works really well for me.</li>
            <li> I received this item new and in the original box. Shaver took a charge and has held the charge for several days. No issues with the battery life and motor. I am not happy with the charger stand that is required to charge the shaver. The stand is made of plastic and would be easily broken making the shaver unusable. I prefer the older chord capable of plugging directly into the shaver. Shave quality is normal. It is not the close shave promised in advertisements. The shaver is comfortable to hold and buttons work well. Removing the head of the shaver seems a bit difficult until you get use to removing the shaving head from the body. Removal and cleaning is not a smooth process as other models. I have always used Norelco products and have been happy with their longevity and quality. This model I would rate average or lower due to the removal of the head issue and the plastic charge base with no other options for charging.</li>
            <li> If you have a bushy beard, it will work perfectly. I think it is a great shaver for current price. But if your beard is not bushy, maybe it can&#x27;t shave your beard very clean. Just because it is the 2d version ? Overall highly recommend for a purchase.</li>
            <li> 1 hour charge time of .40 minutes of use of lithium batteries. These are advanced applications. Original Holland, work relatively well.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for my father&#x27;s chrismas gift. It is a great deal. great coupon, and the goods is also very good. fast shipment. my dad like it so much.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for by husband&#x27;s B-day. It turns out he likes it very much. It is handle and convenient. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> my friend likes the shaver so much, now he changed his used habit shaving the other day for everyday!additionally, his wife appreciated my gift for his hus.</li>
            <li> This razor works very well with shaving cream and a wet shave. I also liked the straight trimmer it works great on my  sideburns and mustache.</li>
            <li> I replaced a 6 year old Norelco with this unit, and have been using this razor for about 1 month.  I did not see a need to spend more for the bells and whistles, and I was relieved that my thoughts were correct. It shaves closer and is easier to handle.</li>
            <li> I ordered this shaver for my father.  The price on eBay was 20 less than the best local price. The item was originally on back order however within two days I received notification that the shaver was being shipped. It arrived well in advance of Christmas. My father loves it.  He says the shave is very close and the shaver is easy for him to use.</li>
            <li> I just got a postcard from Philips saying the rebate is invalid due to other offer. I&#x27;m returning it to Amazon. The shaver is OK. I don&#x27;t have a lot of facial hair but it takes longer for me to shave using this electric razor compared to a regular razor. $20 is ok, $50 is a BIG NO NO. The ONLY reason I bought this shaver is because of the $30 rebate to make the final price of this SO SO razor to $19.97. It looks like a lot of people have called the Philips Customer Service regarding this rebate, since the customer service representative guessed right away that I bought the shaver from Amazon.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t cut at ALL. It took 30mintues to fully shave my face and I didn&#x27;t even have a lot of hair and still I had to use a razor to finish the job. So I sent it back and got my $100 back. I&#x27;ll be going back to razors. I don&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave very clean but quite comfortable. Considering its price, I guess it&#x27;s a decent buy. Get yourself a double edge razor if you are serious about it.</li>
            <li> This item was a Christmas present for my husband.  He tells me he likes it because it gives him a clean, smooth shave  and doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin.  He likes the design and it is comfortable to hold.  Very pleased with shaver.</li>
            <li> Was bought this razor as a christmas gift, I have very sensative skin and this one works great wet or dry, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like other razors do</li>
            <li> Great, affordable prices, and when I received it, when, how much I loved.If you need a good shaving partners, then I suggest that you buy 1150.</li>
            <li> The outlook of this razor is very good and the shaving is quite smooth. When my bother saw it, he said it was awesome. I like it.</li>
            <li> I bought this on November 20,2011 and Amazon shipped it to me in just days.  My last electric shaver was a Norelco Quadra action and it&#x27;s about 15 years old.  The blades on it are getting dull.  I love this new SensoTouch.  It feels comfortable on the face and in my hand.  I found this one on Amazon for $79.97 with $30 instant coupon.  Also there was a $30 mail in rebate, but I finally just got a postcard from Philips Norelco stating they could not honor it because manufacturer&#x27;s discounts taken at the cash register are not valid for rebate promotions.  Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good it&#x27;s perfect  the most important is it&#x27;s cheap enough  it&#x27;s a pity that the coupon is not available</li>
            <li> This is a good lower cost Norelco.I really love the fact that when it needs cleaning i can simply wash it. no need to do anything else .</li>
            <li> This one is quite reasonable for it&#x27;s price. With the promotion code,even you can get 30$ down,so why not choose this one?</li>
            <li> I bought it during black friday, it show on Amazon website eligible for a $30 coupon and $30 rebate. But I just got a postcard from Philips saying the rebate is invalid due to other offer. What breaks the camel&#x27;s back is that the \\&quot;return window\\&quot; expired on last week. what a timing... It&#x27;s a scam!!  In that case, why Amazon listed them at the same time?</li>
            <li> Great product - works well &amp; sideburns trimmer is good.</li>
            <li> I have owned this brand razor for years and this new version is great.  Light, long-life battery and great shave.</li>
            <li> Great! I love it!The best one that I have  ever used. A great gift. I will come again for it</li>
            <li> this product is great, easy to use and works well. I&#x27;ll buy one more for my dad.  also price is very good!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moOKIYM8WKJT0T]]1150 is charging now.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific razor. I had a Norelco before this one that finally died. It had served me well for many years but was beyond repair. This new one has a great feel and the floating head does a great job shaving. For the money, this is a winner.  The one drawback, which is minor, is that on my last Norelco the trimmer was built in. On this one, you have to swap the shaver head out for the trimmer attachment. Again, very minor and it swaps out quite easily.  If you buy this, you will be pleased with what you get.</li>
            <li> you spend the money on this and it looks all nice and good but doesn&#x27;t work as you would expect. Doesn&#x27;t shave closely and you have to go over and over areas to get a somewhat decent result, meaning i still have unwanted stubble left but at least it did something. Its a complete waste and I&#x27;m going to throw it out and buy something else, feel like I got ripped off..but lesson learned.</li>
            <li> Bought one for my dad, it&#x27;s really a great deal! Shipping is fast as usual!  I do hope there&#x27;s a black or dark blue one!</li>
            <li> This is the most powerful shaver i&#x27;ve ever used. And it&#x27;s also my first purchase in Amazon. I love it very much and will continue shopping in Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco electric shavers for several years, so I already knew what to expect when purchasing the Philips Norelco 1150X/40 SensoTouch 2D Electric Razor. As far as I am concerned, the Norelco brand is one of the best electric shavers on the market today!</li>
            <li> Bought it in black Friday. Now I miss my 7310 a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: never scratches my skin(now I really hope it does), looks kind of cool(not as good as in picture though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: shaves not as closely as 7310, now I have to take about 10 minutes to shave (before it takes only 30 seconds), looks kind of plastic (in hand)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rebate fraud: after 7 months i received a card saying they can&#x27;t give me the rebate because \\&quot;Manufacturer&#x27;s discount taken at the cash register are not valid for rebate promotions\\&quot;.  But for God&#x27;s sake I bought it online, not cash register.  Also, I know somebody bought it at the same time the same website and some of them got the rebate.  I guess Philips didn&#x27;t expect so many people bought it so they simply want to use whatever reason to get away.  what a shame&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the first rebate fraud I got and the worst shaver I have ever got.  Now I really regret that I throw away my $20 junk shaver.  At least it never took me 10 minutes to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Now it has been one year and a half and the battery is dead.  Can not charge it.  Every time I put it on the charger, the battery indicator will only blink for a couple seconds and then stops charging.  Left it on the charger for several hours and sill can not charge it a bit more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first shaver that my Dad bought me was a Phillips.  I had another 3 Phillips shavers after that.  But I was never so disappointed of it...  I guess this is it.</li>
            <li> Simply wonderful !!! This product works just as it states it does, and it holds a charge for what seems like forever. GREAT RAZOR</li>
            <li> I bought mine at Best Buy since I had a $30 coupon, and gift card to use. I was very impressed from first cut until now with how smooth and effortlessly this keeps my face clean. I have charged it 5 times since I bought mine. Today, almost a year later it still gives just as close a shave as the day I bought it. This unit was purchased for my FIL at Christmas time. He too has been very impressed with the clean shave given by this electric. He has never found an electric he could use, and since using this has been pleased. Due to medical reasons, he is no longer allowed to shave traditionally (with razors/cream) and is being forced to use electric. He said this electric has made the transition very pleasant.</li>
            <li> The razor does a good job of shaving but it does not last very long. Five o&#x27;clock shadow starts at about 3:00. For the price it isn&#x27;t too bad of a razor. Just look for something else if you want a shave that lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> use philips first time,it&#x27;s seem very nice&lt;br /&gt;look good&lt;br /&gt;l like it</li>
            <li> A very good deal indeed! at first it was on back order, but within days it became available, and the shipment was fast, my husband likes it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my father. maybe, It is the one of the most famous shaver on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve known this stuff gives extra discount occasionally. so, I was waiting for that discount. and got only $42!&lt;br /&gt;The biggest advantage of this shave, of course, is the cheapest price.&lt;br /&gt;Also, a substantial number of users of this shaver have demonstrated its quality.&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a essential choice on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;recommended!!</li>
            <li> I like this electric razor,the battery life of a razor very power and  met my expectations.Blue is very beautiful,Very powerful micro motors.</li>
            <li> First of all let me say that my husband is not a shave everyday guy. He will shave, go until he gets scruffy then shave again. He enjoys the fact that if water gets on this razor it is ok. It gets a close shave and I like it alot. He has had issues with razor burns from other electric razors in the past and this one hasn&#x27;t cause that. He has been using it for 2 weeks (so has shaved about 3 times). We haven&#x27;t found anything we are dissatisfied with yet!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband. The main reason is the $30 rebate :) which I haven&#x27;t received yet.  So far as what my hubby says it does its job and worth the money.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare this razor to any other new ones out there - I have only ever used one electric razor before this one and it was also a Norelco.  It lasted for years, worked well for me and was still working, but battery started to go.  This Norelco is made in Netherlands and appears to be very good quality.  I did not pay full price for mine - had a $30 coupon and a $30 rebate so the price was unbeatable.  Though I would say this is a good valued razor for around $80.  I feel that paying over $200 for a few extra features that aren&#x27;t necessary is silly.  Amazon has great customer service and Norelco has a 45 day money-back guarantee so you can&#x27;t really go wrong giving this one a try.</li>
            <li> I always want to buy a shaver to replace my old one, this Philips Shaver has very good design for shaving, and the price is also attractive for me.</li>
            <li> I could not be happier with my shaver that I purchased on Amazon. It was delivered to me promptly and on time. Packaging was great and the product was pristine. I use it every day and am very satisfied with the shave I get. Looks great and works even better.</li>
            <li> This Norelco shaver is great for quick dry shaves in the morning.  I have not used with moisturizers yet.  It shaves pretty close to a regular blade.  You can shave many times before the battery needs to be recharged again.  I would definitly recommend this electric shaver. The only negative thing is you have to change the head every year per manufacturer&#x27;s recommendation.</li>
            <li> I am wet shaving and my face feels the best it&#x27;s felt in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it wet or dry/</li>
            <li> This is excellent purchase, I saw the exact item in Wal-Mart for over $139.  This is a good deal and a good product!</li>
            <li> not sure if they still make this or not, but for me it wasnt too great experience using this.&lt;br /&gt;I never used electrical shaver before this one.&lt;br /&gt;it didnt shave clean, and time to time beard stuck and hurt me really much that made me scare to shave at all with this&lt;br /&gt;I changed to cheaper model from Braun, and it works so much better for me</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a more expensive Norelco that had finally, after a long life, died.  I didn&#x27;t expect the shave quality to be quite as good, but I&#x27;m actually finding that it&#x27;s slightly superior (and I do replace blades).  The fit to my face is extremely good as well.  Charging was reasonably fast, and the razor is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> I want a philips 1150X for a long time, it&#x27;s good shaver, I can use it easily, it looks very lighting.so I like it.</li>
            <li> I have other shave before, compar Philips Norelco. It&#x27;s stupid. This one  felling wonderful. It&#x27;s easy to use,charge is for 110v/220v is very helpful.</li>
            <li> i have old NORELCO electric shaver for many many years and just about few month ago it did not hold the charge,  but still works great,so i got new one Philips Norelco 1150x/40 and absolutely love it,very very smooth shaving  and price is great,besides i got coupon from AMAZON and save even more money  Thanks Amazon.M.P.</li>
            <li> I love this new shaver.  It works well with water, not to worry about electrical shock.  I would recommend it to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I will not write a negative review but this time I will make an exception I ordered the Norelco 1150x shaver because there was a specific offer in the ad that appeared in Amazon at the time for a rebate. I completed the rebate and purchased the shaver with the additional coupon offered. Now, after 8 weeks, I received a card from Philips Fulfillment Center stating  that manufacturers discounts were taken at the cash register  are not valid for rebate promotions. I read the copy of rebate form that I sent and saw nothing of the sort. Also, the rebate form was clearly offered in the listing of the item on Amazon. I want my rebate and their response is not acceptable. If there is a clear link on a listing for a product, there is no way it honest merchandising not to honor what is offered. The shaver- you can do better for the money, especially since the rebate was phony.</li>
            <li> so far so good. better than other razor I used. One charge can use for a long long long time.</li>
            <li> I just got it just as a gift for my father&#x27;s birthday.  He like it very much,Thank you!  AND we hope we can get more cheap goods fm you.</li>
            <li> i have order it three weeks ago, i have to say it works very well, and the price is very competitively.i love it.</li>
            <li> This is a really good electric razor for the price. It&#x27;s a great option in terms of convenience. It doesn&#x27;t give the close shave that bladed razors give you, but it comes pretty close and is a nice option to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;--Very comfortable to use in terms of swiveling and moving around, no snagging hairs&lt;br /&gt;--Cradle for charging is a really nice touch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;--can miss hairs and give slightly uneven results&lt;br /&gt;--razor makes an annoying high-pitched noise when charging</li>
            <li> When will you give the rebate to us? Or you forgot this matters? Please check this and give us the rebate as soon as possible.</li>
            <li> The design on the SensoTouch is futuristic. good touch feeling. Good apperance. does not snag on the longer hairs.  I like the blue color and smooth appearance. Feel like future items.</li>
            <li> This Electric Shaver Cheap and fine.Graceful appearance,color beautiful.Voice is very light,easy to use,shaving is clean.My father is very like it.</li>
            <li> I have owned various electric razors for over 30 years. This one is the best.The other razors would not shave my throat/neck area very well. Since this one has a 2D pivot and tilt capability it shaves real close without discomfort. I was also able to find a $30 instant coupon online which made the price very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I received my Norelco Shaver in two days and the product performs better than I expected.  I love it!  I also took advantage of the $30 mail in rebate offer that the company had at that time and received my rebate in about 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> Great shaver worth the money I paid for, bought with a promotional price. Elegant design and light weighted, perfect for home use or travel. Recommended!</li>
            <li> What is the daily clean shave but a form of dermatological torture, as well as a thoroughly boring process? 1150X can shave off Beards fast and well.</li>
            <li> It is a good product and excellent price, but 10 weeks passed, I still did not receive the mail-in rebate.</li>
            <li> Have had this razor for about a week and it works great in the choseness department. I had a remmington foil razor before this which is supposed to be a close shave but it doesn&#x27;t even touch the closeness of this one. I would have to shave for everyday with the foil one whereas with this one I can go about a day or two without shaving and still have a fairly smooth face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is that you will need to use some kind of lube or go with shaving cream if you want a smooth glide over your face. I have tried it wet and dry and still gets stuck in spots and have to twist or go in a circular pattern.  Other than that I highly recomend.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my husband for father&#x27;s day in hopes that it might get him to shave more than his standard once per week. I saw a commercial on TV and then researched reviews online and decided it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;His first time (and only time) using it he tried to shave with a dry face first. He kept wincing as the shaver pulled on his hairs so I asked him to try it with shaving cream. It didn&#x27;t produce a close shave on his cheeks and as I watched him shave with it I kept seeing little spots of blood emerge as he went over his cheeks and jawline. It didn&#x27;t have much effect at all on his neck hair. I felt so bad for him I told him he should stop trying to shave with it and he finished the rest of his face with his usual Gillette blade.&lt;br /&gt;I may have had better luck with the 3d sonsoTouch version...but b/c the experience with this 2d version I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll bother with electric shavers anymore.</li>
            <li> Bought this product because of the attractive price after rebate. But Philip and Amazon both failed to abide with promise on rebate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is ok, but not powerful enough. It spends me twice the time to shave compared to my prior Remington shaver. Three heads design looks fancy but not much of a value.</li>
            <li> I had the Norelco architect razor which was great when it was new but after a couple of years and head replacements I didn&#x27;t want to spend so much money again. I read the reviews on this razor and decided to go with it. It is the best. It really gives you an excellent shave and it&#x27;s quick. I rinse it with hot water after each use and it is ready to go for the next shave. It is worth the money, believe me. Buy it!</li>
            <li> Effortless close shaves. Quiet and the battery life is awesome. Have owned 5 or 6 Norelco razors in my lifetime and this is the best.</li>
            <li> very good ！very good ！very good ！very good ！very good ！very good ！very good ！very good ！very good ！very good ！very good ！very good ！</li>
            <li> i ordered the shaver owing to their rebate promise, but till now where and when they will mail me the rebate? are they cheating?</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor 90 days ago, and have been nothing but pleased with its sleek design, and elegant battery and charging lights.  The feel of the SensoTouch&#x27;s form-fitting grip in my hand, its quiet \\&quot;whirring\\&quot; sound, and fit of its  trimming heads to my neck and face are fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a display item for my bathroom, the SensoTouch gets 5/5 stars.  Unfortunately, since day 1, I&#x27;ve had to go over shaving areas 9-30 times in order to get an even, acceptable shave.  Yes, you can get a decent shave going over your stubble as little as 9 times, but you&#x27;ll be forced to bear down on the adjustable head mechanism until it bursts apart.  Fortunately, re-assembling the heads isn&#x27;t terribly difficult, and you get better at it with practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One particularly praiseworthy aspect of the Norelco SensoTouch is that your shaving performance is hardly degraded when it&#x27;s turned off.</li>
            <li> Purchased the Philips SensoTouch Electric Shaver largely in part because of the $30 Rebate Promotion..&lt;br /&gt;Finally received a postcard, first correspondence since Christmas 2011 - REBATE COULD NOT BE HONORED!!&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Manufacturer&#x27;s discounts taken at the cash register are not valid for rebate promotions..\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I BOUGHT THIS ONLINE!!!</li>
            <li> Shaver shaves well,but if you wet shave with lather it is awesome. It is as good as a razor.&lt;br /&gt;Purchased this shaver from amazon and paid less than i could find it anywhere else</li>
            <li> I used to use the Nivea Norelco, which was a bit of a pain and very messy. I upgraded to this one and not only is it cleaner, its an extremely smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver but the $30 rebate advertised on Amazon got rejected by Philips without a good reason. Either the rebate information is misleading or Philips were cheating. I would expect Amazon to investigate this issue.</li>
            <li> Bought to replace old, reliable Norelco 7340XL.  Been using it for about a week now.  Compared to that model, 1150X is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* a faster, slightly closer shave since the drive motor seems to run at twice the rpm of the 7340 (slightly louder maybe)&lt;br /&gt;* easier to clean since the head unit is far less complex internally and the base it attaches to is practically flat (not a deep bowl) with nearly flat drive nubs&lt;br /&gt;* easier to keep the handle clean since there are far fewer seams and ridges&lt;br /&gt;* about 2 ounces lighter it seems&lt;br /&gt;* easier to shave along sideburn lines because the head is a thin unit separate from the battery/handle so its clearer to see where the blade are&lt;br /&gt;* slightly more expensive to replace blades (+$5) since 1150X replacements include the entire flex head and drive shaft/springs, not just the blades, however this means more of the unit is \\&quot;new\\&quot; each time, so eh&lt;br /&gt;* same blade comb design (\\&quot;Series 8\\&quot;) and similar blade cutters so shave is similar experience (but drive shafts are NOT compatible with HQ8&#x27;s - I compared side by side)&lt;br /&gt;* slightly less convenient, separate trimmer but then again it is easier to clean too and its still trivial to swap in/out trimmer, so don&#x27;t worry&lt;br /&gt;* faster recharge time (1-2 hours compared to 8 hours) and you can get in a shave after charging just a few minutes from a zero battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, it was worth it to me to upgrade especially since the 7340XL gave me many reliable years of service so I got my money out of it by now.</li>
            <li> I Was called by Philips yesterday to tell me that my rebate will not be honored because of the \\&quot;May not be combined with other offers\\&quot; clause on  the rebate. If A rebate is being offered on Amazon, Amazon or the manufacturer need to step up and do the right thing. This is a play on words and disingenuous at best by either or both parties. I do not understand this type of behavior by manufactures: They may have saved $30 this time, but the cost to them is much higher when I do not purchase their products in the future in lieu for another brand because of the bad taste they have left in my mouth. Bad business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is only worth about $20 (what it would have cost if I got the rebate), it is not very good and would not have bought it otherwise. Philips, you are not right! i will remember this, you can bank on that too!</li>
            <li> When I ordered this product, it indicated there was a rebate. I submitted the rebate form after I received the product. After several months, I was noticed that it was a mistake and no rebate for this product since I bought it from Amazon online.</li>
            <li> I REALLY wanted to like this electric razor. I&#x27;ve been shaving since 1955, and have had everything from an Eversharp Shick Electric Razor to the first two-rotor blade Norelco to a Panasonic that was a wet/dry (which sounds like a vacuum cleaner in more ways than one). My most recent electric was purchased about 20 years ago, and it&#x27;s a Braun which is all I can compare to this Norelco 1150.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the price of blade shaving has been quite a bit higher because of the price of blades (it&#x27;s very much like color printers and ink), but one of the instructions on the Norelco box was to replace the shaving head once a year. In the area of cost, the edge - so to speak - goes to blades depending upon how tough a beard you have and how often you have to shave and change blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My preference has remained blade shaving, starting with a GEM of all things, and then to Gillette Blue Blade, Thins, Atra, and on and on up to the M3 Power Gillette. Along with Absolute Comfort Shave, there&#x27;s just nothing as close or comfortable than a blade. And yet there&#x27;s always this hope that someone will come out with an electric that can compete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now comes the Norelco 1150, the low end ($99 versus $359) of their newest line. Although it said that a carrying bag was included, I found none ... and I looked four times. Since it&#x27;s only a \\&quot;bag,\\&quot; I figured I could always use a sock to protect it while traveling. I&#x27;ve actually shaved four times, once with cream in four days, and here are my findings:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It has a quick-charge feature which is only 3 minutes, and a full charge in 40 minutes. That&#x27;s fantastic IF your need the quick charge. (My Braun is a cord model.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It is extremely quiet. In fact, having become used to the raucous hum of older electric razors, the Norelco doesn&#x27;t SOUND powerful enough to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It can be used wet or dry. I highly recommend \\&quot;wet\\&quot; using a heavy (what used to be called \\&quot;brushless\\&quot;) shaving cream which with electrics can be messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The manual states that you should give the razor three weeks before you start complaining. Okay, it doesn&#x27;t say that exactly, but it does say to use it for 21 days to get your skin used to this electric razor. Since I use my Braun every two or three weeks for quick touch-ups, I didn&#x27;t think this was necessary. Besides, I&#x27;ve ALWAYS had razor rash from electrics, and to some extent blame electrics for \\&quot;training\\&quot; my beard to go in all different directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. That said, this was VERY comfortable until I overdid the neck area. A little powder has always been soothing, and I sometimes recommend using powder BEFORE using an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. The trimmer actually trims sideburns nicely and straight, but (read CONS)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. There&#x27;s a 45 day money-back guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I get to the negatives, please take into consideration that I&#x27;ve always had a heavy beard and sensitive skin. And now that my beard is half-gray, the gray hairs are even more wiry than the black. (I must say that my two sons-in-law who were \\&quot;consulted,\\&quot; said the following: the one with a light beard said that he got razor rash from any electric. Then there&#x27;s Paul who, when he&#x27;s on a speaking tour, has to shave two to three times a day, can&#x27;t use an electric because the heads wear out in a month and he does not get a close shave. No, he&#x27;s no relation to King Kong, but fair warning to those of you who understand this situation.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Sorry, but the Norelco 1150 simply could not shave neck hair that was more than a quarter- to a half-inch long, and it was not good in what is becoming a NECK with creases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It was my attempts to get these longer hairs at the base of the neck and between my lower lip and chin that culminated in a rash. It was not as severe as my previous electrics, but it still was a .... pain in the neck. In the old days, for me this would have led to ingrown hairs. I think if you have a light beard and shave daily with this Norelco, you&#x27;ll get better results and may well love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. As I said, the razor is good, but even better with shaving cream. However, cleaning is a chore. You can wash the head after easily removing it, and you can brush the hair out of the receptacle under the heads. But, when you come right down to it, I can shave with a blade and clean up faster than with the Norelco (or any other wet/dry electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. As I said, the trimmer actually does trim and does it well. However, you have to take the head off and insert the trimmer in order to just do sideburns. This isn&#x27;t terribly time-consuming, but it is an added step in the shaving process. It also gives you another thing to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. It has a large footprint: The base for the razor isn&#x27;t huge, but it does take up enough counter space. The base has three small suction cups, two of which did not hold on our marble top even after cleaning the top. Bigger suction cups would be good, but in a bathroom where there is powder and other things that get on the counter, I wouldn&#x27;t leave it out providing I have a drawer that can take a razor that is light but bulky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Both the Norelco and my Braun do a great job on the cheeks, but the Braun does a better job on the neck. The Norelco is more comfortable, and there&#x27;s a irresistible urge to go over and over the same spots, especially now that it&#x27;s almost silent. And, surprise, the Norelco actually does a good job of getting ear hair. (Nose hair? Use a small scissors.) It&#x27;s comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not entirely fair to ask ME if I would recommend the Norelco 1150. I&#x27;ve been shaving with a blade for 55 years, and only intermittently with electrics. Considering that while I absolutely hate shaving, but don&#x27;t feel clean without having shaved, I&#x27;ll stick to the soap and lather and my trusty blades which now last a little longer than they used to. But a hundred bucks for a razor? Or go for a steam cleaned Norelco for $350? That&#x27;s a lot of bucks under any circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that the statistics are 72% blade, 20% electric, and the rest with beards (I guess). My father-in-law NEVER in 70 years used anything but an electric, and he always seemed clean shaven. If he were still alive, I might well have given him this Norelco for Christmas. In many respects - unfortunately other than closeness - there&#x27;s a certain WOW factor to the Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s as fair as I can get.irs. I think if you have a light beard and shave daily with this Norelco, you&#x27;ll get better results and may well love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. As I said, the razor is good, but even better with shaving cream. However, cleaning is a chore. You can wash the head after easily removing it, and you can brush the hair out of the receptacle under the heads. But, when you come right down to it, I can shave with a blade and clean up faster than with the Norelco (or any other wet/dry electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. As I said, the trimmer actually does trim and does it well. However, you have to take the head off and insert the trimmer in order to just do sideburns. This isn&#x27;t terribly time-consuming, but it is an added step in the shaving process. It also gives you another thing to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. It has a large footprint: The base for the razor isn&#x27;t huge, but it does take up enough counter space. The base has three small suction cups, two of which did not hold on our marble top even after cleaning the top. Bigger suction cups would be good, but in a bathroom where there is powder and other things that get on the counter, I wouldn&#x27;t leave it out providing I have a drawer that can take a razor that is light but bulky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Both the Norelco and my Braun do a great job on the cheeks, but the Braun does a better job on the neck. The Norelco is more comfortable, and there&#x27;s a irresistible urge to go over and over the same spots, especially now that it&#x27;s almost silent. And, surprise, the Norelco actually does a good job of getting ear hair. (Nose hair? Use a small scissors.) It&#x27;s comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not entirely fair to ask ME if I would recommend the Norelco 1150. I&#x27;ve been shaving with a blade for 55 years, and only intermittently with electrics. Considering that while I absolutely hate shaving, but don&#x27;t feel clean without having shaved, I&#x27;ll stick to the soap and lather and my trusty blades which now last a little longer than they used to. But a hundred bucks for a razor? Or go for a steam cleaned Norelco for $350? That&#x27;s a lot of bucks under any circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that the statistics are 72% blade, 20% electric, and the rest with beards (I guess). My father-in-law NEVER in 70 years used anything but an electric, and he always seemed clean shaven. If he were still alive, I might well have given him this Norelco for Christmas. In many respects - unfortunately other than closeness - there&#x27;s a certain WOW factor to the Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s as fair as I can get.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 45, been shaving for ages now, and I have to say, of all the razors I&#x27;ve owned that are of an electric model, this one is the first one to do the complete job.  What I mean by that is with electric razors of the past, I&#x27;d shave my cheeks and moustache area, and that&#x27;d all go well.  When it came time to shave the hair on my neck, not so good.  I&#x27;d have to do that part with a blade.  Which kind of defeated the purpose really as I preferred electrics.  I would replace the blades, tried a few models over the years, and I&#x27;d still have to do cleanup work (if not all the work depending on the specific unit) with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new one though deals with the neck hair, too.  I have thick course neck hair, a lot more course than the stuff on my cheeks, and I when I tried my neck hair with this new razor, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.  To my surprise, it worked!  I was stunned, as I&#x27;ve never had an electric that&#x27;s done that for me before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this thing five stars quite easily, and without exaggeration.  Feels nice in my hand, too.  The heads collapse and move around to contour to my face, which is probably why it works on the neck hair so well.  A lot of my previous electrics were \\&quot;hard heads\\&quot;, which didn&#x27;t contour much - if at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have hard to shave neck hair, I suggest trying this razor - it worked for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (Jan 20, 2011): I posted this review in September 2010, and after I wrote it, I continued to use the razor after that.  I can add that the battery life was most excellent.  I did not have to recharge it until early January, so the battery lasted for about 3.5 months.  Now I didn&#x27;t use it every single day, I&#x27;m a \\&quot;shave every 3 days\\&quot; kind of guy, but still.  That was a long time between charges.  I continue to be most impressed with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (Nov 25, 2011):  Still going strong.  Replaced the heads a month or two ago, and is still my primary razor.  Very happy with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (Jul 18, 2013): Still going as my primary razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (Nov 9, 2014): Still going as my primary razor. :)ul 18, 2013): Still going as my primary razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (Nov 9, 2014): Still going as my primary razor. :)</li>
            <li> I have used several different Norelco electric razors as well as a few made by other manufacturers.  While other brands seem to work better for some people, the Norelcos I&#x27;ve used have been far superior compared to any of the other brands I have tried.  This particular razor is very good for its price.  It gives me a close shave fairly easily.  I do have to go over areas several times but that has been my experience with all electric razors.  So, the amount of irritation a razor produces is what is most important to me.  This razor causes very little irritation.  Another plus is that it has a trimmer that works well.  Both the shaving head and the trimmer are easy to clean.  I have found it is very important to clean regularly (about once a week works for me).  For a pre-shave lotion you may want to try Williams Lectric Shave w/Green Tea. I am not sure what green tea does for a shaving lotion but I like it better than the Williams Lectic Shave without the green tea.  I&#x27;d recommend Williams Lectric Shave Tenderface but I don&#x27;t think it is made anymore.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver for my husband who has NEVER used an electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Due to medications he could no longer use a regular blade razor.  I thought he&lt;br /&gt;would hate it or would not give him a good close shave.  He absolutely loves it&lt;br /&gt;and most likely will not return to blade shaving, even if the medication is no&lt;br /&gt;longer necessary.  I am soooo very happy I ordered this shaver.</li>
            <li> I recently got this for my teenage son as his first shaver.  When it came in, I got tempted to try it myself.  The last time I used an electric shaver was over 20 years ago and things have certainly changed yet some remain the same.  I have been using Gillette blade razors for a number of years now (model varied over time) and did not have any problems, just wanted to try the fancy new \\&quot;blue\\&quot; electric shaver.      Pros: The Norelco 1150x/40 is very quiet and smooth and you don&#x27;t really feel the vibrations.  The shaving is also pretty good.  It does a good job on the side of the face and the chin area, while the neck part is OK.  It is still a lot better than some of the old shavers that I used to have, but the neck are is still a little tough.  The trimming attachment does an amazing job and is very easy to use.  It is a very quick click (just a pull) to remove the shaving blades and click in the trimming attachment.  Cleaning is also very easy, just pull of the blade and run it under water.  Although I have not used it for too long, the charge seems to be very good.      Cons: I still get razor burn on my neck area after using this, which I do not get from blade razors (still working on different things to try and eliminate this).  Also the shave (at least for me) is not as close as from a blade razor.      Overall, a great shaver that allows you a quick shave, if you don&#x27;t have the razor burn problem.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut me it&#x27;s easy to clean, it shaves close.  It shaves wet or dry and does a great job either way.</li>
            <li> Long ago (35 yrears), I had settled on the Norelco approach to shaving as the best for me and thought there was little else Norelco could do to improve. After all, a charge lasted for weeks, no nicks, cuts or razor burn while getting a close quick dry shave.  However, when faced with the need to replace the head on my Norelco Artic 1060 (it lasted five years) I opted to try the 1150 given a replacement head for the 1060 cost $50 and the new razor was only $89.  What a surprise when I encountered electric shaving using shaving foam! This truly changes the shaving experience.  I would recommend this razor to everyone that is tired of the nicks and cuts from using a blade.</li>
            <li> Philips&#x27; customer service sucks.... buyer beware, you will be on your own if you purchase a product from this company.</li>
            <li> amazon provided instant coupon and a Norelco-$30-rebate link on the product page, which mislead me about the potential overall savings. felt being cheated.  Lesson learned: forget about any mail-in-rebate if there is an instant coupon offered by amazon.com.</li>
            <li> The product is not that bad. But my rebate was not honored by a ridiculous reason. My two reviews were rejected and it seemed that this website does not want to publish any negative comment. I am trying to file a complaint through BBB and will update later.</li>
            <li> product itself was OK so far, but the company refused to honor its rebate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An irresponsible company that you won&#x27;t want to do business with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned 4 Electric Shavers in the past 30 years and they all suck. If you don&#x27;t mind shaving twice a day then get which ever one is cheapest as they all perform about the same. This particular shaver is worth about 20 dollars. Philips-Norelco and Amazon have marked it up to a ridiculous level. You would do better finding a $19 unit as it will work just as well. Anyone who claims that an electric shaver shaves as close as a blade is lying to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With razor cartridges approaching $5 each it is certainly tempting to consider an electric shaver as a cost effective alternative. Unfortunately, they just don&#x27;t live up to the advertising hype. It does not matter how slick/sleek they make them look. It does not matter how many hot women they put in the commercials. These things just don&#x27;t do the job. You would do better buying lottery tickets with your money as you might actually pick a winner. With electric shavers there is no chance of picking a winner.</li>
            <li> My father have had this shaver for a little over three months and it is broken. It does not lock in position. I paid enough for this product to work much longer ...... We would not purchase it again. Obviously  He is switching to a Remington foil design. The Norelco triple head razors just don&#x27;t seem to be built as well as they used to be.</li>
            <li> very good,good price good shaver</li>
            <li> I have been a razor user for 40 years.  Each time I have tried to go Shaver it failed miserably.  They just did not get close enough, and you caused such abrasion that the face felt raw.  Two thing.  I did not know that you must \\&quot;condition\\&quot; the face for 2 - 3 weeks for the face to be accustomed to using an electric shaver.  Secondly, the shavers have come a long way in getting a comfortable and closer shave.  I say closer, because they still dont quite get the same closeness of a razor, but it is an acceptable shave.  I have been using now for about 3 months.  The closeness of the shave is so much better that this is all I use now.  It is especially good on the neck whereas even with a razor I have had some trouble. All in all I enjoy using.  Using once a day I can easily get two weeks out of a charge.  The charging is simple although I would have preferred a connector for the charger on the shaver itself rather than only on the charging stand.  But, since it holds a charge for over two weeks it suites my just fine.</li>
            <li> It can be used wet&amp;dry.Charging quickly in 3 min.It costs only 69.99$ ,which maybe the best shaver in this price series.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver on April, 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the warranty; it is already dying, exactly 2 year after the warranty expired.  I haven’t been able to get more than 2 years on these Phillips / Norelco shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use them while I am taking a shower, so the chances of water getting inside them is high, but that’s what this one’s suppose to be capable of doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some water got inside and it corroded the terminals that charge the battery.  It will require me some soldering to fix it&lt;br /&gt;Also some grinding noise coming from the heads&lt;br /&gt;Motor a little bit rusting, but it is working.&lt;br /&gt;Battery still good&lt;br /&gt;Electronic board has some corrosion but no short circuits / no salts have developed between terminals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prices in Phillips keep getting higher and higher to a point that it is becoming ridiculous, so it is time to give a chance to my Chinese friends, and try one of theirs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will attempt to fix the Phillips shaver so I can get another 30 days while I look for a replacement, I will be playing some roulette and I am planning to get one of those China brands look alike, that are in the range of $24. And suppose to also be wet /dry (If the china brand lasts 1 year I am ahead of the game).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep you posted</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaver for over a year now, and I&#x27;m generally happy with it. It gives a close shave and has a long battery life - which is great if you keep it in you car for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;On the down side, using it when you haven&#x27;t shaved in a while makes for an uncomfortable shave. Other Norelco&#x27;s I&#x27;ve owned are better with longer hair and with the neck / problem areas.</li>
            <li> I never received any response from my $30 rebate submission. It has been more than 3 months since I submitted it. I guess I need to be aware next time I purchase anything from Amazon. The rebate did not give any phone number or e-mail adress once there is an issue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with electric shavers for more years than I care to mention. At the time I bought this I owned a low price Braun and a rather expensive Panasonic. Not really happy with either. I had to go over the same area many times and it still left hairs, especially in the neck area. This shaver is amazing. I bought it just so I could try a rotary shaver, but really didn&#x27;t expect it to be any better than my others. As it turned out this is the best shaver I ever owned. It takes me about 3 minutes for a full shave and the neck hairs are gone. You still must go over the same area more than once and hold the skin taut in the area you are shaving, but not to the degree where it is a problem.</li>
            <li> I bought it Nov 2011. It&#x27;s now June 2012, but I have not received any news about the rebate which attracted me to buy this product.</li>
            <li> The Norelco 6100 is amazing .gives me a close shave I&#x27;m amazed.and no irritation plus the price is great</li>
            <li> It is worth to buy such a razor.&lt;br /&gt;I will consider to buy one more if there is more discount.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice close shave.  Drawback is that it is a noisy razor.</li>
            <li> What can I say, its Norelco, I don&#x27;t care what you say, for the money you cant beat this razor. Its slick, and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;this one is good, i loves it ! Next time ，I willl get one for my friend as a present。</li>
            <li> My skin needs an electric razor and Norelco has always been the best of the lot. Now Norelco has made a new version that cuts almost as close as the blade. Thank you Norelco</li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband who refused to ever want/need an electric shaver. Was a great deal, and he loves that it can be used in the shower or out, and that he is done shaving so quickly with much less irritation and cuts. Overall, I think he&#x27;s a convert!</li>
            <li> So far so good.  That&#x27;s how I would summarize its performance.  I have been using the regular Gillette razor and after a long time tried this product and I would say that it performs as advertised.  My earlier electric shavers were rough and it gave me a sense of iritation and this one doesn&#x27;t.  It gives me a close shave and it is less painful / iritation.  The only issue is, it does take a while unlike the razor blade shaves...which is over in 30 seconds or less.</li>
            <li> I was forced to buy new shaver, because cap on my old one broke (and Norelco no longer makes it as a spare part). My SmartTouch XL 9160 XL is more than 5 years old and still works great. That was my favorite shaver. I would still go with it, if it was still on the market.    I&#x27;m not too happy with this shaver and here is why.    Philips cheap out on parts I can see that after a week of use of that shaver.    -Removable trimmer. Of cause it&#x27;s much cheaper for a company to just make it removable rather than have some kind of flipping mechanism. If you travel this is an issue for you. Carry shaver and a small part with it is absurd.  -Battery&#x27;s life of my Smarttouch is way better than 1150x. Period.  -Battery indicator. Smartouch has 5 bar multicolor battery indicator. 1150x had just one tiny light that tells you that you are screwed if it light up.  -Charging. You must have a stand for 1150x to charge it. My old one did not need a stand for a charge. I could just unplug the wire from the stand in plug it into shaver.  -Power button. Extremely stiff on 1150x  -1150x Has no skin type adjustment. SmartTouch has a wheel that has 3 positions for Normal and sensitive skin.  -1150x No head cap flipping mechanism.      Although I can not say that 1150x shaves worse. There are things which need the improvements.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Norelco shaver ever since I started shaving, many,many years ago. twice in my life I have changed brands.First time, I was given a Remington as a gift, which looked like a Norelco..it was NOT!!!!I had to give it away..  About six months ago for some unknown, insane reason, I was convinced to try a braun shaver..saw to many T.V. ads I guess.  I tried it from November 2010 until April 2011...I was in shaving hell for six weeks..Lesson learned!!..Its NORELCO or Phillips Norelco as they are called now or nothing at all. again I say, lesson learned..  In may 2011 I purchased a new Norelco 1150 model... I accually enjoy shaving..Its not a long tedious chore like it was.  I can shave my face and neck very quickly and smoothly. What a difference. also, if you have tried a Braun razor you  know what a loud razor sounds like.its like starting an outboard motor..  I highly recommend the 1150 model, depending on features you want. My next Norelco will have a charging meter to tell me how much shaving time I have left.The 1150 gives you over two weeks of shaving time so its no big deal,but like I said, my NEXT razor..Years from now..I will never buy another brand of razor..I know I sound like an ad myself, NOPE  just a man who wants to help someone learn from my mistakes .This is my first letter of praise of any kind, ever.  thats how good my 1150 is..</li>
            <li> The product falls apart when you attempt to clean it, and cannot be put back together correctly.  I would like to return it.</li>
            <li> My husband shopped long &amp; hard for a new shaver &amp; read all reviews.  He&#x27;s very happy with his decision to purchase this one...says it&#x27;s the best he&#x27;s ever had &amp; he&#x27;s been shaving nearly 70 years!!  Well packed &amp; came in no time at all.</li>
            <li> I like it. It works fine. The trimmer needs to be stored and put on separately, which means I will lose it. Handier to have it build in, but this one does have a bigger surface. Not sure needed for facial hair,etc though. Nice unit, sleek, no buttons or other items to fill with debris. I haven&#x27;t used it in shower yet. I like it, would buy again, but not as handy as the classic design. I may find more uses for it&#x27;s expanded capabilities over time. I actually use the display stand that it comes with..Slips into the charger very easily..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two Norelco shavers before, so I figured I needed an update + the price was right. After using it for a month I am extremely dissapointed with this product. It simply does not shave close. It requires going over areas multiple times and it still leaves stubble behind. I feel like I&#x27;m shaving without blades. Also, the design requires a separate trim attachment rather than having a pop up trim feature. This is a huge step backwards. Save your money and DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Pretty good price~ thx ~ ^^*Pretty good price~ thx ~ ^^*Pretty good price~ thx ~ ^^* Pretty good price~ thx ~ ^^* Pretty good price~ thx ~ ^^*Pretty good price~ thx ~ ^^*</li>
            <li> This Shaver does everything it says it will at a great price. Would recommend to those who are on the fence about manual razors.</li>
            <li> I was need a Electric shaver just only for business trip.  I usally use a manual shaver Gilette.  But, after use this shaver to test during shower,  i decide to use this.  Great value, and clean and soft shaving.</li>
            <li> Oh,it is a Very good shaver.I used 1180x,a wonderful shaver. Philips are always well for me! This time I bought to my son.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a New Year gift for my father! After a few days I will send it to my father,&lt;br /&gt;and he will be satisfied with it!&lt;br /&gt;But I am not satisfied with it!&lt;br /&gt;I missed the coupon,so sad.</li>
            <li> I have veary sensitive skin and was so excited when I purchased the 2D.  I should have listened to the negative reviews. After shaving with it what a dissapointment. I still got a razor burn from it and had to keep going over the same spot multiple times and still would not shave all of it.  Well my dog did me a favor by destroying it.  I upgraded to the 3D afraid it would be another dissapointment thinking not much has changed i was blown away!  Trust me save your money and get the 3D it is worth every cent.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves his new shaver!</li>
            <li> THIS RAZOR IS BETTER THAN I EZPECTED. GREAT RAZOR FOR THE PRICE. I HAD BOUGHT A COUPLE OF THE $39.95 RAZORS AND THEY DID O K BUT THIS RAZOR SHAVES CLOSER WITH LESS EFFORT.</li>
            <li> Close shave, easy to maintain, locking feature for travel to avoid discharge, easy cradle charge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have used it now for a month and glad I made this choice!</li>
            <li> Old Norelco needed new batteries and shaving head.  Cheaper to replace it with this unit.  Unit does the job. Not much better or worse than old unit, but shaving is not all that pleasant.  This item does not travel well due to large bulky charging tray required to charge the battery.  Old unit had charger built into cord, and cord plugged into unit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers since I started shaving 40 years ago. This shaver feels cheap in your hand and sounds cheap. It does have several bells and whistles that are nice, but do not improve the shaver&#x27;s capability. The shaving head does not cut very well. It takes many more passes to shave my beard smooth than my old Norelco. I don&#x27;t like having a separate head for sideburn trimming. You must remove the shaving head and install the trimming head. I&#x27;m seriously thinking about going back to my old Norelco shaver and just replace the blades.</li>
            <li> Very noisy.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is very disapointing.&lt;br /&gt;I will be a lot more hands on with my selection the next time.</li>
            <li> I took the advise of others and purchased on size smaller in the waist fits great. Color as ordered. Would purchase again</li>
            <li> i think its lowest price when i bought it.and i feel very suitable to use it.although this product is 2D system,its very good,shaving quickly and clean.i will suggest to my friend buying it.</li>
            <li> I have an extremely coarse beard, to the extent that my attempts years ago to use a foil-type electric shaver failed - beard hairs would not fit into the slots. Thought I would give this a try. Purchased about two months ago through Amazon. Tried several different ways - electric pre shave ( no difference) up to taking a leap of faith and using \\&quot;wet\\&quot; - in the shower with my regular shaving gel. It actually gives me an OK shave, and is very convenient for travel, airports, and end of day touch-ups.  I feel this is a good product, works as advertized, but for those times when I feel the need for an excellent shave, still will use a disposable razor in the shower.  I don&#x27;t fault the product, but rather my beard type.</li>
            <li> I must say; up until now, I thought safety razors with double edge blades were the most economical razors since there was hardly any waste other than your own blood. However upon purchasing this nice device I have found this to be even more economical than my safety razor; it not only reduces the risk of nicks or cuts but also unnecessary products, ie., shaving cream, soaps, and  brush; needless  with this tool. In addition it is much more fun to shave with than the scary de razor; I have now decided to discard my de razor, brush, and soap; I will not be needing those anymore now that I have this more up to date form of shaving; shaving my face dry is a simpler,  more convinient way to shave. Thus, by eliminating unneccessary shaving products and just using this razor to shave my face dry, it leaves less of a carbon footprint on the planet. I just wish I could have found this sooner.</li>
            <li> As the owners manual indicate, it takes some getting used to , especially, if you are switching from manual blades. It did work right out of the box and give a close shave. It was very easy on the skin with minimal irritation . Yes I would recommend this razor.[[ASIN:B003V360NY Philips Norelco 1150x/40 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver, Metallic Blue]]</li>
            <li> the colour is good. can shave any way you want.  An excellent travel companion.The result is a close shave that&#x27;s easy on your skin</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco series shaver, is wonderful product in electric shaver field. I like it, and I gave it to my friend as a gift, he also like it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very goodUse a very greatI think value for moneythere was more then 30 days already and the battery still running</li>
            <li> i use a braun and mach 3,this unit is excellent in every way. and thanks to amazon for the best price i could fine.</li>
            <li> good package.fast shipped.AND it&#x27;s the best for its price~~~~~~good present for me.so it is greatwish more goods like this~~~~~it is very useful and Convenient.</li>
            <li> I am always using shavers from philips. They are comfortable and easy to clean. And the blades last very long.</li>
            <li> Very very sharp, very good battery. Two minutes for every day, the shaver still runs quickly without charge for 1 month</li>
            <li> I cannot believe my experience of using this razor is so different from the majority of users here! I got this razor from Walmart, which after mail-in-rebate and gift card amounted to only $19.99!!! I was terribly excited as I had wanted to buy this razor after viewing the marketing videos on Amazon. I was pleased by the reviews and therefore decided to purchase it.  The reason I give it ONE star:  1) I was almost bleeding on my neck. It irritated the heck out of my skin!  2) It did not shave of the hairs on my neck cleanly, and I had to rotate it back and forth and around multiple times before it shaved the hair on my face.  3) It took more time to shave than if I were to use a normal Mach 3 razor.  4) It is not good where you have to trim, like making a straight line on the sideburns.  5) My skin was irritated during the second shave as well, when I used water and shaving cream! It wasn&#x27;t a \\&quot;REFRESHING\\&quot; shave as promoted in the videos.  Now I know that user manual said that it is normal to feel skin irritation upto 21 days of normal use, but I wasn&#x27;t satisfied by the fact that the shaving time equaled or exceeded the time required to shave when I am using a normal razor.   Return the product promptly.  I am really disappointed in this product...</li>
            <li> The electronic shaver is incredible. Not only it shaves very smooth and the result is very good, but it is very easy to be cleaned as well. You just need to use warm water to wash the head and everything. Then let it dry. I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> My husband alsways uses this brand. The price of this one is reasonable, and it shaves smoothly.  It is worth buying.</li>
            <li> happy experience. It is a good source to buy things. I received the item within the promised time frame. I am happy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband for Christmas this year.  He&#x27;s the guy who says \\&quot;I already have two Norelco razors, why would I need a third?\\&quot;  He repairs versus buying new, but I convinced him to give this one a try after telling him about the screamin&#x27; deal I got with Amazon which included a hefty mail-in rebate - making this razor ultimately 75% off. **Keep your eye out for these 2D ones on sale or clearance. 3D&#x27;s are out; costing more, and Norelco will probably be phasing the 2D&#x27;s out in favor of the 3D version eventually. Check out the 3D to compare: [[ASIN:B003V37ZDS Philips Norelco 1250x/40 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver, Black]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now after using it for a week he says: \\&quot;I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for over 40 years and this is the best Norelco ever! I&#x27;ve never had such a close shave.  I&#x27;m considering writing the company to tell them what a great job they did with this one!\\&quot;  I&#x27;ve heard &#x27;Thank you for the new razor&#x27; several times each day, making this a fantastic gift in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great feature of this razor is how quick it is to charge (about 30 minutes) and that it maintains that charge for about 5 days with daily use.  We both agree the wet/dry use is a great option, but he&#x27;s not one to change up his routine and get it &#x27;wet&#x27;.  I may have to borrow it and give that one a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a woman&#x27;s perspective his face feels much, much smoother than I can ever remember it feeling before - which I love!  The closeness of the shave makes me want to snuggle up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suffice to say that if you&#x27;re a long time rotary electric shaver user, or stuck thinking that a blade is the closest shave you can get, think again. This is a step up from most of the other products out there without the huge price tag.</li>
            <li> This shaver is of good value and nice gift for my father-in-law.  $49, a big bargain.:-)  If there is another chance, I will buy it once again for myself.</li>
            <li> Very good razor.  I have only shaved dry, but it did a very good job out of the gate.  There were a couple of missed hairs on the neck and cheek, but the larger you make the circular motions, the better it shaves.  Easy to clean.  I will try to shave wet to see if it gets any closer.  It is not as close as a razor, but the sensitive areas of my neck don&#x27;t hurt any longer from the razors after only one week.  My only complain is that I still need a groomer to thin out my goatee.  I thought the attachment to trim would come with those accessories.  If I could give a 4.5 rating I would.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a better electric shaver. This one works great especially for the price. The only down side is swapping out the head for the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver from Amazon to shave my head.  I was using an electric hair clipper before until I burned the unit out - after 10 years.  I cannot speak more highly of this Norelco unit: the quality construction, the ease of disassembly for cleaning, low noise,long battery etc. etc.  I use Edge shave cream for sensitive skin and use it in and out of the shower.  Outstanding results. It even removed 6 days of head hair with little effort. I tried shaving my face with it knowing that I have never been successful in the past with an electric shaver for my beard.  It did do a great job except my lower neck near my adam&#x27;s apple.  Left a rug burn, just like in the past. 2 days to heal.  Ouch!  I can&#x27;t blame the Norelco as I have super sensetive skin. I don&#x27;t mind sticking with a blade for my face and neck.  Very happy with this purchase for what I intended it for.</li>
            <li> buying this item on amazon was no good   prise was much higher than other locatoions  return this found much better price.  to addto my annoyance i was charged a15%  restocking fee future shopping will check  other  possibilities</li>
            <li> This is one of the best razors that i have ever used.  It shaves very close and was a very good buy.</li>
            <li> This was my first attempt at buying an electric shaver. I finally made the plunge hoping to eliminate the time and energy of blade shaving. I only have every shaved in the shower because I have a very thick beard with very thick hairs (like coarse sand paper, my girlfriend is very lucky, I know). Anyway, with the reviews on this razor, I was hoping it would solve my problem. It did not. If I shave everyday with the razor, it is just okay, it leaves hairs behind, especially on my neck. It is still irritating to my skin. The first few times I used it, my skin was red. I tried using it dry, with shaving cream, and in the shower. It leaves alot behind, and I end up having to use a blade razor to get the rest. It was not for me. That said, the most comfortable shave I was able to get was post shower with shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is more for people with thinner hairs, thinner beards, and who shave everyday.&lt;br /&gt;Kudos.</li>
            <li> I stay away from posting negative reviews but am forced to do this. I bought this hoping for a $30 rebate - the rebate&#x27;s been denied by the manufacturer; I see many others complaining about the same issue.  The product itself is not worth $50 (which is what it would be without the rebate). Slow and ineffective. Makes me very distrustful of the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> bought it during black friday, it show on Amazon website eligible for a $30 coupon and $30 rebate, however the rebate can not be combined with the coupon! In that case, why Amazon list them at the same time? Who gonna claim the rebate when the coupon is way easier to use? And the rebate is only availabe during the black friday! That&#x27;s cheating!</li>
            <li> The product itself worth the money, they were offering $30 rebate when I purchase this shaver, and I followed their instruction and send rebate form back with the bar code, HOWEVER, I didn&#x27;t get their rebate back, Philips just send me a paper saying I am not qualified for this rebate, this is ridicules and make me sad! Shame for this advertising trick!</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my frind, and he really loves it! It&#x27;s very convinient and looks cool. It can shave face clean, and is user-friendly and power-save.</li>
            <li> I bought it last year for my husband&#x27;s birthday. After one years&#x27; work, it still works well! Philips really good!</li>
            <li> I bought it, which worked well. But the rebate thing is really cheating me and other customers.I do not want it to happen again,</li>
            <li> The noise is very small, shaving very clean, face feel very comfortable</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for bf two years ago. He loves it and its still working and holding a charge.</li>
            <li> Very good. My husband like it so much and the price is so beautiful also.</li>
            <li> Norelco just is not the same since Philips purchased it. My old Norelco electric razors used to last and last. I purchased this model at SAMS and it has turned dull in less than 6 months, New blades are not cheap. I purchased a cheap corded Braun razor and are much happier with it.</li>
            <li> I LIKEI  IT VERY MUCH HAVE USED NORELCO MOST OF MY LIFE ( AND I AM 87 YEARS OLD )  THANKS FOR A GOOD PRODUCT  CHUCK</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Quiet,easy cleanup.great razor to travel with&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try you will be satisfied with results.&lt;br /&gt;Holds charge all week for me.</li>
            <li> Received item very quickly. This razor is awesome. Best men&#x27;s electric yet.&lt;br /&gt;Light weight and easy to use with or without water.</li>
            <li> This product is no good.  Don&#x27;t really give u a clean shave at all.  Plus it&#x27;s not as strong either.  In addition still having get my rebate yet</li>
            <li> Overall, very good, but the razor head is easy to get rid of, a heads scrapped, sad&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much special sales, and hope that the next $ 49 the opportunity to come again</li>
            <li> powerful look but sometime I can&#x60;t clear my  beard quickly&lt;br /&gt;I will buy more for giftI think most man like it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor for my husband for Christmas.  He&#x27;s had many electric razors over the years and has found fault with all of them, but he loves this one!  He says that it gives a close shave, is comfortable to hold, easy to clean  and holds a charge for a long time.  He&#x27;s had far more expensive razors that haven&#x27;t worked nearly as well.  The only complaint he had was that the proteective razor head cap  is flimsy and already broke after two months of use.</li>
            <li> I helped my friend to buy it, my friend said it&#x27;s a good one. Powerful and battery can last long time.</li>
            <li> very very good!!! I love it so much and I told my friends that.&lt;br /&gt;very very good!!! I love it so much and I told my friends that.</li>
            <li> Where is my rebate? I bought this as a gift because it offered $30 rebate. I sent everything out, but for months I don&#x27;t receive anything back. Yesterday, I received a letter from Philips told me they are not going to honor my rebate. Such a bad company, no trust! never buy their products again.</li>
            <li> I bought the shaving system for my husband during holidays.  The shaving system is ok but never received my $30 rebate.  I will not buy any shaving system from Philips.</li>
            <li> Becareful. Philips doesn&#x27;t honor their rebates.  I bought Philips Norelco SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver, Metallic Blue in Black Friday when Amazon was offering a $30 off. Paid $49.97 &amp; submitted the $30 MIR to Philips. After a long &amp; agonizing wait of 3 months, I got a postcard with my Rebate rejected &amp; reason given \\&quot;Manufacture&#x27;s dicount taken at cash register are not valid for rebate promotions\\&quot;. I am surprized with this reponse as the deal was for $30 MIR although rebate was advertized along with the coupon.</li>
            <li> Same as other peoples brought this product and \\&quot;No Rebate Check\\&quot; all you get from them is after 5 months from the day I submit my rebate is a stupid post card saying :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; \\&quot;Thank you for participating in the Norelco $30 Rebate promotion. Unfortunately we could not honor your request due to the folling reason: Manufacturer&#x27;s discounts taken at the cash register are not valid for rebate promotions.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- Amazon.com post this sale with instant money take off and offer the rebate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2- F%$king Nerelco or Philips should print it on the rebate form for such reason for not qualify.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3- Nerelco makes good product, this will get them bad reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4- either party suppose to responsible for such mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5- It was on sale on Black Friday 2011, This means Amazon is \\&quot;FALSE ADVERTISING PRODUCTS ON THEIR WEBSITE\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6- As a consumer we buy things onsale or price we thing is fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7- They the one who put on this price and rebate, not us, why should we as consumers suffer for lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line \\&quot;FALSE ADVERTISING\\&quot; , Don&#x27;t ever trust Nerelco or Philips rebate ever again, Even thought they say onsale after instant off or rebate would cost you a $.01 to buy!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally lost trust of this company!!!</li>
            <li> the product is good, but the rebate program is a scam. after 12 weeks, Philips told me the rebate is not valid. Never trust Philips for any rebate incentive.</li>
            <li> I have to say Philips. Has brilliant service. I bought this for my husband, he likes it but found the there is something wrong with charger. We went through at least three rounds with customer service people and changed every part of this product to figure out what wrong with. We finally get it fixed. For sure, I prefer the product came perfectly the first place.</li>
            <li> This is my second philips shaver. I bought a Panasonic ES8103S days, then decided to return it to amazon. It is also a very good product, however I didnot like its and plasitc handler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic E8103 is a very very powerful shaver, if you have lots of hard beard, you may want to go for E8103S. For me, I like the metallic color of Norelco, it did attract my attention. I decide to get this from amzon with a great deal. Overall the norelco is a great product.</li>
            <li> i bought this elcetic shaver for my husband, when he got it,he was very pleased,it let him fondle admiringly.And it is cheaper than other site.</li>
            <li> I bought it at $59.99.&lt;br /&gt;A few days later，&lt;br /&gt;No more than 15 days，&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s  $29.99.&lt;br /&gt;I fell very bad</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend for Christmas. He had a razor that was 4 years old and really needed a new one. This works fine for him, but, it takes him twice as long to get a close shave as his old razor. The upside is this razor does not cause as much razor burn as his old one did even when it was brand new.</li>
            <li> Sleek, modernistic design.  It gives a very close shave.  Amazingly you can wet shave or dry shave with this electric razor.  Hav always been a fan of Norelco and this product will keep me coming back.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research and discovered (after a few purchases) that the Women&#x27;s Razors weren&#x27;t very good. So I started looking into Men&#x27;s razors. What&#x27;s the difference, anyway?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, there is actually a difference. My fianc&amp;eacute; used it and it was amazing for his face and he loves is. But on my legs and bikini area its a no go. It&#x27;s very slow for legs and circle motions in the bikini area actually drew blood from me. So, ladies, keep in mind that there is actually a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fianc&amp;eacute; is extremely happy with his. But for me, the search is still on.</li>
            <li> Works very well - good shave. Easy to remove the head from the shaver for washing it clean. Quick charging time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an expert on electric razors so I do not have much to add, but it works great for me.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas present for my Dad. He&#x27;s on loads of blood thinners and has to be careful not to cut himself. This is has given his a great shave and no razor burn.</li>
            <li> Very smooth shave.  Skin is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s after done shaving.  Easy to use and clean, and holds it charge very well.</li>
            <li> This have and ergonomic shape and metal sheets that endures many many many uses. I have used this many years daily, and is still working good.</li>
            <li> My Dad loves this gift as well.  It is very easy to clean and he says it gives him a real close shave. Awesome!</li>
            <li> very good shaver meets expectations, easy to handle and clean, good battery, nice design recommended, very good accessories good good</li>
            <li> the shave is close (and that is why you buy a razor), but the overall construction feels flimsy comparison to my 3 older Norelco. Metal is switched for thin and flimsy plastic. the older models also last longer on a substanially longer charge. not sure if i would pay this much again. But the shave is close, not sure how long the shaver head will last, again thin plastic replaced metal. My old one (forgot the model) lasted 15 years with the original battery and only ! head change. Cleaning regularly is essential.</li>
            <li> Very good product, i like it very much，also my baby. It is very comfortable to use.I would recommend this product to friends.</li>
            <li> it is nice ,and I like it, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it .</li>
            <li> For the cost that is asked, It is not even remotely as decent as it should be. Out of all the electric razors I have had (3), this is by far the worst. It has so many quirks, and the &amp;#34;ergonomic&amp;#34; design does not contour as it should. Even the amount of facial hair left after shaving leaves me frustrated and ending up using my razor. As for doing this with or without shaving cream, the difference is slight to none. It feels as if without shaving cream you&#x27;re constantly dragging your skin and irritating it more then necessary. With shaving cream you&#x27;re just moving the cream along your face and almost no hair is removed. As for the accessory provided for lining up your hair or facial hair, not even that does he trick correctly. Very unhappy with this purchase, If I could return it I would.</li>
            <li> I tried it once. It seems it is much easier to use from former model from same company. You will need to shave few times to cut to the end but it is sure it slides on your face like cream on hot bread. I liked the previous model, I like this one.</li>
            <li> Well, I wanted to try it out because of its unique look. I have owned previous Norelco shavers and they all seemed to work well but this one was easier to handle and it gets under your chin and neck easier. I like it and would recommend it to others. If you haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver before you&#x27;ll probably have to wait about 3 weeks to see the best results.</li>
            <li> I have owned Norelco razors before. This one cuts even better than the older models and ypu can shave in the shower as well.</li>
            <li> Perfect gifts to give as gifts worth buying, delivery very quickly, perfect packaging quality, value for money,i like it very much</li>
            <li> I got one for my dad, uncle and grandpa. They really liked it. It was easy to use and gave a close shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Philips Norelco arcitec 1090 Men&#x27;s Shaving System since December, 2007. I&#x27;ve enjoyed the 1090 and use it regularly whenever I use an electric shaver rather than a blade. This review will serve as a comparison between the two Norelco shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost: The 1150 is considerably less exepensive without taking any special offers or discounts that may become available into account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bells and Whistles: The 1090 has more bells and whistles. It has an LED display that shows you how much time is left before recharging is necessary. The 1150 does not. The sideburn trimmer is attached to the 1090. With the 1150 you need to change the shaving head to attach the trimmer. The 1090 is a bit easier to clean. You can just flip up the shaving heads and clean it quite easily. With the 1150 you need to remove the cleaning head off the body of the razor in order to clean it out. It isn&#x27;t difficult by any means but it does take just a little more time for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shave: My experience has been that the 1150 gives me a much cleaner shave and does so in less time and with less effort than the 1090. This may be due to the curved shaving heads that seems to follow the contours with more efficieny. This is particularly true in those areas underneath the chin and jaw-line. I have to do less stretching and craning of the neck to make sure the shave is completed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: For me the lower cost and the more effective shaving experience outweighs the bells and whistles found on the 1090. For those who like the bells and whistles you may prefer the 1090. So if I&#x27;m looking to pick one to take on a trip or for when I need a quick shave I&#x27;ll take the 1150.</li>
            <li> Feels good on the face. Great design. That said, however, I have a sparse light beard that should be easy to get a close shave. With a better electric razor I don&#x27;t have to shave but every other day. Not with this model. This razor is at best O.K. Suggest: spend the extra money and get a couple of steps up in quality.</li>
            <li> Purchased 2 items from Philips because of the rebate.  After 2 months received 2 postcards in the mail explaining that they could not honor the rebate because \\&quot;Manufacturer&#x27;s discounts taken at the cash register are not valid for rebate promotions\\&quot;.  I called Philips to explain that no such wording is on the rebate form.  They could not find the rebate form so I faxed it to them.  They then indicated that I would get the rebate.  But 2 months later I got a similar postcard that the rebate could not be honored. Not a very honorable business.</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit on line from Amazon. I have been using Norelco razors since 1980. This one is the best so far. It gives me close smooth shave compared to the previous one arcitec. No razor burns.Easy to clean.The only negative is that you have to take out the shaving unit to insert the trimmer.I am satisfied with its performance</li>
            <li> This razor is a gift for my husband. My husband liked it, and especially easy to use. If you have hard to shave neck hair, I suggest trying this razor - it worked for me!</li>
            <li> Work&#x27;s okay, but would really have to shell out more money for a better electric razor. Only plus is the rechargable base.</li>
            <li> It is not touch skin closely. need to put pressure on razor to cut at skin.  Cheap material for mechanical parts.</li>
            <li> Awkward to use and have to change heads to use trimmer. Just has lost a lot of convience compaired to the older design. Doesn&#x27;t travel as either.</li>
            <li> Good for the price, package is also nice.&lt;br /&gt;Received on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;I feel very comfortable when I am shaving&#x27;, he said.</li>
            <li> My daughters boyfriend loves it. Claims it gives an excellent shave &amp; is very convenient to use anywhere &amp; wet or dry.</li>
            <li> This is my second electric shaver. My first was a Braun shaver that cost me about $80, that shaver was very good. This one feels cheap, sounds weak, and doesn&#x27;t cut thicker hair very well. It almost doesn&#x27;t work at all for dry shaves, does much better with foam/creme, but still not very close or clean. Charging is quick though and the charging cradle is simple, but elegant.</li>
            <li> Actually bough tit for myself (legs) because the size made it easier for my bad hands to hold..However is is NOT good for legs..I cleaned it up and gave it to my son-in-law, he loves it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. The design is gimmicky at best. The charging mechanism is a joke. The charging base looks and functions like it was designed by a middle school student. I regret my purchase on every level. If you want an electric shaver, get an inexpensive low end model (just make sur it has a lithium battery).....Don&#x27;t waste your money on this shaver that brings nothing noteworthy to the table.</li>
            <li> this expensive razor worked fine for 3 weeks, now it doesn&#x27;t shave at all.  and of course it waited until the return period expired, so I am out $90.  BAD  PRODUCT</li>
            <li> You have to remove  shaver head to use trimmer . not all that  great. my old razor was much better</li>

            <li> If you need a razor you need to seriously look at this one. I&#x27;ve been shaving 40 yrs. and it&#x27;s the most comfortable razor ever used!!</li>
            <li> Shaving isn&#x27;t uniform as to cutting all whiskers. It misses even when going over. Shaving is too long and not very good.</li>
            <li> Great product, would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this per my husband!  He like the new shaver very much.  No more nicks from the old one.</li>

            <li> I ordered the shaver for my husband as a surprise birthday gift.  He has been using a really old electric shaver.  He was Absolutely!! happy with this new shaver...he loves it and it does a excellent shave, He also, is happy that he can use shaving cream and water...his face is so smooth!! :) total worth the SURPRISE!! and price...</li>
            <li> The razor work just fine. I am not so happy with the design of the charger. It is difficult to stay upright. But the razor I would recommend.</li>

            <li> I have excited about this product and gone through all the reviews and bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It need multiple times for clean shave, not worth to money</li>
            <li> The razor is great. It was a gift for my granson. There was an issue w/ the shipping, but I contacted the vendor and they were GREAT in resolving it! Thanks, Blue Ridge Books N Gifts!</li>

            <li> Wow, better than you think.&lt;br /&gt; Very good quality.&lt;br /&gt; Fast delivery, good stuff, thank you very affordable price.</li>
            <li> It works very good on my coarse beard, easy to clean and when charged, it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> been buying electric razor like crazy,decided to switch to gilette&lt;br /&gt;now i have the norelco its my one and only shaver&lt;br /&gt;gilette&#x27;s motto is the best a man can get&lt;br /&gt;then norelco shaver should be the best you will ever get</li>
            <li> Very comfortable, but unfortunately they cut prices!Now 30$ coupon!But I have only 10$ coupon only... I should waiting. Cry~ :(</li>
            <li> The razor works okay but doesn&#x27;t shave as close to what I was expecting. Just expected it to be more efficient.</li>
            <li> Buy a gift to my friends, my friends love it.&lt;br /&gt;The price is very affordable, very easy to use, he said.</li>
            <li> Have not bought this product, but unless you are 100% sure you will like it I would not recommend buying it since Phillips Norelco return service is non existent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Philips Norelco QT4070 Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Mustache Trimmer Pro.  It mangled my beard, was disappointed by figured hey I have a 45 day risk free warrantee I will just return it.  Then found out the 45 day risk free warrantee is worthless since they can&#x27;t seem to email, snail mail, or fax a form to return the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy another product from Phillips Norelco and would strongly recommend that no one else does, until they fix their customer service.</li>
            <li> This razor more tha met my expectations. It functions much better than my two previous Norelcos. I would definitely recommend the product.</li>
            <li> Amazing shave - guaranteed, anyone who purchases this razor will not be disappointed ..!&lt;br /&gt;One suggestion: Include a battery charge level indicator in future models.</li>
            <li> Just started to use , but so far I really like it and is doing a good job for me</li>
            <li> gives a good clean shave, is easy to clean and water can rinse it with out hurting any of the moving parts.</li>
            <li> Very good shaver, good quality, good price, easy to use. Everything is fine.&lt;br /&gt;I like it very much. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This Norelco is great. It shaves close and is easy to use. It came with a beard and sideburn trimmer. This is an attachment not a popup.</li>
            <li> It looks so nice!  I bought it as presents for my dad! I think he will love it very much!</li>
            <li> it has beautiful color and looks very good!It&#x27;s the gift for my husband&#x27;s birthday, My husband like it!Good thing! THS!</li>
            <li> I had a Philips shaver. When I need new one, I choice Philips too. 1150X fit me I think, it is OK.</li>
            <li> I bought at a very reasonable price. It works well all along! It is a excellent product! I loves it!</li>
            <li> I always wanted to have the flexibility of not having to stand at the sink and shave. I tried other electric razors years ago, but they were never very good. Could never get a close shave. This Philips Norelco 1150 is great. It shaves close and it does it fast. I can even take it in the car if I&#x27;m running late. And the first charge lasted for almost a month, after daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> The head bends well with the contour of the whole face and shaves nice and smooth without giving a rash.</li>
            <li> Very good, very suitable for me, work is good and cheap. I really like it.Very good, very suitable for me, work is good and cheap. I really like it.</li>
            <li> Just ok no to impressive does the work like any other ones, a bit to pricy for being so simple</li>
            <li> this is a gift ,and he said it is  a very good product for man,everything is perfect~he like it very much</li>
            <li> This was one of the presents I got my husband for Christmas, he has been wanting one for years, but I wanted to be sure to get one that did the job, no complaints.  He loves that he can have it precharged and take it on the road with him.  Holds the charge very well and gives a nice close shave, plus no mess!  Heads collect the hair!  Can be used wet or dry. Very stylish, quick to charge, and fast delivery, brand new shrink wrapped in the box.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my dad and he loved it. He said its quite and keep the face clean.</li>
            <li> I may not have gotten used to this new shaver. It does not seem to give as close a shave as my older Norelco did. I like the way you clean the rotary blades, and I have not tried using it as a wet shaver.  It will take some time to appreciate it&#x27;s finer points.</li>
            <li> Awesome buy very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> Cheap and easy to use. I&#x27;m Chinese,and I need it,that&#x27;s why I bought it on amazon. Everything is very good, very satisfied with the shopping, I will recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> The shaver is great. I don&#x27;t care for the requirement to replace the shaver with the trimmer. I liked the pop-up trimmer better.</li>
            <li> My husband is extremely pleased with this shaver! He grew a beard this winter and I bought him this shaver for his b-day. He loves it! He can not say enough about it! He uses it and keeps making me feel his face. LOL he is 50. And says it&#x27;s the best shaver he has ever owned!</li>
            <li> The design on the SensoTouch is quite futuristic, with a blue front, curved body, and perched shave head. It fits comfortably in the hand, and has a rubber ridge that runs around the edge for added grip (especially useful when using the shaver wet). The shaver has only one button on it, the power button, which is flush with the front of the shaver face. On the shaver front are also three indicator lights. They display low battery, battery charging, and control lock status. The control lock lets you disable the power button to prevent it from accidentallyturning on (when traveling for instance). One annoying aspect of the shaver&#x27;s design, however, is that it is close to impossible to lay the shaver down without it turning on its side, and then dumping out some shavings onto the counter. You just have to remember to place the shaver back in the charging base if you have to stop mid-shave.</li>
            <li> It is a good razor. Very comfortable and easy to use. Hasn&#x27;t given me any razor burns and the shave is much smoother and closer than I expected from an electric razor</li>
            <li> I am using for more than 2 years now, I feel this is a great product from Norelco. I have thick body hair and it does it&#x27;s job effectively like a razor would do. One issue is that, you need to hold in one particular angle from skin to make a smooth painless hair removal</li>
            <li> Had mines for over a year and still works like a champ.</li>
            <li> For Father CI thank God for what I havehristmas, dad is very happy, something good!Hope that the Amazon could do better, make persistent efforts!</li>
            <li> This razor works great. Never had any problems with this razor and always a clean shave. Skin feels good after using this</li>
            <li> you will find the 3D may be even better but if you think about 3 times the cost of 3D .. this 2D must be better for 90% of the user and the performance is amazing and the battery life is also excellent. good for Philips!</li>
            <li> Razor came apart beyond personal repair.  I followed directions per manual and the rotating blades fell out as did the blades frame.</li>
            <li> One of the better razors I have had, had a few over the years.  Easy to hold, lightweight, cleans well.  Holding up well, been using it for over 6 months, glad I got it.</li>
            <li> Have had great success with this shaver, it hasn&#x27;t completely eliminated my use of a straight razor (I have a tough beard) but it using it in combination with my straight razor, I don&#x27;t go through blades as often. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Useful, can be recommended, with every morning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like philips small appliances&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend my friends to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very comfortable feeling</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Philips Norelco shavers before, and this one is pretty much the same. They all shave well enough and I mainly use them when I travel (about 10~12 times a year). I don&#x27;t take the charger with me and they all last at least a week. I&#x27;ve never had any quit on me. I use them in the hotel showers and they work well. At home I use a standard wet shave (Dollar Shave Club razors with the Dr Carver&#x27;s Shave Butter. Outstanding.) Anyway, back to the review... I have a heavy beard and they never have any problems with mowing the grass. Takes longer than a straight shave, but that&#x27;s to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My issue is this: How long before you can&#x27;t get the replacement blades for this model? With every razor I have, the *only* reason I have purchased a new one is because I can&#x27;t get replacement blades for the one I have. After a few years, they stop making replacement blades and force me to buy a new one. Shame on Philips Norelco for that. The shavers are nice, but the company forces you to buy a new one every so-many years.</li>
            <li> Nothing beats the razor I guess</li>
            <li> A newer design which traded off the in-razor trimmer for a separate, attachable trimmer.  Not as convenient. And, the newer shaving head is in my opion much more difficult to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Returned unit for credit.  Prompt credit issued by Amazon.</li>
            <li> Still getting used to it. It shaves much closer than my previous unit but I haven&#x27;t perfected any technique yet so I am not 100% satisfied with the shave.  The shaver itself feels good but has two design quirks: it flops to the side when you set it down; and the charging cord cannot be plugged directly into the device so you can&#x27;t grab a quick shave if the charge is low.  You can do a \\&quot;speed charge\\&quot; in a few minutes - but that just adds time and if you&#x27;re running late... It could easily be solved with a port in the shaver into which the charging cord could be plugged.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for only 54 years (true, since 1960) and always found them excellent, but this one is the best.</li>
            <li> I have used many electric razors, both dry, and wet &amp; dry.&lt;br /&gt;The Philips 1150 x40 is one of the very best I have ever used!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gift to my friend, and my first time to buy this kind stuff. I really like its appearance and performance as described.</li>
            <li> Purchased this over a year ago.  The razor itself works decently, but I&#x27;ve found a few flaws.  One being that there&#x27;s no way to \\&quot;lock\\&quot; the head into place, so if you are an aggressive shaver you will eventually end up popping the head right off.  The second one, which is the worst in my eyes, is that the plastic on the body can break or flake off.  While at the bottom of the razor isn&#x27;t a huge issue, my razor has actually had the plastic broken right by the on/off button.  There&#x27;s actually a hole where the plastic has broken off and more cracks spidering from the top of the button as well.  I would not buy something like this again unless they changed a few things for the next generation.</li>
            <li> basically, my usage feedback after couple months are  -  it is not standing out while comparing with other low end Philips shaver, it is quite stylish, but considering the actual shaving performance, I just gave 3 starts.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable product. My friend have used this shavor for about 1 month now. Everything goes well.&lt;br /&gt;This meets our needs.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, I like it very much.Shaving is very clean, and hurt less than the face.I will give his family purchased separately.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to the face, light and waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;Only slight problem is that you have to charge the razor before shaving, or you have to hold a base to shave while charging.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older Panasonic, and once I got the feel for using it, I&#x27;m quite happy with it. It&#x27;s a lot more quiet and I don&#x27;t have to press as hard to get a smooth shave. It comes with a separate trimmer you have to attach, but I find that too cumbersome, thus I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I really liked this item, is an excellent state, new,works  perfectly. Nothing to complain about it. I really recommend it</li>
            <li> Purchased this shaver as a backup to my Brawn. I&#x27;d been successfully using various Braun shavers for abou 20 years and wouldn&#x27;t have even considered purchasing this one except for a combination coupon/rebate deal which made the price too good to pass up.  Once it arived I tried out this Norelco it once or twice to test it out and wasn&#x27;t overly impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then almost a year later my Braun died and I swithced over to using this shaver on a daily basis. I still wasn&#x27;t overly impressed for the first week or two of daily use. I always used my Brauns without any skin prodcuts but I quickly discovered I needed a preshave lotion to facilitate a smooth shave with the Norelco. Then I remembered it was a Wet / Dry shaver and decided to give it a try in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, the shower is where this little puppy shines. I use a little hand soap lather on my face and voila, this shaver works like a champ. My shower shave is quick and close and best of all I&#x27;m doing it while staying comfortably warm in the shower. I get 2-3 weeks of shaves out of it before it needs recharging and I&#x27;ve had no problem with soap buildup on the foil since I make sure to briefly rinse it out after each shave. The soap &amp; water also provide excellent lubricant which facilitates a faster shave. It may sound odd, but I can move the shaver around my face faster with the soap/wather greasing the skids, so to speak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m extremely please with this Philips Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li> Quite cheap and easy to use...  With coupons, the price is the lowest and the product is so easy to use</li>
            <li> My friend is so satisfied with his new shaver.All my colleagues gathered round me when the parcel was sent to my office. Some urged me to order for them immediately.  I promised I will do if its price goes down again.</li>
            <li> This is Norelco razor is the best of all the Norelco razors that I have bought over the years. I have always bought Norelco razors and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> The motor does not run very fast, but is still OK. I like its color and design. Good for the price. I bought it twice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, a typical razor. I&#x27;m pleased with it but it&#x27;s nothing to scream about.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco SensoTouch electric shaver is very nicely designed and constructed.  It shaves closely, but does have a few annoying design elements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design on the SensoTouch is quite futuristic, with a blue front, curved body, and perched shave head.  It fits comfortably in the hand, and has a rubber ridge that runs around the edge for added grip (especially useful when using the shaver wet).  The shaver has only one button on it, the power button, which is flush with the front of the shaver face.  On the shaver front are also three indicator lights.  They display low battery, battery charging, and control lock status.  The control lock lets you disable the power button to prevent it from accidentally turning on (when traveling for instance).  One annoying aspect of the shaver&#x27;s design, however, is that it is close to impossible to lay the shaver down without it turning on its side, and then dumping out some shavings onto the counter.  You just have to remember to place the shaver back in the charging base if you have to stop mid-shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of, the shaver charges somewhat unconventionally.  It has a base that you drop it into and it charges through contacts on the side of the shaver.  A complete charge takes 1 hour, and lasts 40 minutes.  The low battery light alerts you when there are 5 minutes of shave time left.  The only disadvantage to this system is that you cannot use the shaver while it is plugged in.  If you&#x27;re like me and put off charging till the last minute, you may find yourself out of juice when you need to shave in a hurry.  A quick charge feature allows you to charge the shaver for 5 minutes, and get 3 minutes of shaving time, but sometimes 5 minutes is more than I have when I&#x27;m in a rush.  It would be nice if there was a charging port on the shaver itself to use it corded as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving with the SensoTouch is kind of odd at first.  The shaver puts very little pressure on your face.  At first I didn&#x27;t think I was pushing hard enough to get a close shave, but it was shaving just as close as any other electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  Indeed, you can push as hard as you like, but it never feels like you&#x27;re pushing down hard.  I&#x27;ve learned to use the SensoTouch with a light touch, and the payoff is a close shave with less irritation.  The shaver head pivots smoothly in all directions, and the three shaving heads pivot individually as well.  The shaver screens have holes for shorts hairs and slots for longer hairs.  Indeed, I had no problem getting a close shave on the contours of my face and around my goatee.  The shaver can be used wet or dry or with shaving cream.  I only ever used it dry, as I had no need to attempt a closer shave, and liked the convenience of a dry shave.  Lastly, you can pull off the shaver head and pop on a trimmer head.  The downside to this setup is that the trimmer is a separate piece, whereas most shavers have the trimmer integrated into the shaver itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the shaver could not be easier, after each use you simply pull off the top plate of the shaver head and run water through it and the shaver head.  When a more intense cleaning is needed you can disassemble the entire shaver assembly and clean out each rotary blade individually with the included brush (I actually throw the blades and heads into the dishwasher on a sanitize cycle to get them extra clean).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all... a smarty styled shaver that gives a close and comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;09/27/2010 Update:  I&#x27;ve noticed that even if I don&#x27;t shave, and let me beard grow for a few days, the shaver still shaves very closely and does not snag on the longer hairs.  My old shavers used to snag when I didn&#x27;t shave every few days.enough to get a close shave, but it was shaving just as close as any other electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a [[ASIN:B000PKKAGO Philips Norelco arcitec 1090 Men&#x27;s Shaving System]] since December, 2007. I&#x27;ve enjoyed the 1090 and use it regularly whenever I use an electric shaver rather than a blade.  This review will serve as a comparison between the two Norelco shavers.    Cost:  The 1150 is considerably less exepensive without taking any special offers or discounts that may become available into account.    Bells and Whistles:  The 1090 has more bells and whistles.  It has an LED display that shows you how much time is left before recharging is necessary.  The 1150 does not. The sideburn trimmer is attached to the 1090.  With the 1150 you need to change the shaving head to attach the trimmer.  The 1090 is a bit easier to clean. You can just flip up the shaving heads and clean it quite easily.  With the 1150 you need to remove the cleaning head off the body of the razor in order to clean it out.  It isn&#x27;t difficult by any means but it does take just a little more time for cleaning.    The Shave:  My experience has been that the 1150 gives me a much cleaner shave and does so in less time and with less effort than the 1090.  This may be due to the curved shaving heads that seems to follow the contours with more efficieny.  This is particularly true in those areas underneath the chin and jaw-line.  I have to do less stretching and craning of the neck to make sure the shave is completed.    Bottom line:  For me the lower cost and the more effective shaving experience outweighs the bells and whistles found on the 1090.  For those who like the bells and whistles you may prefer the 1090. So if I&#x27;m looking to pick one to take on a trip or for when I need a quick shave I&#x27;ll take the 1150.</li>
            <li> The razor itself is pretty basic. It has a nice simple stand and indicator lights to show that the razor is charging / charged, etc. The cutting action isn&#x27;t superb but sufficient. I used this razor at work for the occasional missed spot or when I have stumbled out of bed.    I am not a fan of electric razors because of the cost to benefit ratio, but they have their place. In my drawer at work.    I do like that you can pop off the blade and rinse it - just not so sure how this will effect the long term usability of the blade (we all produce oils and dead skin cells that the razor will pick up and lodge into the blades) - I would imagine that some detergent should be used with the blade for more intense cleaning. This will certainly be necessary if you plan to use it everyday.     If you want an everyday electric - get a unit with the cleaning unit and spend the money on a more expensive unit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pretty pleased with this shaver.  It&#x27;s not the top end of the new Philips Norelco line, but it also isn&#x27;t $300+ and in that regard it provides a very nice counterpoint to today&#x27;s blade shaving systems.  I&#x27;ve dabbled here and there with electrics over the years but have mostly stayed with the disposable-blade system.  Yet over the past few years I have become increasingly disenchanted with the cost of the disposable blade systems - every iteration in the disposable razor \\&quot;blades  race\\&quot; brings increasing prices of the blades and lessening durability along with the \\&quot;new, 23 blades and shaves your dog too!\\&quot;  For me, it&#x27;s at the point where the cost, year over year, is essentially even or better with this razor.    As for the razor itself, it has done a nice job for me - not perfect, but nice. It seems to do a better job with shaving cream (I use a gel), but that may be largely imagined because it glides so much more easily.  Philips claims that the best results will be seen after several weeks of regular use - and I&#x27;m getting close to that, so we&#x27;ll see.  The higher end shavers might do better with floating heads or multi-pivot as opposed to the two-dimensional pivot of the heads on this razor.  It hasn&#x27;t been a big problem, but I think it is probably holding it back from that truly close shave - or at least from not having to do multiple passes.    In these several weeks, I&#x27;ve run the razor on one charge.  I have found it to be exceptionally easy to clean - much better than electrics of yore.  Plus, I&#x27;m a shower shaver and it works just fine in the shower - it is not happy as a purely dry shaver.  Overall, I think it is a very solid entry at this price point.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent razor.  The shave was very close and smooth.  It was comfortable and caused no irritation whatsoever.  It also fit well in my hand.  The razor was the quietest one I&#x27;ve owned, it comes with a 45 day money back guarantee, and on top of all that it has a quick charge.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This is a decent shaver, but I didn&#x27;t find the shave itself to be particularly close compared to cheaper electric shavers that I&#x27;ve had: it&#x27;s about the same.  It certainly isn&#x27;t as close of a shave as a non-electric razor, but of course you wouldn&#x27;t expect it to be.  I&#x27;ve tried it both ways: dry and wet (with shaving cream), and prefer wet but I really didn&#x27;t notice much of a change in closeness of shave, just a change in overall comfort.    I&#x27;ve never been a huge fan of &#x27;flexible&#x27; shavers, and it took some getting used to, to achieve the best results.    One place where this shaver does not work very well at all, is the neck.  Even short neck hairs can be tough to remove with this product.    Cleaning is pretty easy, it&#x27;s easy to open the main attachment, brush with the included cleaning brush and rinse.        I&#x27;m not a big fan of the charger.  Yeah, it looks stylish, and it charges fast if necessary (quick charge feature in a few minutes allows it to be used at full strength for a bit), but it feels unnecessarily cumbersome.  I prefer the simple &#x27;plug in&#x27; charger on other models.    The trimmer does its work great, but you have to remove the main shaver head and insert the trimmer.  Not a big deal, but I prefer the convenience of a trimmer included in the shaver itself rather than as a separate attachment.    One comparison I can make is with the much lower priced (~$40) 7310 / 7310XL razors also from Norelco.  For half the price, you get as good of, if not a better shave from the cheaper product, with almost none of the inconveniences.  The trimmer is better for detail work on the 1150x/40, and it looks far more stylish, but in the end that&#x27;s not worth $60 more to me.</li>
            <li> I believe my dad will love it</li>
            <li> Excellent buy. High quality. Replaceable head ensures long lasting use. Definitely worth the extra money. Easy to maintain. Only drawback is awkward charging setup.</li>
            <li> If you happen to have to shave everyday like most military then this thing is perfect, no more replacing razor blades or forgetting to buy any this is always there. I have fairly sensative skin as well and this doesn&#x27;t give me razor burn. Easy to clean and care for and one charge lasts about a month or so. Perfect for daily shaving.</li>
            <li> It works well, shaves my face well cleans up easily. So far no complaints. We shall see over time how well it stands up to daily use.....</li>
            <li> It looks perfect, charged quickly. But when I used it I found this razor a little noisy than expected at this price.</li>
            <li> I had to return my razor. What Amazon or norelco don&#x27;t really tell you is you half to take the head of the razor completely off to attach the mustache trimmer.  My advice is DON&amp;#34;T BUY THIS ITEM.</li>
            <li> it works well and meet my expectation</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the shaver.  Reading other reviews was helpful.  My previous shaver was also a Norelco and I liked it, so I stuck with a winner.  Also, the price is good.</li>
            <li> Do not feel very easy to use, yet my old clean shaven, the other is only charging cradle too much trouble</li>
            <li> Gave as a christmas gift, not sure of a review at this time.  Only used once as of this date.</li>
            <li> WET or Dry.......... He says it one of his best Christmas gifts ever.. New Senso Touch(2D) is the one WE got for him.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve already have one，just bought it for my father，it&#x27;s really good，except one corner of the box was ruined by express</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25.I like the color and the style.The more important is it&#x27;s suit me better than the last razor I&#x27;ve used&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the amzon and philips</li>
            <li> Good product with reasonable price, there are no reasons not to love it so far!  I want to buy it again!</li>
            <li> Not using yet, but this is a good price to buy this product, it&#x27;s a present for farther-in-law. I will add more details a while later.</li>
            <li> The razor does pretty well on the sides of my face, but on the chin and neck I have to apply a great deal of pressure. A lot.  Sometimes it still leaves a good deal of residual hair behind if I don&#x27;t check closely. That&#x27;s never good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it handles well. Cleans easily,  keeps a charge and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space.&lt;br /&gt;Next time will invest a little more money,  although for $100 you would think you would get a good shave without too much worry.</li>
            <li> Did not get as good a shave as I thought I should from origianl shaver.  Complained to company.  They sent me a new shaver head which I am still evaluating.  All in all, I  would have to say that I am satisfied and they are standing behind their product.</li>
            <li> I replaced an earlier version and the new one is easier to use and does a good job of getting all the whiskers.</li>
            <li> I have an older Norelco razor that gives me a closer shave. I made a big mistake buying it, but it took too long to find that out.</li>
            <li> AFTER 2 YEARS,HAD TO REPLACE THE 3-BLADE HEAD,NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR FROM SHAVING &amp;#34;WET&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT RAZOR,CAN&#x27;T BEAT PHILIPS-NORELCO</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few razors and the triple head Norelco have worked best for me.  They never get as close as a regular bladed razor, but you never cut your self either.  It&#x27;s a trade off I am happy with.  I don&#x27;t use this in the shower, so I can&#x27;t comment on how waterproof it is, but it looks well sealed.  I got a great price so I am very happy.  This great price also means that when it comes time to replace the blades the cost of the replacement blades will be  substantial compared to the purchase price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;08/2013 update - I updated my review by dropping a star.  The reason is due to poor design destined to fail, and it did.  One of the nice features, which I never used and now never will, is that the shaver is waterproof.  The entire front face of the shaver is cover by some sort of plastic.  You turn it on and off by pressing a printed logo on the plastic.  That means that the plastic has to flex every single time you turn it on and off.  Unfortunately the plastic is not up to the task and the plastic cracked.  The shaver still turns on and off and works as before, but since the plastic cracked it is no longer waterproof.  In fact is worse because now the circuit board is exposed.  I can see the crack continuing to open up till the plastic fails all around the switch.  That will eventually leave a huge hole.  It&#x27;s too bad as this was otherwise a good shaver.</li>
            <li> not a lowest parice to buy it,but i love it,it&#x27;s bravo.--a chinese buyer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very happy with this razor.  It doesn&#x27;t work very well unless you use the cream that comes with it.  Even then it takes longer to shave than with my old (much cheaper) razor.  What is even worse is that the shaving gel goop builds up inside of the razor head so you have to spend about 5-7 minutes extra to clean it after each use!  What a time waster.  The shave itself is pretty smooth but only if you use the cream.</li>
            <li> HATE IT .I LOST MONEY! CHEATING LIED ADDS. NO MORE PURCHASE FROM IT. I NEED MY MONEY BACK. REALLY! REALLY</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco for years and felt it was time for a new razor. This razor shaves good but not as well as I was hoping - I guess I over sold by the commercials. All that said I feel the razor is worth the cost. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> The Phillips Norelco 1150X/40 gives a smooth and comfortable shave.  I had an older Norelco that finally quit.  This is the first on I have bought in 15 years and It is lighter and easier to use than my old one.  I would recommend this to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I have a young teenager who was starting to look a bit scruffy until I purchased this razor from Phillips Norelco for him.  After months of unsatisfactory shaving with a safety razor, I&#x27;ve heard nothing but praise from him about this new razor.  And he looks better too!! :)</li>
            <li> Tricks you into pressing harder then you should for you do not &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; the shave. You will either love it or hate it. I used it for wet shaving (but lost it and did not replace it). I use another Norelco for dry.</li>
            <li> This is my first Norelco, after using many other traditional shavers. It delivers a very close, comfortable shave, especially, using some hot water and a small amount of shaving cream. It looks great, is ergonomically designed, and gets alot of shaves on a charge. I charged mine on Dec. 26, and it&#x27;s still running on that charge on Ja. 17. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT HAVE ANY CHARGING LIGHTS TO SHOW IT&#x27;S CHARGING OR TO SHOW IT&amp;#34;S FULLY CHARGED.  ALSO NO SIDE TRIMMER BUILT IN . BOTTOM LINE IF I HAD IT TO DO OVER  I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT THE 3-D ANY SUGGESTIONS ?</li>
            <li> I like the ergonomics of the razor &amp; it shaves better under the jaw , but the shave doesn&#x27;t last.  I have to shave every eve.&lt;br /&gt; w/ this razor &amp; I can go every other day with my old Philips  7810 XL ( I think that&#x27;s the model #) and the old one seems to have higher RPMs !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ll still use the new one, but wished I&#x27;d just bought new blades for the old one.</li>
            <li> its good.&lt;br /&gt;my father likes it .it the best shopping experience i have ever had. a nice gift.&lt;br /&gt;i will choose it for next year.</li>
            <li> Very nice, the price is Very cheap,I really like it very much,and I hope you can continue to buy it at this price</li>
            <li> this is the second one i bought,this time i want to buy a new one for my friend.so i bought this again.</li>
            <li> i am not a big fan of electric razors so when i had a chance to review this, i thought i would try them again.  wow, norelco really came through.  i used this in the shower, on my legs and it gave a perfect shave.  it&#x27;s easy to hold, even when soapy.  you can use this with or without shaving cream.  it has a pivoting head and glided over my knees and ankles perfectly.  i also had my hubby try it on his face and he really hate electric shavers more than i do.  he says they never get his neck area smooth.  well, he tried this and even he was surprised at the close shave.  he especially liked it because he can use it in the shower, which is where he does shave.  it got his neck smooth, smoother than any other shaver he has tried.  he uses disposable and he says he still likes that the best but he said if he had to buy any shaver, this one would be it.  he is a marine and very particular about his appearance.    i personally love this and it seems like they really improved the electric shave.    it&#x27;s convient and quiet and gives a smooth shave.  i love it and will continue to use it on my legs.  great product !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed by the Philips-Norelco after a week of usage.  Note, I&#x27;m not the hirsute type, and I usually use a Gillette Fusion every 1.5 days or so.  With the Norelco, I get a shave that&#x27;s even closer than that of the Fusion, and can last me 3 days before shaving.  The primary downside of the Philips-Norelco is that shaving takes about 3x as long as with my Fusion razor.  I experienced some razor burn upon initial usage, but after the third or fourth time, the 1150X felt very comfortable.    OVERALL DESIGN: The recharging station/stand is a slim cradle with a small footprint, which easily fits in any bathroom.  I liked the addition of 3 miniature suction cups at the bottom of the cradle, and they provided surprisingly good grip without requiring much depression of the cradle.  The cradle comprises two electrodes which connect to the shaver on the sides.  The rechargeable battery here is a much-appreciated Lithium-Ion, which can hold a full charge for 40 minutes of continuous shaving, or about a dozen overall shaves.    The 1150X shaver itself is sleek and comfortable to hold.  It fits my smaller hands perfectly, and has 4 buttons on the body, comprising a main power on/off, travel lock indicator, battery low indicator, and charging indicator.  The 1150X was supposed to come with a travel pouch, but it was nowhere to be seen.  However, since it comes with a travel lock, a travel pouch isn&#x27;t terribly critical.  The shaving unit has 3 circular blades mounted on a head that can pivot, tilt inwards, and flex outwards.  The system is described as \\&quot;2D\\&quot;, but I&#x27;m not sure how it differs from the more expensive \\&quot;3D\\&quot; models.  This 2D 1150X appears to be able to perform all the mobile functions of the more expensive models.    OPERATION: Flick on the power switch, and you&#x27;re ready to go.  I find I really need to stretch my skin to get a good close shave.  It takes a bit longer to shave than a straight razor as previously mentioned, but the shave is very close.  I usuallywet shave, by applying the usual shaving cream, and running the shaving unit under the faucet.  The 1150X also comes with a trimming accessory for trimming sideburns and beards, but I found the trimmer to be completely useless.  I resorted to my Gillette Fusion to shave my sideburns more efficiently and speedily.  There was initially some razor burn, but this quickly subsided by the time I used it a third and fourth time.    CLEANING: Just a quick word about cleaning; it&#x27;s very easy to perform here.  Just pop the top of the shaving unit off, and run it under the faucet.  A cleaning brush is provided.  Since this is an entry-level model, it does not come with the jet clean system, but a quick run under the faucet is more than sufficient to clean the 1150X, unless you&#x27;re Chewbacca.    PROS:    - Close shave  - Comfortable grip  - Long battery charge  - Li ion rechargeable batteries  - Compact design and small footprint base cradle  - Easy to clean    CONS:    - Shaving takes longer  - Trimmer useless  - No travel pouch    Since the 1150X is the entry-level model of the SensoTouch line of shavers, I was curious as to what features are missing from the 1150X as compared to the higher end models.    The 1150X is missing a replace shaving heads indicator, cleaning indicator, and full numeric battery level indicator.  The paint jobs on the more expensive models are also glitzier, with a larger usage of chrome.  The more expensive models also include a larger capacity battery with shaving time up to 1 hour on a full charge, and a standby duration of up to 20 days.  Lastly, the more expensive models supposedly have a better cutting mechanism, and a jet clean washing system for automatically cleaning the shaver.    Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the 1150X.</li>
            <li> Received this shaver yesterday, and had a chance to play around with it. It is very ergonomic, easy to hold. None of my other electrics have ever done well on my neck, yet this 1150x has no problem. The head does a wonderful job of adapting to your face to get as many hairs as possible; you can even use it in the shower! The shaver gets 5 stars. However, to plug it in, you must dock it in the cradle. This may make it hard to travel with, although this is somewhat mitigated by a 40min battery. It also doesn&#x27;t come with a case. One other qualm is the trimmer. The head of the shaver pops out and can be replaced with a trimmer instead of the trimmer being on the back of the unit. This however does make it a bit easier to use the trimmer, since the unit is so easy to hold. I love this shaver so much I am contemplating getting another for travelling. You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this shaver, and if you are, Norelco offers a 45 day guarantee.</li>
            <li> This is my first battery powered razor.  I do not have beard, have only light mustache which I shave everyday.  I just charged the razor once, been using it for 3 weeks, and still works good.  I am very happy with this razor.</li>
            <li> Buy the Sensor Touch 3D instead.</li>
            <li> it works ok. I would say it doesn’t produce the cleanest shave. The charging stand is a bit annoying thought. its not convenient to travel with and the contacts are very sensitive. sometimes I leave it to charge only to come back and see that it wasn’t charging.</li>
            <li> a litte expensive.it is good.</li>
            <li> Using for a few days now and so far the ONLY problem is that below the chin its hard to maneuver and get a good shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: wet and dry shave, i recommend wet shave using minimal shaving cream, but dry is just as good, its well built and charges relatively fast, not faster than using a blade but at least you aren&#x27;t buying blades all the time.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco SensoTouch electric shaver is very nicely designed and constructed. It shaves closely, but does have a few annoying design elements.</li>
            <li> I bought this on at the time thinking that it would be an improvement to my old electric shaver.  For the first 3 or so shaves, it seemed to do a pretty good job.  Then I noticed it was taken me longer and going over the same areas multiple times.  Now, it takes twice as long as my old razor when it was dull.  And even then, it still misses spots and is more frustrating than anything else.  I will say that the battery does last a long while at least.  Other wise, this was certainly a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Meh, this is expensive and doesn&#x27;t work that well. I used this electric razor and then immediately switched to shaving with regular blades because I have had enough with electric razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like shaving for a half hour and shaving the same spot 30 times this is the razor for you.</li>
            <li> Great, quality is good</li>
            <li> this is nothing better than an electric face massager. I have used Norelco shavers since 1967. They have become progressively worse over the years. Whether I use this in the shower with shave cream or soap, or at the sink with shave cream or electric pre-shave lotion, the shave is terrible. Takes 10 minutes and still leaves stubble. Save your money.</li>
            <li> Good price and good service.But only one problem that the plastic cover is too brittle. I want to buy a new one if necessary.</li>
            <li> I bought this one is as present for a firend, based on his feedback, It is easy to use, he also recommend his friend to buy this product, the price compared to other product is very good.</li>
            <li> Nothing on this Earth beats a blade, but this razor is sleek, smooth, gets close enough, &amp; i&#x27;m a very happy customer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry purchased my 11/28 2011 from Wal Mart &amp; Had 21/2 year warranty , Well my Shaver stop taking charge 7/25/2015 . Used the Razor twice week . Come on man less than 4 yrs , Contact NORELCO talked to online Rep was instructed the Head in unit was bad . Give me a Code dclm13e7118 to used at online NORELCO on line store will the code has expires , Thinking twice BEFORE Buying another Norelco Razor, I hope this one last longer than 2yrs</li>
            <li> Returned it.  It irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this razor!     After about a year of searching for a great quality product at a reasonable price (for full-time college student), I am delighted with my final choice.   After just over a minute every morning, my face is clean-shaven and smooth. I love that it&#x27;s water proof, so I can shave in the shover. I wish I could afford the Senso Touch 3D since it has a few more extra features, but this is a great alternative at this price.    I gave this product 5 stars for what it is. Yes, the $299 model is amazing, but for the price and the results, this razor is a 5 star in my book.</li>
            <li> My husband wanted an electric razor. I did the research. [[ASIN:B003V360NY Philips Norelco 1150x/40 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver, Metallic Blue]] It looked great! We charged it and it worked, for less than a month! Yesterday my husband went to shave and ... It literally didn&#x27;t work! As in no juice, not a peep. So, after writing this review, I will arrange to send it back.</li>
            <li> Having used cheaper electric shavers in the past, I was amazed at how close of a shave I could get with the SensoTouch 2d. With a dry shave, the shaver works alright but not great.  I found the best results by simply wetting my face and then rinsing the shaver with warm water, thus getting a very close comfortable shave.      The only negative is that you cannot use the shaver when plugged in, which can be inconvenient if you forgot to charge the shaver.  But I am assuming this is because the shaver can be used in the shower, so therefore has to have a way to charge that&#x27;s waterproof.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my father as a gift, he love it</li>
            <li> I have used Norelcos for more than forty years and have yet to be let down with a newer product.  Each of the past ones has simply worn out after many years of regular use.  Great product!</li>
            <li> better shaver than the previous Norelco....  each new model seems to do a better job!</li>
            <li> It is OK, not excellent. Unpractical not to have the trimmer together with the shaver. I hoped it would do a closer shaving, but for the price I believe it is a good deal.</li>
            <li> I have been using a cheapy $30 model for a couple years.  It tears my face up and leaves it itchy and red.  But could just never bring myself to pay hundreds for something better.  Then I finally decided I had to because I got to where I put off shaving for as long as possible.  I narrowed down my choice to the Philips 2D and 3D.  I&#x27;m sure the 3D is all sorts of amazing, but I&#x27;m not super obsessed with getting the most super close shave possible.  The 2D is terrific, it&#x27;s smooth, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my face/neck irritated.  Glad I didn&#x27;t waste the extra $100 for the 3D.  I still have to go over some spots a few times to get every last hair, but nowhere near like my cheapy model.  And really the only reason I&#x27;m taking off a star is because this one is a little harder to get right under my nose.  Something about the design of the heads I guess.  A little more effort there gets it done, though.  Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The shaving head&#x27;s design is not suitable to shave the upper lip area (difficult to manoeuvre). Routine cleaning of the shave head is difficult since disassembly of the blades is too cumbersome. Foil shavers such as Braun provide a much eaiser and closer shave.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this razor! I have always used electric razors for ease of use, and this one by far cuts the closest, when compared to the others (but the others were also cheaper x.x). The only major cons that I have for this razor is that the charger makes an annoying squealing noise while it is charging (like a CRT TV being turned on) and the trimmer is an add-on.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product and I am loving the experience. Worth the price and finally there is something that leaves little rashes on the neck post shaving. Thanks to Philips for finally bringing out a product in the market that is pure delight!</li>
            <li> I was using a Braun shaver and it was terrible. It took forever and I never got an even shave. This Phillips is the best e-razor I&#x27;ve ever used. Warning, use a light touch or you can cut yourself.</li>
            <li> I UPGRADED FROM OLDER NORELCO SHAVER. AT FIRST I WASN&#x27;T SURE I&#x27;D GET A CLOSE SHAVE, BUT I GAVE IT TWO WEEKS AS NORELCO SUGGESTED AND NOW DO . IT DOES TAKE SEVERAL PASSES TO GET A REALLY CLOSE SHAVE, BUT MY FACE IS NOT IRITATED FROM THE CLOSENESS AS IT WOULD BE WITH A FOIL HEAD SHAVER. I FIND THAT THE WET SHAVE FEATURE IS NOT FOR ME AS THE SHAVER ALWAYS FEELS WET, EVEN AFTER OVERNIGHT. I LIKE THE QUIETNESS,EASE OF CLEANING AND QUICK RECHARGE.</li>
            <li> As they have for 50 ears,  the best shave  you can get with an electric razor.   I had one a long time ago but this new one is so updated.  the battery charge lasts a long time thru more than 15 shaves.   Best buy I have made in a long time.    cal white</li>
            <li> So far so good. I only hoped it would be easier to shave my neck... But that is an issue I have with any shaver, so I don&#x27;t blame this one :-p</li>
            <li> I have one of these razors.  Although not purchased here, I am submitting this review because I am a frequent Amazon customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After less than 6 months of use, a part of the drive mechanism in the lower half of the head fell off in the sink when I took the cutters off to wash then.  The part was a small triangular piece that is pressed on to a drive shaft that spins the cutters.  It does not appear to be repairable, and the entire head would need to be replaced - probably more expensive than it is worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although a Norelco user for decades, I&#x27;m switching to a Remington foil design.  The Norelco triple head razors just don&#x27;t seem to be built as well as they used to be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco electric shavers since around the time that I started shaving, close to 40 years ago. I&#x27;ve gone through a progression of Norelco models. They&#x27;ve always been well made and usually last for many years. Eventually, the battery begins to lose charging capacity or a new \\&quot;must-have\\&quot; feature is introduced that compels me to buy a new one. My most recent shaver, an 8140XL, was still going strong after years, but it wasn&#x27;t shaving quite as well, probably because of worn blades. I was weighing the option of buying replacement foils and blades (and expensive proposition) or going for a new model. The SensoTouch 2D models looked interesting and were not outrageously priced like some of the newer 3D 1200-series models. But, I was sceptical that they would do a dramatically better job than my existing shaver.    I&#x27;ve never had good results with shaving around my neck. I&#x27;d always end up with some stubble and missed spots. I guess that I learned to live with it. On my first use of the 1150X, I was amazed with how well it followed the neck contours and it really did a noticeably better job of getting the chin and neck stubble off. After three weeks of ownership, I&#x27;ve been very impressed. These really are the best shaving results that I&#x27;ve ever encountered with an electric shaver.    I do have some concerns. The attachment point from the shaving head to the body looks like it could have some mechanical stability problems. I do note one recent review which mentions that this piece broke after 6 months of use. I hope that that experience was an outlier. I&#x27;m also annoyed that the new design requires one to use the charging stand when charging the shaver. In the past, you could plug the charging cable directly into the shaver. This new design is awkward for travel. If I&#x27;m gone for more than a week, I really would feel compelled to take the charging stand and AC adapter. The stand looks like it could get crushed and break in my luggage. This was a poor design choice, though I suspect that Norelco went in this direction to enable the shaver to withstand water when cleaning.    Those concerns aside, I&#x27;d recommend this series of SensoTouch 2D shavers.</li>
            <li> It is a very nice razor,I mean I like it since I receive the package.Original (MADE IN NETHRELANDS)product,higher quality than its cheaper models which from China.It is a gift to my friend,I do not use it,so I do not know if it works fine.However it looks nice</li>
            <li> Better than other razor I used. The battery last quite a while before recharge. and razor gets close shave. Very good!</li>
            <li> The best razor I can get.</li>
            <li> Easy to use but not so good as I thought. I think it&#x27;s fine for young people to use. Not recommend for elder guys</li>
            <li> as a chrismas gift to my boy friend, he love it very much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;will go back to another one ....yeah</li>
            <li> The price of this product in China is the equivalent of $353, and here, I am bought with $60, the price is very good, and the most important is that the razor is very good, my husband told me, this is I bought the best razor!</li>
            <li> The shaver didn&#x27;t accomplish what I was looking for. It nicks my husband when I try to shave him. The recharger is a real pain in the neck it doesn&#x27;t sit in the stand as other electric razors I  have had do it always falls over and it a nusence. I am thinking of returning it. Not sure if I can now I have had iet over 10 days, but believe me it is not something I would recommend to anyone. It is just horrible to us. a disgusted customer Rosemary Mariotti</li>
            <li> bigest prob i have with it is the bracket for charging it is very dificult to keep making good contact where it willcharge right</li>
            <li> This is my third or fourth Norelco.  Most have lasted well and shaved adequately.  And all were from the $40-50 class.  I couldn&#x27;t stand to shell out enough for the newest top of the class, but I wanted to move up in the price/quality menu.  So I bought the top level of the last generation (senso touch 2D -- new class is the 3D).  For the price ($86 I think), I am happy.  It&#x27;s the best electric I&#x27;ve had.  It provides a closer shave in less time (less passes).  Andit holds charge better (aided by less time shaving). That said, it&#x27;s not so good as to be revolutionary or anything.  It&#x27;s still an electric razor.  But I like it.</li>
            <li> The razor is the best one in my life. I bought this one three times. One for me, one for my father and one for my brother. It works so good.</li>
            <li> i purchased it as a gift for my friend. It should be an official and certificed one so it is ok.</li>
            <li> So It cuts hair, it shaves your face and/or your head. What do you want it to do, shine your shoes? I&#x27;ll talk to them about it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had one of these for several years and I&#x27;ve replaced the cutter head once. The unit recently developed a crack in the area around the push button that turns it on. Big deal, I don&#x27;t shower with it anyway. ( you cannot kill yourself with a cordless shaver, don&#x27;t ask :-) I like the old one so much that I recently replaced it with another one. Haven&#x27;t used it yet but it&#x27;s the same. I suppose I could crack the new one but then how would I tell the difference?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a cancer survivour and until I was diagnosed I had hair down to the middle of my back. Shaved it before the chemo got it and my wife likes it this way! After being married to her for 46 years I&#x27;m not going to fight with her now so the Norelco 1150X/40 really does save the day.. You can use this unit either wet or dry. I like it dry myself. Does an excellent job.</li>
            <li> ive always gone with norelco electric shavers for their quality. My last one lasted 4 years and still worked when i bought this one! I keep my head shaved everyday, and this shaver is so good that you can get a very close shave for even your head. I&#x27;m very happy i upgraded to this one after having the last 1 for 4 years. Great product.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t get a close enough shave and left me feeling itchy, and red. I&#x27;m going to see if i can return this.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work with my father&#x27;s thick beard.  I purchased another electric razor that cost $130...and that didn&#x27;t work either!  I finally purchased one of those small shavers for goatees, and shaving around the ears and stuff...and it shaves his beard really well!!  $14.00!</li>
            <li> The pivoting head is definitely a step up from my previous razor.</li>
            <li> Broke after two months.</li>
            <li> the head are very easy to break</li>
            <li> a father&#x27;s birthday gift, he loves it!!!</li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor and I am very happy with it. I did quite a bit of research into electric razors before I  bought this and that has definitely paid off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving from a traditional razor to an electric has a adjustment time which has been extensively written about on the web. It took me around a week to get a good shave and a couple of weeks before I was totally satisfied. As the product documentation says, try to use it on every shave instead of switching back to your old razor in between. It is fairly quiet and smooth to use. One of my favorite things about the razor is how long the charge lasts - I shave daily and one full charge lasts me around 3-4 weeks. This is great because I don&#x27;t need to carry the charging stand etc. on my travels. Cleaning is easy (I don&#x27;t have the jet clean system) - just take the razor head off and place the blades under running hot water for about 30 secs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great purchase.</li>
            <li> This gets close to the skin and leaves a good clean look. It does not get as close as a razor but is great for use in between.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so good, so cool ,it&#x27;s more cheaper than the store,as good as the store,so i love it ,that&#x27;s all</li>
            <li> Does A great job just what I was expecting I also like being able to clean it with runnig water</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with it.It is rather light.This is a gift for my dad.I hope he will like it.It would be better if  it was much more cheap.</li>
            <li> I love it. Very easy to use products., The family is a good choice as a gift to a friend.Next time will buy.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I got tired of regular razors. I have bough a lot of them and different brands. I have a thick beard and it grows fast. The Norelco is good but it is not like the commercials show. I have to shave in all directions to get all(most) of the hairs cut, but when it does cut them it is very close. I started using it with my shaving cream / wet but now I use it dry and it works good.</li>
            <li> easy to use. nice shaver. use it every morning. The battery is durable too. Sometimes it may to some time to shave tidily.</li>
            <li> Bought this razor because they offered a great deal with rebate making it only about $20.  Then Norelco would not honor the rebate saying it made the product too cheap.  So ended up paying more like $60 for it.  If I had only paid $20 for it I may still think it was only worth $10 if that tells you anything.  I have owned many Philips Norelco razors in the past and they have been great razors for me this one just was not.</li>
            <li> It has very nice color, shape and function! Package is good! I got it at a discount price during holidays.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Seller was excellent to deal with.  Wish it got as close as a blade but no electric can do that.</li>
            <li> exxelente maquina de afeitar le queda la cara suave y sin irritacion,recomiendo este producto justo lo que yo buscava ok</li>
            <li> Let me start out and say; what a pile of junk. I have an old Remington 3 Head rotary. it wasn&#x27;t the most expensive model, but it was good and I had no issues with it. Unfortunately the internal batteries no longer would hold a charge and it time for a new one. I did my research and thought the Philips Norelco 1150X/40 SensoTouch 2D Electric Razor was going to be the one.  Man was I mistaken. I&#x27;m use to a rotary head shaver and this one is sad. It doesn&#x27;t have anywhere near the cutting capability; leaving a lot of hair unshaven on my face. I also noticed that the foil heads had nowhere near the same number of holes as my old shaver. I shaved one side with this new one and shaved the other with my crappy Remington and the Remington gave me a closer shave. The blades on the Remington are 6 months old too&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The things I disliked about it:&lt;br /&gt;1. The floating head arrangement is cheesy and doesn&#x27;t float as well as other rotary shaver I&#x27;ve had. They way they pivot really does not contour to you face. It&#x27;s a limited \\&quot;2D\\&quot; shaver.&lt;br /&gt;2. I had to go over my face multiple times to get the same shave I did only once with the old shaver&lt;br /&gt;3. You need the base if you&#x27;re traveling because it&#x27;s the only way to charge it.&lt;br /&gt;4. The charge indicators don&#x27;t tell you when it&#x27;s fully charged and kinda hokey.&lt;br /&gt;5. Noisey and felt under-powered.&lt;br /&gt;6. The trimmer is a separate attachment and it&#x27;s pitiful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really had high hopes for this and it totally let me down. Look for something else to shave with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update: 02/16/14 - I ended up with the Philips Norelco AT830 Powertouch with Aquatec Electric Razor and what a difference. It works well on my face and actually gave me a closer shave. The trimmer is built in and it&#x27;s quiet. Been using it for a week and very impressed so far with no negatives. Feels better built and more solid then the flimsy 1150.</li>
            <li> Quality is very good, style is very good-looking. Shaving is very soft. The sound is very light&lt;br /&gt;.Later will buy this brand</li>
            <li> Have used 3+ years and still working well !</li>
            <li> great product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t trim my hair well at all. I&#x27;ve got an old trimmer that I use that works much better, and I guess I&#x27;ll continue to use it. I like its ability to work in the shower or with shaving cream/gel, but it&#x27;s just not effective at removing hair (wet OR dry), and isn&#x27;t that what this thing is meant to do? Even the trimmer on it won&#x27;t really trim my hair that well, much less the three shave heads.</li>
            <li> Fast, thorough and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I have bought at leat 4 Philips and this is the worst. It does not shave close AT ALL. It looks cheap, feels cheap and lacks quality. For the price, I expected better. Even a 20 pounds shaver I bought in the UK some years ago shaved better than this one. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> good price good quality</li>
            <li> High cost of a Philips electric shavers, discounts are also very affordable, in line with my request, the effect is also very good use</li>
            <li> I used this for more than 1 year, it&#x27;s with good quality and easy to use. I am happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my son. It is his first electric razor, he has only tried it once. He said it works great! It is lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for about 20 years, and using an electric razor the whole time. I&#x27;ve shaved with a blade maybe 10 times in my life. This is the fifth electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned, and all have been Norelco.    The most recent shaver I had before the 1150x was a Norelco 8140XL which I bought close to five years ago. I&#x27;ve replaced the blades before, and the blades were getting dull again. I decided that due to the age, the battery was probably going to go out sooner or later, so rather than pay $30 for new blades, I&#x27;d invest in a new shaver. I selected the 1150x and I&#x27;ve had it for about 3 weeks.    I&#x27;m definitely getting a smoother shave with the new shaver, but I think that&#x27;s probably due to the new blade rather than the shaver itself. The 1150x does a better job on my neck than the 8140XL. The \\&quot;SensoTouch 2D\\&quot; means the blades push in and out and flex to the contours of your face better. However, I think the 8140XL did a better job on my upper lip. But generally I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s about the same overall. I think the closeness of the shave is about the same, too - maybe the 1150x slightly closer, but again I&#x27;d bet that is due to the new blade and not the shaver.    Some other reviews mentioned the amount of counter space the shaver takes up. In comparison to the 8140XL, it&#x27;s roughly the same amount of space.    The 1150x is more difficult to clean. With the 8140XL, you just pop the top which is on a hinge, empty any excess hair into the wastebasket, rinse the whole thing under warm water, and close it back. The 1150x has a detachable head, and then you have to separate the blades from that and rinse two pieces that are separate from the shaver itself. Still not that hard, but more troublesome than the 8140XL.    I generally shave in the morning and leave the shaver in the charger after I finish shaving until the next morning, so never have trouble with charging. However, I did notice that while it&#x27;s charging it makes a faint high-pitched hum. It&#x27;s not loud at all and I didn&#x27;t even notice it until the fourth day I had it. The hum goes away when it&#x27;s not charging (if you remove it from the charger, or after it finishes charging). Never had a hum with the 8140XL.    Generally I think this is a good shaver, but I think I liked the 8140XL better.</li>
            <li> Purchased this shaver for my husband as a Christmas gift and he loves it! Stunning appearence as the picture shown on web and my hubby said it&#x27;s handy and smoothy when shaving although i will never have a chance to try:). Also good Amazon delivery service, they deliver the item on time with DHL so that i can always track my package online. Happy online shopping exp, good service and good shaver, recommand!</li>
            <li> Love that this can be rinsed clean, very easy.  Love that this will shave with a wet face.  My face needed no adjustment time for this new razor.  All other razors needed 3 weeks to phase in.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> This shaver take off the hair and nto the skin as my screen shaver did. I love it. style. handling, charging, design - over all wonderful</li>
            <li> I have not given it the full month and a half trial yet. It shaves OK for an electric (I have been shaving with a mug and brush and modern blade razor for 50 years) but it leaves my neck severely irritated</li>
            <li> I had been using a micro screen shaver for the last few years. It had always been a fairly irritating shave. It also took some time just to get a good, clean shave. This shaver is quite a step up both in terms of comfort and ease of use. It takes me significantly less time to get a good, close shave and it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve been trying to shave my face with sandpaper. I have been using my norelco for about two months and would only be happier if it actually had a pop-out trimmer, but I knew this when I bought it. I would recommend this shaver to anyone with no caveats.</li>
            <li> This is the first Norelco shaver that I have used in many years. It does a great job. Instructions are a little unclear but like it overall.</li>
            <li> Best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Using it is like a massage of the face.  Easy to clean, but use care in taking off shaving head.  I pried mine off and it fell apart.  But Philips replaced it quickly under the warranty.</li>
            <li> IT WORKS GREAT,AND IT&#x27;S EASY TO CLEAN.100 PERCENT SATISFIED! I WOULD RECCOMEND THIS RAZOR AND THE PRICE WAS JUST GREAT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used batteries or electric shavers, razors only, but when I buy the Philips Norelco remain quite satisfied with the results, I do not mistreat my face, does not irritate the skin and does not feel his beard after shaving</li>
            <li> It is very strong and durable!Easy to use!New Year&#x27;s gift for myself， I like this products very much!but no Invoice</li>
            <li> Well, good price, is the most cost-effective to buy commodities. Performance is very good, worth having.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS RAZOR FOR MY 90 YEAR OLD BROTHER---HE TOLD ME TO GIVE HIM MY 2 YEAR OLD NORELCO FOR THIS ONE.---I DID.  I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR OVER SIX-MONTHS AND THIS IS THE BEST, BEST, BEST, ELECTRIC RAZOR I HAVE EVER USE.  I TRIED A BRAUN, BEFORE THIS RAZOR, AND IT DID NOT GET THE JOB DONE.  I HAVE HAD PHILLIPS NORELCO SINCE 1984, AND THIS NEW 1150/40 IS THE BEST RAZOR I HAVE EVER USED.  ALL U DO IS SHAVE, PUT IT BACK IN THE STAND, AND NEVER CHARGE IT.  WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS RAZOR IS IT SHAVES YOUR FACE LIKE A GILLETTE RAZOR.  I HAVE BOTH AND THE SHAVE FROM THIS 1150/40 IS AS CLOSE AS A BLADE.  I LOVE GILLETTE, BUT THIS NORELCO, MAY TAKE A LITTLE MORE TIME, BUT IT IS EXCELLENT, AND GETS U SHAVED CLOSE.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS RAZOR OPPOSED TO USING FOAM AND A BLADE.</li>
            <li> I have used the Norelco shavers for years and this is my latest acquisition.  The cleaning method has taken a little time to get used to but I am very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This identical item (Philips Norelco 1150x/40 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver, Metallic Blue)was on sale at Costco for $69.00. This purchase from Amazon comes out to be about $20 more than I would have paid at Costco. I did not make out well this time. Jack Stein</li>
            <li> I got this on Amazon for $50 on sale.    Pros:     -You won&#x27;t have to buy an expensive razor again.  -You can still use shaving cream  -Shaves well under the neck, avoiding razor burn  -Does a nice job around the lips and mouth   -So confortable I thought for a second it really wasn&#x27;t trimming, you don&#x27;t even feel it.    Cons: The shave just will never be as close as a razor but that is a given. If it&#x27;s important to have an semblance of hair on your face then stick with a razor but this thing does the job very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really liked, and used, Braun shavers for decades, but this Norelco shaver is my new standard. Braun foil systems worked well for me, but, as I have gotten older and my facial hair has gotten more random in its orientation and curvature, problems developed. I&#x27;d been having issues with too many hairs that got missed by my shaver. My solution had been to use the trimmer on my shaver to cut these longer hairs and/or to shave with a blade to get them.     I bought the Norelco shaver thinking I would use it instead of the blade every few days to get those longer hairs. Instead, the 1150x/40 shaved me so well and so comfortably that it has replaced my Braun shaver for everyday use. It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade, but it does shave as close, and as comfortably, as a Braun and it cuts all the hairs.</li>
            <li> After using this razor for six months, my initial impressions were confirmed--it&#x27;s flimsy, cheaply made, and doesn&#x27;t shave very well--with or without shaving cream. It is mostly definitely not worth its premium price. As someone who doesn&#x27;t grow much of a beard (asian!), it&#x27;s a little absurd that I have to pass this thing over my face and chin 7-10 times to cut the few hairs on my face off--even then, it&#x27;s obviously not as close as a cheap-o disposable razor. The blade-head is also pretty abusive to skin--maybe I&#x27;m extra sensitive--but I&#x27;m starting to get acne when I didn&#x27;t before. Shaving creams/gels just makes the Norelco experience worse/messier. The sideburn trimmer is of even worse quality--it rips hairs rather than trims them.    My recommendation is to NOT buy this razor. I&#x27;m definitely going back to my regular three blade pharmacy razor. If you really want an electric razor, stay away from this one--get a decent quality cheaper one or go elsewhere!    Making a terrible razor worse, I bought this with the idea of getting a rebate. I got a note saying they didn&#x27;t get my UPC code--but what can I do? I can&#x27;t send another UPC if I already sent it. If they lost it, I can&#x27;t magically make a new one. Letters and phone calls--to no avail. So, I have a terrible expensive razor with no rebate.</li>
            <li> My 10 year old Norelco Advantage Wet/Dry razor finally broke, so it was time to get a new razor.  I tried a Braun, but realized I missed the ability to use shaving cream to reduce razor burn. In addition, I am used to and now prefer to be able to shave in a circular motion to catch my hairs from all angles.  The 1140x works fairly well in this regard, but I wish I had my old razor back.  This razor is similar to my old one in closeness of shave and because I can&#x27;t use it if I wait more than a day between shaves.  However, the new razor has clipped the skin at the corners of my mouth a couple of times and left me bleeding - ouch!  In addition, I travel a lot and you can&#x27;t charge this razor without the stand (The AC cord plugs into the stand only) which is annoying.  In addition, this razor doesn&#x27;t come with a travel case.  Thankfully, I can use the neoprene case that came with my old razor.</li>
            <li> After using it for a few days, I was surprised how smooth it is. It does a good job picking up most of the hair, even  under the chin. The product is very light, and seems to be a bit fragile. So I&#x27;m being very careful handling it. It remains to be seen how long it will last. I wish the construction was a litter heavier and more sturdy. The cleaning part is a breeze, just run it under the faucet for a few seconds. So far (1 month), I am happy with it, would give a better grade wasn&#x27;t for the lightness of the body.</li>
            <li> shaver does its thing oh so slowly. takes up to eight minutes for my face to feel decently smooth, and this after wetting whiskers at beginning and during shave with warm water. did better for first few weeks but quickly ran out of gas.</li>
            <li> 2nd one I have owned, both have worked well.  Is a little clumsy to clean out after a shave, but I use canned air from computer supplies and it makes the job much easier.</li>
            <li> This shaver, once I got used to it, performed admirably.  It provides a relatively close shave with minimal effort and is very quiet.  I would reccomend it to anyone, especially those who are becoming annoyed by the rising cost of blades.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Philips shaver [...] for about 3 years now and i&#x27;m 200% satisfied with this product. I have never changed the blades and it is still working for me. I bought this sensotouch 2D to upgrade the experience and I should say it let down. Thats when I realized, life is good when things are simple rather those so many so called features failed against the olders products.    Coming to sensotouch 2D:    It never removed hairs in one stroke or what ever circular motion. The size of the entire product can be even smaller for the feature it provides. The indicator lights look cheap. I was expecting some basic pouch with this product but they did not provide. Then I checked the model and it says it does not come with the pouch. But the other 2D model comes with a pouch. If philips thinks it is a marketing tactics then are very much wrong here.    -Us</li>
            <li> This shaver is excellent. Nice touch and feelings.   The price is fair and I will definitely recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> 1150 takes me less time and less efforrt to shave, which is very important. I used it everyday, and I found that 1150 is very effective. I love it, yes!</li>
            <li> Nice cut, great battery life.  I used it two weeks every day before the battery needed to be re-charged.  I have used Philips Razor for a long time now and my last Philips Razor lasted five to seven years with every day use.</li>
            <li> Meh.  I&#x27;ve used the 8260XL for a couple of years now and switched to the 1150x/40 SensoTouch for something new.  It&#x27;s been a month or so now and I&#x27;ll probably take advantage of Norelco&#x27;s 45 day return policy.  The 1150x has potential, but so far, has not provided as close a shave as the 8260XL.  I can&#x27;t really think of any pros.  The cons: not as close a shave, no case for it, and the sideburn/beard trimmer being a separate attachment is a gigantic pain in the rear.  I haul my razor to the gym with me each morning before work. This isn&#x27;t compatible.    I&#x27;ve used electric Norelco&#x27;s for 15-20 years and this is the first one I&#x27;m not very happy with.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my new shaver. Even though it says you have to wait really 21 days to see good results, so far in the 3rd day I am getting a really good-smooth shave. In fact, I bought 2 pieces just in case there is no more stock of this in the future. I have used Norelco shavers in the past 10 years and they are all good. Best of all You can use it in the shower and save time.</li>
            <li> This is very good. I love it,and use it everyday.Maybe I will buy it again for my papa .I think he love it also.</li>
            <li> My husband got this razor for himself and he loves it.  He uses it daily with ease.  It is easy to take apart and clean the attachments and is a breeze to use for a quick trim.</li>
            <li> There are many good reviews for this shaver. I bought one after reading them. Unfortunately, starting with the first impression of the item out of the box - it looked very cheap and made of low quality materials - and continuing with the very bad shave, there was nothing that could make me keep it, not to mention justify the price.  The $30 off deals and $30 rebate on this one are there for a reason.  Some additional comments: the movable shaving head is actually quite stiff, so it doesn&#x27;t follow contours of the face unless you pres really hard, in which case it starts hurting and pulling the skin. It also doesn&#x27;t glide on the skin as another reviewer noted - the friction is quite bad. Lastly, it left multiple hairs unshaven even though I went on those spots several times.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco SensoTouch electric shaver is very nicely designed and constructed. It shaves closely&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design on the SensoTouch is quite futuristic, with a blue front, curved body, and perched shave head. It fits comfortably in the hand, and has a rubber ridge that runs around the edge for added grip (especially useful when using the shaver wet). The shaver has only one button on it, the power button, which is flush with the front of the shaver face. On the shaver front are also three indicator lights. They display low battery, battery charging, and control lock status. The control lock lets you disable the power button to prevent it from accidentally turning on (when traveling for instance). One annoying aspect of the shaver&#x27;s design,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving with the SensoTouch is kind of odd at first. The shaver puts very little pressure on your face. At first I didn&#x27;t think I was pushing hard enough to get a close shave, but it was shaving just as close as any other electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used. Indeed, you can push as hard as you like, but it never feels like you&#x27;re pushing down hard. I&#x27;ve learned to use the SensoTouch with a light touch, and the payoff is a close shave with less irritation. The shaver head pivots smoothly in all directions, and the three shaving heads pivot individually as well. The shaver screens have holes for shorts hairs and slots for longer hairs. Indeed, I had no problem getting a close shave on the contours of my face and around my goatee. The shaver can be used wet or dry or with shaving cream. I only ever used it dry, as I had no need to attempt a closer shave, and liked the convenience of a dry shave. Lastly, you can pull off the shaver head and pop on a trimmer head. The downside to this setup is that the trimmer is a separate piece, whereas most shavers have the trimmer integrated into the shaver itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the shaver be easier, after each use you simply pull off the top plate of the shaver head and run water through it and the shaver head. When a more intense cleaning is needed you can disassemble the entire shaver assembly and clean out each rotary blade individually with the included brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all... a smarty styled shaver that gives a close and comfortable shave.haver head. When a more intense cleaning is needed you can disassemble the entire shaver assembly and clean out each rotary blade individually with the included brush  All in all... a smarty styled shaver that gives a close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Given the fact that I&#x27;m only in my early twenties, I don&#x27;t have that much shaving experience. However, I have been using electric shavers since I started shaving as a teenager (first a Remington, then a low-end Norelco, then the Norelco 1150X), and I am confident that the 1150X is the best one I&#x27;ve used-and I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 weeks! The shave is very close and can even get the hairs on my neck that other shavers have been unable to eliminate. Plus, I got this shaver for just $20 (I didn&#x27;t buy from Amazon, but got a $30 gift card at the store where I did buy it-Wal Mart-plus Norelco is offering a $30 mail in rebate for all Senso Touch shavers).  UPDATE (Feb. 20, 2012): So it turns out that the mail-in-rebate is invalid if your purchase came with ANY other discounts, even if they aren&#x27;t traditional discounts (in my case, I got a Wal-Mart gift card), something which is not explicitly stated on the rebate form. The shaver still works great, but I&#x27;ve now lowered the rating to one star to reflect my displeasure with Philips&#x27; business practices. I will NEVER give Phillips my business again!</li>
            <li> this shaver is brilliant in my books lets you use it wet or dry . easy clean under the tap great pivoting head .gets long or short hairs no sweat another great philips product need i say more must buy oh i did say more lol</li>
            <li> Cheap products. For me it is very easy to use, this is a suitable product. Feel very comfortable. Easy to use. I like it.</li>
            <li> I am fair of face, and so don&#x27;t need much in the way of a razor, but the last razor I used did not come close to comparing to a manual razor.  This razor is fantastic, cuts close, and is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I had bought two to my freind.  Good shaver it is!  They all think it is so good to shave!</li>
            <li> it was my first time that i bought something in Amazon, the experience was really wonderful. The shaver is good, the price was so nice. Amazon&#x27;s customer service is amazing. I have to say i was really happy with Amazon&#x27;s shopping experience.</li>
            <li> very good quality,this product for this price, I want to give 5 stars, but,,, shipping is too slow, it&#x27;s takes me almost 1 month to wait, and maybe another month to wait for rebate(hope I can get that $30 rebate).  but anyway, it&#x27;s good one, even for $49.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, waterproof, easy to recharge. Only one short-come is the cap on the shaver, little hard to take off, not a big deal.</li>
            <li> The electronic shaver is incredible. Not only it shaves very smooth and the result is very good, but it is very easy to be cleaned as well. Good product</li>
            <li> I like it very much, beautiful design, ship fast, I would like to get second one if I live in states, I can not use rebate here in Canada.</li>
            <li> This shaver is a handy little tool,and it&#x27;s so cheap to a shaver which has so much functions.I love it!</li>
            <li> Buy it with $49.99.  It is great.  It is very easy to use and looks cool.  And only one hour quick charge.</li>
            <li> it is the  best gift  for  your friend or your family .....i  like it  but  only  can  buy  one in the cheap price</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my husband at Christmas hoping he would shave more! He had an old Norelco razor that he just seemed to have a hard time parting with. He used the new Norelco 1150x and it was love at first shave! Now he shaves everyday and looks forward to it.  I have nothing negative to say about it. It is that good!</li>
            <li> The order arrived within 5 days, and the product was in good quality, just the same as the description of the seller.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve buy two Philips Norelco 1150 for both my dad and my boyfriend&#x27;s dad, they love it~  especially the easy clean&amp;travel lock</li>
            <li> It is just what I want. I like it. It is a gift for my father. Hope he likes it too.</li>
            <li> this was a gift for my friend, he loves the 1150 because he feels the shaver works gently, I think the point is his beard grows slowly, as for me, I ordered a la63 in 2013, and ordered a 790cc last year, I think these shavers work more efficiently!</li>
            <li> I sent it to my dad and he just love it. He told me in China it costs more than 3,000RMB. Unbelievable i bought if for only 50 dollars. Im still waiting for the rebate. hope it will come in half a year....</li>
            <li> Very good shaving.  One full charge and two weeks of use with no recharge till now.  One bad thing is that you can&#x27;t shave with the plug, only with charged battery.</li>
            <li> bought this item with because of the rebate offered by the manufacturer,but the rebate was rejected,reason given was since amazon  already gave the thirty dollars discount,now Philips Norwood won&#x27;t honor the the rebate submitted. I will never buy anything from this manufacturer again. It is a deceptive,fraudulent practice.  Now I am out of thirty bucks... The product itself is a little better than my other low priced shavers. It is quieter than most shavers I have owned.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and doesn&#x27;t need to charging much.  Basically very good shaver.  Looks good and compact charger, charges quickly (less then 2 hours) then last for days of shaving.</li>
            <li> When I bought this product, I was told there would be $30 rebate from the manufacture. Now my rebate has been denied by the manufacture because they said the rebate is not valid if purchased from Amazon. I am thinking about return the product to Amazon, however, without a UPC code(I mailed the UPC code to manufacture for rebate.)it is not eligible for return based on Amazon return policy. This made me stuck here. I will appreciate if you have better idea.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product,it is a great gift for father ,huaband and friend by chrismats and new year.</li>
            <li> I bought the production for the discount and rebate, but only received a mail said the rebate was void! If discount and rebate could not be gotten at the same time, why did you tell us earlier? I felt the amaon and Philips both cheated us, it was only a trap! I would never buy anything with rebate!</li>
            <li> Like others I also had my rebate rejected. The only reason I bought this items was it was a good deal. Nothing was said about restrictions on the rebate form.  The shaver is OK I don&#x27;t like the charging base as I travel and it&#x27;s much easier just to pack a cord.</li>
            <li> I did not want to write a bad review about this product, but it was meant to be a nice gift for a friend and I got feedback that it does not perform very well either after a short period of time. I used 6 different Norelco products in the past few years and they were on average good to very good. The quality of this one is below what we consider average. On top of this they refuse to honor the advertised rebate, because of the fine print which is very vague. Basically if you get any discount at any store for even 1 cent will automatically disqualify the rebate, as per their customer representative. Not that the rebate will make it a better product. Norelco rebate is just a bait. This is for sure my last Norelco product with or without rebate, time to buy quality next time.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco 1150X/40 Shaver 6100</li>
            <li> Very good with a razor, I like it.</li>
            <li> Good item,good price,good service!</li>
            <li> This is my first time to may a shaver. It works well!  I like it very much!</li>
            <li> Good price and quality!</li>
            <li> My friend like this present.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very nice,my daddy is very love it!</li>
            <li> does not work as was described. not very strong. takes a lot of runs over the face to even work well.</li>
            <li> Had to return it to Target. Did not get a close shave.</li>
            <li> No good. It didn&#x27;t get the job done. Couldn&#x27;t get a close shave. For $90, we were expecting a better product. Returned it.</li>
            <li> Fabulous shave, wet or dry!</li>
            <li> Not bad. working well.&lt;br /&gt;but not great.</li>
            <li> Dad said it was very good!</li>
            <li> No complaints so far, it works great.</li>
            <li> Have been using an electric razor all my life.This is absolutely the worse one i have ever owned. Regret this purchase big time. Keep shopping and i can not understand any review with more than one star.</li>
            <li> very good.it&#x27;s beautiful.thank you very much.Please make your utmost effort to hasten shipment next time.I like electric shavers because they don&#x27;t cause bumps at the base of the back of my neck like blade shaving does. I also like to shave on the go.</li>
            <li> It works well, gives me a close shave,  and is quiet. I like the fact that it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I have been using shavers for more than 20 years and  my first one from philips lasted for 14 years.&lt;br /&gt;This one only lasted for 2 and a half year.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic cover of the on/off switch broke after 2 years and now the battery does not hold charge after 3 years of daily use.&lt;br /&gt;There is the neck problem also where i need to use a razor to finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;The hair storage capacity is very low and you need to open it and clean after each use for optimal performance.&lt;br /&gt;It was ok when it lasted.</li>
            <li> I bought it online in November, 2011. And it was shown that there was 30$ cash back. I sent out mail-in rebate form after I received the product. So far I did not receive refund.</li>
            <li> I bought this item on black Friday and like so many others had my rebate rejected by Phillips. The same rebate that was good only on Black Friday and advertised on the Amazon website as being valid on the razor. Either Amazon or Philipps are at fault but neither seems to want to take responsibility.</li>
            <li> I just found out that this itme they offered back in December 2011 with a $30 coupon and a $30 rebate from Phillips was null and voided as told to me by a phillips representative, They being Phillips are not accepting any rebates for the $30 they offered because they state when you accept the $20 or $30 coupon offered by amazon you are attempting to combine offers which is not allowed under phillips policy basically stating you cannot stack your coupon with a rebate to get $60 bucks off the item, now amazon did not state anything at the time i purchased the item that you couldnt use the rebate after accepting their coupon upon purchasing the item but now phillips is not accepting my rebate, so yes i good deal on the price of the item at the time of purchase but the item should have been discounted $60 bucks total as AMAZON was offering it, but because myself and several other customers naturally used their coupon and submitted the rebate we screwed ourselves out of $30 and amazon i believe knew that phillips would not honor those rebates in the first place because the form clearly states you cannot combine deals, so BUYER BEWARE if amazon is offering a coupon without a rebate by all means take advantage of the item, but if there is a rebate attached to the item as well, make sure its says you can stack both before using both you basically have to choose 1 or the other for most items and specially for phillips/norelco items, after calling and giving them a good piece of my mind for what i believe is false advertising on amazon&#x27;s and phillips part they are sending me a 15% off coupon for future purchases, so again buyer beware...dont get burned like myself and im sure several thousand other people who purchased this item in dec 2011...&lt;br /&gt;0</li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned so take it with that context.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product works somewhat well, but as my title implies, it&#x27;s hard to get a very close shave. For cutting long hairs, it&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s very fast and leaves no irritation at all. But for the \\&quot;20%\\&quot; of smaller hairs, it takes a very long time to get a smooth shave with this. For now, I use this for about 20 seconds in the morning and then switch to a 5-blade cartridge razor to clean up the rest. I&#x27;d say it improves my shaving experience, but certainly doesn&#x27;t replace my old razors.</li>
            <li> $30 rebate is a scam.&lt;br /&gt;Juts got a postcard says \\&quot;Manufacture&#x27;s discounts taken at the cash register are not valid for rebate promotions.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Is that a joke?</li>
            <li> My husband likes the razor fine, but we only purchased the item because of a promised $30 rebate. Now Philps Norelco is refusing to honor the rebate even though it was posted on the Amazon page. This is a clear example of bait and switch and I will never purchase another PhilipsNorelco product again.</li>
            <li> The product is in high quality. It is working great. I love it. The shipment is quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad thing is that the manufacturer failed to fund the $30 mail-in rebate on this product which is included in the mail-in rebate list.</li>
            <li> The philips Shaver 1150x is Cheap and realisitic. The process of purchasing is convinient and happiness.I would like to enjoy purchadsing online.</li>
            <li> if you are buying this bottom line shaver, dont expect phillips to honor the rebate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased the Philips SensoTouch Electric Shaver largely in part because of the $30 Rebate Promotion..&lt;br /&gt;Finally received a postcard, first correspondence since Thanksgiving/Christmas 2011 - REBATE COULD NOT BE HONORED!!&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Manufacturer&#x27;s discounts taken at the cash register are not valid for rebate promotions..\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i hope amazon stops taking their overstock items and dumping them for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***update  send amazon an email to customer service explaining the problem and you will get a 30 dollar promo certificate from amazon. ***</li>
            <li> With razor. But it is not the most suitable for Asian. But the price, but you are not satisfied with it?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this SensoTouch shaver for over three months now and am generally very happy with it. It offers a hassle-free, idiot-proof shave. Although the shave doesn&#x27;t feel quite as close as my old Braun Series 5,the difference is negligible, and the SensoTouch wins in terms of comfort, ease, and cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SHAVE&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness: I have a very angular face with a slow-growing, thin beard. This SensoTouch is very effective for my face and beard type. The slight arch outwards in the head design means I can shave my chin areas easily, which is something I found hard to do with the Braun. The large head means that it&#x27;s harder for me to miss an errant, bit of stubble. As long as I use the circular-pressing motion they recommend in the manual, I get no irritation. Shaving the neck is a non-issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfort: The SensoTouch offers a comfortable shave. The body of the shaver feels solid in the hand and is swooped to ensure that it won&#x27;t slip. The circular-pressing motion you&#x27;re asked to do gets a bit tiring at first, my wrist started feeling strange near the end of my second shave, but it&#x27;s not a problem any more. Because the head is large, you won&#x27;t have to do many circular motions to cover your face. I found it helpful to slightly pull-tight my skin as the shaver went over the area. Either way, this shaver has never cut me, unlike the Braun, which gave me various scars as I learnt to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Result: On the first pass for me, it cuts fairly close. Although it&#x27;s smooth to the eye, it&#x27;s not smooth to the touch. At this point, I&#x27;ll dump out the collected hairs, and then do another pass. At the end of the second round, I&#x27;m smooth to the touch and will generally not need to shave until two days later. I like to follow up with [[ASIN:B003ZH74F4 Genuine Ogallala Bay Rum Aftershave]], but it&#x27;s not by any means essential. With my Braun, assuming I didn&#x27;t miss any areas, I could go about three days without a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;Build: The SensoTouch is well built and feels solid. Not as hefty as the Braun, but it doesn&#x27;t need to rely on weight to give a good shave. Unfortunately, the charging station is a T-style cradle that is made of the cheapest, lightest plastic in the world. This makes it difficult to quickly drop the shaver in. The cradle will fall or skid away. After the shaver&#x27;s in, it&#x27;s own weight makes things much more stable, though. As well, in order to hook the charging cable to the cradle, you really need to jam it into the port. For a long time, I was wondering why the charging cable would keep on getting disconnected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery Life: I took this shaver on holiday for a week using it for a total of at least 30 minutes without recharging it. The thing worked fine, with no loss of motor torque or any other oddities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Value: Compared with the Braun, the Sensotouch is a great value. Besides the rotor heads, which really should take years to wear out, there isn&#x27;t much that could go wrong. No expensive foils or assemblies to replace. Other than the charging dock and cord, I can see the SensoTouch lasting for years. At a below-double-digit price, it&#x27;s probably the best shaver you&#x27;ll get for an angular face.</li>
            <li> Bought it last Nov while there was a $30 rebate promotion in addition to a $30 up-front discount (so the final price should be ~$20).  However, as you&#x27;ve probably seen from other reviewers, the $30 rebate got rejected.  Talked to their customer support and they said it&#x27;s the same promotion and can&#x27;t used twice.  Trust me, like many of you guys, I read all the fine prints really carefully.  Nowhere it said they were the same discount.  It&#x27;s really disappointing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the product, it&#x27;s just a $20 product with a bit more fancier design.</li>
            <li> Without $30 rebate, $50 for the shaver is not worth. Philips is a company I will never buy from them. They use cheating and misleading to sell.</li>
            <li> I know lot of you came here to get an honest review on this shaver and are probably frustrated reading about this \\&quot;rebate\\&quot; issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you guessed it, I also was duped by Philips with their deceptive rebate scam.  I honestly can&#x27;t recommend any product from a company that does this kind of shady business in this day and age.  Forget the review about this product.  Just stay away from Philips and you&#x27;ll be much happier in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon on the other hand stepped up as always, took up the issue on themselves and issued me a $30 credit without an hassle.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe Philips should look into things like \\&quot;customer retention\\&quot; \\&quot;customer loyalty\\&quot; \\&quot;customer service\\&quot; into their business model.  Learn from Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> It has a sleek design , nice looking, but other than that&lt;br /&gt;this shaver is very weak, and flimsy,. Weak battery and rotation cut,&lt;br /&gt;It is a piece of crap in my opinion. I have used for the last few months,&lt;br /&gt;and I had it. I going back to my old shaver</li>
            <li> Very comfortable razor, that does a decent job, it just seems supremely under powered.  I had to go over everything multiple times to get a clean shave, and I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard.  I returned the razor and went back to my old model.  I&#x27;d like to try one of the higher powered versions, they are just SO expensive.</li>
            <li> I bought the Norelco Shaver from Amazon at the end of the year last year and got a great price on it.  Because of the great price, I thought that the shaver would have some issues but I was very pleased with the shaver once I received it.  This shaver is definitely the best shaver I have owed, by far.  This shaver shaves incredible close and the battery lasts forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up until I bought the Phillips shaver, I was using an electric shaver to shave a couple times a week and then would do a close shave with a razor Blase once a week, too to get the hard to cut and thin hairs that the razor didn&#x27;t catch.  That process is a thing of the past now that I have this shaver.  The Phillip does a nice clean shave every time and doesn&#x27;t leave any hair behind. I can&#x27;t say enough about how close it shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as holding a charge, the Phillips is amazing.  This is going to sound like I am exaggerating but for me, shaving twice a week, the charge lasts somewhere over 12 weeks. I have literally  charged this shaver three to four times since I have owned it. Totally amazing battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was one very big issue, though, and a limitation of this type of shaver / the company. This type of shaver, with three heads, doesn&#x27;t allow you to shave right under your nose well, especially if your are shaving around a mustache, as I need to.  It&#x27;s just to hard to get one of the heads in there with out risking shaving parts of your mustache, you are not trying to shave.  Phillips does give you an attachment for such reasons but for me swapping shaver heads every time I shave is a bit messy so I use a trimmer for such purposes.  This problem is more an over all three head shaver problem and not a Phillips problem so I didn&#x27;t knock any stars off for the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked this shaver so much that I bought one for my father for Xmas.  This is where the my real issue is.  The one I bought for my father was at the same amazing price but also was supposeto give a $30 rebate back.  A month after submitting the paper work, I got a notice back from Phillips saying that they don&#x27;t do dual offers (I&#x27;m paraphrasing).  I am not allowed to get the discount price and a rebate.  This is really not fair and a little shady since the rebate time frame corresponded with the discount. Nowhere in the rebate paper work did it say that I could receive a discount and a rebate.  Reading the Amazon forum on this, I can see that this happened to many other people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver itself is 5 star shaver but I rate the company 3 stars so I am giving an overall 4 star rating.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be honest...the best shave you can get is from a professional barber..with hot towels and hot foam...after that it&#x27;s trial and error because of different hair and skin types...I shave my head and face and the barber is a treat at $25-$30 low end..it last 2-3 days&lt;br /&gt;I usually use Mach 3 or above on head and face..which can be long, messy, and I always have a cut or two..the price of refills is skyrocketing and I decided to try this..&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it thurs..got it sat!...I first tried the 1150 dry,and I was surprised that with several days growth..I was able to get a reasonably close shave..no cuts or mess...I then washed my face thoroughly, applied shave gel and could not believe it..as close if not closer than the blades...my wife checked for places I usually miss and I hadn&#x27;t ...and without a scratch..&lt;br /&gt;I usually don&#x27;t review items however when you feel you have gotten what you&#x27;ve paid for(for a change)why not ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also seems by some of the reviews that people want a pro shave at home??. It&#x27;s not going to happen..for me this is a&lt;br /&gt;Great alternative to the high cost of shaving , and for me 99% as good as a pro.&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased this not expecting a rebate..wasn&#x27;t offered one and it is worth it without one</li>
            <li> It is horrible. It doesn&#x27;t get to spots on my face regularly. Almost completely misses the hair on my upper lip right under my nose. Misses spots on my chin and I really have to give myself razor burn, even using gel, just to get a \\&quot;super smooth\\&quot; shave as they boast on their videos. Stay away from this razor, spend the extra $20 or so and get an actually good one.</li>
            <li> I have been so disappointing in this item. It looks about 5x better then what it delivers, which is a half hearted trim. You have to keep going over the same spot until it leaves your face raw just to get the last remaining hairs. I bought this to replace my old shaver and after about 3 uses I ended up going back to the old shaver. The only thing I use this for is to trim my sideburns with the extra attachment, otherwise I would not recommend it to anyone. It&#x27;s a massive waist of money.</li>
            <li> Great product and perfect gift foathers&#x27; day.</li>
            <li> quiet, fast and clean shave, not very comparable to manual shaver though. very satisfied with the battery, lasted for a month at least. Easy to clean, no odor even I forgot to clean it and left it there for a week.</li>
            <li> Present for my friend&#x27;s father.</li>
            <li> easy to shave, like it very much.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for a week know and I like it. It easily does the job, I really enjoy the wet shave, it fly&#x27;s on your face!! The only bad thing is that I have replace the head to be able to use the razor, but I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> It looks good and is easy to hold for the task, but the motor doesn&#x27;t have the guts to get through my beard.</li>
            <li> I have a plug-in Philips Norelco razor that I&#x27;ve used for over ten years.  I think the blades finally were getting dull because it seemed like I wasn&#x27;t getting the shave I used to get.  I looked at the different models of the cordless Norelco shavers, I finally decided that spending big bucks on a fancy razor was not money well spent.  I&#x27;m very glad I went with this model- it gives me a very close shave (better than the old one when it was new) and is comfortable to use.  The trimmer being an extra piece is not a problem, and it does a much better job than the pop up one from the old razor.  I was concerned that the charge life being shorter with this model might be a disadvantage, but I&#x27;ve been going on the first charge for over a month.  Two-D versus three-D capability?  My face doesn&#x27;t know it&#x27;s been short changed.  It does run quieter than I expected, the impression is that it isn&#x27;t as strong but in fact it does quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Down sides:  I don&#x27;t like the way the head comes apart for cleaning, you can&#x27;t get a good grip on it because it feels like you could easily damage the cutting foils, and that it could go flying out of the hand when it snaps loose.  This razor doesn&#x27;t do as good a job at capturing longer hairs as my old one did (although the old electric was capable of taking a nip out of my lip if I got too close); if I have skipped a couple of days (gone camping) it really has difficulty making a clean sweep of my face.  If I&#x27;ve got the light good and bright and spot some whiskers that didn&#x27;t get clipped, I&#x27;ll run around and over and back and forth and seem not to make any progress.  Also, I question the recommendation to rinse the shaving head under water because I&#x27;ve heard the tap water will cause the blades to dull prematurely unless they&#x27;re scrupulously dried (and who&#x27;s got time for that?).  Maybe the jet clean system offered on the other models is worth the money, but I really didn&#x27;t want an appliance on my bathroom counter.  I cleaned theold one manually for many years, It&#x27;s not that big a deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line- it&#x27;s a pretty good razor for the money and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I was not sure if the reputed longer battery life of the more expensive models was important, but I took a chance on this.  I&#x27;ve been waiting on the low battery light to come on . . . . 42 days of shaving and today it finally flickered on!  I don&#x27;t know how many minutes on average I use it every day, but I shave thoroughly and use the trimmer often.  No complaints on this score.</li>
            <li> This mid range shaver is great! I like the flexible heads, ergonomic, and water resistant design. The replacement heads are easy to find and my local store has plenty of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having this shaver is a no brainier that wont break the bank. Battery lasts long enough to leave the charger at home while weekend/business traveling, but is also 110/220 great when leaving the states.</li>
            <li> Excellent!!! Excellent!!!</li>
            <li> The goods is very good, very good use. Satisfaction. Just logistics slowly.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this shaver:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: -Easy clean up, just rinse off after use&lt;br /&gt;  -excellent battery life, I&#x27;ve gone weeks without charging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  You need to detach the shaving head unit to put on the trimmer.  Not a big issue as I don&#x27;t use the trimmer much but it could get annoying for those who do.</li>
            <li> Bottom-Line: On balance I am very disappointed in the SensoTouch 1150x Electric Shaver, so the search continues to replace my Advantage 7735X.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life sucks sometimes!!  After years of use my trusty Norelco Advantage 7735X final gave up the ghost! The head of the razor came apart, springs and all, and I had no choice but to toss the whole thing into the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now over the years I have tried a number of razors--any number of traditional one-to-four blade straight (disposable) handles, as well as electric units from Remington and Norelco.  All of them irritate my skin to some degree and leave razor bumps (Black men are more susceptible to razor bumps than white men because of the course curly nature of our hair). Traditional razors tend to irritate my skin the most, and through experimentation over the years, I have found that Norelco brand razors tend to irritate my skin much less than all the others.  So, I have stuck with Norelco for the past fifteen years or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when my Norelco Advantage 7735X broke I was forced to find a comparable replacement, only to discover that Norelco no longer makes the 7700 series of lotion dispensing electric razors.  I like the lotion dispenser because it lubricates the skin while I shave and at the end of the process abrogates the need for aftershave lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I ended up purchasing was the Norelco SensoTouch 1150x Electric Shaver. Since I shave my head and face at least three times a week, it is important to me that any razor I use shave closely without, again, irritating my skin.  After several days of use I can report that I am very disappointed in the SensoTouch 1150x Electric Shavers&#x27; performance; after I shave my scalp is often dry and somewhat flaky in need of lotion.  However, there are no shaving bumps so that is a great outcome, but there is a considerable amount of stubble left behind, shaving wet (in the shower) or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the Advantage 7735X, which ships with 5 lotion packs by Nivea that  are easy to insert into the back of the razor, the SensoTouch 1150x Electric Shaver does not come so equipped.  And that for me is the main disadvantage of the razor; while the Advantage 7735X shaves closely, without lotion, and even better with it, without some sort of moisturizer the SensoTouch 1150x Electric Shaver fails to shave as closely as I&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also use shaving cream with the SensoTouch 1150x Electric Shaver, but that can get a bit messy (I only tried it once)  and the shave was not much better and the reason I use an electric razor is so I do not have to use shaving gel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the design of the unit, it is cutting edge and stylish.  The razor fits easily into the hand and while running the SensoTouch 1150x Electric Shaver is quieter than the unit it replaces, the motor is underpowered and I could actually hear the blades slowing down if I pressed the razor to closely to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SensoTouch 1150x Electric Shaver is cordless and comes with a charging stand that can automatically switch to the prevailing voltage, so traveling overseas will not be an issue.  But there is no carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned three other Norelco razors, and the only one that shaves as close as the Advantage 7735X was the Advantage 5655.  On balance I am very disappointed in the SensoTouch 1150x Electric Shaver, so much so that I returned in to Amazon.com where I purchased it for $79.97. So the search continues...5 lotion packs by Nivea that  are easy to insert into the back of the razor, the SensoTouch 1150x Electric Shaver does not come so equipped.  And that for me is the main disadvantage of the razor; while the Advantage 7735X shaves closely, without lotion, and even better with it, without some sort of moisturizer the SensoTouch 1150x Electric Shaver fails to shave as closely as I&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also use shaving cream with the SensoTouch 1150x Electric Shaver, but that can get a bit messy (I only tried it once)  and the shave was not much better and the reason I use an electric razor is so I do not have to use shaving gel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the design of the unit, it is cutting edge and stylish.

            <li> The person received this and stated that it is easy to use and that it is great having a rechargeable razor.  No cords to mess with in the hotels.  A great shave too.</li>
            <li> Great shave when you can keep the shaving head from falling off. This poorly designed shaver falls apart at least two times per shave.The head does not properly lock to the body.&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased several Norelco Shavers over the last thirty years and was always very satisfied. I can&#x27;t believe Norelco put their name on this one.</li>
            <li> It is really good price, may be the function not like some expencive ones&#x27;. But for a man don&#x27;t have a lot of beard, it is perfect.</li>
            <li> This item came with the wrong charging base, not Amazon&#x27;s fault.  Norelco was quick to send the correct one, however.  My 15-year-old Norelco shaves as well as this one and as close even with the original heads.  It is far more convenient to use.  This one, my fifth Norelco, is clunky, noisy, and inconvenient.</li>
            <li> It works well enough and easy enough that my son stays clean shaven--a requirement for his school. It is worth buying!</li>
            <li> What a great shaver, def an upgrade to my old 10year razor. Im sure they make better ones every year but i love the fact that its a wet dry razor. Looks stylish and got it at a excellent price!</li>
            <li> very comfortable, great battery life.</li>
            <li> This is our second Philips shaver of this type and gives a great shave</li>
            <li> Shaver&#x27;s battery only last like a year.  It won&#x27;t charge anymore and can not be replaced.  I&#x27;ve shavers before that lasted 10 yrs.  Very unhappy with this shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought it during black Friday, it show on Amazon website eligible for a $30 coupon and $30 rebate. I have submitted the rebate in early Jan. 2012. My submission is never shown up in their rebate tracking system and no rebate check is received. The product doesn&#x27;t  worth the price if there is no rebate. Also, Philips never cares their customer when you try to solve this problem with them. I will never buy anything from Philips.</li>
            <li> the most important reason I bought is the low price, which is one-third price of China selling price.&lt;br /&gt;However, after using this, it is not good as I thought, and I found the cleaning effect is same as the cheaper one which made in China. So I think it&#x27;s better to use manual to keep clean</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shaver.  The only thing was I didn&#x27;t receive all the rebates I was supposed to get.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very good&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s very simple&lt;br /&gt;i will tell my friends to buy it  Philips Norelco 1150X/40 SensoTouch 2D Electric Razor</li>
            <li> I have used other Norelco razors in the past and like them all. This one lives up the the name.</li>
            <li> it just didn&#x27;t feel good on the face or in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;it shaved longer hairs well - but not close enough. i should have believed the other reviews.</li>
            <li> very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;much more cheap than HK&lt;br /&gt;very beautiful very beautiful very beautiful very beautiful very beautiful very beautiful very beautiful</li>
            <li> 1.price lower&lt;br /&gt;2.very fast and comfortable&lt;br /&gt;3.battery is long life for common use&lt;br /&gt;4.it&#x27;s looks good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love it ~</li>
            <li> Not as good as my Braun 390 Razor, the triple razor head looks good but working really not as it looks,so my next Razor will be a Brauns maybe 590 or 790.</li>
            <li> Love the product. I need a mid- priced shaver without giving up a lot of dough  but will do the job. After looking at different shavers online and at stores , I settled with Philips Norelco 1150x/40 6100. Been happy with the results. So far no issues with the product,it have been a year now since this purchase.</li>
            <li> have use norelco shavers all my life for the price and what the producct delivers a good buy.  Would recommend</li>
            <li> Junk&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money. It won&#x27;t cut your whiskers .</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco 1150x40 SensoTouch 2D electric razor performs quite well on stubborn hairs! This can be used &#x27;wet or dry&#x27; and is very sturdy and easy to clean. It has a good long battery life, too. I would recommend this over a more expensive brand-- cuz it does the job!</li>
            <li> First off, let me say that I have thick stubble that is somewhat thin (as opposed to dense) on my face.  The first few shaves were spotty and left many random stragglers, but after about 5 days of shaving daily, I began getting the best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten with a DRY electric.  Also, I have had minimal irritation while using this razor.  After a couple months, I started getting lax on it and stopped shaving everyday since my beard grows pretty slowly and now am suffering.  It seems that when I go even 2 days without shaving, it&#x27;s like starting over, irritation and kind of bad shave again.  I&#x27;ve always had trouble with longer hairs missing, and my beard grows pretty flat against the skin, so this is likely my issue.  However, this has really helped my shaving, since I hate to do it, and manual shaving I would routinely go a week or more between shaves.   I&#x27;ve tried wet shaving with cream a few times, and it was awesome, but what&#x27;s the point of that?  If I&#x27;m going to use cream I&#x27;ll use a manual razor too!</li>
            <li> I think some people can be a little quick to complain sometime with items and also don&#x27;t understand that unfortunately you do run into the occasional defected item which is sometimes why people seem to lose their minds and post a terrible review which often discourages people. With that said, I purchased this item in December of 2010. I have to say that I&#x27;ve owned one other shaver (Foil) that shaved much faster BUT irritated my face very much. This shaver doesn&#x27;t irritate me at all. This seems to be more of a \\&quot;take your time\\&quot; kind of shaver but it will get the job done with very little to no missed spots. If there is, go over it a few times and the hairs are gone. It&#x27;s a pretty close shave as well...very close to a razor except this doesn&#x27;t irritate my face like a razor. The battery holds a GREAT charge. It is VERY easy to take apart and clean. Read the directions on how to take it apart rather than doing it wrong and breaking it which results in you giving a unwarranted bad review. Shaves great dry or wet (i prefer a wet shave with shaving gel...much smoother). For the price compared to some others, there is good value....and with the current $30 coupon I&#x27;d jump on this quick. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll regret it. I didn&#x27;t, I love this shaver.</li>
            <li> After about 10+ years, I finally had to replace m old Norelco electric shaver and replaced it with the 2d 1150/40 SensoTouch 2d.  The price on Amazon, was a good price with free s/h. I got the 2d mixed up with the 3d and other higher (and more expensive) models in this line and couldn&#x27;t take advantage of the $10 manufacturer rebate.  In any case, this is the best working shaver I&#x27;ve owned and I have no regrets buying it, even though the run time on the battery charge is lower than other SensoTouch models.  I probably have light growing facial hair but the the first charge lasted me an entire month before the battery charge warning light started to blink.  So, I have no issues on how long the battery charge lasts.  As for the shave itself, this shaver gives me the best shaves day after day.  After reading someone&#x27;s else review on not needing the SensoTouch that comes bundled with the head cleaner device, I opt&#x27;d to just get the shaver and no cleaner device.  Now and then, all I do is pop the 3-head shaver head off exposing the rotary blades and I just rinse the blade holder part and the base under hot water as instructed.  After, I take a tissue to pat dry and everything is ready to go again.  Very easy.  Excellent electric shaver.  This base model SensoTouch was worth buying. You can buy the higher level models and pay the higher prices but I don&#x27;t think you will get a better shave, just more bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> ------  Introduction  ------  I&#x27;ve no idea why, but apparently it is generally believed that someone with naturally coarse, curly hair (i.e a Black man) should never invest in a rotary or foil electric razor because they don&#x27;t work on that type of person&#x27;s face. While clinging to this notion, Blacks have the choice of contending with those relentless razor bumps produced by manual razors (the propensity of our hair to curl facilitates this) or turning to messy harsh, depilatory cremes/powders that produce offensive odors.  ----  I was tired of bumps, messes, and nonsense, so I invested in this shaver(the Norelco 1150x). The bottom line: My first shave was brilliant despite the fact that my face hasn&#x27;t even adjusted to a rotary blade Norelco has a sort of money-back guarantee deal in the event that it doesn&#x27;t do the job for you, so there&#x27;s no reason not to be confident in the machine&#x27;s ability to dominate your facial hairs.   I opted to wet shave and was a bit hasty about it, missing a few hairs on my cheek, but it seems every bit as close as manual shave. With a manual blade, shaving without missing the patch of hairs adjacent to the trachea and on my chin without cutting myself was a challenge. Depilatories would remove some hair, but not nearly all of them, and require me to wait 36 hours before trying again without damaging already tingling skin. The Norelco got the job done with no irritation.    Aesthetically, this machine stands out from the other mid-range rotaries and foils. In person, it is not as vibrant blue as it appears online, and that&#x27;s good. With the charger, it does not take up much space. I was thankful it did not come with the massive Jet Clean charger/cleaner system. The trimmer is a neat bonus.</li>
            <li> I have had the shaver for a few months now, it took a while to get used to but so far its gone a month without the charge light coming on.    The shave isnt quite as close as you would get with a manual razor but its much better and quicker than any electric razor I have used before.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if this is as good as electric razors get or not but I splurged on this thinking that this would work great, but it does not.  It says on the instruction that to go in circular motion and I did and it still does not shave well.  You have to like totally get this is the right spot and sweet spot on your face.  your neck and chin, fogetttaboutit!!!  I have to move this thing around my face up, down, in, out, every angle possible before i get a complete shave.  BTW, I am not a hairy person at all.  I normally shave 2-3 times per week.</li>
            <li> Get our hands look perfect shape, with relatively clean feeling after. Battery is more durable, have not yet been charged.</li>
            <li> This is a first electric shaver in my whole life.  Every morning I used to cut my face by handy shaver blide.  This product was my solution.  After it used, I never seen my blood on face.</li>
            <li> For someone who has rarely used, and traditionally hated, electric razors this one is truly amazing. I bought it use when in a time crunch and truly love it. The dry or wet feature makes it even more readily usable.</li>
            <li> It was really good  bargain, and very good quality as well.  But the style is not much great as much as photo.  But still excellent economy value.</li>
            <li> Bought it when it&#x27;s on sale, just paid 1/3 of the retail price in Canada, good quality, a nice gift to surprise Dad.</li>
            <li> Good performance with low price   For the first time in the Amazon shopping  Good experience  Hope discounts  Once a week</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It has a great value/price ratio. It is convinient, easy to clean. Hope one year later I will buy the same products.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I recommend! He is an electric shaver that runs right corner of the face to remove all the hair and does not damage the skin. This is very good. It really is very good!</li>
            <li> First of all the guy who is demonstrating the video is a paid actor and a good one at that! If you have been using electric shavers and want to upgrade this would be a good choice also it being on sale now for $49.97 makes it a good bargain/investment. This whole \\&quot;2d, 3d senso touch\\&quot; bull crap is just another way of keeping people interested in their products. I received this e. razor as a gift and on first use it screwed up my skin. I have relatively thick hair (Mediterranean) and it barely caught any of the hair!  I got razor bumps, rash, irritation, and patches of hair left over my entire face. Though this negative experience was unpleasant it helped me get into DE Shaving (using safety razors). My prayers have finally been answered! Affordable, effective and simple. All done :)</li>
            <li> It fits well to my face. The battery can lasting a long time if you are not hairy.Price is favourite. A perfect gift!</li>
            <li> I cost $49 FOR IT. BUT I DID&#x60;NT USE IT MYSELF,I GAVE IT TO MY FRIEND AS A PRESENT.  HE LIKED IT VERY MUCH. SO GOOD,SO CHEAP.  I&#x60;LL BUY IT AGAIN,IF THE PRICE IS UNDER $50.</li>
            <li> Nice Look. Works dry and wet. My husband likes it, Would recommend to friends.But it is larger than we thought.</li>
            <li> It is my dad&#x27;s birthday gift.My dad and my family like it very much,i will buy again and tell my friend and ciassmates.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco electric shavers basically since I started shaving. They are very easy to use and much more economical than disposable razors and their expensive refills. I have always found the round tri-head electric shavers from Norelco work much better than the foil syle design from Remington and others. I think they really do shave just as well as a blade.  This shaver is no exception. It looks cool to begin with but the most important thing is that it works very well. This thing is so light (almost too light in that it feels slightly less sturdy than older designs) and it glides across your face even without using pre-shave or shaving cream (yes it will work with cream!). It is super quiet when using.  It comes with a nice charging base and clearly indicates on the shaver itself when it is charging and turns off when completed. It charges fast as well.  The only 2 negatives I have with this product are:  1) The charging base has suction cups to help hold it in place but they are sort of small. We have Corian style solid surface sink tops in our bathroom and the suction cups don&#x27;t want to stick to it very well so it sort of slides around and makes it hard to keep in one place. It can tend to tip over as well when the suction cups don&#x27;t hold.  2) This unit is entirely cordless and ONLY works as a cordless shaver. Meaning, you can&#x27;t plug the cord directly into the unit and use it as a corded shaver. Why is this important do you ask when you are buying a cordless unit for the convenience of being cordless? As I said, I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for a long time. After a while the batteries will stop accepting a charge and they are not easily replaced. When this happens (like it did with my last older style) I could still shave and just needed to use the cord. With this unit once the batteries start to die it is basically time to get a new one. Since I got this for only $50 with a $30 off coupon at Christmas that is not too big of a deal but it is a minor inconvenience.  All in all though this shaver is very nice and does a great job, especially since it is the bottom of the line model! I&#x27;m not sure how the higher models could do much better.</li>
            <li> I like the product. It is a present for my father and he like it also. I bought it with coupon so the price is excellent!</li>
            <li> i got the amonzon for a long time but have not trial,  when my friend troduced the shavel to me,  i was shocked by it deeply.  with the help of amozon, i finished the purchasing and received   the goods qucickly.  The quality is perfect and same as shopping.  I think i will visit amnozon everyday in the future.</li>
            <li> it’s very nice！I love it very much！It‘s helpful for me and use it everyday！I will buy it if I need it!</li>
            <li> Great little razor gets close shave, battery lasts a long time! The only downside is how expensive the replacement heads are to buy. overall a great shave!</li>
            <li> Very elegant product and good performance. I purchased tw, one for my self and the other as a gift. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This shaver is very good gift for friends or myself , it is very easy to use and very smooth.</li>
            <li> IT IS A VERY GOOD SHAVER COMPARING OTHER MY USED SHAVERS. ESPECIALLY THE SHAVER WORKS WELL. SO I RECOMMEND IT TO MY FRIEDNDS.</li>
            <li> Although this is only the Philips low-end products, but the effect was great.Great value, I hope we all try to buy.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver with the rebate. While I haven&#x27;t got the rebate yet, shaver itself is working great beyond the look. Wish it comes with the noise trimmer. Otherwise, I think this is an excellent buy with the rebate.</li>
            <li> Still going strong. Replaced the heads a month or two ago, and is still my primary razor. Very happy with this one.</li>
            <li> Philips razors are usually very good.  I have owned a number of models in the past.&lt;br /&gt;This one is good value for money.  It is however a little on the noisy side.  I have an older model that is slightly quieter.&lt;br /&gt;It would also be much better if the clipper were somehow &amp;#34;built-in&amp;#34; ... or at least if Philips was providing a proper case for storage.  I guess these are features included with the more expensive models.</li>
            <li> I got this product last year, as I wanted to have a wet shaver as previously I have used Norelco dry shavers only and felt that after a year the blades get blunt and the need replacing. This shaver gave a good feel for initial few months of use as the shave was close but I found that the inside construction had cheap feel using small plastic to hold down the blades in place. Also the locking mechanism is not as good and the blades would come out while cleaning under running tap water. Still considering that I wanted the close shave feel I carried on without return (now I feel made wrond desicion) but in less than year the top blade mechanism broke in two pieces and making the shaver useless. Now, I am waiting to send it back to the manufacturer for warranty coverage.&lt;br /&gt;Though I was saved by the old shaver I had which is still good after two years. Also, I found that the trimmer comes as a separate attachement which is not user friendly. Further the charger needs to have the base for charging which no one can carry when on travel as it is too big to fit in shaving kit bag. Thus, it happened with me that 2 times the shaver got on by itself in the shaving kit bag given that the button are very sensitive to touch (thus name \\&quot; Sensotouch\\&quot;) and there was no charging base with me. Had to borrow the razors from hotel and one time even had to rush out to buy from local store.&lt;br /&gt;I think Philips has not made this shavers as sturdy as their other shavers and further screwed up in the design.</li>
            <li> So good .I like it very much.I hope to have more such preferential activities.And hope to the first time know。&lt;br /&gt;Thanks very  much!</li>
            <li> OK，very  good!  iLIKE it !!  give my baby!  Philips Norelco 1150X/40 SensoTouch 2D Electric Razor.Philips Norelco 1150X/40 SensoTouch 2D Electric Razor</li>
            <li> Purchased to replace old Norelco that was 10 years old.  Cleaning is easy and quick. This gives a closer shave.</li>
            <li> This shaver gave my face a bad case of the feels. I never even knew what skin was supposed to feel like before I used this bad boy and I have never looked back.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric razor I ever used.  It&#x27;s very comfortable and enjoyable, and really far beyond my expectation.</li>
            <li> Considering the price, this shaver is the worst I&#x27;ve ever owned. The actual shaving performance is not on par with products that have a similar price tag.&lt;br /&gt;The charging station is annoying and it&#x27;s required for charging. You don&#x27;t have the option to use the station to charge or directly charge with the cord (as other products offer). I don&#x27;t have much space so the station takes up too much room. And it fall over way too easy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never owned a shaver that has a cleaning process that is as tedious as this one. All three shaving head are supposed to go back in the same hole when you take it apart and put it back together. Trying to keep track of that while you&#x27;re cleaning is ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend buying this product. It&#x27;s a step back for electric shavers and there are far better products out there--products that perform better and are easier to charge and clean.</li>
            <li> Something very good, with coupons, very good value, and I love it.The next will come back to buy bath just sound big</li>
            <li> Works really well. Closest shave I ever got with an electric razor. Highly recommend  to anyone thinking of going electric.</li>
            <li> I go through blades like you wouldn&#x27;t believe; that gets expensive and still cannot get the results I want. I decided to try a high quality electric razor to see how it compares. I have used other brands and get really bad razor burn, and even the lesser expensive Norelco. They were better than the other brands but still I suffered razor burn and chafing.  This SensoTouch 2D gives me the most comfortable shave ever with an electric razor and does a good job giving me a close shave. I have not tried it wet yet, but I like the easy water cleanup when I use it from time to time. As I shave with it more and more, it gets more comfortable and a closer shave, just like the manual said. I love it and I am glad I bought it. Best electric razor I ever owned.</li>
            <li> I have placed my order on Thursday and I didn&#x27;t expect to be able to received it that quick !! Awesome shipping service , I have got my parcel on Monday afternoon . It is a Xmas gift for my husband and I am sure he will love it ! Look like someone is trying to open the box but everything still look new and good quality ! 5 stars for both pricing and service! Thanks !!!</li>
            <li> I bought two razors are Philips, a 1150 and a 1250.As a New Year gift for my friends, they liked.I think there is nothing wrong with my choice.</li>
            <li> I have had Norelco for a long time. I tried a non-Norelco and ended up replacing it sooner that I expected. pay a little more and get quality.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver. I always use blade as I prefer a much cleaner shave. However after getting this shaver, this became my goto razor before going to work. I like how it glides to my face with ease. I do have a really sensitive skin but I&#x27;m not getting any rashes whenever I get to use this. Already recommended this product to some of my friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my new electric shaver.  It works quietly, efficiently, and almost as good as a regular razor shave.  Very pleased with this procuct</li>
            <li> Works extremely well.  Cuts very smooth and cause no irritation. Built well. It comes with the detachable trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Just a little surprise with low humming noise from the wall charger.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I like this shaver but it doesn&#x27;t get as close as avertised. I have to go over and over spots that the shaver does not get it done. I probably could have bought a cheaper model that would do the same.</li>
            <li> it,s every thing i read about and more,the best dam shave i could get.thank you norelco,you are the greatess ever</li>
            <li> My husband likes it. But the price&#x27;s cut 10 dollars down just after my order. It&#x27;s a pity that I didn&#x27;t get it at its lowest price.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s got a good reputation，my husband was very satisfied with it.  I&#x27;ll recommend it to my friends and family soon.</li>
            <li> Great shaver! works well dry or wet .....  it can go in the shower with it and does a good job I highly recommend it. Just remember to clean it and dry it off after....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using mine for 6 months now with no complaint. Took me a little bit to get used to it because I&#x27;ve been using razors since I could grow a beard. The results are smooth and without any missed ones. Great in the shower or I use mine with shaving cream because it helps the surface to glide and contour on the jawline.</li>
            <li> good stuff. Like it so much and use it at daily basis. A little bit noise than I had one before.</li>
            <li> Even with the trimmer attachment, does not remove hair easily.  I would recommend scissors and a straight razor before I would recommend this garbage.</li>
            <li> works great, easy to clean, takes a moment to put back together.&lt;br /&gt;shaves nice would recommend for everyone who has to shave.</li>
            <li> Shaves close, recharges well. This is the only razor that hasn&#x27;t left rough places on my skin. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like the product with perfect function. It is the best electric razor I have used. good excellent aaaaaaaaa aaaaaa</li>
            <li> very good, and it support RQ12, i will try it serval months later. i like it very much, and it&#x27;s very cheap. $59</li>
            <li> first It looks beautiful,and I feel comfortable when I use it.Then it is not only useful but also very cheep!</li>
            <li> good product ,want any more,more cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good product ,want any more&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good product&lt;br /&gt;good product ,want any more,more cheap,etc...&lt;br /&gt;by</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much much more cheaper than China.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty good and like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy one more for my father.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best shaver I have ever owned! It does not pull hair at all and can be used in the shower! Norelco has always made awesome shavers.</li>
            <li> smooth,easy to recharge and good looking,this is a good gift for my family number.may be i will get back and buy another for my father.</li>
            <li> I should start off by saying that this watch takes a reasonable amount of intelligence for you to get the most out of it. I have yet to find anything negative about it but you need to keep these things in mind.</li>
            <li> I had hoped this would be a reasonable replacement for a dead Senso Touch 3D.  I am a long time Norelco user so I thought I knew what to expect.  The shave quality of this unit was terrible, not up to Norelco standards certainly.  The on/off switch is difficult to use, the power and charging indicators not intuitive. Very disappointing on all fronts.  I have returned this unit for a higher end Norelco.</li>
            <li> I like five 1150xs,but not better than 7310.noise loudly.this price is higher.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it that spending $75 by per.</li>
            <li> Very comfortableto use,  buy not sharp enough,  overall it&#x27;s okay ..........lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo .......</li>
            <li> The product is great, very good! Is worth purchasing, the price is ok!&lt;br /&gt;The product is great, very good! Is worth purchasing, the price is ok!</li>
            <li> the price is appropriated。&lt;br /&gt;this item can shave clean than the old one。&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is used time not long enough after charging.</li>
            <li> Perfect, I am happy to have it. Never let you disappointed, I will buy some more after it break down</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of facial hair but one charge lasted me almost eight months with 2 or 3 shaves per week.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice. My dad loves it.</li>
            <li> Came on time and as described.</li>
            <li> great item just as expected very good quality</li>
            <li> I have used it for almost 2 years, and found not problems with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean, and charge is quick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gift for my father, he loves it!</li>
            <li> my husband loves it .  I bought it for his christmas gift.  It&#x27;s easy to use with high quality. very good。</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not giving this el. shaver a 5-stars only because it&#x27;s somewhat more noisy compared to older Norelco models, which disappointed me. Also the fact that the trimmer is not a part of the shaver, needs additional steps in order to attach the trimmer instead of the shaver.</li>
            <li> This is a well engineered, well designed product, overall feel is good, clean shave and simple removal of head for cleaning. The fit into thr cradle is well designed a charge lasts for a very good time and I recommend this producr</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and you can shave everyday when you take a shower!It looks very nice and handle well!</li>
            <li> It is a good electric shaver made by a brand name so far after 20 days use. However, I don&#x27;t know how long I have to wait for my $30 rebate for this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric shaver I have ever used. It gives a very close shave, it is quiet and easy to clean. I&#x27;ve owned other electric shavers over the years and none of them have given me as good a shave as the Senso Touch 2d has. It does the job in a very short time too. The design is great, it&#x27;s easy to hold and looks very cool in the charging stand. Amazon had a thirty dollar off coupon that made it a great buy as well. I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
            <li> I bought this after I got tired of my old shaver. It was a braun that didnt has the three blades but just a single long blade. Not sure what they call those. Anyway when I first started shaving my dad said the 3 bladed shavers always worked best for him but I bought my first electric shaver in a pinch at an Army PX store. Worked really well for a few years but I decided to try this one out. It is pretty quiet, looks good, holds a good charge and cleans easy but when it comes to the little hairs on the neck is just doesnt work. Shaving with this seems to take a lot longer than my old shaver and I still have to shave in the shower to get the small hair on my neck. The nice thing is is you dont have to press hard to get the hairs. If anything a nice light touch and it does the job better than pressing harder.</li>
            <li> I received my package before the Chinese spring festival.  The package is very good, nothing misses during long way transportation.  The shaver is easy to use.  I didn&#x27;t expect it shave so smoothly.  I love it.</li>
            <li> It looks good. I bought it as a gift. So not tried it yet. But the price is really low.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver around last MAX, and received it after 3 days. I works perfect. And the only thing is not good is I have not got the rebate so far.</li>
            <li> This is a decent razor, but I ended up returning it.  First, for me, it does not shave better than the 7310, which is considerably cheaper.  Second, it doesn&#x27;t travel very well: the head tends to separate from the body in one&#x27;s bag, and the charging stand is bulky and awkwardly shaped (and thus hard to pack). Again, the 7310 has neither of these problems (and also can be used while plugged in if the batteries run low).  I would recommend the 7310 instead, as it is a much better value.</li>
            <li> I had been using a Philips Norelco 1060X for a few years and was getting ready to buy new blades. I saw this one and decided to give it a try. I use it with a gel shaving cream and it works great. Very close and nick free and clean up is very easy.</li>
            <li> I went out and purchased this at a local store for about $100 bucks. I am working overseas in a location that does not suit the typical razor and cream, so I thought I would try this out. After about a month I can honestly say that I am not very impressed. It takes forever to shave with this thing. If you happen to wait a week in between shaving just forget about using this shaver. It will do the job eventually, but misses long strands of hair on the face and neck. You will have to continuously go back and try and get the stragglers. Since I found this out, I have been using it every other day with somewhat adequate results. Using this shaver on your neck is a pain in the butt. It does not just glide over your face and neck. The directions say use a swirling pattern. Last time I tried that I cut the side of my lip and portions of my neck... I have only used this as a dry shaver, so no info on the cream or wet shave. The shaver is relatively easy to clean and charge. The little beard trimmer attachment is garbage. My 10 dollar beard trimmer does a better job. I gave this shaver three out of four because it does work (with a little effort) and is somewhat cheaper than the other models.</li>
            <li> This shaver is just an average product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What made the thing worse is that this company \\&quot;Phillips\\&quot; does not even&lt;br /&gt;honor its own official rebate saying Amazon has this product on sale so they don&#x27;t honor the rebate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has all sorts of products on sale all the time. A product on sale should not be the reason for Phillips to reject the rebate. I will not use any Phillips product again since this company is such an untrustworthy company.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to file my complaints with other customer right agencies like BBB or FTC.&lt;br /&gt;For those who have been denied rebate by Phillips, you could do the same.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Razor in November from Amazon.  Amazon took $30 off and then I filled out a $30 rebate form and sent it to Philips.  I have just now (4 months later) received a reply postcard which states that my rebate will not be honored due to the discount taken by Amazon at the cash register.  First of all the razor is OK at best, it cannot be used if your facial hair gets very long and I have had more razor burn from it than with a simple disposable razor. I am disappointed as neither Amazon nor Philips warn about this trap.  I certainly would not have purchased this if I knew I would not receive the full discount. Most discouragingly, I am currently chatting with a representative from Philips simply named \\&quot;Mack\\&quot;.  He has been very abrupt with me, not answering questions really only giving me the same line.  I have asked to speak to a supervisor and he states that there are none on duty and if I want to speak to anyone I must write Philips (snail mail style).  Needless to say I am more than disappointed with this entire experience.    **Update** Mack disconnected told me our conversation was \\&quot;going nowhere\\&quot; and disconnected the chat:    JW: Mack are you in the United States currently?  Mack: Yes.  JW: Mack are you in Massachusetts?  Mack: JW, it seems that the chat conversation is going nowhere and I need to disconnect the chat.  Mack: Thank you for contacting Philips.  Mack: Bye. Take care.    **Update 2** Chatted with AMAZON and had much better experience, a customer shouldn&#x27;t have to go through this, but none the less (p.s. the first person I spoke with didn&#x27;t comprehend anything)  THANKS AMAZON:    Me:No Neha, I am due the full $30.  There are several customers having the same issue and Amazon has issued them full refunds:  http://www.amazon.com/Philips-1150x-40-SensoTouch-Electric/product-reviews/B003V360NY/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_top_recent?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;showViewpoints&#x3D;0&amp;sortBy&#x3D;bySubmissionDateDescending  Neha:But, the rebate which you have received from this item is of$10.  Me:Neha.. Here is the rebate I was denied:  [...]  That is for $30  Neha:Please allow me a moment. Let me check further.  Thank you for your patience.  JW, as per your words, I am issuing $30 promotional credit on your account and the promotional credit will automatically be applied on your next purchase and on the items which are sold and shipped by Amazon.  You will be able to see the credit applied on your account at the checkout page while placing the order and it will neither be applied on the items which are sold and shipped by a third party seller or sold by a third party seller and shipped by Amazon.  Me:Thank you very much, even though I was supposed to receive this in cash I am happy that Amazon has stepped up here in this instance.  Neha:Thank you for your patience and understanding JW.  Is there anything else I can do for you today?  Me:No, goodnight.</li>
            <li> Purchased this just for $30 mail-in rebate. After sending all the paper work to the Philips and learnt recently that the rebate is not going to be honored due to the discount taken at Amazon. Very disappointed as neither Amazon nor Philips warn about this rebate trap.</li>
            <li> The worst product I ever bought in my life. The product did not work well, I called Philips support line, but Philips customer reps are even worse, they could not solve your issues but kicked the ball around until you had the products for over 90 days, then they said you could not return the product. Even though they admitted it was totally their fault, but they did not allow you to return the product. They play tricks with customer.</li>
            <li> Price after $30 rebate would give this shaver a 5-star quality for its price. Since we are all time having problem with Phillip Norelco rebate, we would switch to Panasonic shaver since Panasonic gives better service.</li>
            <li> When I bought it, it said if you mail it back , u will get a rebate. I and my friends all bought this product but nobody ever got the promised rebate. Very bad!</li>
            <li> Christmas present for my husband. He wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the product but kept it anyway. 1 year later the razor does not work. I expected to get more than 1 year of use. Would not recommend. SAVE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> Purchased this Norelco only because of $30 Rebate during Black Friday.&lt;br /&gt;However today a card from Philips sent to me instead of check:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Thank you for participating in the Norelco $30 Rebate promotion. Unfortunately we could not honor your request due to the following reason: Manufacturer&#x27;s discounts taken at the cash register are not valid for rebate promotions.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That reason never showing on their rebate form. Also I submitted the rebate on their website, never rejected me. Since I left our email, Philips non-stop to send me ad flyers.</li>
            <li> Norelco doesn&#x27;t honor its rebates. It rejected the rebate applications of everyone who purchased this product from Amazon at a discount. The postcard we all received said \\&quot;Manufacturer&#x27;s discounts taken at the register are not eligible for rebates.\\&quot; However, the rebate form states, \\&quot;Offer is not redeemable in stores.\\&quot; So the rebate couldn&#x27;t have been taken at the register. Upon calling them, I was given a different reason, that the rebate form said, \\&quot;May not be combined with other offers.\\&quot; Clearly, that meant that you cannot use two rebates from Norelco on the same item, not that you cannot receive a discount from the seller and still be eligible for a rebate. It&#x27;s disgusting that a company as large as Philips would try to dodge its obligations on a flimsy pretext like that. I will never buy another product of theirs and I urge anyone reading this not to either. I hope it costs them a lot more than the amount they saved on all of the $30 rebates they by improperly rejected.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers I want to say that philips did not honour our rebates and they give different reasons by mail and when you call them. I&#x27;m leaving this feedback more for the company than for the product. I would have bought this product from another company if they would not have sold it with the rebate</li>
            <li> I am so love it,I want to buy more,but you limitied the number,how can i do,it is very good.it is the one i want.</li>
            <li> Very good razor, I recommend to anyone who is not very stiff bristles. No irritation and discomfort. Fast charging of the accumulators, the possibility of wet shaving</li>
            <li> Great razor, good shave, excellent battery life, comfortable using, nice ergonomics - why didn&#x27;t I get one years ago? Strong buy recommendation especially for the price - not sure how much better higher end, higher priced models could be</li>
            <li> Makes my face break out with razor bump but works well other wise. Just wish I didn&#x27;t have the razor bumps.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! Great experience!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve tried an electric.  Never seemed to get a very close shave and I was hoping that over the years they have gotten better.  They haven&#x27;t.  If you don&#x27;t mind a 3&#x27;oclock shadow at 8am then it&#x27;s ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going back to the razor and using this as a decorative item, it looks great.</li>
            <li> The shaver did everything the ad said it would. It shaves closely and cleanly.</li>
            <li> Good shaver good price</li>
            <li> nice shaver.  battery lasts</li>
            <li> ITS AN AVERAGE SHAVER</li>
            <li> What a sexy looking shaver. It also functions beautifully. Clean and sharp on shaving. Comfortable on grip.</li>
            <li> electric razors are good only as fill in shavers when there isn&#x27;t time or energy for a shaving cream and razor shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a good electric shaver and with reasonable price. The shaving experience is good than before shaver. The package is also good.</li>
            <li> I had been using a foil shaver that finally gave out on me.  I decided to go back to a rotary type to replace it.  While I was waiting to get the new Norelco I dug out a 10 year old Remington Titanium shaver that I had stopped using.  It still worked well when plugged into the AC.  The batteries were about gone which was not surprising considering its age.  When I got the Norelco in and started using it I was sadly disappointed at how much less closely it shaved me over the 10 year old Remington.  It also had more drag across my face than the Rem due to all the rubber surrounding the cutting heads.  I also discovered that you cannot plug an AC power cord into it to keep it going in case you forget and let it run down. You can with the Rem. I returned this Norelco and ordered a new Remington R5130xlp (about the same price).  It shaves much closer and with less drag on my face. Better ergos in my opinion as well, but that is subjective.  I also prefer its mechanical on/off switch and a % of charge remaining lights that this Norelco does not have.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco razors for more than 50 years.  I have had practically everyone they have manufactured. Some have been better shavers than others.  I like the ability to wash the razer head with hot water, etc., and have been using these models for many years.  When I purchased a Norelco SensoTouch 1150X believing it was an improvement over the former models.  I have given the razor several months&#x27; trial.  I do not like or recommend this model.  I am now using an older model which does a better shaving job for me.</li>
            <li> The product is very good, power is very adequate.Segment also humane, very good.I also will be the next purchase of Philips,</li>
            <li> I have shaved with a Norelco razor for several year, this is my first bad one it is noisyier than my other razor&#x27;s and does not shave as good, I recharged my old one and it shaved much better than the new model 1150X</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase.  Have always shaved and this is my husband&#x27;s first electric.  He is very happy with the Norelco.  I am very happy with delivery and price.</li>
            <li> I buy it for my father and he likes it.I would buy this product again.It can be used by myself and for friends.</li>
            <li> Super smooth save with easy clean up. works great wet/dry. hold plenty charge &amp; operating time. Have not tried the trimmer as of yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of this shaver in terms of how well it works and its battery life, but one area where it really falls short is its travel-friendliness. What makes this such a pain to travel with is the charger: it is a rigid stand about 3/5ths the height of the shaver, and while it has suction cups on the bottom of it that give it the ability to stick to mirrors and some surfaces, the stand is bulky and EXTREMELY awkward to carry anywhere. And even if you are able to fit in a travel bag or another part of your suitcase, you have to worry about it breaking it  - thus eliminating your ability to charge your shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;+ sleek, modern look&lt;br /&gt;+ good battery life&lt;br /&gt;+ very flexible and surprisingly soft shaver head (good for nice close shave resulting in smooth skin afterwards)&lt;br /&gt;+ nice and intuitive indicator lights (telling you if the battery is low, if the device is charging properly, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;+ seems to be very water resistant&lt;br /&gt;+ comes with shaver, beard trimmer, charging stand (with cord), and cleaning brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- charging stand is rigid, bulky, and VERY difficult to travel with&lt;br /&gt;-  shaving attachments sometimes fall off when shaving (the happens quite seldom and the chance of it can be minimized by making sure that you apply a good amount of pressure when inserting the shaving attachments)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully Phillips Norelco can develop a way to make the travel stand foldable so that it will be much easier to travel with because that would make this product an easy 5-star device.</li>
            <li> Hi. Thank you very much for such products. I am very pleased with this purchase :) It is very practical and very efficient. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> My son requested this shaver and I found it on Amazon for a better price than anywhere else. My son loves it!</li>
            <li> It is a gift and my friend likes it very much. It is a good product for its price .</li>
            <li> this one is good,my husband loves it ! Next time ，I willl get one for my friend as a  present。</li>
            <li> This new razor gives a close shave.  The redesigned head is comfortable and maneuverable .  I would have preferred a direct cable connection to recharge the razor and I have not adjusted to changes heads to use the trimmer.  Overall, I am delighted with the purchase.</li>
            <li> fit meSpeaking of, the shaver charges somewhat unconventionally. It has a base that you drop it into and it charges through contacts on the side of the shaver. A complete charge takes 1 hour, and lasts 40 minutes. The low battery light alerts you when there are 5 minutes of shave time left. The only disadvantage to this system is that you cannot use the shaver while it is plugged in. If you&#x27;re like me and put off charging till the last minute, you may find yourself out of juice when you need to shave in a hurry. A quick charge feature allows you to charge the shaver for 5 minutes, and get 3 minutes of shaving time, but sometimes 5 minutes is more than I have when I&#x27;m in a rush.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m from china,oh,my poor english..i like it.so,i wanna buy it again. ok? dala dala dala dala ... dala dala dala~</li>
            <li> Great, my husband really like this product, which is his New Year&#x27;s gift. Amazon to buy really good,  I like it</li>
            <li> I had a Cool Skin 6700 series which I liked better as well as a Braun which I really liked and a lot more convenient when traveling (but the Braun didn&#x27;t have anything behind the blades to collect the cut stubble). The blades on this get dull sooner than the Cool Skin as well. And definitely not practical for travel - you have to have the stand to charge it.</li>
            <li> Frankly, I am disappointed in the shave, it&#x27;s not very close. I thought the new technology would give me a better, closer shave. But this razor doesn&#x27;t cut any closer than my old Norelco, a 73--XL, which is about 10 years old and needs new heads, and cost about only 40% of this new one. Also, the new one is very noisey/loud. I thought a new  razor would be quieter. With the noise this makes, it doesn&#x27;t sound like a very good razor. Another disadvantage, is I have to remove the razor head and put on a trimming head if I want to do some trimming. With my old razor, all I had to do was trip the trimmer and it popped up. Seems your design has regressed, not progressed. I am considering sending the new razor back.  Wes Malcolm</li>
            <li> Just got it and love it. The instructions say &#x27;&#x27;give it 30 days&#x27;&#x27;, but I am satisfied after 3 days !</li>
            <li> Not big,not heavy,it&#x27;s in a good price and very usefull for me!&lt;br /&gt;I will buy another one when it&#x27;s on sale next time.</li>
            <li> Promotions are purchased only $ 60.A good deal.Dutch original. In mainland China to sell 1,100 yuan. Equivalent to $ 200. Logistics speed very fast. The disadvantage is that the packaging is not strong. Shaver box a bit distorted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet cheap and very useful to my lift, it&#x27;s easy to clean and assemble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will my new one to my dad.</li>
            <li> meet my expectations and gives an exceptionally good shave. Easy to use, great charging stand easy to pack and store</li>
            <li> my husband likes to have one at home and one in the car.  his prior (older) Norelco finally died so i got him this one.  he loves it. the battery stays charged nicely and it gives him a great shave.</li>
            <li> This is my first time to buy a electronic razor, my transitional razor worked better for me actually. However, this one saves a lot of time.</li>
            <li> When wet shaving with this unit it comes closer to a blade shave than anything i&#x27;ve used in my 67 years.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor to replace both a women&#x27;s electric and my Gillette bladed razor.  The women&#x27;s electric seeemed too flimsy and broke within a few months - just past it&#x27;s 90 day warranty.  ALthough this razor is an excellent piece of equipment all the way around, I am not happy with the shaving.  I guess nothing will ever match some nice shave gel and a razor in the shower.  This razor gets three out of five because it is comfortable to hold, the head rotates well around &amp;#34;knobby&amp;#34; areas like ankles and knees, seems to charge well and quickly, holds a charge for several days (and legs are a lot more area to cover than faces!), and it is made well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have switched to an epilator that works MUCH better.</li>
            <li> Grate razor and it cuts close and fast with no pulling, it is easy to clean and holds a good charge.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver.  I recommend it to any one.  Good close shave every time both wet and dry.</li>
            <li> looks nice and really comfortable. Deserves to buy. My father likes it very much. Also, the package looks pretty, said by mum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered it 2 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;Used it daily, twice on day. Excellent quality.</li>
            <li> -:¦:-A-:¦:-W-:¦:-E-:¦:-S-:¦:-O-:¦:-M-:¦:-E-:¦:-</li>
            <li> bought it to get a closer shave, could hardly get it to shave anything</li>
            <li> Not so good.  There are better choices for a nice electric shave.</li>
            <li> It is very good with them, that is a little bit big noise.</li>
            <li> all went will good product buy</li>
            <li> the shaver is pretty good, but the single track heads miss a bunch of hairs and may take a while to cut. The method for fixing this is to buy the replacement head for the more expensive sensotouch 3d. You then get a 250 dollar shaver for 130! ive been doing this since i got this replacement in april, and i dont see myself going back.</li>
            <li> has been working good</li>
            <li> Very good, cost-effective</li>
            <li> That is OK,But is not very good.That is OK,But is not very good.But is not good like 3D items.Thank.It just so so</li>
            <li> Still not completely satisfied with the closeness or lack of the the shave, but am getting used to it.  A few more days will tell.</li>
            <li> My very old Philips Norelco, which was similar in design, had just died.  Chose this one online and have not regretted it since.  Easy to clean and gives the closest shave I&#x27;ve gotten in a long time from an electic model.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of electric shavers, I find them to provide a less than perfect shave - leaving blotches of hair and not being close enough, this electric shaver, however, is in my opinion the closest you can get to a razor shave.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for the last month and I think that I&#x27;m now ready to provide an accurate and detailed review.</li>
            <li> Philips razor has been synonymous with speed and efficiency, it is not exceptional also, and the price is very cheap, but a bit less than is generally work, the color is too young to charge some instability</li>
            <li> I have used a Norelco triple head shaver for the last 20 years, had many units and replaced the cutters and I was still happy with the product.  I bought this one last year (January 2012) from Amazon as a present for myself, since it looked like a neat design and had features which I liked.  The charging stand is an added bonus.  So what&#x27;s the problem, you say?  It just does not remove the hairs from those hard to shave places, like under my nose, along the sides under the shin and even under my lower lip.  The old Norelco units I had did not have the amount of give that the new ones do in the motion of the cutting heads.  So, now it sits in a drawer and I finally had enough of complaints from my inspector general wife that she could still see the hairs after a shave.  Solution:  I researched shavers and found the Panasonic ES-LA63-S Nanotech 4-Blade (Arc 4) Multi-Flex Dual-Motor Electric Shaver and ordered it from Amazon last month.  Now this is a real improvement.  Removes all the hair from the hard to shave areas and it passes the Wife Test.  I won&#x27;t be using my Norelco since I have found a shaver that really works and meets all my needs.  Sorry Norelco/Amazon, but time moves on and so have I.  Moral: never change a design that has worked for many years just to sucker in some new shavers in the youth crowd who don&#x27;t know better.  If you are one of the newbies, be my guest, but you owe to yourself to try the Panasonic line.</li>
            <li> Takes multiple passes to cut 75% of the hairs. You will never get all the hair and spend the rest of the day with patches and red irritated skin. A $10 Mach razor is much better and faster, The only thing you get with this razor is the ability to shave on the go but trust me everyone will know. Got one for Christmas and was the first electric in many years. I had forgot that these things were this bad. Well see you again in 20 years when they sucker me back into another one.</li>
            <li> I cannot provide any &amp;#34;rave&amp;#34; for this as the past several Norelco&#x27;s I&#x27;ve purchased have not held up well. This one borders on the fragile side and is difficult to clean. I will say the shave is smooth and gets rid of the beard..</li>
            <li> I really have enjoyed this shaver. My old one would not shave as close, but this one does an excellent job.</li>
            <li> Light weight, very quiet and excellent product. Have use other product brands and they did not cut as well and irritated my face.</li>
            <li> So far so good this one -- based on quality/price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if it can stay with a good performance.</li>
            <li> I used to shave the beard is very clean.Easy to use, body wash, Thank you such a good product,I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li> it used good and comfortable！look so cool ！ It is very strong and durable！  I like this products  very much!</li>
            <li> this is very bad item that i second time ordered, first one was better i use it till. may be secnd is patent i do not know</li>
            <li> Works great and is a good value.  I read other reviews and decided this would be a good one to get. I love it!</li>
            <li> The product has a high cost performance, I have used thisrazor two weeks. It&#x27;s a good razor,  I love that it&#x27;s water proof,  this razor is a 5 star in my book.</li>
            <li> Design quality, appearance is very beautiful, very smooth shave, hope can be lasting and reliable quality, hope the blade can be maintained for a long time, also hope to be able to buy the right accessories</li>
            <li> Very surprised by the clean shave I get, even without using a pre-shave. Only gave it 4 stars because the shave doesn&#x27;t last as long as a blade and I sometimes have to shave twice a day to stay clean shaven. Still, I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> battery lasts for ever. water proof, nice looks! easy to clean. easy to wash. has a nice stand that suits the item nicely in it.</li>
            <li> The shaver is all that I could have wanted. It gets the job done and holds a charge for a long time, sometimes longer than the advertised 3 weeks. As far as functionality goes, there is nothing that I can complain about. The only drawback is the price of the replacement shaver heads. On average they are between $40 and $50. A little pricey but then again it is a replacement for a quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I&#x27;d recommend it to friends and family.</li>
            <li> It did not work as expected and could not cut 2 days growth of beard on an African American. This is the second Norelco we have bought and been disappointed, but I couldn&#x27;t bother to make a return. I will stick to the T-outliner in the future.</li>
            <li> very good!  gaoduan daqi shangdangci hiahia~ I  got this for my friend and she give it to her husband as a gift, both of them are very satisfied.</li>
            <li> i barelly remember i bought this,,, because it is long long time ago...</li>
            <li> It shaves hair. Thats what it is made to do. It does this. Okay.</li>
            <li> very nice shaver for the price I only charge it once and I use it for 2 months its perfect I love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got this razor at a reasonable price, and my father likes it very much and replaced the old one.</li>
            <li> This shaver is a top of the line instrument. Smooth as silk in using it, dry or wet alike. High quality construction. A bargain for under $100.</li>
            <li> works like advertised. no complaints .14 more words reqyuired what kind of b.s. is this.If I have to complete a survey like this everytime I buy something maybe i&#x27;ll look elsewhere!!</li>
            <li> This shaver is  beautiful ,but the shaver can&#x27;t stand up with its fixture because the fixture is too lightness.</li>
            <li> Still use this shaver to this day.  Never replaced the blades yet and it is still doing a great job.  The battery also holds a charge although I don&#x27;t use it for very long each day.</li>
            <li> An amazing product. Fits well in the hand. Heads (one for face, one for mustache trimming) are removable and sit well up from the body of the razor. Recharges in the supplied stand. But, this is all secondary: my face is, for all intents and purposes, as smooth as if shaved with a blade.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge for 3 to 4 weeks traveling.  I have always used a Norelco and this one is waterproof.</li>
            <li> This is third Phillips shaver i am using and i can tell that first model was best and my grandpa still is using it, after me. i bought it 15 years ago and haven&#x27;t changed heads. Second one was worst than first one, but still good. I&#x27;ve got it some 7 years ago and used without changing blades, and now my dad is using it. and this one first impression was not as clean shave as previous ones, also it says change blades after 1 year, when previous ones i used without changing blades. seems quality is getting worse and worse.</li>
            <li> it was broken when I used it for 4 months.It can not be charged anymore.So bad.Never buy it.</li>
            <li> worse than my old two-head Philips</li>
            <li> I bought this in the middle and did not work. then sent again and he immediately deteriorated. serve no purpose Philips Norelco 1150X / 40 Shaver 6100. they deceive buyers. Do not let be deceived and do not buy these things are defective.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I got this, but it&#x27;s been a total letdown from the beginning. My husband used it first and he said it takes several strokes for it to work and it&#x27;s not a close shave at all. Then I tried it. I use it on my knees and down by my ankles since I seem to cut myself with a real razor. It does not work! At all! Seriously! We had a 15 year old Remington that I threw away thinking this &#x27;high tech&#x27; razor would be better and I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have done that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been about 3 months since we bought this and I&#x27;m done with it&#x27;s poor performance, so I&#x27;m on the prowl for a new razor.</li>
            <li> This shaver gives a smooth and clean shave. It provides a very comfortable, good feel as it glides over the skin. Great product.&lt;br /&gt;My husband liked this so much, we purchased a second one for his brother, a stroke victim.</li>
            <li> Amazon has always let me have much to look forward to, quality needless to say. Very fit, I like it hope to be able to have the more preferential activities Fast charging, motion gentle</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Dad a couple years ago and he&#x27;s still using it.  He said it works great for him and he&#x27;s never had any trouble with it.</li>
            <li> Bought it @ Amazon for a $30 dollar coupon. However, after 6 months, Philips won&#x27;t valid the coupon due to  purchase @ Amazon.  The coupon was linked by Amazon website and supposed to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving with Philps 1150 is so so. You have to shave multiple times to have clear shave. The handling is good though. With the regular price, not worth buying. Go to get a higher end model or Braun.</li>
            <li> good item but mine has come Without Trimmer! -1 star for that... i opened box and there was no trimmer O.O</li>
            <li> health/personal care.&lt;br /&gt;Norelco senso touch 2 Electric Razor is not a very impractical or efficientv product.It does not shave3 very well and the requirement to change heads for trimming is time consuming</li>
            <li> it is good! at a good price, I bought 4 boxes for myself and relatives. worth to buy ! I like it</li>
            <li> Really nice razor.  Battery life is excellent.  Wish it came with a travel case but will have to buy one separate.</li>
            <li> I purchased it Nov. 20, 2011, three more uses per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The crispy skin above the only ON/OFF button is broken already.&lt;br /&gt;And there are four more cracks around the button&#x27;s cave (see my uploaded pictures please).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to press many times to turn it on or off right now, and I am sure it will be dead within a week as it no more waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;I live in LA and I am sure the crispy is not because of cold weather. It is really NOT a good design.</li>
            <li> Very cheap, grabbed, just over $60&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy home dad feel very good with it, but the replacement head is a bit of trouble</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband. He likes it very much. The color is beautiful and it&#x27;s good for using.</li>
            <li> i am not thrilled with the recharging stand, but the shaver is excellent.  ii would recommend this shaver to other people</li>
            <li> I just got mine yesterday, much better than Philips/Norelco 7340XL that I&#x27;ve been using for few years.&lt;br /&gt;from a children author - william sawyers</li>
            <li> Product has held up well during the time span I have had this razor. I need to replace the cutting blades but the unit still charges up and the charge lasts quite some time. Good product that is built well.</li>
            <li> my friend recommended this to me for my boy friend, was expecting more as this is the most expensive one I&#x27;ve bought.&lt;br /&gt;but not bad</li>
            <li> expected this to allow me to shave in a matter of 5 minutes. takes forever to cut hair, I have to run it SLOWLY over one patch of hair for minutes to get a clean shave. all in all not any faster or more convenient than a manual.</li>
            <li> I needed an electric razor and being female, it&#x27;s hard to find a decent one, so I ordered this &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34; razor.  It moves effortlessly over knees and curves.  The only drawback is when removing the plastic protective cap the shaver heads come off as well.  So I just have to do it over the sink or trash.  Otherwise I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The shaver works well. I wish they had been more clear in telling you the only way to charge it is using the stand.</li>
            <li> I got this razor for Christmas and still haven&#x27;t used it more than 5 times, but I really liked it so far. You can get a fast and clean shave because you can use it with your dry skin. I tried also using it with shaving foam and it was fantastic! It glides really well and doesn&#x27;t keep pulling your hair. It also comed with a trimmer, so if you want to shave it all off, you can still use it to even it out. I loved it!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I got tired of regular razors.  I have bough a lot of them and different brands.  I have a thick beard and it grows fast.  The Norelco is good but it is not like the commercials show.  I have to shave in all directions to get all(most) of the hairs cut, but when it does cut them it is very close.  I started using it with my shaving cream / wet but now I use it dry and it works good.</li>
            <li> Good product. The new ones are better, but this shaver is good for the price point.</li>
            <li> Discount is very good, love family, very to force, hope still to discount next time, I will continue to buy</li>
            <li> Summary: This shaver gives an inferior shave, but it has some great features that might make it a good choice for those with a light beard or who don&#x27;t care about a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Great ergonomics - fits well in the hand and a nice light weight.&lt;br /&gt;- Handy charging cradle makes it easy to recharge (compared to tight cord plug on other shavers).&lt;br /&gt;- Does a good job of shaving the jawline and neck.&lt;br /&gt;- Cool blue color and smooth, soft-touch design.&lt;br /&gt;- Not really quiet but a better timbre than other shavers makes it seem quieter.&lt;br /&gt;- The charge seems to last a really long time.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- A bit more irritating than the competition.&lt;br /&gt;- Not a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;- Five o&#x27;clock shadow makes appearance around noon.&lt;br /&gt;- Tough to shave the upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;- No incremental charge indicator.&lt;br /&gt;- Seems to be a slower shave than the competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full Review: Shaving is a pain in the neck, but I do it daily. I always shave wet (usually in the shower) and I use a good, non-foaming gel (King of Shaves). I say shaving dry with an electric razor is only slightly better than shaving dry with a blade. I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic shavers for about five years now after liberating myself from the overpriced Fusion system. Loved the Panasonics, but decided to try the Philips Norelco 1150X/40 based on positive reviews I read here. The thing I&#x27;ve found really annoying about the Panasonic razors is that the batteries fail to hold charge after about two years. My current Panasonic shaver (my 2nd) has a bad cell, so the indicator goes from 60 to zero in about 30 seconds. This means I need to remember charge every third day. I saw where Norelco offered a 2.5 year warranty so figured I&#x27;d give them a try. I liked the look and feel of the shaver. But, well.... the shaving not so much. I used the slick blue shaver for three weeks - it took about a week for my beard to adjust - and the results were just okay. My daughter called me &amp;#34;Mr. Scratchy&amp;#34; - really, the closeness that I&#x27;ve achieved with the comparably priced Panasonic mid-level razor was no contest. The Panasonic has more difficulty getting a clean shave on some parts of the neck and has a more annoying buzzing sound, but with a shave that is so superior I can only recommend this razor for perhaps 15 year-olds with only a few whiskers or others who have light beards.Scratchy&amp;#34; - really, the closeness that I&#x27;ve achieved with the comparably priced Panasonic mid-level razor was no contest.

            <li> Dissapointed in the quality of the shave. Not sure if blades need replacing...probably as with most products in todays world. You buy the product and spend tons on upkeep (printer cartridges come to mind)</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco electric razors 25 years or more, I decided to try the new format unit.  It works adequately and the battery last for many shaves,</li>
            <li> very good The design on the SensoTouch is quite futuristic, with a blue front, curved body, and perched shave head. It fits comfortably in the hand, and has a rubber ridge that runs around the edge for added grip (especially useful when using the shaver wet). The shaver has only one button on it, the power button, which is flush with the front of the shaver face. On the shaver front are also three indicator lights. They display low battery, battery charging, and control lock status. The control lock lets you disable the power button to prevent it from accidentally turning on (when traveling for instance). One annoying aspect of the shaver&#x27;s design, however, is that it is close to impossible to lay the shaver down without it turning on its side, and then dumping out some shavings onto the counter. You just have to remember to place the shaver back in the charging base if you have to stop mid-shave.</li>
            <li> I like it ! It gives you a great shave! long lasting battery life without recharging it- easy to clean! great price!</li>
            <li> This shaver is lighter and easier to hold and maneuver  than the previous model I&#x27;ve used for 10 years.  It doesn&#x27;t have the triple blades but doesn&#x27;t need them:  it is fast and close.  You can&#x27;t beat the price and it&#x27;s well worth it.  I almost did not get it but I&#x27;m so glad I did.  It has space-age looks and would do the job for anyone:  a great shave in half the time.</li>
            <li> THis is the second one I bought for the frind&#x27;s gift. My friend like it very much. It match its value.</li>
            <li> My husband does not like this at all. He said it rips out the hair instead of cutting it. It will be going back</li>
            <li> I love this shaving feeling, the price is materially beneficial. Will be in consumption. Service is also very good。&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend to friends</li>
            <li> Look beautiful, feel good,  noise is very small and clean shaven. This is a perfect product. I am happy to have it.</li>
            <li> A good product, and shipping is fast too.&lt;br /&gt;But it could not be satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Because it does not scale&lt;br /&gt;4 Unfortunately, the items themselves good</li>
            <li> I prefer my previous shaver because it had a built in trimmer.  I have to remove the shaver head and attach a separate trimmer head on my new shaver.  Also, the new shaver requires a separate charging stand.  My previous shaver plugged directly into an outlet for charging.  Otherwise it shaves fine, and has a longer lasting battery than my old shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought it after reading the reviews. I have a Brawn and this shaver is not even half as good as the Brawn. What a disappointment. It doesn&#x27;t shaver nearly as close as a Brawn, or the Panasonic for that matter. Unless you are a die hard Norelco fan I would stay away from this shaver. By the way, I don&#x27;t have a really tough beard.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this shaver at Target and returned it.  I have used Braun shavers for many years (at least since 1988).  My most recent Braun shaver&#x27;s battery would no longer hold a long enough charge and it was time for a replacement.  I visited my local Target and fell in love with the look of this razor and the fact that replacement blades were much cheaper than Braun&#x27;s.  I decided to give this Norelco a try.  I found that I got a very close shave, but the razor was very time consuming to keep clean, if you followed Norelco&#x27;s suggested cleaning methods.  About 3 weeks after purchase I noticed that the plastic body was opening at the seams on both sides of the body and returned it to Target the next day. I asked the clerk if this was unusual and he said he had seen this at least 1 time before. I replaced it with a more a expensive Braun Series 5 shaver and could not be happier with it.  Sorry I was unfaithful.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very eacy to use. and the price is much reasonable than best buy.&lt;br /&gt;wash, clean is easy. give me a very good feeling when shaving.</li>
            <li> very good.It is a very high-quality product.Is that accessories is too expensive.Hope that the future can be presented to replace the cutter head</li>
            <li> My wife got me this shaver as a gift.  I have very sensitive skin and this is my first electric shaver.  Before, I was using the Gillette fusion razors but even those irritated my skin pretty badly.  I love this shaver! I use it once a day on my way to work and I have zero irritation.  This product can also be used in the shower which is convenient if you like a wet shave.  Two drawbacks, trimmer is not the best and in order to use it you have to detach the shaving head.  Design is nice and it comes with a cool charging base which needs to be used maybe every the weeks.</li>
            <li> 4 Stars. In the future include an indicator to show how much time or power is remaining for a shave after a full charge.</li>
            <li> I bought it for present to my customer, and he loves it! It&#x27;s SOOOOO much cheaper compare with mainland China. Here it&#x27;s price is about ￥2000 (about $320).</li>
            <li> Great shaver. Great shave. Easy to use. Looks sleek. Great product.</li>
            <li> Really a high-tech capable razor.  After struggling with a similar model that was state-of-the-art a few years ago, the new model is a revelation!</li>
            <li> I.m a chinese customer.I bought it for my colleague.It&#x27;s a amazing product.</li>
            <li> I used the same Norelco for nearly 25 years. I finally broke down and got a new one. Wow, I didn&#x27;t realize what I was missing. Shaves smooth as silk and gets very close. Cleaning is a breeze.</li>
            <li> I would rate this shaver average mainly because it leaves hairs mainly around neck and no matter how much you move this around it wont pick those. Considering the price paid for this I expected this shaver to do better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this last thanksgiving so kind of used this over a year and kind of give up on this shaving, I mainly use this for trimming sideburns now.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver. Works great right out of the box. Easy to use and easy to charge. Feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave as close as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco 1150X/40 SensoTouch 2D Electric Razo，Philips Norelco。Well, I really like。Well, I really like。I hope to be able to better</li>
            <li> Have used Norelco products for 30+ years but this senso touch model is the best I&#x27;ve used. Very close comfortable shave. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have had this razor since 2010 and still use it today. I only changed the head once two years ago and although its probably due for a new head, it still serves its purpose for me each day. I bought the razor for myself and had it shipped to me in Iraq while I was deployed. I used it there everyday through the heat and sand storms. I could not ask for a better razor, definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Chinese,and I need it,that&#x27;s why I bought it on amazon. Everything is very good, very satisfied with the shopping, I will recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> For the money,  Norelco 1150/40 Sensor Touch 2  is a god buy.  Even though it is not updated technical advances and&lt;br /&gt;fancy gadgets, the price is reasonable and it costs more than half less compared with Sensor Touch 3.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the Norelco &amp; I do also as it truly gives him a close shave &amp; his skin is so smooth with absolutely no stubble. He has always used Norelco but it far.</li>
            <li> I buy this item for my friends, actually, the second coupon cannot be used, so the last price is 49.9. Well, it is still a good sliver.</li>
            <li> Sexy out look of the product had been the biggest reason I bought it. The shaving head of it moves execllent.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he loves it. Have taken it with while vacationing and it travels well. Would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This Norelco razor is a great product . I used previous \\&quot;standard\\&quot; norelco razor for many  years but this surpasses it for closeness of shave, shaving in tight areas (e.g. under nose), quickness and duration of charge, and effectiveness of trimmer (separate attach).</li>
            <li> I have tried everything, from safety razors to straight razors. I get in grown hairs all the time from just normal shaving. If you are at your ends wit for shaving and want something new, try this. It is the best shave I have ever had and with no irritation! Buy it!</li>
            <li> Bought this electric razor for my husband a couple of years ago and it still is holding up.  He uses it almost everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Brought this for my husband and it is the first (of many shavers) to get those stubborn, short,white hairs and leaves him so smooth! He and I loved it so much we brought one for my father!</li>
            <li> I really like this razor, really well. I survived it, great. I am very satisfied, I hope next time there Promotions</li>
            <li> often have some residuals. Seems not just for me. My roommate bought it and had the similar issues. Takes way longer time to shave.</li>
            <li> not as good as 3d razor should have bought the 3d version it gives a better shave than 2d shaver</li>
            <li> I like it, very comfortable razor, give it away too great grades, most importantly deals! Price is also very suitable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for 3 months now and cannot and have never been able to get a close shave. It will be going in the trash soon just like the $90 I paid for it. I believe this is the worst shaver I&#x27;ve ever had except for maybe those cheapy $10 jobs.</li>
            <li> Cuts well, smooth, small, comfortable in the hand, and the battery is most impressive.  I&#x27;ve used the unit at least 15 times and haven&#x27;t recharged it since the first time i used it.</li>
            <li> The trimmer on this razor barely cuts hair. It simply vibrates and doesn&#x27;t do anything as far as trying to even up sideburns or even shaping my stash. The facial part it works great at but the attatchment for trimming overall sucks. Sorry but I was very dissapointed because I need both of these in my everyday useage.</li>
            <li> I am so agravated or (pissed off) by this name brand product that turned out to be a piece of junk. The razors inside triple head easily and often fall out if opened or dropped accidentally and within several weeks all but one are missing making it useless and how can you do anything about it. I have had noreclco products for decades and none of them had such poor quality. You should be ashamed for marketing this to a senior citizen who has little access to help in returning or even figuring out how to. Once again Philips should be ashamed for marketing this piece of junk</li>
            <li> The best razor my boyfriend ever had he loves it!.simple to use works great dry or wet. Smooths on your face and neck</li>
            <li> Brought it on Black Friday sale. Nice price to buy a professional razor for my elder brother. Good brand, good quality, good price.</li>
            <li> My husband really liked it.  It came promptly in the mail. It also went missing after a get together at my home last week. The next one will be put away, even in our private bath.</li>
            <li> did not get the discount</li>
            <li> Really great product. I bought two for husband and son. Recommend it.</li>
            <li> Bought this razor to replace an ancient Norelco. Have used the 1150 for about three months now and am every unhappy with the product. I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard and yet it takes forever to shave with the 1150! It just does not provide a clean, convenient shave! By the time I finish shaving my skin is red from going over and over the same area to cut the whiskers! Cannot recommend the 1150……..other models may be a better choice!</li>
            <li> For the money it&#x27;s ok. I find that I have to spend a little more time shaving to get the job done. I would spen a little more money next time on a better razor.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that was light and had a head that was easy to replace, and which was not a big deal if it got wet.&lt;br /&gt;I like also the way the head floats and moves to accommodate your face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first real quality shaver I got. And the battery is a long life one. I really like it.</li>
            <li> it is a powerful razor, I like it. one hour needed to charge. if there is more spare head , it will be perfect.</li>
            <li> It has a good value for money,I like it very much.In my country,this kind of things sold  very  expensive,including other commodities like watchs, powdered milk,and so on.</li>
            <li> gave this as a Christmas gift, two years ago, and it  is a great shaver. better than all the rest.</li>
            <li> excellent!&lt;br /&gt;what a good thing! so cheap and nice!&lt;br /&gt;I like it very much!&lt;br /&gt;very nice!&lt;br /&gt;I happened to own it!</li>
            <li> give it a time around 3 weeks so your skin will adjust and then shaving is a pleasure - (beginings are rough)</li>
            <li> the gift for daddy , good looking and cleaning by water directly is very useful for our travell  life, I wish the 1250 has the same decline price if it is possible hahaha...</li>
            <li> Our son loves it.  Says it shaves great and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin.  It takes only minutes to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco brand shavers for over 40 years and have always been happy with them. This one seems to work as well as every other one I have owned. I am used to them feeling heavy and this one feels almost like there is nothing inside so not sure how well it will last over the years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good,Simply can shave a good,I really liked this item,the Philips Norelco SensoTouch electric shaver is very nicely designed and constructed</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so greatful, cheap,and i love it.it&#x27;s  easy to use. it&#x27;s so greatful, cheap,and i love it.it&#x27;s  easy to use.</li>
            <li> My husband is on blood thinners for a medical condition, loves the new shaver. No worry of accidental cuts. Can be used in the shower or with shaving gel. Charge lasts  for long time. Great gift.</li>
            <li> It works well, my father love it very much.&lt;br /&gt;If it sales next time, may be I will buy it again for my brother.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband last Christmas, still uses it daily with no problems</li>
            <li> Philips is a very good brand&lt;br /&gt;This kind of razor has very good comfort&lt;br /&gt;Recommend like this brand of people buy</li>
            <li> I recommend for any one want to use an a good electric razor and got a sensitive skin it work smoothly and i got it in time and as is written it is really marvels</li>
            <li> My wife had purchased this razor last year and uses it for her legs. She loves it so I purchased one for my beard. It seems to work fine. Easy to use and clean. We both highly recommend it for both men &amp; women.</li>
            <li> I have tried Remington, Panasonic and other Norelco brand shavers over the years.  All of them would work ok, but I would have to shave my neck/face  twice weekly with a blade because the shaver just couldn&#x27;t get to certain spots.  This shaver takes care of neck hair and  fine facial hairs that my other shavers missed. The flex head design works very well fitting facial and neck contours and leaves a close shave.  I haven&#x27;t used a blade and shaving creme for weeks.  The only downfall is the trimmer head is separate from the shaver (not built in) and one must remove the rotary heads and snap on the trimmer head if you want to use it.  I kept  my old Panasonic shaver and  use its trimmer when needed (it is built in to the shaver)  and do not bother with the swap out.  Otherwise, I love this shaver.  Great price on Amazon and Norelco  had a coupon for $20 off around Christmas, so paid about $55 for the best shaver I have ever owned. My wife loves the close shave and I would definitely buy this shaver again!</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco 1150X/46 Shaver 6100</li>
            <li> I have used cordless razors for many years and was always able to plug in the cord when the battery was low.  Then I would just leave it plugged in to recharge it.  When I got the new razor I realized that it can be used in the shower and did not have a cord or connection for a cord.  The charging stand that comes with the razor has suction cups on the bottom.  They do not work and the stand is unstable due too a small base.  I also do not like the clutter of the stand being on the counter.  I am lucky that I have an outlet inside the cabinet under the counter so I can place the charging stand out of sight.&lt;br /&gt;I do like the fact that because the unit is water tight I can quickly clean the razor under the sink faucet.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for last Thanksgiving day and still I am waiting for the 30$ mail-in rebate promised. Hope Philips gets good customer care in future.</li>
            <li> Very good, with favorable price to buy my satisfaction of things, this is exactly what I want. A time in the amazon&#x27;s shopping experience is very happy</li>
            <li> Too famous razor. It is a friend who was too beautiful to organize a realistic price and your beard. How is it? Let&#x27;s enjoy this shaver :)</li>
            <li> best elect razor I ever owned</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver in over 50 years! Boy have they improved! This razor is quiet, fits great in my hand while giving a pretty clean shave. I hated shaving every day with a blade; too much work so I was shaving every three days. Wifey didn&#x27;t like that much. With this easy and quick Norelco I now shave every day. A happy wife makes for a happy day for me!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband since the last time he had his Norelco was 2008. This razor is great! The detachable trimmer comes with it so all you need to do is pull the razor head up and off and click on the trimmer. Nice soft grip and is very quiet. Wet or dry use, even though my husband doesn&#x27;t wet-shave other than splashing a bit of water on his face from time to time before he shaves.</li>
            <li> My Husband loves this shaver</li>
            <li> i buy it for my father ,he love it very much&lt;br /&gt;it is comfortable and has a fast work&lt;br /&gt;I do not have a higher rating</li>
            <li> (upside): very light...nice charging stand...now, finding a place to put it so it won&#x27;t occassionally hit the floor...&lt;br /&gt;(downside):hard to get the blades separated from the head for cleaning...I feel like I&#x27;m tearing it apart when I change heads (button release would be nice vs just pulling on it until it separated)...would I buy another one like this one...NO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: how&#x27;s the shave...OK...the older model left my face burning...this one doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Smooth shave, head conforms to contour of face. Good value.</li>
            <li> good product, recommended to my friend</li>
            <li> i decided to buy this shaver when it went on sale a few months ago.  Being a longtime Braun user I hesitated, but the price was too good to pass.  unfortunately, I now remember why i stopped using the norelco shavers.  My overall feeling is that the unit does an ok job. I decided to try it as a wet shaver, using a foamy soap, a high quality shaving cream, and also dry.  I am not too happy with results.  I noticed much more irritation than I&#x27;m used to, especially on dry. Granted, I&#x27;ve been using the Braun singlefoil style shaver for a very long time, and I suspect that matters.  But more importantly, i think the irritation comes from having to do way more passes than I normally would, especially shaving my chin and neck. Unfortunately, it just can&#x27;t seem to be able to shave those areas without a lot of work and consequently irritation.  I had less irritation when using soap or shaving cream, but that&#x27;s probably because i did less passes; that also meant it didn&#x27;t actually shave those areas very well and there was always stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would i buy again? probably not. I dont&#x27; really have much of a beard,so I&#x27;d hate to see someone with a thick beard trying to work this thing.  I will continue to use it, but not for long. I will probably just get another Braun.</li>
            <li> it is simply amazing. wet or dry it works the same. no more razor burn or buying shaving cream. recommend to all men</li>
            <li> This is actually my first of many before that i finally like it at all !!! Very good quality and works very good.  excellent product . Love it !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product!!! It excedeed my expectations. I recommend this for every one. So comfortable and has a good size</li>
            <li> The Best part and why i would recommend:&lt;br /&gt;- Baby-smooth shave for facial hairs on cheek and jaw-line.&lt;br /&gt;- Excellent for slightly long hairs for people like me who shave once in 3-4 days&lt;br /&gt;- Awesome battery life. Very happy so far with the battery performance even after 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Blades still holding strong and sharp after 2 years of regular usage (Note: Not daily usage but twice a week on average)&lt;br /&gt;- Comfortable grip, head swivel movement and wet-use&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to clean and maintain (compared to other models that come with jet-clean and shaving capsules and what not!!.)&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to use : One-button operation&lt;br /&gt;- Sleek design with elegant looks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-  Philips doesn&#x27;t honor their rebates.Period! Was actually very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;-  Not great for the hair around neck region and gives razor burns. I use blade for my neck region and this for hairs on cheek. But then i am blessed with long slender neck so the razor still might work for you.&lt;br /&gt;- Go for Amazon frustration-free packaging.I Hate it&#x27;s original package. I don&#x27;t know what manufacturer&#x27;s get by packing such a great product in such a messed up way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral:&lt;br /&gt;- The charging base is convenient for daily use , however cumbersome for traveling purpose&lt;br /&gt;- Decent price.&lt;br /&gt;- Battery holds strong for short travel without need for packing in the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;- Use it in a circular moment on your cheeks for best results.&lt;br /&gt;- It can be used as a dry shaver but Use it with shaving cream for better results.&lt;br /&gt;- Clean after every use for best results.</li>
            <li> very good ,much amazoning，i love the Philips Norelco 1150X/40 SensoTouch 2D Electric Razor  very much .great chioce ,but a lit expensive</li>
            <li> The first day the plastic shaver head cover broke when I removed it to shave.  Not as close a shave as my previous experience with Reming ton and Braun, however it is certainly more comfortable.</li>
            <li> very good I like itvery good I like itvery good I like itvery good I like itvery good I like itvery good I like itvery good I like itvery good I like itvery good I like itvery good I like it  very useful  I  should  buy</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver that I&#x27;ve ever used, sharp, comfortable and good looking.&lt;br /&gt;I bought many of it for gifts.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for my 1D shaver.  I have been using an electric shaver for over thirty years, and this gives the best shave yet.  Cleans up easily with water.  Don&#x27;t spend the money for the 3d version.  This one doesn&#x27;t the job!</li>
            <li> very very good&lt;br /&gt;At a very good price&lt;br /&gt;Brand worthy of trust&lt;br /&gt;Is very convenient to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope we can offer good product</li>
            <li> This product needs training and you need to use it for at least 2 weeks to get accustomed to it.  There is only one slight problem is to cut the moustache underneath the lips.  That hurts but probably i am chubby on that area.  Overall, battery life is good and blades last really long.</li>
            <li> It works great, smooth and clean. it&#x27;s waterproof, too. Just wash it with liquid soap under running water. I bought several of them.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco 1150X/40 SensoTouch 2D Electric Razor ,Tough the package seems old,the product is still well.I like use it .</li>
            <li> Really gives a good shave. One thing I have always hated about an electric razor is that if I go too long between shaves, It is difficult to shave the long hairs. This one has an attachment that allows me to give my face a haircut before I shave it. This is a big deal with me. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> It is very good and cheap.I will buy it next time for my friends.Daddy said it is perfect ,he like it.</li>
            <li> This razor burned my husband&#x27;s neck everytime he used it. Also it just did not get in the &amp;#34;hard spots&amp;#34; around the chin and he had to finish up with his foam and straight razor each day. Returned.</li>
            <li> well we are in China, a place that everything advanced are marked in high price! this same Razor, imagine it! sold officially at the price of USD 400/pc! mad! so I bought it and ship it back even though I needed to pay for extra freight and tax to the custome, while it ended up totally only USD 90, so, I am very happy with all the efforts. it&#x27;s working well, better than my previous HQ9090. maybe next Christmas I will buy an even better one, after this first trail.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an old Remington dual foil that I&#x27;ve been using for the past 10 years. I liked the Remington a lot but it just wasn&#x27;t doing the job anymore. Looking for a good replacement, I thought this would do the job and get those spots the Remington had been missing. Not so. This did a terrible job. I had to repeatedly go over the same spots to even begin to get a good shave. The result of that was razor burn and bumps all over my neck and a horrible irritation. I am returning this and asking for a refund and going back to my old Remington.</li>
            <li> My husband has Parkinson&#x27;s Disease, the flexibility of the razor works great for him. He loves it and I am vwey happy.</li>
            <li> Much better than ther klast generation Norelco Razor.  I&#x27;m interested to see how good the replacement heads are for this model, they were not satisfactory for prevkious model.  They dulled within 2 months.</li>
            <li> I bought this with a coupon for dirt cheap for my boyfriend and he didn&#x27;t like it. It didn&#x27;t shave close so he had to use it sometimes twice a day but it still left his face looking gray from the poor cut. After about a year of using it, he stopped using it and went back to his old razor.</li>
            <li> this good is not quiet good. some design seems too weak. may be easy to broke. but it still is pretty.</li>
            <li> this shave is not so good at the price it sales;&lt;br /&gt;the quality and the looking is just OK&lt;br /&gt;this style is just so so</li>
            <li> a few years ago I bought a 9060xl one, wich is a complete piece of garbage, in consequence I had my doubts about this one.  But I have to admit this one is a complete improvement, very smoth easy to use, very good desing, and the materials are way more durable</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;Great value.&lt;br /&gt;The shape of 1150x/40 is good looking.&lt;br /&gt;I love it, and wish it can be used for long time.</li>
            <li> good  very useful ， its  very helpful  for me ,and  whats important is its  very  cheap！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！  very useful  very useful very useful</li>
            <li> Good so far, shaves nice and close, holds a charge, comfortable to grip.  It helped that it was a great buy!</li>
            <li> The side burn trimmer does a poor job and is not as easy to use as the old pop-up trimmer.</li>
            <li> I am Chinese buyers, this robot is too great, you deserve it, although we Chinese made, but you America price than our domestic prices cheaper by half</li>
            <li> Best thing I ever bought. I use it wherever I am. It&#x27;s so convenient and small enough to fit anywhere. when I&#x27;m in a rush I use it to shave in the car as gross as that sounds. It works really quickly and gets to every spot in seconds.</li>
            <li> It was problem with Gillette razor ,Always blood after shaving now no more ,specially I love shaving with Electric Razor specially&lt;br /&gt;with shaving gel.</li>
            <li> i bought it for my son. My son love it very much.  light smooth beautiful</li>
            <li> very easy to use, and it&#x27;s so cheap</li>
            <li> my dad really love it!</li>
            <li> Dis keeps me lookin fresh as fuh fo da ladies and works good I like it</li>
            <li> I would discuss this with a friend or family.  It requires a charging stand that is included.  I wish the charger would just plug into the razor.  It doesn&#x27;t shave as fast as my old 12 year old Norelco did.</li>
            <li> I like Norelco, but not the 1150X/40.  My old Norelco was fine but wore out.  Bought the 1150X/40 and am disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is a gift to my uncle, he looks quite like this razor, at least his face is more clean than before.</li>
            <li> Not the closest shave, but very comfortable.  Holds a charge well and is very easy to maintain.  One piece change of razor head is nice.</li>
            <li> It is what I expected and does a great job.  If I had a dislike it is that the trimmer is separate and had to be attached to use.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s great!I love it!The Philips Norelco SensoTouch electric shaver is very nicely designed and constructed. It shaves closely, but does have a few annoying design elements.</li>
            <li> Nice shaver, but the trimmer needs to be better.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shaver and the fact that you can get 40 shaves before charging.</li>
            <li> Had this for a long time and it still runs like a champ.  Great quality, love the charging stand as well.</li>
            <li> I come from China,the express delivery is so fast.just use four days.&lt;br /&gt;Philips Norelco is a gift for my husband.&lt;br /&gt;He said Philips Norelco is very usefull and he like it.</li>
            <li> Have used a Norelco Spectra 8894xl  for years bought new when it was first offered. You figure out how old it is. Bought  this series 6100 and it does not compare with the model 8894. I felt like I was using an experimental Razor. I had to shave again at night  before going out. Never got a close shave. I am back to using 8894 since the model 6100 stopped dead one morning and only started operating again after several trys.&lt;br /&gt;When it finall started operating it sounded  very noiy so I stopped using it. If this is Phillips Norelco engineering I am not impressed and am out the purchase price because I am afraid to us it.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco products forever and the one that I bought recently is the best one. The product es excellent, the shipment just on time and the price is the best in the market. Excellent choice I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It requires going over areas multiple times and it still leaves stubble behind. I feel like I&#x27;m shaving without blades.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and I researched all the razors and decided on this one based on info about use and price - medium price range.  He likes it very much.</li>
            <li> i loved it , the battery last a lot longer than what they say , and i loved the fact that i received the item 3 days after placing the order even thou i am in Saudi Arabia&lt;br /&gt;regards&lt;br /&gt;sam</li>
            <li> this philips 1150 is a wonderful shaving machine.&lt;br /&gt;the charging speed is very fast. and give me a wonderful shaving feeling.&lt;br /&gt;most of all, the price is much lower than BESTBUY.</li>
            <li> This is a gift and it is so cheap in US.&lt;br /&gt;Well made and really love it.</li>
            <li> Philips refused to honor my complete and on-time rebate submission.  After several conversations with their customer service, they were still unwilling to honor my rebate.  I came to the conclusion that Philips cares more about $30 than it does about its loyal customers.  Well, I can now state that I am no longer a loyal Philips customer.</li>
            <li> My husband doesnt like it because it doesn&#x27;t give a close shave and you have to really work at it to get a good shave in the first place. But he also has a thick beard. It might work better for someone with less facial hair. Pretty disappointing with how much it costs.</li>
            <li> I got this on sale at Amazon. It had an Amazon instant sale coupon (not a Phillips one). Anyway, so I sent in the Phillips coupon and waited months. Finally called them, they were fairly rude and told me there was no rebate as I got it on sale. I was stunned at her rudeness. I ended up complaining to Amazon and Amazon gave me a voucher to make up for it. Amazon is awesome, Phillips is not. Never going to buy a Phillips anything again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver itself is ok. Its good as long as I shave everyday. But if I miss a day, it has a hard time with the longer hair. And its really annoying having to change the trimmer head all the time. I would not buy anything like this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not as pleased with this as I&#x27;d hoped I&#x27;d be. It doesn&#x27;t really seem like it cuts that well and it sounds like it isn&#x27;t charged up as good as some of the other one&#x27;s I&#x27;ve owned, but it&#x27;s okay.  I think the older models may be better but I really liked the look of this one.</li>
            <li> it is an excelllent razor follows the nick and crannies of my face without going over areas mulitude times. i charge it about once a week it may last longer but i have not tried</li>
            <li> This razor is very light weight and comfortable to use. The battery life is outstanding and I love the ease of cleaning the head after each use just by running it under hot water. I have been using Norelco electric razors for 25 years and this is only the 3rd one in all those years, the last one I had for 14 years, which speaks volumes for their quality and I would not change brands if someone gave me one.</li>
            <li> My first electric razor after many years of using a blade.  Does everything it&#x27;s supposed to do.  Holds its charge, easy to recharge, easy to clean.  I&#x27;m not getting as close a shave as I did with a blade but I&#x27;m not getting any shaving cuts so it&#x27;s worth the trade-off.</li>
            <li> thin and comfortable ,it is very cheap and I strongly suggest every man should buy one thin and cothin and comfortablethin and comfortablethin and comfortablethin and comfortablemfortable</li>
            <li> I have the older style Norelco and like it much better.  You have to put this one on a bulky stand to charge, you can&#x27;&#x27;t just plug the cord into the bottom, and the neck trimmer piece is not attached.  You have to take the regular head off and put on the trimmer instead of it just popping up from the back.  I miss my old one.  Poor design.</li>
            <li> I bought 4 as presents for my families.They all like it!That&#x27;s very good.I use 20$ off Coupon saving. SO at last it&#x27;s 69.95$.</li>
