            <li>Great stuff!</li>
            <li>However, it truly did hold up well for a week and looked great!</li>

            <li>Have not wore the color yet, but it looks great in the bottle</li>
            <li>This nail polish brand is great.  </li>
            <li>A great purchase.love</li>
            <li>I love that I don&#x27;t have to use UV to cure it, yet it&#x27;s durable and comes in awesome colors.</li>
            <li>I love this color!</li>
            <li>LOVE!</li>
            <li>Really nice color.  </li>
            <li>I always used OPI or Essie really nice brands.  </li>
            <li>This polish color is gorgeous but even better</li>
            <li>Nice color.</li>
            <li>Nice color.  </li>
            <li>I typically do my own nails, but while on vacation, I went to a spa for a manicure.</li>
            <li>But this one is quite nice as well.  </li>
            <li>I love this polish and the color is just what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I think it looks better than picture.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>So when I read that this polish was actually more like a gel I thought I would try it.  </li>
            <li>This product performs as it claims - lasts more than over a week for me - more like 10 days.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this color.</li>
            <li>Vinylux is supposed to be one of the top lacquer nail polishes that wear for 7-10 days.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>OK.  </li>
            <li>I then applied 2 coats of color and the required VINYLUX top coat.  </li>
            <li>wait to order more colors!!&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>I am sure since there are varied reviews on here, that the longevity depends on one&#x27;s chemistry.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect to get any more than 2-4 days wear, if that.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite polish color too...</li>
            <li>I received many compliments.</li>
            <li>I hoped this &amp;#34;weekly polish&amp;#34; would be the next best thing.</li>
            <li>Tried under multiethnic CND polishes, none lasted more than a day.</li>
            <li>Again, I love the brand and this color because it is darker does cover.</li>
            <li>Gave 2 stars since I love the color and therefore will be trying to get another manicure or two out of the bottle</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product, but still kind of skeptical.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great fall color and the new neautral.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, lasts long, easy to take off, and great shine!</li>
            <li>This polish is a great product so far.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>The polish chips off a bit at the end of the fingers during week two, but overall they still look great.</li>
            <li>Didnt go on smoothly...</li>
            <li>I used it, but it was a chore to get a smooth nail.</li>
            <li>I have had manicures before that use the UV light</li>
            <li>FABULOUS color, altho&#x27; for some, perhaps a bit too sparkly.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite brand of nail polish!  </li>
            <li>It is kind of a pain to remove - but normal</li>
            <li>remove, I used pure acetone, (have been using that for a while, its good stuff!), and it came off just like regular polish!  </li>
            <li>Nothing special about this product</li>
            <li>Love the color and it lasts really well.</li>
            <li>But, it did last 5 days, which is better than most polishes.  </li>
            <li>This shimmer brownish beige is very pretty.</li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast!!</li>
            <li>Dries super fast!!  </li>
            <li>It is my new favorite at the moment.</li>
            <li>I love this new fingernail polish by CND.</li>
            <li>You have to put it on your bare nail (no base coat) and you have to use the weekly top coat with it.  </li>
            <li>I would (and probably will very soon) order from this seller again, no doubt!!</li>
            <li>It really lasts!!</li>
            <li>I do recommend getting the scrub fresh as well that they recommend using as a pre treat to the fingernail polish.</li>
            <li>I always use the topcoat over the polish, it adds a nice gloss and makes the polish last.</li>
            <li>The only reason it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because the polish does get a bit cloudy in appearance, but if anyone&#x27;s inspecting my nails that closely, they need to get a life :-).</li>
            <li>As mentioned by Vinylux, their top coat (sealer) is necessary.</li>
            <li>and I was able to wash my hands and do things shortly after but wish that it lasted longer.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>but it did not last more than 2-3 days before chipping.  </li>
            <li>I really do like this brand!</li>
            <li>\\&quot;First Base\\&quot;, because of some people taking about staining.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty neutral as well</li>
            <li>The color was a pretty metalic bronze.</li>
            <li>Vinylux products stay on about 10 days which is certainly better than traditional polish.</li>
            <li>This nail polish lasts much longer that Essie or OPI!</li>
            <li>But I REALLY like it a LOT!</li>
            <li>Even with my short nails - it really is a nice professional color.  </li>
            <li>It removes easily with regular polish remover.  </li>
            <li>The brush is really hairy</li>
            <li>It was much darker.</li>
            <li>Shellac never worked for me, but this stays on very well -</li>
            <li>I love the Vinylux polishes and so far I have only found a couple of colors that I didn&#x27;t like</li>
            <li>The color is nice, but it doesn&#x27;t last any longer than regular polish.  </li>
            <li>I have used it to make swirls on top of other VINYLUX polishes.</li>
            <li>nail polish remover does the trick - you just need to be more vigorous with the scubbing than typical polish.</li>
            <li>so you can wear with most colors, something to think about, if it is going to last that long!)  </li>
            <li>Used it with the top coat as recommended and chipped after 3-4 days, multiple tries.</li>
            <li>Spice\\&quot; is a metallic look but not super dark, (very pretty, I love</li>
            <li>First, let me say that this did not last 7 days without chipping.  </li>
            <li>The nail Polish was old, &amp;#34;clue like texture&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It really does last a week.</li>
            <li>It seemed like it was old nail polish...</li>
            <li>As elsewhere stated appeared to be old polish.</li>
            <li>No soaking and drying out the natural nail.</li>
            <li>Does not give complete coverage but stays on well.</li>
            <li>While I like the color (a bronze-y color), I really hoped it would last 7</li>
            <li>Also considering it is listed as a &amp;#34;new release&amp;#34; color, the product shouldn&#x27;t be old.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply - manicure, set and dried, in just 30 minutes!</li>
            <li>As long as you use the Scrub Fresh and the top coat, per the directions, this polish will last at least a week with NO chipping!</li>
            <li>really pretty pink tone</li>
            <li>One positive is it only takes 3 coats (2 of color  and 1 of top coat) vs the 4 coats with regular polish (base, 2 color, top coat).</li>
            <li>I was hoping it had a little more pink in it for an every day color that is not BAM, all in your face.</li>
            <li>This is by far the longest lasting polish I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Was barely manageable even after adding a polish thinner (which I don&#x27;t like to do).  </li>
            <li>I like painted nails, BUT I hate that I do them myself with very good polish, and it last maybe 3 days.  </li>
            <li>I even spent a day in my new house hanging pictures, and gave them quite a beating.  </li>

            <li> I even spent a day in my new house hanging pictures, and gave them quite a beating.  </li>
            <li> Shipped fast, but the Polish was thick and gummy, like Polish gets when it&#x27;s old.  </li>
            <li> And, it really DID dry in less than 10 minutes to the point that I could actually put clothes in the washer without it smearing or getting messed up at all.  </li>
            <li> It looks really pretty, but I received a dull blue color instead.  </li>
            <li> hard to tell the real colors on this brand, and it does not last 1 minute longer than the cheaper ones in the grocery store.</li>
            <li> I have noticed since removing the polish that my nails seems very dried out and are starting to peel- which is not a usual things for me.  </li>
            <li> Stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li> It never really chipped, but just the outside nail edge was fading away.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not a complete loss of my purchase price.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t last any longer than any other nail polish.</li>
            <li> Color lasts longer than other polishes, but it does not last for a week.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> I know this is a new release, but it seemed thick, settles, and old!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the color is not quite what I expected.</li>
            <li> It is pretty on and not too flashy.</li>
            <li> have other colors, and they are not like that.</li>
            <li> I have not had this issue with my other Vinylux polishes.</li>
            <li> chips and peels just like any other polish.  </li>

            <li> Have a hard time getting lasting polish for my nails.</li>
            <li> Obviously irritating, but not worth the effort to send back.</li>
            <li> When she told me the polish would last a week, I was skeptical because in my experience NO polish lasts that long.</li>
            <li> A waste of my money.  </li>
            <li> It dried within about 30-45 min</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> Went on streaky and was hard to manage due to consistency.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately started chipping 2 days later.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I bought from a knockoff seller, but this isn&#x27;t what I got in the salon.</li>
            <li> I do wash my hands frequently so needless to say the polish started coming off the same day I put it on.</li>
            <li> The color shown was way too dark for me and polish was very thick.</li>
            <li> first applied Essie base coat,</li>

            <li> Disappointed after thinking it would last a week.</li>
            <li> Thick and difficult to work with, and then began chipping after two days.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed and surprised</li>
            <li> Very thin.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality product.</li>
            <li> But, it looked terrible on - the polish was thick and gummy and came out streaked.</li>
            <li> So 5 stars for wear-ability and 3 stars for drying out my nails. :{</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with quality.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very disappointed!  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great color. Lasting polish.</li>
            <li> Did not stay on my nails as advertised.</li>
            <li> The nail Polish was old, &amp;#34;clue like texture&amp;#34;. The brush is really hairy and I&#x27;m very disappointed!  A waste of my money.  Kathy Sabo</li>
            <li> This product works SO well. As long as you use the Scrub Fresh and the top coat, per the directions, this polish will last at least a week with NO chipping!</li>
            <li> It looks really pretty, but I received a dull blue color instead.  Obviously irritating, but not worth the effort to send back.</li>
            <li> I love this polish and the color is just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Really nice color.  I think it looks better than picture.  Arrived in perfect condition and quicker than described.  Even with my short nails - it really is a nice professional color.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. My nails split and cracked for years, polished or not. With CND  Vinylux my problem is gone. Love it.</li>
            <li> really pretty pink tone</li>
            <li> I read about this brand of polish on a blog.  I have always had the hardest time with nail polish staying on my nails.  I would polish them and they would immediately chip or peel off.  I always used OPI or Essie really nice brands.  So when I read that this polish was actually more like a gel I thought I would try it.  You have to put it on your bare nail (no base coat) and you have to use the weekly top coat with it.  It works!  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  My manicures with this polish (I have several colors) last from a week to 10 days. It removes easily with regular polish remover.  I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Actually did stay on a week!  Great metallic sheen.  This is my new favorite brand of nail polish!  It is kind of a pain to remove - but normal nail polish remover does the trick - you just need to be more vigorous with the scubbing than typical polish.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li> A Vinylux manicure actually lasts two weeks, during which my nails grew longer and didn&#x27;t chip! The polish chips off a bit at the end of the fingers during week two, but overall they still look great. The only reason it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because the polish does get a bit cloudy in appearance, but if anyone&#x27;s inspecting my nails that closely, they need to get a life :-). Great for vacations - no touch ups needed. As mentioned by Vinylux, their top coat (sealer) is necessary.</li>
            <li> Great metallic colour but unfortunately started chipping 2 days later. It dried within about 30-45 min and I was able to wash my hands and do things shortly after but wish that it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> The polish stays on as indicated.  It is easy to apply.  The only complaint I have is the color was not what I expected.  It was much darker.</li>
            <li> This product performs as it claims - lasts more than over a week for me - more like 10 days. Does not chip at all. Color is beautiful!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this color. It is my new favorite at the moment. The shipping was super fast!! I would (and probably will very soon) order from this seller again, no doubt!! I love the Vinylux polishes and so far I have only found a couple of colors that I didn&#x27;t like but this one is lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For everyone who says the polish doesn&#x27;t stay on any longer than regular polish... Make sure you use the topcoat!!!</li>
            <li> This polish color is gorgeous but even better it actually stays on. My polish always chips within 2-3 days. This actually stays on all week!</li>
            <li> I love this new fingernail polish by CND. It really does last a week. I was very skeptical but I am now sold!!!!! I do recommend getting the scrub fresh as well that they recommend using as a pre treat to the fingernail polish.</li>
            <li> Have a hard time getting lasting polish for my nails. This didn&#x27;t last any longer than any other nail polish. It&#x27;s not worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly like the picture. It is pretty on and not too flashy. Can we worn for day or night.</li>
            <li> I didnt like the color... It seemed like it was old nail polish... It seemed too thick..  Didnt go on smoothly...</li>
            <li> Thick and difficult to work with, and then began chipping after two days.  Not as advertised, save your money.  As elsewhere stated appeared to be old polish.</li>
            <li> I know this is a new release, but it seemed thick, settles, and old!&lt;br /&gt;I have other colors, and they are not like that.</li>
            <li> This polish will last up to a week on nails. It comes off with regular polish remover...you don&#x27;t have to go through the same removal process with this polish that you do with gel polish.</li>
            <li> hard to tell the real colors on this brand, and it does not last 1 minute longer than the cheaper ones in the grocery store.</li>
            <li> Love the color and it lasts really well.</li>
            <li> the polish does not stay on my nails. I would like to return it but can&#x27;t figure how to do it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! It really lasts!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t care for the color</li>
            <li> Vinylux is supposed to be one of the top lacquer nail polishes that wear for 7-10 days.  I bought several colors and used them as instructed but it did not last more than 2-3 days before chipping.  I will not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Not the same quality as I have had at Salons. Very thin.</li>
            <li> Nice color. Love this product.</li>
            <li> First, let me say that this did not last 7 days without chipping.  But, it did last 5 days, which is better than most polishes.  And, it really DID dry in less than 10 minutes to the point that I could actually put clothes in the washer without it smearing or getting messed up at all.  For that reason alone, I will definitely buy CND Weekly again.</li>
            <li> I love this color! But, it looked terrible on - the polish was thick and gummy and came out streaked. I had to take the polish off and I threw out the bottle. I have not had this issue with my other Vinylux polishes. I really do like this brand! Shellac never worked for me, but this stays on very well - and I wash and use my hands constantly!</li>
            <li> OK.  I like painted nails, BUT I hate that I do them myself with very good polish, and it last maybe 3 days.  I decided to try VINYLUX.  I have had 2 manicure with Shellac, and it just did not stay on me.  I was excited to try this product, but still kind of skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT STAYED ON FOR 7 DAYS!!!  It never really chipped, but just the outside nail edge was fading away.  I even spent a day in my new house hanging pictures, and gave them quite a beating.  That was on day three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first applied Essie base coat, \\&quot;First Base\\&quot;, because of some people taking about staining.  \\&quot;Sugared Spice\\&quot; is a metallic look but not super dark, (very pretty, I love it- it&#x27;s pretty neutral as well so you can wear with most colors, something to think about, if it is going to last that long!)  so I had no staining. I then applied 2 coats of color and the required VINYLUX top coat.  I also used SND \\&quot;Solar Oil\\&quot; every evening, (which I do every evening anyway) and that may have helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To remove, I used pure acetone, (have been using that for a while, its good stuff!), and it came off just like regular polish!  No soaking and drying out the natural nail. Yea!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to order more colors!!&lt;br /&gt;Note:  I am sure since there are varied reviews on here, that the longevity depends on one&#x27;s chemistry.  Like I said Shallac doesn&#x27;t work on me, but VINYLUX does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update-  Rating has been down-graded to three stars. I have noticed since removing the polish that my nails seems very dried out and are starting to peel- which is not a usual things for me.  So 5 stars for wear-ability and 3 stars for drying out my nails. :{</li>
            <li> Polish chipped after 3 days. Disappointed after thinking it would last a week.</li>
            <li> Nice color.  Shipped fast, but the Polish was thick and gummy, like Polish gets when it&#x27;s old.  I used it, but it was a chore to get a smooth nail.</li>
            <li> The color is nice, but it doesn&#x27;t last any longer than regular polish.  Don&#x27;t expect to get any more than 2-4 days wear, if that.</li>
            <li> Color lasts longer than other polishes, but it does not last for a week. The color was a pretty metalic bronze.</li>
            <li> This polish is a great product so far. NO CHIPPING!! Dries super fast!!  This shimmer brownish beige is very pretty. I have used it to make swirls on top of other VINYLUX polishes.</li>
            <li> Have not wore the color yet, but it looks great in the bottle</li>
            <li> I like the Vinylux products but didn&#x27;t like the tacky look of this color.  Vinylux products stay on about 10 days which is certainly better than traditional polish.</li>
            <li> This is by far the longest lasting polish I&#x27;ve ever used.  This is my favorite polish color too...it&#x27;s a shiny bronze.</li>
            <li> I typically do my own nails, but while on vacation, I went to a spa for a manicure. The technician used CND Vinylux polish and topcoat to do my mani. When she told me the polish would last a week, I was skeptical because in my experience NO polish lasts that long. However, it truly did hold up well for a week and looked great! I have used CND Vinylux exclusively since then. When I use it on my toes, it lasts even longer than 1 week. I love that I don&#x27;t have to use UV to cure it, yet it&#x27;s durable and comes in awesome colors. I always use the topcoat over the polish, it adds a nice gloss and makes the polish last. LOVE!</li>
            <li> I was hoping it had a little more pink in it for an every day color that is not BAM, all in your face. But this one is quite nice as well.  I received many compliments.</li>
            <li> Does not give complete coverage but stays on well.</li>
            <li> While I like the color (a bronze-y color), I really hoped it would last 7+ days as stated. I have had manicures before that use the UV light and it was a disaster trying to remove it without taking layers of nail of with it. I hoped this &amp;#34;weekly polish&amp;#34; would be the next best thing. But similar to regular nail polish,I got about 3 days before the chipping began. One positive is it only takes 3 coats (2 of color  and 1 of top coat) vs the 4 coats with regular polish (base, 2 color, top coat).</li>
            <li> the color is not quite what I expected. thick with sparkles.</li>
            <li> I wish this product was sold locally.  The color shown was way too dark for me and polish was very thick.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I bought from a knockoff seller, but this isn&#x27;t what I got in the salon. Tried under multiethnic CND polishes, none lasted more than a day. What a waste.</li>
            <li> This nail polish brand is great.  I can go at least 5 days with no signs of wear or chips and the shine lasts all week.  Easy to apply - manicure, set and dried, in just 30 minutes!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, lasts long, easy to take off, and great shine! This nail polish lasts much longer that Essie or OPI!</li>
            <li> Again, I love the brand and this color because it is darker does cover. You have to like a sparkle to like the color</li>
            <li> It chipped 2 days after applied</li>
            <li> chips and peels just like any other polish.  Nothing special about this product</li>
            <li> This polish stays on!!! And comes off with regular remover.</li>
            <li> FABULOUS color, altho&#x27; for some, perhaps a bit too sparkly. But I REALLY like it a LOT! Stays on well with CND Vinylux Topcoat, too!</li>
            <li> Used it with the top coat as recommended and chipped after 3-4 days, multiple tries. Bummer!! At least I didn&#x27;t spend a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Excellant ! ! A great purchase.love the shades wears well.</li>
            <li> This is a great fall color and the new neautral. It wears well.</li>
            <li> Does not stay on any longer than a day if you don&#x27;t wash your hands. I do wash my hands frequently so needless to say the polish started coming off the same day I put it on. Not as advertised on Amazon. Very poor quality product. Buyers beware!</li>
            <li> The product arrived thick and clumpy.  Very unhappy with quality.  Went on streaky and was hard to manage due to consistency.  Was barely manageable even after adding a polish thinner (which I don&#x27;t like to do).  Very disappointed and surprised since hadn&#x27;t ever had a problem with CND Vinylux product before.  Also considering it is listed as a &amp;#34;new release&amp;#34; color, the product shouldn&#x27;t be old.  Gave 2 stars since I love the color and therefore will be trying to get another manicure or two out of the bottle so it&#x27;s not a complete loss of my purchase price.</li>
