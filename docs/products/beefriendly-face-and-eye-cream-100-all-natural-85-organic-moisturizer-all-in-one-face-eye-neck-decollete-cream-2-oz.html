            <li>/&gt;Customer service at this company is amazing.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great product!!</li>
            <li>I like to apply it after a warm shower.</li>
            <li>Kind of mentholated.</li>
            <li>The absolute best moisturizer!</li>
            <li>Cannot wear during the day, but a nice night cream.</li>
            <li>Honestly, after applying it to my face, I see immediate results.</li>
            <li>I have made my own homemade lotion/moisturizer before but its a bit of a pain to make.</li>
            <li>It seeps into your skin and gives it a nice radiant glow.</li>
            <li>A really nice moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It moisturize my skin perfectly, and I really like the smell of it.</li>
            <li>Leaves a nice texture on the skin.</li>
            <li>Came nicely packaged and sealed.</li>
            <li>It softens the face nicely.  </li>
            <li>What a nice face moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product, I&#x27;m a bee-liever!</li>
            <li>I went crunchy months ago but could not find a homemade mixture I liked for my face.</li>
            <li>Goes on nice and smooth..not greasy.</li>
            <li>but I believe the ingredients are good and safe for the skin.</li>
            <li>It is a bit greasy so, for me, I would not be apt to use it during the day</li>
            <li>It adds a nice glow to the skin.</li>
            <li>It gave me a nice dewey look.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t need to use much to be effective.  </li>
            <li>Anyways when I got this, I guess I forgot about the gooey consistency and how kind of sticky it is.</li>
            <li>so thanks for a great product !!!</li>
            <li>This cream replenishes the moisture in my skin, giving a nice glow and softens the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I liked how silky it felt as I smoothed it around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Nice face cream-</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that this was organic and made with honey.</li>
            <li>I ended up giving it to my Mom and she liked it.</li>
            <li>this is really going to be wonderful</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m able to find a good use for it I will update my review.</li>
            <li>In a class all it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful cream, it really does make my skin feel softer, I have used morning and night.</li>
            <li>Both my face and neck look &amp; feel SPECTACULAR after using this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it goes on nice but</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>I bought the night cream and liked it</li>
            <li>This product will give your face a nice glow and nice even texture.</li>
            <li>I love how good it moisturizes my skin without clogging it or making it oily.</li>
            <li>One just needs to warm it up with your fingertips before you apply it.</li>
            <li>I recieved follow up notes asking how I liked the product.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;d tried many others along the way, but for some reason, I remembered this one</li>

            <li>Many chemicals and ingredients seemed to set off the rash.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit thicker ( as described online) than most moisturizers, but it does the job.</li>
            <li>Product is OK</li>
            <li>It started out okay, but the more I use it the more</li>

            <li>Scent is light, pleasant and disappears quickly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very rich but not in a greasy on the surface way.  </li>
            <li>Very rich.</li>
            <li>Very rich and silky.</li>
            <li>BeeFriendly so far is working just as good!  </li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>But even on the first day I noticed my skin was very moisturized, which I was impressed.</li>
            <li>I used it on my freshly washed face as instructed and love love love it!</li>
            <li>I love using in the morning and at bedtime it works great for making my skin nice and soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to use a clean applicator stick or something(I use wood coffee stirrers) or this might happen to you!</li>
            <li>The added essential oils are very pleasant.</li>
            <li>Will definitely order again, or better yet, give it a whirl and try making my own lol</li>
            <li>I have tried all the best and the cheapest creams I may have found one I will use for a long time...</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, non oily, works nicely under foundation and before bedtime!  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s pretty good for the winter.</li>
            <li>I thought the price for it was pretty good.  </li>
            <li>but so far - is works beautifully.  </li>
            <li>While I haven&#x27;t seen any fine lines disappear yet, overall I am very happy with this product and would recommend it.</li>

            <li>My hands are significantly improved also!  </li>
            <li>Thank you Bee Friendly!</li>
            <li>This is the BEST product if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li>As I have issues with dry eyes &amp; blepharitis, it&#x27;s wonderful to have a product that can be applied to my eyelids which doesn&#x27;t irritate them.  </li>
            <li>The best cream for dry skin.</li>
            <li>My favorite for many years, Rosa Mosqueta face cream from Aubrey, is no longer available.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice, olive-oil-based moisturizer with good, natural ingredients in the plainest of containers.  </li>
            <li>and Best Face is showing a very positive improvement even at this early point of use</li>
            <li>Very special.</li>
            <li>Great natural product!</li>
            <li>Perfect for dry skin!</li>
            <li>and this is so lovely that I will use it even if I don&#x27;t see results with my fine lines.</li>
            <li>and I had just turned 40 and my fine lines were getting more pronounced.</li>
            <li>A friend recently told me about Best Face and Eye Moisturizer by Bee Friendly Skincare.  </li>
            <li>This is the best moisturizer I have found for my very, very dry skin.</li>
            <li>It has made my skin so soft and works beautifully under my eyes to lessen fine lines.</li>
            <li>The company has been very good in providing me with an immediate return label to ship it back.</li>
            <li>This is a great natural face moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Feels natural and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li>Great product for my combination, 65 - year- old skin.</li>
            <li>My face is smooth and looks much more even.</li>
            <li>The all natural ingredient list is great, but this moisturizer is quite oily on the face and eye area.</li>
            <li>ITs more than just free 2 day shipping people.</li>
            <li>I have spent a lot of money on moisturizers but this one is the best and is a lot cheaper.  </li>
            <li>No sickening scents added.</li>
            <li>The great thing though is that this cream is completely natural.</li>
            <li>1-It&#x27;s all natural and 2-it does a great job of moisturizing my skin, and doesn&#x27;t cause that greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>I have seen so many customer reviews that have been disclosed at the end that the product was supplied to them in exchange for an honest review - and while I don&#x27;t really have a problem with that, I still think I have more appreciation for reviews where the customer was NOT compensated in any way.</li>
            <li>They serve with excellence and although buying online have implemented the &amp;#34;human factor&amp;#34; which many sellers forget is extremely important.</li>
            <li>I have used this product along with the night cream for almost  a month and have seen an incredible improvement in the overall appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>Soo far I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li>I am also so happy that the ingredients are all natural.  </li>
            <li>Great results to far.</li>
            <li>This is a good moisturizer but it is also very oily.  </li>
            <li>My sister tried it and loved it so much that I shipped a jar to her for her birthday.</li>
            <li>This cream smells good but it very oily.</li>
            <li>it it really works, and the price is good.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, good smell and feel when applied on face.</li>
            <li>I chalk it up to having taken good care of my skin for so long, and think others see results because maybe they have not been using good products forever.</li>
            <li>Perfect for very dry skin!</li>
            <li>For me, I ended up using Best Face Night Cream which is now my new adaptable 24/7 365 cream with a very silky feel</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite face moisturizer!!</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a week so far, and I already notice that my skin looks better!!</li>
            <li>So happy to have found such a great natural product please keep on making this product and keep the resonable price!!</li>
            <li>The scent, which is very light before vanishing is more reminiscent of &amp;#34;garden&amp;#34; to me, quite pleasant.  </li>
            <li>My future is looking bright!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I discovered Bee Friendly.</li>
            <li>I love how rich and creamy it is and</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Bee Friendly Skincare products.  </li>
            <li>you Bee Friendly Skincare for helping me to love my skin again.</li>
            <li>This is a great face cream went on smooth and made my face feel soft</li>
            <li>Love the product, it&#x27;s really moisturizing and feels and smells amazing</li>
            <li>The product worked too well do deduct any points for something that was easily preventable.</li>
            <li>and I have incredibly soft skin that looks smooth and feels great.</li>
            <li>I liked my Bee Friendly from the very first day</li>
            <li>This was an easy purchase</li>
            <li>I love the clean ingredients and the smell and how it moisturizes.</li>
            <li>However, it blends easily and all melts(and</li>
            <li>I am rarely blown away by products, not because they may not be good but because I rarely see any difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use one product for eyes as well as the rest of your face.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easily , disappears into the skin, and</li>
            <li>After looking around for a good anti-aging cream, I decided to purchased this product mainly because it was organic and had olive oil in it</li>
            <li>I am a strong believer in this product.  </li>
            <li>The smell is a bit strong for both of us.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with the whole experience</li>
            <li>I wanted to wait and see how it would do after two weeks and honestly after the first night I could see a difference in my face.</li>
            <li>first use, it felt nice but nothing ground breaking...</li>
            <li>I love this cream so much and will love to see more of their products.</li>
            <li>So far I am loving this product!</li>
            <li>Pleasant smell, absorbs very quickly, and works well so far under my concealer.</li>
            <li>Very good if you have dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I have not noticed any difference in fine lines, etc.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was fine, everything as expected.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Now using the bottle for the winter and it has been fine, but keeping it in the fridge.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
            <li>AND I NOTICED A DIFFERENCE IN TWO DAYS OF MY FINE LINES AND WRINKLES.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients will separate, but I just shake the jar and everything&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>It is just a bit oily in texture but fine for night.</li>
            <li>but I could see firming around those fine lines.</li>
            <li>it was fine.  </li>
            <li>She has seen a reduction in fine lines and an increase in the firmness of her skin.</li>
            <li>My husband rolled over in bed the first night I wore it and said, &amp;#34;I smell scones&amp;#34; we had a good laugh</li>
            <li>Love the ingredients, consistency, and mild scent.</li>
            <li>Fast results and love the smell and feeling!</li>
            <li>After just one application, my face feels absolutely nourished, and am confident I will order again, and again!...</li>
            <li>I love the way it goes on smoothly and soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li>Awesome product ..love the natural scent very mild and leaves skin hydrated and soft..</li>
            <li>It is little greasy, but it works for wrinkles and smooth the skin just perfectly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks now and have noticed a huge difference on my skin.</li>
            <li>and I can tell a huge difference in my hands using this product with/without cotton gloves at night.</li>
            <li>WOW, this is the most amazing</li>
            <li>I had hoped it would have absorbed better, leaving your face feeling silky and smooth instead of greasy.</li>
            <li>I believe this will make a huge difference to my skin this winter.  </li>
            <li>Works very well when face is moist and warm from just washing face or shower.</li>
            <li>However, it does provide great lasting moisture.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>Not too oily, feels light on your skin.</li>
            <li>You do have to let it absorb into the skin for a few minutes before applying makeup for the best results.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>cheap bottle.</li>
            <li>This cream is fantastic - took me a while to find a way to get this to wear well with my foundation powder.</li>
            <li>I mix my foundation powder with the cream into a smooth paste, and then I dot it all over my face and blend it out.</li>
            <li>Great for face use daily.</li>
            <li>Skin feels really smooth.</li>
            <li>Says it makes her skin feel fantastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy I found this because its basically the same as my homemade stuff.</li>
            <li>Although most of it is absorbed to condition your skin, there is still a layer of oil that ends up being rubbed onto my pillow during sleep.</li>
            <li>It feels great on the skin and leaves my face clear, bright and moisturized the next morning.</li>
            <li>a once a day face washer and am floored by how smooth, moisturized, and youthful my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li>I leave my face moist post-shower and then smooth it on and let it combine with the water droplets for maximum moisture.</li>
            <li>and my face look as great as I did when I left.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Also clears up complexion and leaves skin smooth.  </li>
            <li>also like the fact that it works great as both a facial moisturizer AND a luxurious eye</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly over the skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too heavy, and has a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li>This would be a fantastic cream to use during the winter months.</li>
            <li>I feel what I put on my skin is just  as important as what goes in it...</li>
            <li>It is certified organic product which is important to me.  </li>
            <li>fragrance free etc.</li>
            <li>The results of daily use have been great.</li>
            <li>up on it did not make under eye concealer extremely smooth.  </li>
            <li>The important item &amp; what I am paying for are the contents &amp; what they do for my skin.</li>
            <li>I wish this company continued success, as I will want to be able to be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling so smooth</li>
            <li>There does seem to be a light coat that remains on my face all day.  </li>
            <li>I would prefer the container was glass, not plastic since there is no mention of it being BPA Free.</li>
            <li>in all, a fantastic product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never felt comfortable going anywhere or doing anything without make-up on in attempt to hide my acne and scars.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on smooth &amp; feels light on my face.</li>
            <li>The product goes on really smooth without feeling like it&#x27;s clogging your pores.</li>
            <li>Leaves a smooth, refreshed look.</li>
            <li>Put oil on your face and see if you enjoy that, it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
            <li>I am 47 with smile and squint lines that seem to look better when I put the cream on.</li>
            <li>I could no longer use eyeshadow or cover up as the product would not go on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I deceided to look for a made in the USA, organic and cruelty free product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe this cream is great for somebody, but definitely not me.</li>
            <li>Received for free for review.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling silky smooth, and since I&#x27;ve started using this</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels fabulous.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and gives my face a nice glow.  </li>
            <li>good thing is it is all natural for skin to absorb</li>
            <li>cause how good could it be if they&#x27;re nearly giving it away</li>
            <li>I had to wait a week before I could come to this decision, but after a good week&#x27;s worth of applying this moisturizer morning and night, I really think I&#x27;m seeing a smoothing-out of my skin.</li>
            <li>So far so good for now and at this point I would suggest trying it to others.</li>
            <li>This does seem to be a homemade product with good ingredients -- it smells and feels natural.  </li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>Good product, definitely natural.</li>
            <li>Just to know that I am putting something 100% natural and organic on my face and eyes gives me a good feeling about this cream.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good facial cream that is good and doesn&#x27;t cost too much.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say enough wonderful comments about this (these) products.</li>
            <li>(unprecedented) and leaves my skin nicely moisturized and glowing the next day.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s an all natural product and feel like I&#x27;m doing something good for my skin.</li>
            <li>I noticed my skin became more fresh in the morning when I started to use Bee friendly cream in the nights.</li>
            <li>Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve used, and I love that it&#x27;s for both face and eyes as am very lazy with these things</li>
            <li>BTW I have extremely sensitive skin, and have been delighted with the results from Bee Friendly.</li>
            <li>I used to use Aubrey Organics moisturizers for years, but ditched them when they came out with their flashier, non user-friendly containers, and frankly I find this Bee Friendly product far superior.  </li>
            <li>A wonderful combination, especially if you live in the northeast where this winter just doesn&#x27;t want to stop!</li>
            <li>Very useful during winter months.</li>
            <li>It does have a very nice texture overall.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Bee Friendly for two weeks and see a huge difference in my complexion.</li>
            <li>Rich, smooth and not greasy.</li>
            <li>This is a rich and smooth cream</li>
            <li>You must follow the directions for cleaning the face first, &amp; most important use sparingly.</li>
            <li>but I will tell you that it goes on smooth, not unpleasant odor and really feels nice on the skin.</li>
            <li>My new favorite!  </li>
            <li>My new favorite moisturizer!  </li>
            <li>It is excellent if you have dry skin, and is very soothing.</li>
            <li>It goes on real  good and as others have said you just need a small amount.  </li>
            <li>I wash my face in the morning and keep this Bee Friendly face and eye moisturizer in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li>The serum is a bit rich for combination skin</li>
            <li>What I have noticed is worth shouting about!  </li>
            <li>I;M EXCITED TO KEEP USING IT</li>
            <li>So worth the money!</li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>so I ordered Bee Friendly face cream.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rich and a bit oily, but that&#x27;s what is needed for the dryness in the air</li>
            <li>Love the gentle ingredients too!</li>
            <li>I did not appreciate getting three emails from Bee Friendly Skincare, urging me to review its product.  </li>
            <li>My moisturizer that I use during the day just feels like it doesn&#x27;t moisturize that well, and using a small amount of this with it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive this product after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>and of course I enthusiastically told her about Bee Friendly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li>I am so excited about the face moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This cream is so rich and smells GREAT.Love</li>
            <li>Reccommend using with Bee Friendly Mask.</li>
            <li>Facial skin is the most important part of me and I am willing to use good product to protect it.</li>
            <li>A lil bit goes a very long way, great value.</li>
            <li>I just use a clean toothpick to it up before applying.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>great moisturizer leaves your skin very moisturize and it all natural</li>
            <li>My skin responded immediately and became much more soft and had a better clarity.</li>

            <li>Great consistency, Have been using it for a few days now and my skin seems to love it.</li>
            <li>The ingredients appear to be clean, though not all organic.  </li>
            <li>It soaks in quickly and smells lightly of honey.</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>It feels and smells great, a rich cream for a very dry skin.</li>
            <li>It feels amazing when applying the product, so soft and moisturizing!</li>

            <li>My skin is so soft and moisturized, I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>A touch greasy but is perfect for my dry to normal skin.</li>
            <li>It has reduced the appearance of fine lines and my skin feels softer and smoother and my complexion looks more even highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>Great for what dry michigan winters does to my skin!</li>
            <li>it is kind of whipped, i stirred it because the products start to seperate from each other and the product kind of lost its volume.</li>
            <li>I love that the ingredients are natural, there are no chemicals that will age your skin, and it supports an earth friendly mindset!</li>
            <li>This is a great natural moisturizer for a decent price.</li>

            <li>Wow this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Overall, pretty happy.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised at how amazing this product was for the price.</li>
            <li>~ I also love the minimal and very healthy ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It feels like putting honey in ur face without the whole stickyness of it since its a cream  :)</li>
            <li>It absorbs nicely and makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li>This is the most real cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>It has no perfume or sweet smell.</li>
            <li>This proved not at all true.  </li>
            <li>Once absorbed skin smooth.</li>
            <li>I love it so much I bought the body moisturizer and serum.</li>
            <li>so your skin doesn&#x27;t need to produce natural oils on its own</li>
            <li>It goes on light and gives my skin a fresh, almost dewy look.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sweet earthy smell-</li>
            <li>To know I&#x27;m putting good stuff not only on but in my body!</li>
            <li>Makes your skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good about this product.  </li>
            <li>it says that it good for the eyes as well, but if it accidentally get into your eyes (even hours later) it stings.</li>
            <li>My hands love it, so it is intensely moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s so gentle</li>
            <li>me&amp;#34; even after a full night&#x27;s sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can say that this does have a nice natural feel to it, but it&#x27;s basically oil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really more of an oil and very lightweight.</li>
            <li>My skin really seems to love it.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, it&#x27;s definitely a night cream for me though,it has a nice natural scent to it</li>
            <li>I bought this moisturizer because I wanted something different that was organic and at a good price.</li>
            <li>awesome moisturizer, thick and creamy.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>Nice organic eye cream causes no problems for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and effective</li>
            <li>So far it seems pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Now that I think about it, that&#x27;s not a bad idea....</li>
            <li>Not bad</li>
            <li>great product for dry skin!!</li>
            <li>I love that it is made naturally in Hawaii - Mahalo nui loa!!!</li>
            <li>Works great for very dry skin!</li>
            <li>I probably use more than the normal person needs, but if you have dry skin, this moisturizer is a great option.</li>
            <li>, I can honestly say that my bitchy, pimple-prone skin has been SUPER CLEAR since using this product.</li>
            <li>My face is definitely more hydrated, my makeup goes on smoother, my skin feels VERY soft, and smooth, and it looks healthier.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes after reading many of the very positive reviews, but you&#x27;ve got to be kidding!</li>
            <li>Wow, this product is so awesome and moisturizing for my super flakey and dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful product for sensitive and combination to dry skin!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend to anyone wanting to use a natural but effective product!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really enjoying this new staple!  </li>
            <li>One of the main reasons that I like it is that it does not cause breakouts which is a huge plus!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; if that makes any sense and I didn&#x27;t feel it really helped my skin that much.</li>
            <li>I am currently pregnant and have been looking for something organic.  </li>
            <li>It does not leave a super greasy clogging feeling, but moisturizes all day.  </li>
            <li>I have hyper-sensitive skin where most fragrance free, natural moisturizers don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>and I quickly headed over to Amazon.com</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of it in the future for sure</li>
            <li>It quickly absorbs into the skin and is not greasy in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>Received product quickly and hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li>Wonderfully emollient, easily absorbed into the delicate areas of the face.  </li>
            <li>It shipped quickly, too</li>
            <li>I say quickly because as soon as you put some in your hand, it starts to melt.</li>
            <li>Lucky for me it was waiting at the door.</li>
            <li>SUPER hydrating, which is damn work by olive oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one is a keeper because it is both affordable and moisturizes adequately.</li>
            <li>I think this product works better them my high priced department store cream.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worked for a high end retail cosmetics line &amp; used their products for years with healthy glowing skin.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more from this company and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Love that it is natural!!</li>
            <li>excellent product, great if you suffer with dry skin and normal moisturizer just don&#x27;t do it no more.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this, the quality is fantastic and it ships quickly!</li>
            <li>Still needed to use all of my normal skin care, no need to add one more thing with no additional benefits.</li>
            <li>really appreciate a product that has so many natural, healthy, wholesome ingredients.  </li>
            <li>A tiny amount does a great job of moisurizing - even older skin.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff, can&#x27;t wait to try their other products!</li>
            <li>I tried one recently that smelled of licorice and had a gritty texture; I didn&#x27;t love it, but used it anyway until I found something I liked better.</li>
            <li>This rich and gentle moisturizer is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>I believe that I&#x27;ve found my new favorite night cream.</li>
            <li>my new favorite.</li>
            <li>I guess it may be a good moisturizer if you do not have dry skin.</li>
            <li>It gets absorbed into the skin quickly and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s pretty good, does the job.</li>
            <li>This works good for dry skin.</li>
            <li>It is absorbed quickly and does not cause eye makeup to smear.  </li>
            <li>It is very greasy and doesn&#x27;t soak in very quick, BUT in the morning your skin will be very supple!!</li>
            <li>Meaning, these guys &amp;#34;could&amp;#34; of put 100% organic, (like most do in this and other industries) but since not ALL of the ingredients could be honestly labeled as such, they were honest about it and put 87% organic on their label.</li>
            <li>It is rich but not at all greasy, it is absorbed very well, and is feels silky smooth within minutes of it being absorbed.</li>
            <li>- I have very sensitive skin, and many \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; or \\&quot;hypo-allergenic\\&quot; products</li>
            <li>I absolutely love that this face moisturizer is made with all natural and organic ingredients, and that it works!</li>
            <li>; woman saw and felt results after the first two nights!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely a return customer for sure!</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a facial moisturizer I would love for years and this is it!</li>
            <li>SO BE AWARE THOSE WHO MAY REACT TO BEE PRODUCTS!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Love this natural moisturizer!</li>
            <li>I never leave feedback for products, but this facial cream is absolutely outstanding!</li>
            <li>Pure and perfect for my mature dry skin.</li>
            <li>My skin soaks it up quickly, and I&#x27;m left with a nice glow.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin and don&#x27;t find it to be exceptionally moisturizing, but it&#x27;s adequate.  </li>
            <li>I love applying it &amp; how it makes my skin feel super soft &amp; hydrated.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very important to me that I use as natural ingredients as I can find and this product fits the bill.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy that I found this product, I&#x27;m 43 years old and was looking for a good organic facial cream for a long time.</li>
            <li>I am pregnant and have been experiencing some breakouts and dryness, and this seems to have zapped those issues right</li>
            <li>Great for my skin - gets a little shiny though...</li>
            <li>even though it may seem a little sticky when you apply it, it just feels great on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I need to use it more to get an overall opinion on whether I think it will help improve fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>This product will probably be great in the winter as it is very heavy and rich moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I will certainly purchase more when this runs out, but that may be a while, you don&#x27;t need to use that much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have too many fine lines or wrinkles yet to evaluate the product&#x27;s effectiveness on; however, it has made my (sensitive) skin so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to use it everyday and see how great the results are.</li>
            <li>and this product helps to calm my acne .&lt;br</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is very creamy and smooth.</li>
            <li>I had to edit to add about the amazing customer service, I&#x27;ve received several emails just to see if I received the product</li>
            <li>The next day it still looked amazing.</li>
            <li>Also, there&#x27;s really not too much of a scent to this cream, which I find really wonderful since it&#x27;s a natural moisturizer and shouldn&#x27;t be loaded with scent anyway.</li>
            <li>I love this brand and that it contains natural and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>This cream is nice and gentle, but I don&#x27;t really like it that much.  </li>
            <li>and I love it so far.</li>
            <li>I love the all natural ingredients in this cream.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>I am loving the idea of having just one product for both face and eyes, and I am a big fan of anything that has honey in it for skin care.  </li>
            <li>I am quite pleased so far.</li>
            <li>This makes sure no separation occurs, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any so far.</li>
            <li>You know, the kind that is constantly peeling and molting.</li>
            <li>Nice product, I actually see improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>I love how this moisturizer is made from all natural ingredients</li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural and how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I love the natural glow that remains after it has soaked into the skin.</li>
            <li>It is pretty good to my skin and lasts for a long time...</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that it is organic and all natural.</li>
            <li>Thank you for this product at such a nice price.</li>
            <li>All natural product, It words for me, I love it</li>
            <li>While I love the idea of a natural product, this one leaves my skin feeling and looking greasy.  </li>
            <li>After its on it is totally absorbed and non greasy.</li>
            <li>This one feels like butter going on at night, but is fully absorbed by morning.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and it was not irritated by this (many products do).  </li>
            <li>I am 72 years old and I have been searching for a face cream  for most of my life.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s organic and looks so fresh, I store it in fridge.</li>
            <li>and my face feels fresh in the morning.</li>
            <li>I love the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>If used daily it gives your skin a nice dewy glow and remains even after you&#x27;ve washed it off.  </li>
            <li>work is worth the effort.</li>
            <li>and I love that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>I like the texture of this product, the fact that it&#x27;s all natural and that it can safely be applied to the eye area.  </li>
            <li>So far, I love it.</li>
            <li>And also, my skin is somehow more sensitive and there are acnes coming out.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice that it is all natural...and has become part of my daily routine...</li>
            <li>This cream makes your skin soft, supple, and lovely.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s a natural product</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is  made of natural ingredients and after 3 weeks of use</li>
            <li>I wake up with skin so fresh and hydrated.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only used the product a couple of times, but it has been great.  </li>
            <li>I love how your organic creams makes my face and eye area feel so soft.</li>
            <li>so believe me when I say it&#x27;s something worth spending the money</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s an all natural product.  </li>
            <li>I really like how this feels on my face after its on it for a bit, my face feels nice and soft, that said I am not fond of the smell of this product</li>
            <li>My favorite natural face lotion.</li>
            <li>So far I love it.</li>
            <li>I love your product has all natural ingredients</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s a natural product.</li>
            <li>Recieved several compliments of how nice my skin looks, I will purchase again.</li>
            <li>but I think jt was worth it.</li>
            <li>I love this cream, and it makes my skin feel really soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE that it makes my face feel so soft and cared for.</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure, as it is a bit thicker that the one I currently use, but it sinks right in to your skin and leaves a beautiful glow.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth not greasy..but very rich at the same time.  </li>
            <li>It had very positive feedback from it&#x27;s buyers.</li>
            <li>However, this is great for people with dry or normal skin conditions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It may appear greasy when it first goes on, but it quickly gets absorbed.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like creams which absorbed right away</li>
            <li>I love using this cream, and am now looking for a similar hand cream from Bee Friendly Skincare.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not uncomfortable and absorbs fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>It looks greasy at first, but quickly soaks in.</li>
            <li>It is all natural and organic which I really like and very easy to apply .</li>
            <li>Absorbs well!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfaied with the product, worth every cent!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li>but I feel letting people know that Bee Friendly really does</li>
            <li>Very helpful &amp; friendly communication from seller.</li>
            <li>skin is smooth textured and and appears less wrinkled and with a more youthful appearance.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li>Soaks right in and softens the look of those &amp;#34;old</li>
            <li>but you pay for what you get and the price is right for the product</li>
            <li>cream also absorbs right in, isn&#x27;t greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>It just fluffs right up.</li>
            <li>Applied it right away and waited for a skin reaction.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s to greasy and doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin right away.</li>
            <li>It means it&#x27;s all REAL INGREDIENTS that you can pronounce and are healthy and natural to your skin!!</li>
            <li>Simple, no weird smells, amazing.</li>
            <li>I searched for a product with similar ingredients as the one I previously used because honestly I thought it was a good product.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the sale price (in the $30s), but the full retail price is too much.</li>
            <li>It has a very nice, subtle scent, and is light in texture.</li>
            <li>It actually makes my skin look kind of oily at first, but later on or the next morning, it just looks nice and more youthful.</li>
            <li>I am always too lazy to write reviews lol unless the product blows me away.</li>
            <li>Great product, does not leave my face oily when applied in small amounts.</li>
            <li>For a natural product, this absorbs very well and is very light.</li>
            <li>Bee Friendly is my new go to product that I won&#x27;t be without!</li>
            <li>In those three days my skin became quite dry, fine lines around my eyes becoming more apparent with the sustained TEWL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>Perfect for dry skin day and night, works as a night cream for other skin types.</li>
            <li>When first applied, I thought that it would blend right into my skin</li>
            <li>Applause for its natural ingredients, and customer service, which has been reaching out to make sure everything&#x27;s alright, showing that they really care.</li>
            <li>My face does feel nice in the morning, it doesn&#x27;t have dry patches after I wash the cream off in the morning.</li>
            <li>Overall, I believe this to be a good value for the money, and I haven&#x27;t yet found anything else I like nearly as well.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>She liked this cream so much I purchased a second jar for myself.   </li>
            <li>To my surprise, in two days the dead skin fell off and my skin was nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin and get rashes easily.  </li>
            <li>It is soft and silky and makes my skin feel so soft it is amazing.</li>
            <li>great that i can use the same cream for the eyes as well and it is working well for the same</li>
            <li>So soft, so moisturized, I really couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it about 5 days and so far so good.</li>
            <li>Natural ingredients, very moisturizing, lovely consistency and smell.</li>
            <li>I am looking younger and more fresh.</li>
            <li>First of all,  I love the pure natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice to have just one single product that can be used for face and eyes.</li>
            <li>Great product, a little bit goes long way,it leaves my skin really soft and smooth, I love it</li>
            <li>However, it does not soak in very fast, so I use it at night or mornings when I&#x27;m going to be home for the day.</li>
            <li>Very highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t break you out.</li>
            <li>it is very very lightweight</li>
            <li>Very light scent, immediately softens facial skin &amp; hands when I use it.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are simple, and that was something very important to me.</li>
            <li>Very gentle and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price is also very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much when I bought Bee Friendly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no longer having to use any other products to address the blepharitis, and my eyelids are much more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>My wrinkles and fine lines had nearly vanished.</li>
            <li>but I don know that after a month of daily use my skin feels incredible and other people have noticed a glow.</li>
            <li>A little oily but feels good.</li>
            <li>A little creasy, but skin feels good.  </li>
            <li>A little oily, but skin feels good.</li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t like very much, after used for a week</li>
            <li>Wonderful moisturizer, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for the winter months  when it&#x27;s hard to keep your skin moisterized</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made my skin so much softer and evened out lots of the wrinkles!  </li>
            <li>I forgot to mention that I work outside and use sunscreens and lots of retin A on top of that</li>
            <li>I first apply some vitamin E oil with Q-tip around  my eyes and then use this cream to seal it to keep it hydrates.- AM and PM.</li>
            <li>Actually this cream made my wrinkles more pronounced</li>
            <li>and it works really well!</li>
            <li>Not only do I love how it makes my skin look</li>
            <li>, I love the short list of ingredients!</li>
            <li>I am finding a replacement for my wonderful but expensive Shiseido Bio.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t necessarily like the smell, but I love the results</li>
            <li>Overall satisfied with the purchase and quality of the product.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff!</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft and smooth and is not greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>This is the only lotion I&#x27;ve used that balances out the more drying products.</li>
            <li>I paid $40 for this jar, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again at a higher price.</li>
            <li>It feels wonderful going on, but unfortunately, caused some breakouts.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing!</li>
            <li>I had no problems with the first bottle because I used it within 3 months of purchase.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to use much!  </li>
            <li>The formula itself may not be for people with oily skin as you are essentially adding more oils onto your skin.</li>
            <li>which makes your skin actually break out more.</li>
            <li>It really does work immediately!  </li>
            <li>By the way, I should add here that I have tried many different products, ranging in price from $3.00 to $300.00 per jar/tube.  </li>
            <li>My skin soft and the light wrinkle of my eyes are reduced a lot.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves!</li>
            <li>This one works pretty well.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I use the Bee Friend Skincare 100%</li>
            <li>just put the top back on and shake it up</li>
            <li>Thanks again for making my day you rock!</li>
            <li>I have only been using it a week and love it.</li>
            <li>My skin is starting to look better.</li>
            <li>Ive tried many pricy dept store brands(pale in comparison) before finding this gem &amp; I will never go back!</li>
            <li>Its greasy at first when you put it on</li>
            <li>I might add I was not fond of the smell at first , but it grew on me as time went by.  </li>
            <li>But performance is key here and I am pleased.</li>
            <li>My skin has improved over only a couple weeks and is more moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I.e., with the highest proportions listed first, then descending from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And anything i tried would feel like it would only moisturize the top layer of my skin.</li>
            <li>The texture is smooth and the scent is pleasantly natural from the butters and oils.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have written a review</li>
            <li>Overall, I love it.</li>
            <li>Works well for sensitive skin which I have and believe it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s free of all of the chemicals found in brand name products.</li>
            <li>and I really like it!</li>
            <li>I have been using it with a 100% hyalauronic acid serum that I apply first and let sink into my skin, then I apply this cream.  </li>
            <li>*)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be trying more of their products.</li>
            <li>I really like this cream and will be ordering it again, thank you!,</li>
            <li>The product is really greasy and does not get absorbed.</li>
            <li>Really happy with it &amp; totally recommend it to people with sensitive skin wanting a natural &amp; eco-friendly product</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer and will never use anything different again!</li>
            <li>I have been using this for 2 months and my skin is so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different types of face products!</li>
            <li>Really like this beauty product!</li>
            <li>but, my skin seems to drink it in pretty well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this daily, every night and most mornings too.</li>
            <li>soft, comfortable, not greasy, not like there&#x27;s a film on my skin.</li>
            <li>so while this will go further than a drugstore brand for sure.</li>
            <li>/&gt;REALLY REALLY can not stand the smell!</li>
            <li>Very Moisturizing!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worked in the skin care industry for nearly 30 years and have never been able to find an all natural product that is worth using until now.</li>
            <li>But overall, the quality of my skin has has become  better becausr of this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using this mostly as an eye cream, and occasionally as a night cream, for about a month.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much for coverage!  </li>
            <li>skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The cream made me break out after the first use.  </li>
            <li>This product made my skin so soft and it felt silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Very greasy!</li>
            <li>The red gets better now.</li>
            <li>my dermatologist wouldn&#x27;t do anything about, and for the first time it no longer flakes and the redness is going away.  </li>
            <li>The first jar lasted 3 months with twice a day use.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Really like the product &amp; the results!</li>
            <li>I really like this moisturizer!</li>
            <li>My face is smooth and soft,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that it is just a few ingredients and mostly organic and natural.</li>
            <li>Very mild scent, a little goes a long way and best of all, it doesn&#x27;t annoy my skin thanks to the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>~ it&#x27;s texture is great, rich &amp; creamy, and it only takes a little bit to moisturize face, eyes, chest</li>
            <li>highly recommend this creme, super product.</li>
            <li>I will say it&#x27;s great for anyone from normal to dry or sensitive skin,</li>
            <li>It is rich, blends directly into my skin - feels very much like Im nourishing my skin.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin and my skin feels so soft and has looked really good since using.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is more natural than other products.</li>
            <li>Bee Friendly face moisturizer really hydrated my skin and left it feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>Now with that being said, it&#x27;s rather uncommon such a lubricating product would not normally make me break out, but THIS ONE DOESN&#x27;T.</li>
            <li>The oily feeling on my skin only lasts for a couple minutes: maybe because of the dryness too, but it seems to be absorbed pretty quickly!</li>
            <li>At the age of 59,I have purchased MANY products at very high prices that did not come close to the lasting dewy ness of this quality product,I love it and it is totally affordable !</li>
            <li>Moisturizing, good for dry skin, but not much effects on fine lines as it claims.</li>
            <li>but this Bee Friendly cream has wiped it out COMPLETELY in 4 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have similar skin type, be aware that this might only be a good choice for night cream.</li>
            <li>First of all, I must have the most sensitive, acne-prone skin on the planet for an old lady in her 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>This product is creamy &amp; rich &amp; moisturizers my skin with a modest amount applied and keeps it moist all day.</li>
            <li>Ok, so when I first got this cream I thought I was following directions my mixing it up but still found it be very oily.</li>
            <li>Light, natural scent (sweet but not sickly so), thick and rich, but sinks in quickly and deeply instead of lying on top of the skin...</li>
            <li>This definitely will last a good 4 months if using  every day.  </li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s a natural product and non-irritating to my sensitive skin and eyes.</li>
            <li>I would love to try the whole line, especially the honey mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I apply the cream at night before bed; in the morning it has been fully absorbed by my skin, leaving my skin feeling soft and looking fresh.</li>
            <li>This is honestly just oil that completely separates from possibly wax?</li>
            <li>At first, I was applying too large a dab</li>
            <li>As with other reviewers, I agree that it does not soak into the skin very quickly, but this is fine with me as i do not wear much makeup.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied since this is my second time trying out an 100% organic/natural moisturizer that works way more consistently for an 8-hour day as opposed to some $100 moisturizers I&#x27;ve bought in the past.</li>
            <li>And I must say that after less than a week of use the lines under my eyes seem to have diminished and my skin seems smoother and more moisterized!</li>
            <li>I use it at night as it is a little oily and although my skin has become dry as I&#x27;ve gotten older, this is best at night.</li>
            <li>It has a light, sweet scent &amp; it helped to hydrate my dry skin.</li>
            <li>After reading all of the positive reviews about this face cream, I decided to take a gamble and try it.</li>
            <li>and my skin is positively radiant.  </li>
            <li>Living in AZ for 12 years and have spent so much money searching for the best face cream for my extremely dry and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>and my face feels very comfortable all day even into the evening without feeling like my face is going to dry out underneath my foundation.  </li>
            <li>Pretty much odorless too for those who might be concerned about that.</li>
            <li>I like that it is mostly organic but dont like being told how long a review to write, js.</li>
            <li>I have always been told I have very pretty skin, but I have gotten some other compliments lately about my skin looking brighter and smoother, and it&#x27;s a great feeling!!</li>
            <li>I took off a star because of the feel of the cream after applying on my face the first time around, I didn&#x27;t know how much was needed</li>
            <li>so please keep making the cream,&lt;br /&gt;i love it.&lt;br /&gt;i am not a young woman</li>
            <li>I love how this cream has such a nice light scent (has a natural dried grass scent with a hint of honey) and goes on like butter!</li>
            <li>Using it for few days now, very satisfied with the moisturizing effect.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;But, when I opened it,  there it was, a beautiful mellow yellow,  sweet smelling, delicate and luxurious to the touch creme.</li>
            <li>A very good value - a little moisturizer goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>My fine lines seemed to have diminished,which is probably due to this creams rich emollient properties.</li>
            <li>Cause This cream was fantastic for my super dry skin.</li>
            <li>After using this product for a couple of weeks, I continue to be very enthused over it, and am especially thrilled at the moisturizing effect it has on the small dry areas I get on my face every winter.  </li>
            <li>My makeup adheres beautifully and you only need a little.</li>
            <li>amazing and deep lines are barely visible.</li>
            <li>so I ended up with dry skin most of the day.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and will break out from almost anything.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel truly moisturized and super soft in the morning.  </li>
            <li>The cream is thick and has a pleasant fragrance to it.</li>
            <li>Also, the aging spots that were quite large and dark....are indeed fading.</li>
            <li>I will certainly purchase this again, probably sooner than I planned as I think my daughter is using it too.</li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li>So far it looks very promising!  </li>
            <li>and I plan on using it for a long time!! :)</li>
            <li>Very rich, which I like since I am 50 and tend to have dry skin.</li>
            <li>My skin has looked really smooth having used this day and night only for 2 days so far.&lt;br /&gt;I lost a good bit of weight now back to my high school weight, but at my age my face has wrinkled suddenly because of that</li>
            <li>This definitely did nothing for my the dryness, bags or fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I also am noticing fine lines are starting to disappear!</li>
            <li>Like many others, I have a drawer full of other organic and natural face creams.  </li>
            <li>little about my skin: I&#x27;m only 28 and have taken very good care of my skin thus far.</li>
            <li>Amazing, after just a few days my face feels &amp;#34;better&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it a few weeks, and my skin feels amazing.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft and moisturized, and is absorbed fast so there is no greasy look or feel.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>High quality stuff!</li>
            <li>my face is very soft....does not feel greasy.....would recommend to friends...</li>
            <li>The cream is greasy, but it vanishes fairly fast (10 minutes).</li>
            <li>very moisterizing</li>
            <li>Keeps the area moisterized the whole day without drying up the concealer or settleling in the lines...</li>
            <li>I use it as eye makeup remover and it works very well for that purpose.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t really leave a greasy film on your skin.</li>
            <li>Very concentrated as mentioned.</li>
            <li>It has a very neutral smell.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t care too much.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li>When I recieved this product ,I could not use straight away as I had an allergic reaction to another foundation product .which</li>

            <li>Highly recommend!</li>

            <li>I question if my real father is a lizard.</li>
            <li>With that being said, I have to use an intense moisturizer to keep my skin balanced and hydrated.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight yet is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream and will buy nothing else from now on!  </li>

            <li>I have had no breakouts and my skin is very soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This stuff does feel very oily, but it does absorb into the skin and really softens your face.</li>
            <li>but it soaks in fast.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t like the smell too much</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>

            <li>It works very well as a night cream.</li>
            <li>visually it&#x27;s a bit of a turn off - but the important thing is that the product works.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I save so much money and</li>
            <li>this cream is so much healthier for my face.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes very well, but doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all</li>
            <li>This product is very greasy and doesn&#x27;t absorb well into my skin</li>
            <li>once you know how much to use.  </li>
            <li>I am very satified and will purchase again.</li>
            <li>However, it is ABSOLUTELY NOT!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Silky smooth and totally organic</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always believed in olive oil for the skin, and this really delivers.</li>
            <li>My face looks clear an fresh.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an all-around gem of a moisturizer</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and hydrating.</li>
            <li>They stand behind their products and care that the customers are happy.</li>
            <li>After just 2 uses, the skin around my eyes is much softer.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely cannot beat it for the price.  </li>
            <li>I really like this cream.  </li>
            <li>and I can see a real difference in my complection.</li>
            <li>I am especially happy about the lack of artificial ingredients.  </li>
            <li>My makeup applied nicely over it after giving it a few minutes to soak in.</li>
            <li>It has a green tint, and smells nice.  </li>
            <li>I think when the weather starts to feel more like early springtime, I will only be using it twice a day.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and silky, my face looks smoother and it actually has a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>, i have incredibly sensitive skin, burns and breaks out with almost 9 out of 10 products, love this stuff, definitely reordering</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still in the middle of my own personal trial of testing how well this fades sun spots on my cheekbones.  </li>
            <li>I love how soft it makes face and skin feels younger</li>
            <li>So far I love it, I like that it is a facial and eye moisturizer and makes  traveling easier,</li>
            <li>it is creamy and very gentle on dry skin, a great moisturizer without feeling heavy or oily.</li>
            <li>hands down be friendly Wins!  </li>
            <li>I have been searching high and low for an organic, clean (no chemicals) face cream for so long, and I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the one from BeeFriendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my skin feels so soft and hydrated!!!</li>
            <li>I usually get a mildly burning sensation on my skin with most moisturizers.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t made my skin look a whole lot different, but it has kept it really well hydrated, and I SO appreciate the straightforward ingredient list and lack of fragrance.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t completely absorb right away</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got it on my elbows right now &amp; they stay soft.  </li>
            <li>I am 62 and my skin is sort of dry, after applying the cream, my skin looks and feels very smooth and soft!</li>
            <li>Like this very much because it is all natural!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product and makes my skin so smooth, unfortunately I was allergic to it!</li>
            <li>Bee Friendly has a faint organic smell that reminds you you&#x27;re doing something good for your skin.</li>
            <li>A little does go a long away, which is great if you consider how much you get for the price.</li>
            <li>The natural ingredients are a big plus too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great job Bee Friendly!</li>
            <li>even in summer it is not greasy - I have normal skin!</li>
            <li>Friendly skincare has totally changed my face.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any of the problems mentioned in other reviews about oil collecting on the top.</li>
            <li>Other than that really enjoying this.</li>
            <li>I look forward to trying other products :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars, because I like it as well or better than any other product I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it as a night cream because it&#x27;s rich enough.</li>
            <li>I have found that to be true, only if you use too much.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was too oily when I put it on, but found it really absorbs into the skin, leaving it silky soft.  </li>
            <li>I have been slowly transitioning over to organic beauty products after first switching over with my dietary needs, and I had not found a moisturizer yet that I really liked.</li>
            <li>I have been enjoying clear skin for a long time now which is another benefit</li>
            <li>but that is a small price for good, all natural cream.</li>
            <li>Tore open the package and put it on right away!</li>
            <li>Wanted to love it, but it was really greasy and didn&#x27;t absorb as well as typical moisturizing products.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the first rule of natural skincare that I&#x27;ve learned- never put oils or butters on dry skin, because they won&#x27;t soak in properly, plusthey don&#x27;t provide moisture on their own.</li>
            <li>My skin tone around the eyes is more even , dark circles are lighter and puffines is reduced.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>Literally felt that over night my face was more calm and clear, and then after a few days the tone/redness of my skin had evened out.</li>
            <li>decided to buy this product because the eye cream I used every night was in such a teeeny tiiiny bottle I thought surely I could find a product that would work just as well and would last me much longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still pretty young, so I can&#x27;t vouch for the anti-aging properties, but my skin does feel tighter in the morning.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t normally pay that much for a face cream.</li>
            <li>Feels natural on my skin.  ;)</li>
            <li>It goes down very smooth and absorbs quickly, and I have noticed an overall healthier glow of the skin.</li>
            <li>One email was fine; any more than that is irritating.</li>
            <li>This stuff is ok if you like your face to feel greased down.</li>
            <li>Not only did I receive the first order the very next day, but my additional orders arrived very quickly as well.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did cause I received my Bee Friendly Skincare Product just a few days later</li>
            <li>Not an overwhelming purfume smell, just an organic, slight citrus-y smell that goes away after a couple minutes.</li>
            <li>Less is more.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s super overall.</li>
            <li>being said, this anti-aging moisturizer is refreshingly different from many of the anti-aging moisturizers that are currently out there.</li>
            <li>It is better than the more expensive creams I have used.</li>
            <li>But being summer, I only can use this cream at nite, although it is on the greasy side, it is light, not heavy.</li>
            <li>It not soak into my skin quickly, and with my rushed mornings, it left me running out the door with a shiny face, so I kept to using it before bed.  </li>
            <li>And I love supporting a small business that cares about the environment.</li>
            <li>It is soothing and mild enough that I can also use around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling soft and velvety smooth.</li>
            <li>I just needed more at the same price - or cheaper if possible.</li>
            <li>cream appears solid in the jar but quickly emulsifies into the consistency of an oil as you apply it.</li>
            <li>So, the price/amount ratio is completely realistic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s oily, so I mainly use in winter time.</li>
            <li>Yes I am experiencing a notable improvement in my overall facial health and appearance.</li>
            <li>I know there are many that are more expensive though,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been loving this new face cream, which is super-moisturizing, yet doesn&#x27;t feel oily, It has a light, natural scent, which I appreciate, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>This feels so good on my face and under the eye area...just gently dab as a little goes a long way....</li>
            <li>If your current cream stays the same all the time, something is not right and could do more harm than good to your sensitive facial skin!</li>
            <li>She has very sensitive skin and a little goes a long way and because her skin is dry, this cream is perfect.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t even been using make-up since I started to use this cream: I just apply a little of it (not too much, since it&#x27;s a little oily) on my red cheeks, and in 10 minutes while I drive to work, my face looks perfect!</li>
            <li>She said It really soaks in and makes her skin feel soft!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone my age.  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE.</li>
            <li>is highly concentrated.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s too high.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Olga</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li>Everything I used from the high end cosmetics to drug store brands burned my skin.</li>
            <li>Affordable compared to high end retail brands.</li>
            <li>I buy alot of face products &amp; I would highly recommend trying this product.</li>
            <li>And believe me I have spent so much money on expensive and cheap products over the years and have look for so long especially for a good eye cream with not even ok results!</li>
            <li>On the other hand, another popular organic facial cream comes in 0.8 oz (shipping weight) and costs $20 or $22.  </li>
            <li>I would have preferred a little better absorption to the skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little be grease, to use it at night its ok, but no for the day.</li>
            <li>That does not mean it doesn&#x27;t work for some people, so that is why the 3 stars.  </li>
            <li>but my skin is super dry and this really helps.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it leaves a light layer of oil on my face after a very light application.</li>
            <li>recommend this product for everyone, and I&#x27;m excited to use it in the winter when my face is really dry</li>
            <li>it is a little oily at first but soaks in and keeps skin smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Without the strong perfumed smells of other products.</li>
            <li>I use the CerVe Cream first on my super dry sensitive skin</li>
            <li>One only needs to use a little bit as it is oily, but it makes my face feel so smooth and light.</li>
            <li>There is no strong smell but a very light scent.</li>
            <li>Have enjoyed trying this product at the promotion price.....takes only a small amount and leaves your face and eye area feeling smooth and soft would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>For years I have used expensive department store eye creams was happy with the results but not the price.</li>
            <li>Nothing great and nothing wrong with it.  </li>
            <li>Use a light hand in the A.M. as it can be shiny till sinks in.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am a busy dude, and to get me to write a review on Amazon really says something.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer is very emolient - it could be too greasy for anyone prone to acne or with naturally oily skin.  </li>
            <li>It really does make your skin feel so so soft and moisturized</li>
            <li>it is extremely gentle, it does not sting my sensitive eye skin at all.  </li>
            <li>and I remembered how much I&#x27;d like this natural and organic face &amp; eye cream.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer really makes your skin soft.  </li>
            <li>I really like this moisturizer, can only use at night because it leaves a sheen after use, but really like the way it leaves my skin feeling, have been using it on my hands and really like the way it feels.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer makes my skin feel soft but is very greasy.  </li>
            <li>It was very soothing, It kept my skin soft and my burn didn&#x27;t peel.</li>
            <li>I really do like this all natural cream.</li>
            <li>Very greasy...only to be used at night if you have naturally oily skin.</li>
            <li>I am definitely looking forward to use &amp; buying more in the near future.</li>
            <li>I only wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey, but then again it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using this cream consistently, because it goes on a bit heavy, and I like light creams that soak faster into the skin.  </li>
            <li>It seems brighter too, will have to update in a few more weeks.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have problems with bags under my eyes or puffiness but I am starting to notice some wrinkling around my eyes when I smile.</li>
            <li>I wash my hand to many times everyday, this really helps to keep my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t leave reviews but this product is a must for everyone to try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok , not for day time wear , it&#x27;s rather heavy.</li>
            <li>I used it again a few nights ago and enjoyed it and have begun using it nightly.  </li>
            <li>prefer to just use their Serum during the day as it definitely makes your face look fresh -</li>
            <li>It was thick, which I liked but worried about since I have oily skin.  </li>
            <li>nice thick cream.</li>
            <li>I live in the arid high mountains, and we need hydration.</li>
            <li>When using on the face, the only down side is that it is too oily, however the oily feeling goes away really quick, like 30 sec after putting it on, the skin absorbed most of it.</li>
            <li>It applies smoothly onto your skin and is light and delicate enough that you can apply it to the most sensitive and most delicate parts of your skin, such as under the eyes, eyelids, etc.</li>
            <li>I have mixed skin, and this product has had no adverse effects in making my skin more oily or dry.</li>
            <li>This is a good heavy moisturizer for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin is normally very dry so it might not be as good for someone needing just a little moisture.</li>
            <li>I have a very dry clean.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and I had not a single issue from the first use.</li>
            <li>If I want to wear during the day I have mixed a SMALL amount with my current moisturizer which works great.</li>
            <li>Because I live in Arizona where humidity is VERY low most of the time I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have been keeping it in the fridge because I live in Phoenix</li>
            <li>However I live in GA</li>
            <li>so I decided to try something new.</li>
            <li>I never had a reaction like I sometimes do when trying a new product.</li>
            <li>and I told him it was my new moisturizer with honey in it.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product as my skin is extremely dry in this country (UK) and the lotion is very creamy and really moisturizes my skin.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s absorbed so fast once applied to the skin, the skin surfave doesn&#x27;t look like wet, oily.</li>
            <li>My wife really likes this stuff, She says this cream is different than others she has tried and she really likes it.</li>
            <li>And the dry skin on my feet is quickly healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The key is to use a tiny amount and work it into your skin with light fingertip pressure.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Different parts of your face will demand different amounts of this Moisturizer - so be careful as a little bit of this Moisturizer goes a long way and you could end up going from a &amp;#34;Dewey&amp;#34; look to a &amp;#34;Shiny&amp;#34; - which is not so wonderful IMHO... except at nighttime.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little greasy at first but absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It does feel a little greasy when you first put it on, but it seems to absorb quickly.  </li>
            <li>Mostly, I just wanted to start going back to the more natural products (the ones with no chemicals in them), because I started having headaches and even a little irritation from some of the other products.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Skin feels very soft and well moisturized.</li>
            <li>It did make my skin very soft, I still use it on my hands.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and this did not irritate.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin/ acne</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, acne prone skin, and this did not break me out.</li>
            <li>When applied to my face and neck, this cream leaves my skin so very soft.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin but had no problems with this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product as a skin care professional.</li>
            <li>, after a few days that is when the magic started... I have had a dry patch of skin under my right eye for years (yeah, YEARS) and nothing ever seemed to work</li>
            <li>It is ok, I mean the real one is not like the picture.</li>
            <li>sure you REALLY mix it up, and only use a little</li>
            <li>This has started to clear my skin in 3 uses!</li>
            <li>Just started using it and my skin feels so soft!</li>
            <li>Loveeeeeeee this face cream more expensive than I like but worth it!</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel so hydrated and soooo soft!</li>
            <li>how long it would take to be absorbed.</li>
            <li>So far I like it!</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>but after I got it, I was actually surprised at how well it worked!</li>
            <li>The price was a deterrent at first, but I think it will probably last me for months.  </li>
            <li>and so far I am seeing results!  </li>
            <li>I will post another comment after finishing this first jar to let you know my final thoughts.</li>
            <li>The cream&#x27;s first ingredient is extra virgin olive oil, (when it arrives in the mail, you may have to stir it)</li>
            <li>Oh one more thing...if you go overboard and cake this on your hair can stick to it if you have hair.  </li>
            <li>Plus, how you can see the ingredients separating when you first open &amp; take the lid off it.</li>
            <li>You must cleanse your face first in order for it to work properly.  </li>
            <li>I am finishing my first jar of this product &amp; have purchased a 2nd jar.</li>
            <li>This is only my first week of using it</li>
            <li>and I love that its manufactured by a small company.</li>
            <li>Like the fact that it is natural!</li>
            <li>Bee Friendly service seems to be outstanding with follow up emails, I have the feeling I will be taken care of if anything were to go wrong.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need any more than a small amount.</li>
            <li>I put some on my face for the first time yesterday and this morning the wrinkle in the middle of my forehead was dramatically reduced.  </li>
            <li>Want to keep this skin looking and feeling young!  </li>
            <li>Put your product on the skin deep ap ;)</li>
            <li>I can definitely feel it keeping my whole face moisturized!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to report results on my fine lines, but I tend towards dryness</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, nice not have to use a ton of product.  </li>
            <li>I am very careful to clean my hands and sanitizing them as well before dipping my fingers into the jar by the way.  </li>
            <li>I like the light scent &amp; how long this will last me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive nor dry skin, but for some reason my skin got problems for the FIRST time in my life, with this cream!</li>
            <li>I have found this moisturizer really helped even out my skin, calm it down</li>
            <li>Has a very light fragrance that is hard to explain.</li>
            <li>You need a very small amount of this cream and it absorbs super quick.</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry skin that flakes, this moisturizer left my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>The packing looks cheap, and only a little more than half bottle.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, but makes my skin very soft and very fine lines disappear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to cut back on the product I have put on my nose daily to combat breakouts, so I&#x27;m not battling dry, flaky nose skin anymore.</li>
            <li>It is a really good product but no matter how little i use (because a little does go along way)</li>
            <li>I live in an extremely hot and dry desert climate.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you use only a little because otherwise your face will look like you just came out of a sauna.</li>
            <li>only quarrel is that I wish the container was glass, or sealed a little better.</li>
            <li>Might due better for people with dry skin</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for making this affordable natural facial cream!!!</li>
            <li>I can clearly feel that my skin is hydrated and a lot smoother by the time I wake up.</li>
            <li>You only need a little bit since it&#x27;s very rich.</li>
            <li>The color looks green/yellowish in the jar, but goes on clear &amp; there is no powdery residue.</li>
            <li>I really try to use only natural organic skincare products.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling so soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that gets irritated by almost anything and</li>
            <li>this cream leaves the skin soft without any residue...</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I like that the product has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say it does anything for the wrinkles, it does make your skin soft</li>
            <li>Only on day one so not much changed in the mirror but the natural fragrance is yummy, the texture is so smooth, there was separation in the container but no biggie.  </li>
            <li>I have (or should I say had) very oily skin prior to using this product.  </li>
            <li>I have used this for 2 weeks and the daily moisturizer for a month and my skin has really improved (wrinkles/dryness).  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many face creams, like at least 30.</li>
            <li>This is the only face cream I have gotten fast results with and no break outs from.</li>
            <li>it redness going away and skin feels soft no reaction.</li>
            <li>To say the least, I absolutely love the cream.</li>
            <li>has kept my face soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so refreshed and soft.</li>
            <li>It has made my skin amazingly soft.</li>
            <li>but I still recommend for soft skin.</li>
            <li>It soothed his pain and helped considerably.</li>
            <li>I like it so far.</li>
            <li>However, it does seem to soak in after about 10 minutes, and I like that the ingredients are all natural.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a natural moisturizer and after trying many&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was searching Amazon and found this all natural eye cream at 1/2 the cost of the one I was using.  </li>
            <li>Remember this is truly and all natural product without all the chemicals.</li>
            <li>o/o Natural bee cream on AMZ Trader Review on Amazon  </li>
            <li>This cream left my face very moisturized.</li>
            <li>She has sensitive and sun damaged skin.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin, so use it sparingly, but it makes my face, neck and chest so soft.  </li>
            <li>I received this over a week ago, and was really surprised that it did not cause me any redness or allergic reaction like a lot of skincare products do.</li>
            <li>I havent noticed wrinkles disappearing before my very eyes yet, but I have only used it three days.  </li>
            <li>By the way, I am 34 years old</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend trying it for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin moist and soft.</li>
            <li>I like the results so far.</li>
            <li>I left them alone, used a gentle exfoliant and kept using the \\&quot;bee cream\\&quot; as I call it.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel really soft</li>
            <li>I am 65 yrs old</li>
            <li>No breakouts at all thus far.</li>
            <li>So far, this cream meets all my expectations... and then some.</li>
            <li>I use it as a night cream for eyes, makes skin moisturised and soft</li>
            <li>I have tried almost every product on the market that says they are all natural or all organic and they work in the beginning</li>
            <li>and wow makes my skin look and feel&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is really sensitive, so if yours is sensitive too, I would not buy this product.</li>
            <li>Also the smell is so natural as all the  ingredients....</li>
            <li>My skin is much smoother and my pores seem to be a lot smaller.</li>
            <li>This product is made from mostly natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Anyone complaining that it is greasy likely applied too much.  </li>
            <li>It does not irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my face soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and hydrated after using this.</li>
            <li>I like to use this in the evening as part of my nightly beauty routine, my skin feels soft and hydrated after using.</li>
            <li>I am 72 years old and have been using it about a week.</li>
            <li>It is not heavily perfumed, so if you&#x27;re allergic to fragrances you don&#x27;t need to worry about that.</li>
            <li>It smells completely natural no chemical or fragrance.  </li>
            <li>and if I was liking it so far.</li>
            <li>I only used under my eyes - would not use on my whole face.</li>
            <li>It just melts into your skin and leaves it feeling soft &amp; moisturized and &#x27;glowing&#x27;.</li>
            <li>My lips are no longer chapped, my skin is moist &amp; soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin so soft....</li>
            <li>I have been using a salon facial moisturizer that cost twice as much per container</li>
            <li>I myself at 62 yrs old have found it to be beneficial.</li>
            <li>Purchased this for my mother who has extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I like that its all natural and has ingredients I can pronounce.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to all that are into natural products like myself.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have acne prone skin and so far, no breakouts.  </li>
            <li>This cream works well to hydrate my skin and leaves it feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>My search for an all natural moisturizer is over.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since it&#x27;s natural, it does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>My sensitive skin loves this cream.  </li>
            <li>but ... it hasn&#x27;t so far.  </li>
            <li>The aroma is light and fresh..:like green tea.</li>
            <li>The smell is from the natural ingredients and fades.</li>
            <li>When I take it off in the morning, my skin feels soft and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have sensitive oily skin and have not have any issues with it.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a moisturizer with fewer ingredients, natural ingredients, no animal testing and made in the USA.  </li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t irritate it all, but left a greasy residue and didn&#x27;t moisturize much if that makes any sense.</li>
            <li>My skin stays soft and moisturized all day.</li>
            <li>Because of it&#x27;s natural ingredients, I thought I would apply some to the burn.</li>
            <li>will order again when this one is nearly gone.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>nothing you can&#x27;t read and no heavy perfumes or dyes.</li>
            <li>My face really doesn&#x27;t feel&amp; look the same without them.  </li>
            <li>As a young adult I worked as a skincare expert and a makeup artist</li>
            <li>I use it at night and it has not made my combination sensitive skin nose break out</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>Its natural</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and supple and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores at all.  </li>
            <li>put, it feels like it is moisturizing my skin, feels incredibly soft, and is hopefully providing nourishment as well.</li>
            <li>One of the nicest face creams I&#x27;ve ever tried so far.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised it did not aggravate or increase my acne</li>
            <li>This cream is worth every penny I spent on it.</li>
            <li>It feels more like thick oil and has a funky smell.</li>
            <li>I was having dry spots on my chin and this has helped very much in clearing it up.  </li>
            <li>I like Bee Friendly face and eye moisturizer, as it is quite emollient and was very helpful with clearing up my dry skin due to winter months&#x27; chafing.</li>
            <li>The next morning, the tiny breakouts are gone and the bigger bumps are reduced significantly in size.</li>
            <li>; can still mean &amp;#34;clogs your pores and gives you the largest zit in history&amp;#34; :-)</li>
            <li>actually it&#x27;s more like rotating in around in circles, if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of facial moisturizers (many much more expensive than this product!)</li>
            <li>It is a little rich for me to use under makeup as my T-zone is oily, but I use it at night or days I am not wearing makeup.</li>
            <li>I generally use this at night though, so I apply it a little heavy because it makes my skin feel great the next morning.  </li>
            <li>it is all natural and the scent is very subtle and nice.</li>
            <li>My skin is also very sensitive, and any new ingredient is likely to cause break outs.</li>
            <li>I live in a high desert area so this is not a major problem for me.</li>
            <li>It goes on very rich and a little goes a long way, but I still like the natural way it feels on my skin and how it makes my skin look and feel hydrated.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that truly a little bit goes a long way with this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Love it a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>At first it may appear a little glossy depending how much used.  </li>
            <li>around the edges at the top  (very small amount)</li>
            <li>this cream works for the whole family, even though we are very picky with face-products and have different skin types - from oily pimple-prone to dry eczema-prone...</li>
            <li>and..Nothing!&lt;br /&gt;Oddly enough, the &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; oil I was using prior would inflame my skin, and this creme put the fire out in a matter of seconds within the first application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Has an interesting feel due to the honey and other bee products.</li>
            <li>Plus, it has a subtle golden &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34; that gives a nice little light-reflecting glow!</li>
            <li>I just put the top on tight and gently shake it a few times...</li>
            <li>I was thinking about why it has such high rate.</li>
            <li>I have cystic rosacea and have struggled for years - through prescription meds, high end face wash products, multiple dermatologists and what seems like hundreds of moisturizers....</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m happy with that, but I didn&#x27;t take into account that other people are probably used to going through commercial products much quicker than I&#x27;m used to going through the natural products I already use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>recently bought the mask and wow!!</li>
            <li>Since I switched to this cream and an organic chemical free cleanser, my skin is less greasy and I have had only 2 breakouts this month.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing for for dry mature skin.</li>
            <li>Suck ...looking cheap and only half</li>
            <li>I can see this jar lasting for a few months, easily, even with a nightly application.</li>
            <li>So far it has kept my face and eyes skin soft and not dry all day.</li>
            <li>I use this a few nights a week and wake up with super soft skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for three days and my skin is almost back to normal.</li>
            <li>My skin is not totally clear, but has improved so much that everyone I know has noticed.</li>
            <li>To me, this isn&#x27;t going to last as long as other reviews lead me to believe, only because I&#x27;m used to natural products being more concentrated</li>
            <li>I like this line of products, I look forward to using this product during the long, cold, dry winters in NYC, it will be perfect.</li>
            <li>so i can&#x27;t speak to how to does with those, but I really like this product for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Really helped with my dry face and not sticky at all.</li>
            <li>This Facial cream has gave me much needed moisture back into my face and has helped with those wrinkle lines.</li>
            <li>I only use it at night so this is not a big deal, but if you were to wear it during the day you would probably have to apply it VERY</li>
            <li>but the jar is big and since you don&#x27;t need to use much, this will last a while</li>
            <li>When companies make their products flashy, I always wonder how much quality they are if they have to prove it by being over the top.  </li>
            <li>Since winter is fast approaching I will wear it during the day outside to protect my skin from the winter weather.</li>
            <li>but what I did differently was I very thoroughly mixed the cream.</li>
            <li>I have tried all natural oils like jojoba, apricot, rose hip, and expensive brands</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s early in the game to see real effects, however, I can say that while using it as a night cream that I wake up with super soft skin.</li>
            <li>I tried different expensive product, but nothing worked as good as this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, but don&#x27;t worry if you use a bit too much because the excess is quickly absorbed.  </li>
            <li>and this was completely bare skin!</li>
            <li>As the other reviews indicated, it does feel oily at first, so I use it as a night cream and also on days when I have time to spare before applying my makeup so that my skin has time to absorb it.  </li>
            <li>No more dry face :)</li>
            <li>When I opened this jar, the smell was clean and not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>I was kind of worried about this having an extra virgin olive oil base, as I tend to break out easily.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin however and this works very well</li>
            <li>I will updare my review after using for a few weeks but my first impression is that this cream is a keeper!</li>
            <li>You only need a small amount and it arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only thing stopping me from giving this full five stars is because the moisturizer makes your skin a little too shiny.</li>
            <li>I searched high and low for a substitute when I found out that I cannot buy Astalift products outside of Asia.  </li>
            <li>I had ordered your product due to positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I never received my package and complained and the seller sent me a jar free of charge with expedited shipping.  </li>
            <li>It is so silky smooth and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>A small amount goes a long way in making my skin feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I recently started using a Vitamin C serum to clear up wrinkles.</li>
            <li>should also note, I have been using this every night for at least a week now, probably more like two weeks, and have not developed any breakouts from it.</li>
            <li>Searched so long for something free of dyes, fragrances and harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>I have rocesea and eczema prone skin and this product not only didn&#x27;t aggravate my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Since I am 50 years old, I have deep wrinkles around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>, I put it on at night before bed, and wake up the next morning with wonderfully soft skin.</li>
            <li>My hands were still soft hours later.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple days, but so far my worries seem to be unfounded.</li>
            <li>Its definitely all natural products.</li>
            <li>Since I have oily combo and sensitive skin, I only put it on at night.</li>
            <li>Since it is natural it will separate, so I do use a coffee stir stick every week or so to stir it but no big deal.  </li>
            <li>Not for daytime use, apparently.  </li>
            <li>Finally, an organic and all natural cream that I don&#x27;t worry about using on my skin.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve spent a fortune on products, even as much as 200 for an eyecream.  </li>
            <li>No bitter taste either.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin but for some reason my skin became red and itchy after using this product.</li>
            <li>I actually bought this for my Mom, but so far she loves it.  </li>
            <li>far, my only issue is the price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it for a week so far, but it makes my skin look glowing and radiant.  </li>
            <li>I have received several compliments on how young I am lloking since using the cream</li>
            <li>The texture was unique and not exactly what I expected in a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Creamy, thick, and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Pleasant scent, consistency is thick so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I tried this because it was marked down so much</li>
            <li>As other reviewers mention - at first, it goes on a little greasy but as in a short time it is absorbed into the skin and does not leave a greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>Even in the winter when it&#x27;s hard to keep my skin from getting really dry, this stuff works like magic.  </li>
            <li>Moistures my whole face and no need to reapply unless my skin is very dry that day!</li>
            <li>A little goes a very long way and if you have dry skin, like me, you just might love this too.</li>
            <li>Other reviewers are right - a little goes a long way, and I like to have my hands slightly wet when using the product to thin it out more and help it to spread easily.  </li>
            <li>It is a little heavy, but feels very smooth when applying.</li>
            <li>, I wouldn&#x27;t use it if your skin tends to be oily, mine is normal to dry</li>
            <li>I have used Royal Jelly products before and this is pretty close to the one I used previously to this.</li>
            <li>It costs 10 times less than the last facial cream I bought - not kidding, but it feels better than the other one.</li>
            <li>And I have read other comments about the &#x27;oil slick&#x27; on top</li>
            <li>I usually mix it with Vit C or HA serum or DMAE powder or another night cream and apply quickly.</li>
            <li>so I really need something extremely moisturing and soothing.  </li>
            <li>My skin is extremely &#x27;oil-dry&#x27; and very sun damaged.</li>
            <li>What everyone says about a little going a long way is true.</li>
            <li>It is a little more green than what the picture shows, and it does separate as it sits settles, but I shake it up well before I use it and the separation does not seem to affect it.</li>
            <li>I seriously saw a little difference the next day and a good difference a week later.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use much at all, and even in just the small amount needed, it leaves my skin feeling so soft!!</li>
            <li>I bought this for my eye area, which is noticeably dry in the New England winter, and is at a pre-wrinkle stage.</li>
            <li>You only need very little to cover a fairly large area, and the moisturizing effect lasts for for pretty long time.</li>
            <li>44 year old female, with greasy skin prone to occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li>It is true you only need a small amount.  </li>
            <li>I am 63 years old and have tried many rejuvenating/ moisturizing products including extremely expensive creams recommended by dermatologists.  </li>
            <li>My skin is never dry again even in winter time.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive and dry skin, and this product soothes and hydrates my face.</li>
            <li>have very sensitive dry skin</li>
            <li>The smell is a little funny</li>
            <li>But because I&#x27;m a little dry I still need moisturizer under my makeup for work and all the creams I was trying (some very very expensive) looked great when I first put on in the AM</li>
            <li>Its thick so use only a little, its not greasy and it smells nice.</li>
            <li>I actually felt like I was putting something very beneficial on my skin,  had no hesitation like with other chemically induced</li>
            <li>I had no trouble as long</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so soft but not greasy all day long.</li>
            <li>It will replace a more expensive cream that was natural and moisturized my face, but had an odor that recently became close to intolerable and which the manufacturer denied was there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- it keeps my skin soft and supple all day long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tossed so much money down the drain looking for a product that will help with my acne scars.</li>
            <li>To much weighs your face down will not help with moisterizing your face.</li>
            <li>Other than that I really like this cream, it is truly the richest cream you can possible get for a dry (and mature) skin.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive dry skin</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin that is prone to cystic acne.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Age 35, skin sensitive to dry</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin (exremely ssensitive around my eyes).  </li>
            <li>so naturally I have dry skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is dessert dry at 70yrs old.</li>
            <li>It caused no irritation with my dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Natural and cleared up a dry skin problem I was having.</li>
            <li>Previously, my face always felt dry after a few hours and since I already had makeup on at that point I could not add more moisturizer</li>
            <li>Also, I took the container on an international flight and it is pretty messy.  </li>
            <li>But this amazingness goes deep, leaves my skin glowing and not dry and flaky.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not new to natural skin care at all, but I believe a lot of reviewers are newer.</li>
            <li>The main difference from the previous product (complex 15) I&#x27;ve been using is this is mostly oil based formulation while the other one was water based.</li>
            <li>The scent is a little odd, but it is light enough to ignore.</li>
            <li>I find applying it when my face is still a little wet out of the shower that it absorbs better, so it&#x27;s less oily.</li>
            <li>It transformed  my dry dehydrated skin into soft dewy complexion within days of starting to use it.</li>
            <li>I especially recommend these products for dry or mature skin and for folks with fragrance sensitivity.</li>
            <li>- I really dislike having that tight skin feeling -</li>
            <li>I live in the Southwest where the air is very, very dry and sucks the moisture right out of my body.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a subtle sweet smell to it but not like the flowery girly face creams I steal from my wife.</li>
            <li>The manufactures suggestion to start with a little so that your face can Absorb it does not just sit on the skin was very helpful.  </li>
            <li>A little bit &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; or perhaps I&#x27;m using too much.  </li>
            <li>Just use a little to see how much you need...</li>
            <li>and I was looking for a new moisturizer that would help combate extremely flaky skin.</li>
            <li>I typically have pretty dry skin (especially in the winter) and using this twice a day</li>
            <li>It smelled a little old, maybe I just got an old one.</li>
            <li>And you only need to use a little bit, too much</li>
            <li>Under my eyes I think I would like a product that tightens the delicate eye area a little more.</li>
            <li>truly only takes a little to moisturize your whole face.</li>
            <li>I think it would be too heavy for summer, but has been great in my cold climate.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;Customer service at this company is amazing.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great product!!</li>
            <li> I like to apply it after a warm shower.</li>
            <li> Kind of mentholated.</li>
            <li> The absolute best moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Cannot wear during the day, but a nice night cream.</li>
            <li> Honestly, after applying it to my face, I see immediate results.</li>
            <li> I have made my own homemade lotion/moisturizer before but its a bit of a pain to make.</li>
            <li> It seeps into your skin and gives it a nice radiant glow.</li>
            <li> A really nice moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It moisturize my skin perfectly, and I really like the smell of it.</li>
            <li> Leaves a nice texture on the skin.</li>
            <li> Came nicely packaged and sealed.</li>
            <li> It softens the face nicely.  </li>
            <li> What a nice face moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product, I&#x27;m a bee-liever!</li>
            <li> I went crunchy months ago but could not find a homemade mixture I liked for my face.</li>
            <li> Goes on nice and smooth..not greasy.</li>
            <li> but I believe the ingredients are good and safe for the skin.</li>
            <li> It is a bit greasy so, for me, I would not be apt to use it during the day</li>
            <li> It adds a nice glow to the skin.</li>
            <li> It gave me a nice dewey look.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t need to use much to be effective.  </li>
            <li> Anyways when I got this, I guess I forgot about the gooey consistency and how kind of sticky it is.</li>
            <li> so thanks for a great product !!!</li>
            <li> This cream replenishes the moisture in my skin, giving a nice glow and softens the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I liked how silky it felt as I smoothed it around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Nice face cream-</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that this was organic and made with honey.</li>
            <li> I ended up giving it to my Mom and she liked it.</li>
            <li> this is really going to be wonderful</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m able to find a good use for it I will update my review.</li>
            <li> In a class all it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful cream, it really does make my skin feel softer, I have used morning and night.</li>
            <li> Both my face and neck look &amp; feel SPECTACULAR after using this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it goes on nice but</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> I bought the night cream and liked it</li>
            <li> This product will give your face a nice glow and nice even texture.</li>
            <li> I love how good it moisturizes my skin without clogging it or making it oily.</li>
            <li> One just needs to warm it up with your fingertips before you apply it.</li>
            <li> I recieved follow up notes asking how I liked the product.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great product!</li>
            <li> Its natural, easy to apply, feels great on you face, reduces fine lines and wrinkles, and you feel great because you look great!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell great but the way it makes my skin look and feel in the morning is well worth it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s organic goodness gets absorbed into the skin and just FEELS good for you!</li>
            <li> Thank You Bee Friendly for a great product.</li>

            <li> I love this product, it is so rich and does a great job moisturizing my skin.</li>
            <li> Nothing removes wrinkles but good moisturizers like this one temporarily plumps up and fills in fine lines.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Bee Friendly!!!!</li>
            <li> Also, the cream has a mild lavender scent and it smells very nice  when I sleep at night.  </li>
            <li> This cream works great, very light, and it absorbs quickly.  </li>

            <li> Great product, so rich and smooth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very important to massage it in though, or you will have a shiny face for quite awhile (plus it won&#x27;t moisturize quite as well).  </li>

            <li> Ok so I read about this skin care product on Facebook</li>
            <li> I just started using it, so time will tell how well it works, but I am also using as more preventative rather than corrective work.</li>
            <li> but my skin sure feels like</li>

            <li> I tried it all over my face the night I got it, and fell in love.</li>
            <li> I have since purchased more because my husband is in love with it as well.</li>
            <li> So if you are okay with oil based formulation, this is a 5 star product.</li>
            <li> After auditioning many products, this cream seems to be the one.</li>
            <li> Love the way it feels and smells</li>

            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this cream.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin shiny, so it&#x27;s better for night than for day.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t plan to buy it again soon because I need something more moisturizing for winter.</li>
            <li> ; - who doesn&#x27;t love their husband look at them the way they used to decades ago....</li>

            <li> My skin looks much better.</li>
            <li> It goes on wonderfully smooth and has a nice scent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried many others along the way, but for some reason, I remembered this one</li>
            <li> and I thought I&#x27;d try getting more to see if it would help with some of my skin issues.</li>
            <li> there are so many creams out there</li>

            <li> I can safely say that I have been using this product and no breakouts.</li>
            <li> At age 41 I tried so many different creams, nothing work perfect...</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I am currently pleased with my purchase of this cream.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t claim to be able to speak for everyone&#x27;s skin.....</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> healthy to the skin.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>

            <li> Absolutely love this cream....</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see how much better my skin will improve in a week.</li>

            <li> I have never been as pleased with any of them as I have been with this product.  </li>

            <li> I found a keeper with this product makes my skin feels so much better and with the winter upon us</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased again, I love this cream</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad to have found an affordable cream that I like.</li>
            <li> Really enjoying this multi-purpose cream</li>
            <li> I like that it is safe to use around your eyes.  </li>
            <li> but the better part was that after eight hours of tossing and turning (I don&#x27;t sleep well)</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>

            <li> Perfect for night time facial care.</li>
            <li> more supple.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this product!&lt;br</li>

            <li> Grand jct</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer...</li>
            <li> It has become a staple for sure.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I have used so many face creams in my life..</li>
            <li> And secondly I love the result.</li>
            <li> My skin tone is a lot more even.</li>
            <li> So many have been dis-continued.</li>

            <li> My friends were commenting on how healthy my skin looked.</li>
            <li> I love that its mostly organic</li>
            <li> Many chemicals and ingredients seemed to set off the rash.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit thicker ( as described online) than most moisturizers, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> Product is OK</li>
            <li> It started out okay, but the more I use it the more</li>
            <li> I realize that my skin is not as hydrated as it should be and the greasy quality of this lotion makes my face break out more than it ever has before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my skin has a bit more of a healthy look to it.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim with a coupon and am really glad I did.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely smelling organic cream.</li>
            <li> I will be getting more for this winter for sure.</li>
            <li> This product penetrates and it smells lovely, not perfumey.</li>
            <li> I am really in love with this product.</li>

            <li> Lovely moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I love the thickness and the way it feels.</li>

            <li> I love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> The smell is okay, smells like honey.  </li>
            <li> Not greasy on my skin, no nasty perfume smell.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I use it morning and night and love the fact that I can use it on my face as well as under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT and recommend.  </li>
            <li> It is nice to find something that is good for your skin, is reasonable and truly works.</li>
            <li> It IS the greatest cream I have used that really showed results right away.  </li>
            <li> Scent is light, pleasant and disappears quickly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very rich but not in a greasy on the surface way.  </li>
            <li> Very rich.</li>
            <li> Very rich and silky.</li>
            <li> BeeFriendly so far is working just as good!  </li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> But even on the first day I noticed my skin was very moisturized, which I was impressed.</li>
            <li> I used it on my freshly washed face as instructed and love love love it!</li>
            <li> I love using in the morning and at bedtime it works great for making my skin nice and soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to use a clean applicator stick or something(I use wood coffee stirrers) or this might happen to you!</li>
            <li> The added essential oils are very pleasant.</li>
            <li> Will definitely order again, or better yet, give it a whirl and try making my own lol</li>
            <li> I have tried all the best and the cheapest creams I may have found one I will use for a long time...</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, non oily, works nicely under foundation and before bedtime!  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s pretty good for the winter.</li>
            <li> I thought the price for it was pretty good.  </li>
            <li> but so far - is works beautifully.  </li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t seen any fine lines disappear yet, overall I am very happy with this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Thank you Bee Friendly Skincare!</li>
            <li> My hands are significantly improved also!  </li>
            <li> Thank you Bee Friendly!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST product if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> As I have issues with dry eyes &amp; blepharitis, it&#x27;s wonderful to have a product that can be applied to my eyelids which doesn&#x27;t irritate them.  </li>
            <li> The best cream for dry skin.</li>
            <li> My favorite for many years, Rosa Mosqueta face cream from Aubrey, is no longer available.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice, olive-oil-based moisturizer with good, natural ingredients in the plainest of containers.  </li>
            <li> and Best Face is showing a very positive improvement even at this early point of use</li>
            <li> Very special.</li>
            <li> Great natural product!</li>
            <li> Perfect for dry skin!</li>
            <li> and this is so lovely that I will use it even if I don&#x27;t see results with my fine lines.</li>
            <li> and I had just turned 40 and my fine lines were getting more pronounced.</li>
            <li> A friend recently told me about Best Face and Eye Moisturizer by Bee Friendly Skincare.  </li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I have found for my very, very dry skin.</li>
            <li> It has made my skin so soft and works beautifully under my eyes to lessen fine lines.</li>
            <li> The company has been very good in providing me with an immediate return label to ship it back.</li>
            <li> This is a great natural face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Feels natural and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li> Great product for my combination, 65 - year- old skin.</li>
            <li> My face is smooth and looks much more even.</li>
            <li> The all natural ingredient list is great, but this moisturizer is quite oily on the face and eye area.</li>
            <li> ITs more than just free 2 day shipping people.</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot of money on moisturizers but this one is the best and is a lot cheaper.  </li>
            <li> No sickening scents added.</li>
            <li> The great thing though is that this cream is completely natural.</li>
            <li> 1-It&#x27;s all natural and 2-it does a great job of moisturizing my skin, and doesn&#x27;t cause that greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> I have seen so many customer reviews that have been disclosed at the end that the product was supplied to them in exchange for an honest review - and while I don&#x27;t really have a problem with that, I still think I have more appreciation for reviews where the customer was NOT compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> They serve with excellence and although buying online have implemented the &amp;#34;human factor&amp;#34; which many sellers forget is extremely important.</li>
            <li> I have used this product along with the night cream for almost  a month and have seen an incredible improvement in the overall appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> Soo far I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I am also so happy that the ingredients are all natural.  </li>
            <li> Great results to far.</li>
            <li> This is a good moisturizer but it is also very oily.  </li>
            <li> My sister tried it and loved it so much that I shipped a jar to her for her birthday.</li>
            <li> This cream smells good but it very oily.</li>
            <li> it it really works, and the price is good.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, good smell and feel when applied on face.</li>
            <li> I chalk it up to having taken good care of my skin for so long, and think others see results because maybe they have not been using good products forever.</li>
            <li> Perfect for very dry skin!</li>
            <li> For me, I ended up using Best Face Night Cream which is now my new adaptable 24/7 365 cream with a very silky feel</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite face moisturizer!!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a week so far, and I already notice that my skin looks better!!</li>
            <li> So happy to have found such a great natural product please keep on making this product and keep the resonable price!!</li>
            <li> The scent, which is very light before vanishing is more reminiscent of &amp;#34;garden&amp;#34; to me, quite pleasant.  </li>
            <li> My future is looking bright!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I discovered Bee Friendly.</li>
            <li> I love how rich and creamy it is and</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Bee Friendly Skincare products.  </li>
            <li> you Bee Friendly Skincare for helping me to love my skin again.</li>
            <li> This is a great face cream went on smooth and made my face feel soft</li>
            <li> Love the product, it&#x27;s really moisturizing and feels and smells amazing</li>
            <li> The product worked too well do deduct any points for something that was easily preventable.</li>
            <li> and I have incredibly soft skin that looks smooth and feels great.</li>
            <li> I liked my Bee Friendly from the very first day</li>
            <li> This was an easy purchase</li>
            <li> I love the clean ingredients and the smell and how it moisturizes.</li>
            <li> However, it blends easily and all melts(and</li>
            <li> I am rarely blown away by products, not because they may not be good but because I rarely see any difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use one product for eyes as well as the rest of your face.  </li>
            <li> It goes on easily , disappears into the skin, and</li>
            <li> After looking around for a good anti-aging cream, I decided to purchased this product mainly because it was organic and had olive oil in it</li>
            <li> I am a strong believer in this product.  </li>
            <li> The smell is a bit strong for both of us.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with the whole experience</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait and see how it would do after two weeks and honestly after the first night I could see a difference in my face.</li>
            <li> first use, it felt nice but nothing ground breaking...</li>
            <li> I love this cream so much and will love to see more of their products.</li>
            <li> So far I am loving this product!</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell, absorbs very quickly, and works well so far under my concealer.</li>
            <li> Very good if you have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have not noticed any difference in fine lines, etc.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was fine, everything as expected.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Now using the bottle for the winter and it has been fine, but keeping it in the fridge.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
            <li> AND I NOTICED A DIFFERENCE IN TWO DAYS OF MY FINE LINES AND WRINKLES.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients will separate, but I just shake the jar and everything&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> It is just a bit oily in texture but fine for night.</li>
            <li> but I could see firming around those fine lines.</li>
            <li> it was fine.  </li>
            <li> She has seen a reduction in fine lines and an increase in the firmness of her skin.</li>
            <li> My husband rolled over in bed the first night I wore it and said, &amp;#34;I smell scones&amp;#34; we had a good laugh</li>
            <li> Love the ingredients, consistency, and mild scent.</li>
            <li> Fast results and love the smell and feeling!</li>
            <li> After just one application, my face feels absolutely nourished, and am confident I will order again, and again!...</li>
            <li> I love the way it goes on smoothly and soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li> Awesome product ..love the natural scent very mild and leaves skin hydrated and soft..</li>
            <li> It is little greasy, but it works for wrinkles and smooth the skin just perfectly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks now and have noticed a huge difference on my skin.</li>
            <li> and I can tell a huge difference in my hands using this product with/without cotton gloves at night.</li>
            <li> WOW, this is the most amazing</li>
            <li> I had hoped it would have absorbed better, leaving your face feeling silky and smooth instead of greasy.</li>
            <li> I believe this will make a huge difference to my skin this winter.  </li>
            <li> Works very well when face is moist and warm from just washing face or shower.</li>
            <li> However, it does provide great lasting moisture.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Not too oily, feels light on your skin.</li>
            <li> You do have to let it absorb into the skin for a few minutes before applying makeup for the best results.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> cheap bottle.</li>
            <li> This cream is fantastic - took me a while to find a way to get this to wear well with my foundation powder.</li>
            <li> I mix my foundation powder with the cream into a smooth paste, and then I dot it all over my face and blend it out.</li>
            <li> Great for face use daily.</li>
            <li> Skin feels really smooth.</li>
            <li> Says it makes her skin feel fantastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy I found this because its basically the same as my homemade stuff.</li>
            <li> Although most of it is absorbed to condition your skin, there is still a layer of oil that ends up being rubbed onto my pillow during sleep.</li>
            <li> It feels great on the skin and leaves my face clear, bright and moisturized the next morning.</li>
            <li> a once a day face washer and am floored by how smooth, moisturized, and youthful my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li> I leave my face moist post-shower and then smooth it on and let it combine with the water droplets for maximum moisture.</li>
            <li> and my face look as great as I did when I left.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Also clears up complexion and leaves skin smooth.  </li>
            <li> also like the fact that it works great as both a facial moisturizer AND a luxurious eye</li>
            <li> It glides on smoothly over the skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too heavy, and has a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> This would be a fantastic cream to use during the winter months.</li>
            <li> I feel what I put on my skin is just  as important as what goes in it...</li>
            <li> It is certified organic product which is important to me.  </li>
            <li> fragrance free etc.</li>
            <li> The results of daily use have been great.</li>
            <li> up on it did not make under eye concealer extremely smooth.  </li>
            <li> The important item &amp; what I am paying for are the contents &amp; what they do for my skin.</li>
            <li> I wish this company continued success, as I will want to be able to be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling so smooth</li>
            <li> There does seem to be a light coat that remains on my face all day.  </li>
            <li> I would prefer the container was glass, not plastic since there is no mention of it being BPA Free.</li>
            <li> in all, a fantastic product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never felt comfortable going anywhere or doing anything without make-up on in attempt to hide my acne and scars.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on smooth &amp; feels light on my face.</li>
            <li> The product goes on really smooth without feeling like it&#x27;s clogging your pores.</li>
            <li> Leaves a smooth, refreshed look.</li>
            <li> Put oil on your face and see if you enjoy that, it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
            <li> I am 47 with smile and squint lines that seem to look better when I put the cream on.</li>
            <li> I could no longer use eyeshadow or cover up as the product would not go on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> I deceided to look for a made in the USA, organic and cruelty free product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe this cream is great for somebody, but definitely not me.</li>
            <li> Received for free for review.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling silky smooth, and since I&#x27;ve started using this</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels fabulous.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and gives my face a nice glow.  </li>
            <li> good thing is it is all natural for skin to absorb</li>
            <li> cause how good could it be if they&#x27;re nearly giving it away</li>
            <li> I had to wait a week before I could come to this decision, but after a good week&#x27;s worth of applying this moisturizer morning and night, I really think I&#x27;m seeing a smoothing-out of my skin.</li>
            <li> So far so good for now and at this point I would suggest trying it to others.</li>
            <li> This does seem to be a homemade product with good ingredients -- it smells and feels natural.  </li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Good product, definitely natural.</li>
            <li> Just to know that I am putting something 100% natural and organic on my face and eyes gives me a good feeling about this cream.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good facial cream that is good and doesn&#x27;t cost too much.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say enough wonderful comments about this (these) products.</li>
            <li> (unprecedented) and leaves my skin nicely moisturized and glowing the next day.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an all natural product and feel like I&#x27;m doing something good for my skin.</li>
            <li> I noticed my skin became more fresh in the morning when I started to use Bee friendly cream in the nights.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve used, and I love that it&#x27;s for both face and eyes as am very lazy with these things</li>
            <li> BTW I have extremely sensitive skin, and have been delighted with the results from Bee Friendly.</li>
            <li> I used to use Aubrey Organics moisturizers for years, but ditched them when they came out with their flashier, non user-friendly containers, and frankly I find this Bee Friendly product far superior.  </li>
            <li> A wonderful combination, especially if you live in the northeast where this winter just doesn&#x27;t want to stop!</li>
            <li> Very useful during winter months.</li>
            <li> It does have a very nice texture overall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Bee Friendly for two weeks and see a huge difference in my complexion.</li>
            <li> Rich, smooth and not greasy.</li>
            <li> This is a rich and smooth cream</li>
            <li> You must follow the directions for cleaning the face first, &amp; most important use sparingly.</li>
            <li> but I will tell you that it goes on smooth, not unpleasant odor and really feels nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> My new favorite!  </li>
            <li> My new favorite moisturizer!  </li>
            <li> It is excellent if you have dry skin, and is very soothing.</li>
            <li> It goes on real  good and as others have said you just need a small amount.  </li>
            <li> I wash my face in the morning and keep this Bee Friendly face and eye moisturizer in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li> The serum is a bit rich for combination skin</li>
            <li> What I have noticed is worth shouting about!  </li>
            <li> I;M EXCITED TO KEEP USING IT</li>
            <li> So worth the money!</li>
            <li> Worth it!</li>
            <li> so I ordered Bee Friendly face cream.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rich and a bit oily, but that&#x27;s what is needed for the dryness in the air</li>
            <li> Love the gentle ingredients too!</li>
            <li> I did not appreciate getting three emails from Bee Friendly Skincare, urging me to review its product.  </li>
            <li> My moisturizer that I use during the day just feels like it doesn&#x27;t moisturize that well, and using a small amount of this with it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this product after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> and of course I enthusiastically told her about Bee Friendly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li> I am so excited about the face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This cream is so rich and smells GREAT.Love</li>
            <li> Reccommend using with Bee Friendly Mask.</li>
            <li> Facial skin is the most important part of me and I am willing to use good product to protect it.</li>
            <li> A lil bit goes a very long way, great value.</li>
            <li> I just use a clean toothpick to it up before applying.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> great moisturizer leaves your skin very moisturize and it all natural</li>
            <li> My skin responded immediately and became much more soft and had a better clarity.</li>

            <li> What I love most is that it&#x27;s natural without chemicals.</li>
            <li> The following morning,  my skin was flawless, dewy, and so soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I.</li>
            <li> Great consistency, Have been using it for a few days now and my skin seems to love it.</li>
            <li> The ingredients appear to be clean, though not all organic.  </li>
            <li> It soaks in quickly and smells lightly of honey.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> It feels and smells great, a rich cream for a very dry skin.</li>
            <li> It feels amazing when applying the product, so soft and moisturizing!</li>
            <li> This one by far is my favorite!  </li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and moisturized, I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> A touch greasy but is perfect for my dry to normal skin.</li>
            <li> It has reduced the appearance of fine lines and my skin feels softer and smoother and my complexion looks more even highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Great for what dry michigan winters does to my skin!</li>
            <li> it is kind of whipped, i stirred it because the products start to seperate from each other and the product kind of lost its volume.</li>
            <li> I love that the ingredients are natural, there are no chemicals that will age your skin, and it supports an earth friendly mindset!</li>
            <li> This is a great natural moisturizer for a decent price.</li>
            <li> Amazing moisturizer and helps replenish skin and clear breakouts.</li>
            <li> Wow this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Overall, pretty happy.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised at how amazing this product was for the price.</li>
            <li> ~ I also love the minimal and very healthy ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It feels like putting honey in ur face without the whole stickyness of it since its a cream  :)</li>
            <li> It absorbs nicely and makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li> This is the most real cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> It has no perfume or sweet smell.</li>
            <li> This proved not at all true.  </li>
            <li> Once absorbed skin smooth.</li>
            <li> I love it so much I bought the body moisturizer and serum.</li>
            <li> so your skin doesn&#x27;t need to produce natural oils on its own</li>
            <li> It goes on light and gives my skin a fresh, almost dewy look.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sweet earthy smell-</li>
            <li> To know I&#x27;m putting good stuff not only on but in my body!</li>
            <li> Makes your skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good about this product.  </li>
            <li> it says that it good for the eyes as well, but if it accidentally get into your eyes (even hours later) it stings.</li>
            <li> My hands love it, so it is intensely moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s so gentle</li>
            <li> me&amp;#34; even after a full night&#x27;s sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can say that this does have a nice natural feel to it, but it&#x27;s basically oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really more of an oil and very lightweight.</li>
            <li> My skin really seems to love it.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, it&#x27;s definitely a night cream for me though,it has a nice natural scent to it</li>
            <li> I bought this moisturizer because I wanted something different that was organic and at a good price.</li>
            <li> awesome moisturizer, thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> Nice organic eye cream causes no problems for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural and effective</li>
            <li> So far it seems pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Now that I think about it, that&#x27;s not a bad idea....</li>
            <li> Not bad</li>
            <li> great product for dry skin!!</li>
            <li> I love that it is made naturally in Hawaii - Mahalo nui loa!!!</li>
            <li> Works great for very dry skin!</li>
            <li> I probably use more than the normal person needs, but if you have dry skin, this moisturizer is a great option.</li>
            <li> , I can honestly say that my bitchy, pimple-prone skin has been SUPER CLEAR since using this product.</li>
            <li> My face is definitely more hydrated, my makeup goes on smoother, my skin feels VERY soft, and smooth, and it looks healthier.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes after reading many of the very positive reviews, but you&#x27;ve got to be kidding!</li>
            <li> Wow, this product is so awesome and moisturizing for my super flakey and dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful product for sensitive and combination to dry skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend to anyone wanting to use a natural but effective product!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really enjoying this new staple!  </li>
            <li> One of the main reasons that I like it is that it does not cause breakouts which is a huge plus!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; if that makes any sense and I didn&#x27;t feel it really helped my skin that much.</li>
            <li> I am currently pregnant and have been looking for something organic.  </li>
            <li> It does not leave a super greasy clogging feeling, but moisturizes all day.  </li>
            <li> I have hyper-sensitive skin where most fragrance free, natural moisturizers don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> and I quickly headed over to Amazon.com</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of it in the future for sure</li>
            <li> It quickly absorbs into the skin and is not greasy in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> Received product quickly and hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully emollient, easily absorbed into the delicate areas of the face.  </li>
            <li> It shipped quickly, too</li>
            <li> I say quickly because as soon as you put some in your hand, it starts to melt.</li>
            <li> Lucky for me it was waiting at the door.</li>
            <li> SUPER hydrating, which is damn work by olive oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one is a keeper because it is both affordable and moisturizes adequately.</li>
            <li> I think this product works better them my high priced department store cream.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worked for a high end retail cosmetics line &amp; used their products for years with healthy glowing skin.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more from this company and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love that it is natural!!</li>
            <li> excellent product, great if you suffer with dry skin and normal moisturizer just don&#x27;t do it no more.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this, the quality is fantastic and it ships quickly!</li>
            <li> Still needed to use all of my normal skin care, no need to add one more thing with no additional benefits.</li>
            <li> really appreciate a product that has so many natural, healthy, wholesome ingredients.  </li>
            <li> A tiny amount does a great job of moisurizing - even older skin.  </li>
            <li> Great stuff, can&#x27;t wait to try their other products!</li>
            <li> I tried one recently that smelled of licorice and had a gritty texture; I didn&#x27;t love it, but used it anyway until I found something I liked better.</li>
            <li> This rich and gentle moisturizer is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li> I believe that I&#x27;ve found my new favorite night cream.</li>
            <li> my new favorite.</li>
            <li> I guess it may be a good moisturizer if you do not have dry skin.</li>
            <li> It gets absorbed into the skin quickly and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s pretty good, does the job.</li>
            <li> This works good for dry skin.</li>
            <li> It is absorbed quickly and does not cause eye makeup to smear.  </li>
            <li> It is very greasy and doesn&#x27;t soak in very quick, BUT in the morning your skin will be very supple!!</li>
            <li> Meaning, these guys &amp;#34;could&amp;#34; of put 100% organic, (like most do in this and other industries) but since not ALL of the ingredients could be honestly labeled as such, they were honest about it and put 87% organic on their label.</li>
            <li> It is rich but not at all greasy, it is absorbed very well, and is feels silky smooth within minutes of it being absorbed.</li>
            <li> - I have very sensitive skin, and many \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; or \\&quot;hypo-allergenic\\&quot; products</li>
            <li> I absolutely love that this face moisturizer is made with all natural and organic ingredients, and that it works!</li>
            <li> ; woman saw and felt results after the first two nights!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely a return customer for sure!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a facial moisturizer I would love for years and this is it!</li>
            <li> SO BE AWARE THOSE WHO MAY REACT TO BEE PRODUCTS!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Love this natural moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I never leave feedback for products, but this facial cream is absolutely outstanding!</li>
            <li> Pure and perfect for my mature dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin soaks it up quickly, and I&#x27;m left with a nice glow.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and don&#x27;t find it to be exceptionally moisturizing, but it&#x27;s adequate.  </li>
            <li> I love applying it &amp; how it makes my skin feel super soft &amp; hydrated.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very important to me that I use as natural ingredients as I can find and this product fits the bill.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy that I found this product, I&#x27;m 43 years old and was looking for a good organic facial cream for a long time.</li>
            <li> I am pregnant and have been experiencing some breakouts and dryness, and this seems to have zapped those issues right</li>
            <li> Great for my skin - gets a little shiny though...</li>
            <li> even though it may seem a little sticky when you apply it, it just feels great on your skin.  </li>
            <li> I need to use it more to get an overall opinion on whether I think it will help improve fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This product will probably be great in the winter as it is very heavy and rich moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I will certainly purchase more when this runs out, but that may be a while, you don&#x27;t need to use that much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have too many fine lines or wrinkles yet to evaluate the product&#x27;s effectiveness on; however, it has made my (sensitive) skin so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to use it everyday and see how great the results are.</li>
            <li> and this product helps to calm my acne .&lt;br</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is very creamy and smooth.</li>
            <li> I had to edit to add about the amazing customer service, I&#x27;ve received several emails just to see if I received the product</li>
            <li> The next day it still looked amazing.</li>
            <li> Also, there&#x27;s really not too much of a scent to this cream, which I find really wonderful since it&#x27;s a natural moisturizer and shouldn&#x27;t be loaded with scent anyway.</li>
            <li> I love this brand and that it contains natural and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> This cream is nice and gentle, but I don&#x27;t really like it that much.  </li>
            <li> and I love it so far.</li>
            <li> I love the all natural ingredients in this cream.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> I am loving the idea of having just one product for both face and eyes, and I am a big fan of anything that has honey in it for skin care.  </li>
            <li> I am quite pleased so far.</li>
            <li> This makes sure no separation occurs, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any so far.</li>
            <li> You know, the kind that is constantly peeling and molting.</li>
            <li> Nice product, I actually see improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> I love how this moisturizer is made from all natural ingredients</li>
            <li> I love that it is all natural and how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I love the natural glow that remains after it has soaked into the skin.</li>
            <li> It is pretty good to my skin and lasts for a long time...</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that it is organic and all natural.</li>
            <li> Thank you for this product at such a nice price.</li>
            <li> All natural product, It words for me, I love it</li>
            <li> While I love the idea of a natural product, this one leaves my skin feeling and looking greasy.  </li>
            <li> After its on it is totally absorbed and non greasy.</li>
            <li> This one feels like butter going on at night, but is fully absorbed by morning.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and it was not irritated by this (many products do).  </li>
            <li> I am 72 years old and I have been searching for a face cream  for most of my life.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s organic and looks so fresh, I store it in fridge.</li>
            <li> and my face feels fresh in the morning.</li>
            <li> I love the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> If used daily it gives your skin a nice dewy glow and remains even after you&#x27;ve washed it off.  </li>
            <li> work is worth the effort.</li>
            <li> and I love that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> I like the texture of this product, the fact that it&#x27;s all natural and that it can safely be applied to the eye area.  </li>
            <li> So far, I love it.</li>
            <li> And also, my skin is somehow more sensitive and there are acnes coming out.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice that it is all natural...and has become part of my daily routine...</li>
            <li> This cream makes your skin soft, supple, and lovely.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s a natural product</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is  made of natural ingredients and after 3 weeks of use</li>
            <li> I wake up with skin so fresh and hydrated.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used the product a couple of times, but it has been great.  </li>
            <li> I love how your organic creams makes my face and eye area feel so soft.</li>
            <li> so believe me when I say it&#x27;s something worth spending the money</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s an all natural product.  </li>
            <li> I really like how this feels on my face after its on it for a bit, my face feels nice and soft, that said I am not fond of the smell of this product</li>
            <li> My favorite natural face lotion.</li>
            <li> So far I love it.</li>
            <li> I love your product has all natural ingredients</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s a natural product.</li>
            <li> Recieved several compliments of how nice my skin looks, I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> but I think jt was worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this cream, and it makes my skin feel really soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE that it makes my face feel so soft and cared for.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure, as it is a bit thicker that the one I currently use, but it sinks right in to your skin and leaves a beautiful glow.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth not greasy..but very rich at the same time.  </li>
            <li> It had very positive feedback from it&#x27;s buyers.</li>
            <li> However, this is great for people with dry or normal skin conditions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It may appear greasy when it first goes on, but it quickly gets absorbed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like creams which absorbed right away</li>
            <li> I love using this cream, and am now looking for a similar hand cream from Bee Friendly Skincare.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not uncomfortable and absorbs fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> It looks greasy at first, but quickly soaks in.</li>
            <li> It is all natural and organic which I really like and very easy to apply .</li>
            <li> Absorbs well!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfaied with the product, worth every cent!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> but I feel letting people know that Bee Friendly really does</li>
            <li> Very helpful &amp; friendly communication from seller.</li>
            <li> skin is smooth textured and and appears less wrinkled and with a more youthful appearance.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> Soaks right in and softens the look of those &amp;#34;old</li>
            <li> but you pay for what you get and the price is right for the product</li>
            <li> cream also absorbs right in, isn&#x27;t greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> It just fluffs right up.</li>
            <li> Applied it right away and waited for a skin reaction.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s to greasy and doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin right away.</li>
            <li> It means it&#x27;s all REAL INGREDIENTS that you can pronounce and are healthy and natural to your skin!!</li>
            <li> Simple, no weird smells, amazing.</li>
            <li> I searched for a product with similar ingredients as the one I previously used because honestly I thought it was a good product.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the sale price (in the $30s), but the full retail price is too much.</li>
            <li> It has a very nice, subtle scent, and is light in texture.</li>
            <li> It actually makes my skin look kind of oily at first, but later on or the next morning, it just looks nice and more youthful.</li>
            <li> I am always too lazy to write reviews lol unless the product blows me away.</li>
            <li> Great product, does not leave my face oily when applied in small amounts.</li>
            <li> For a natural product, this absorbs very well and is very light.</li>
            <li> Bee Friendly is my new go to product that I won&#x27;t be without!</li>
            <li> In those three days my skin became quite dry, fine lines around my eyes becoming more apparent with the sustained TEWL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> Perfect for dry skin day and night, works as a night cream for other skin types.</li>
            <li> When first applied, I thought that it would blend right into my skin</li>
            <li> Applause for its natural ingredients, and customer service, which has been reaching out to make sure everything&#x27;s alright, showing that they really care.</li>
            <li> My face does feel nice in the morning, it doesn&#x27;t have dry patches after I wash the cream off in the morning.</li>
            <li> Overall, I believe this to be a good value for the money, and I haven&#x27;t yet found anything else I like nearly as well.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> She liked this cream so much I purchased a second jar for myself.   </li>
            <li> To my surprise, in two days the dead skin fell off and my skin was nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and get rashes easily.  </li>
            <li> It is soft and silky and makes my skin feel so soft it is amazing.</li>
            <li> great that i can use the same cream for the eyes as well and it is working well for the same</li>
            <li> So soft, so moisturized, I really couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it about 5 days and so far so good.</li>
            <li> Natural ingredients, very moisturizing, lovely consistency and smell.</li>
            <li> I am looking younger and more fresh.</li>
            <li> First of all,  I love the pure natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice to have just one single product that can be used for face and eyes.</li>
            <li> Great product, a little bit goes long way,it leaves my skin really soft and smooth, I love it</li>
            <li> However, it does not soak in very fast, so I use it at night or mornings when I&#x27;m going to be home for the day.</li>
            <li> Very highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t break you out.</li>
            <li> it is very very lightweight</li>
            <li> Very light scent, immediately softens facial skin &amp; hands when I use it.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are simple, and that was something very important to me.</li>
            <li> Very gentle and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price is also very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much when I bought Bee Friendly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no longer having to use any other products to address the blepharitis, and my eyelids are much more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> My wrinkles and fine lines had nearly vanished.</li>
            <li> but I don know that after a month of daily use my skin feels incredible and other people have noticed a glow.</li>
            <li> A little oily but feels good.</li>
            <li> A little creasy, but skin feels good.  </li>
            <li> A little oily, but skin feels good.</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t like very much, after used for a week</li>
            <li> Wonderful moisturizer, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for the winter months  when it&#x27;s hard to keep your skin moisterized</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made my skin so much softer and evened out lots of the wrinkles!  </li>
            <li> I forgot to mention that I work outside and use sunscreens and lots of retin A on top of that</li>
            <li> I first apply some vitamin E oil with Q-tip around  my eyes and then use this cream to seal it to keep it hydrates.- AM and PM.</li>
            <li> Actually this cream made my wrinkles more pronounced</li>
            <li> and it works really well!</li>
            <li> Not only do I love how it makes my skin look</li>
            <li> , I love the short list of ingredients!</li>
            <li> I am finding a replacement for my wonderful but expensive Shiseido Bio.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t necessarily like the smell, but I love the results</li>
            <li> Overall satisfied with the purchase and quality of the product.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff!</li>
            <li> Skin feels soft and smooth and is not greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion I&#x27;ve used that balances out the more drying products.</li>
            <li> I paid $40 for this jar, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again at a higher price.</li>
            <li> It feels wonderful going on, but unfortunately, caused some breakouts.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing!</li>
            <li> I had no problems with the first bottle because I used it within 3 months of purchase.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to use much!  </li>
            <li> The formula itself may not be for people with oily skin as you are essentially adding more oils onto your skin.</li>
            <li> which makes your skin actually break out more.</li>
            <li> It really does work immediately!  </li>
            <li> By the way, I should add here that I have tried many different products, ranging in price from $3.00 to $300.00 per jar/tube.  </li>
            <li> My skin soft and the light wrinkle of my eyes are reduced a lot.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves!</li>
            <li> This one works pretty well.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I use the Bee Friend Skincare 100%</li>
            <li> just put the top back on and shake it up</li>
            <li> Thanks again for making my day you rock!</li>
            <li> I have only been using it a week and love it.</li>
            <li> My skin is starting to look better.</li>
            <li> Ive tried many pricy dept store brands(pale in comparison) before finding this gem &amp; I will never go back!</li>
            <li> Its greasy at first when you put it on</li>
            <li> I might add I was not fond of the smell at first , but it grew on me as time went by.  </li>
            <li> But performance is key here and I am pleased.</li>
            <li> My skin has improved over only a couple weeks and is more moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I.e., with the highest proportions listed first, then descending from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And anything i tried would feel like it would only moisturize the top layer of my skin.</li>
            <li> The texture is smooth and the scent is pleasantly natural from the butters and oils.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have written a review</li>
            <li> Overall, I love it.</li>
            <li> Works well for sensitive skin which I have and believe it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s free of all of the chemicals found in brand name products.</li>
            <li> and I really like it!</li>
            <li> I have been using it with a 100% hyalauronic acid serum that I apply first and let sink into my skin, then I apply this cream.  </li>
            <li> *)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be trying more of their products.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream and will be ordering it again, thank you!,</li>
            <li> The product is really greasy and does not get absorbed.</li>
            <li> Really happy with it &amp; totally recommend it to people with sensitive skin wanting a natural &amp; eco-friendly product</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer and will never use anything different again!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 2 months and my skin is so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different types of face products!</li>
            <li> Really like this beauty product!</li>
            <li> but, my skin seems to drink it in pretty well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily, every night and most mornings too.</li>
            <li> soft, comfortable, not greasy, not like there&#x27;s a film on my skin.</li>
            <li> so while this will go further than a drugstore brand for sure.</li>
            <li> /&gt;REALLY REALLY can not stand the smell!</li>
            <li> Very Moisturizing!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worked in the skin care industry for nearly 30 years and have never been able to find an all natural product that is worth using until now.</li>
            <li> But overall, the quality of my skin has has become  better becausr of this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mostly as an eye cream, and occasionally as a night cream, for about a month.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much for coverage!  </li>
            <li> skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The cream made me break out after the first use.  </li>
            <li> This product made my skin so soft and it felt silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Very greasy!</li>
            <li> The red gets better now.</li>
            <li> my dermatologist wouldn&#x27;t do anything about, and for the first time it no longer flakes and the redness is going away.  </li>
            <li> The first jar lasted 3 months with twice a day use.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Really like the product &amp; the results!</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> My face is smooth and soft,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that it is just a few ingredients and mostly organic and natural.</li>
            <li> Very mild scent, a little goes a long way and best of all, it doesn&#x27;t annoy my skin thanks to the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> ~ it&#x27;s texture is great, rich &amp; creamy, and it only takes a little bit to moisturize face, eyes, chest</li>
            <li> highly recommend this creme, super product.</li>
            <li> I will say it&#x27;s great for anyone from normal to dry or sensitive skin,</li>
            <li> It is rich, blends directly into my skin - feels very much like Im nourishing my skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and my skin feels so soft and has looked really good since using.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is more natural than other products.</li>
            <li> Bee Friendly face moisturizer really hydrated my skin and left it feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> Now with that being said, it&#x27;s rather uncommon such a lubricating product would not normally make me break out, but THIS ONE DOESN&#x27;T.</li>
            <li> The oily feeling on my skin only lasts for a couple minutes: maybe because of the dryness too, but it seems to be absorbed pretty quickly!</li>
            <li> At the age of 59,I have purchased MANY products at very high prices that did not come close to the lasting dewy ness of this quality product,I love it and it is totally affordable !</li>
            <li> Moisturizing, good for dry skin, but not much effects on fine lines as it claims.</li>
            <li> but this Bee Friendly cream has wiped it out COMPLETELY in 4 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have similar skin type, be aware that this might only be a good choice for night cream.</li>
            <li> First of all, I must have the most sensitive, acne-prone skin on the planet for an old lady in her 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This product is creamy &amp; rich &amp; moisturizers my skin with a modest amount applied and keeps it moist all day.</li>
            <li> Ok, so when I first got this cream I thought I was following directions my mixing it up but still found it be very oily.</li>
            <li> Light, natural scent (sweet but not sickly so), thick and rich, but sinks in quickly and deeply instead of lying on top of the skin...</li>
            <li> This definitely will last a good 4 months if using  every day.  </li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s a natural product and non-irritating to my sensitive skin and eyes.</li>
            <li> I would love to try the whole line, especially the honey mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I apply the cream at night before bed; in the morning it has been fully absorbed by my skin, leaving my skin feeling soft and looking fresh.</li>
            <li> This is honestly just oil that completely separates from possibly wax?</li>
            <li> At first, I was applying too large a dab</li>
            <li> As with other reviewers, I agree that it does not soak into the skin very quickly, but this is fine with me as i do not wear much makeup.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied since this is my second time trying out an 100% organic/natural moisturizer that works way more consistently for an 8-hour day as opposed to some $100 moisturizers I&#x27;ve bought in the past.</li>
            <li> And I must say that after less than a week of use the lines under my eyes seem to have diminished and my skin seems smoother and more moisterized!</li>
            <li> I use it at night as it is a little oily and although my skin has become dry as I&#x27;ve gotten older, this is best at night.</li>
            <li> It has a light, sweet scent &amp; it helped to hydrate my dry skin.</li>
            <li> After reading all of the positive reviews about this face cream, I decided to take a gamble and try it.</li>
            <li> and my skin is positively radiant.  </li>
            <li> Living in AZ for 12 years and have spent so much money searching for the best face cream for my extremely dry and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> and my face feels very comfortable all day even into the evening without feeling like my face is going to dry out underneath my foundation.  </li>
            <li> Pretty much odorless too for those who might be concerned about that.</li>
            <li> I like that it is mostly organic but dont like being told how long a review to write, js.</li>
            <li> I have always been told I have very pretty skin, but I have gotten some other compliments lately about my skin looking brighter and smoother, and it&#x27;s a great feeling!!</li>
            <li> I took off a star because of the feel of the cream after applying on my face the first time around, I didn&#x27;t know how much was needed</li>
            <li> so please keep making the cream,&lt;br /&gt;i love it.&lt;br /&gt;i am not a young woman</li>
            <li> I love how this cream has such a nice light scent (has a natural dried grass scent with a hint of honey) and goes on like butter!</li>
            <li> Using it for few days now, very satisfied with the moisturizing effect.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;But, when I opened it,  there it was, a beautiful mellow yellow,  sweet smelling, delicate and luxurious to the touch creme.</li>
            <li> A very good value - a little moisturizer goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> My fine lines seemed to have diminished,which is probably due to this creams rich emollient properties.</li>
            <li> Cause This cream was fantastic for my super dry skin.</li>
            <li> After using this product for a couple of weeks, I continue to be very enthused over it, and am especially thrilled at the moisturizing effect it has on the small dry areas I get on my face every winter.  </li>
            <li> My makeup adheres beautifully and you only need a little.</li>
            <li> amazing and deep lines are barely visible.</li>
            <li> so I ended up with dry skin most of the day.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and will break out from almost anything.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel truly moisturized and super soft in the morning.  </li>
            <li> The cream is thick and has a pleasant fragrance to it.</li>
            <li> Also, the aging spots that were quite large and dark....are indeed fading.</li>
            <li> I will certainly purchase this again, probably sooner than I planned as I think my daughter is using it too.</li>
            <li> but I was pleasantly surprised the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li> So far it looks very promising!  </li>
            <li> and I plan on using it for a long time!! :)</li>
            <li> Very rich, which I like since I am 50 and tend to have dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin has looked really smooth having used this day and night only for 2 days so far.&lt;br /&gt;I lost a good bit of weight now back to my high school weight, but at my age my face has wrinkled suddenly because of that</li>
            <li> This definitely did nothing for my the dryness, bags or fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I also am noticing fine lines are starting to disappear!</li>
            <li> Like many others, I have a drawer full of other organic and natural face creams.  </li>
            <li> little about my skin: I&#x27;m only 28 and have taken very good care of my skin thus far.</li>
            <li> Amazing, after just a few days my face feels &amp;#34;better&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it a few weeks, and my skin feels amazing.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft and moisturized, and is absorbed fast so there is no greasy look or feel.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> High quality stuff!</li>
            <li> my face is very soft....does not feel greasy.....would recommend to friends...</li>
            <li> The cream is greasy, but it vanishes fairly fast (10 minutes).</li>
            <li> very moisterizing</li>
            <li> Keeps the area moisterized the whole day without drying up the concealer or settleling in the lines...</li>
            <li> I use it as eye makeup remover and it works very well for that purpose.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t really leave a greasy film on your skin.</li>
            <li> Very concentrated as mentioned.</li>
            <li> It has a very neutral smell.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t care too much.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> When I recieved this product ,I could not use straight away as I had an allergic reaction to another foundation product .which</li>
            <li> It wear very well, keeps my skin hydrated throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It just stays on top...and looks and feels very greasy.</li>
            <li> , I really want to have some moisture on my face, and this cream fits the bill.</li>

            <li> I question if my real father is a lizard.</li>
            <li> With that being said, I have to use an intense moisturizer to keep my skin balanced and hydrated.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight yet is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream and will buy nothing else from now on!  </li>

            <li> Thanks for the sample</li>
            <li> I have had no breakouts and my skin is very soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This stuff does feel very oily, but it does absorb into the skin and really softens your face.</li>
            <li> but it soaks in fast.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like the smell too much</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> And living in Denver - dry, dry, dry climate - the BeeFriendly has a wonderful moisturizing effect.</li>
            <li> And in the morning I apply it more carefully and wear it under makeup with no problem.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am very happy!&lt;br</li>
            <li> #34;keep doing what you are doing, you are absolutely glowing!&amp;#34</li>

            <li> I really like this face cream.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>

            <li> Additionally, it has kept my skin very moisturized.</li>

            <li> Thanks for sending this to me.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It is my hope they are caring for the the bees responsibly and not taking shortcuts with gmo sugar water and corn syrup products.  </li>
            <li> It also had a very &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; ingredient list which is a must for me.</li>

            <li> Thank you so much for making and selling it, much appreciated.</li>
            <li> i tried to apply make-up over it, I&#x27;d be very shiny by the end of the day.</li>

            <li> It works very well as a night cream.</li>
            <li> visually it&#x27;s a bit of a turn off - but the important thing is that the product works.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I save so much money and</li>
            <li> this cream is so much healthier for my face.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes very well, but doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all</li>
            <li> This product is very greasy and doesn&#x27;t absorb well into my skin</li>
            <li> once you know how much to use.  </li>
            <li> I am very satified and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> However, it is ABSOLUTELY NOT!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Silky smooth and totally organic</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always believed in olive oil for the skin, and this really delivers.</li>
            <li> My face looks clear an fresh.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an all-around gem of a moisturizer</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and hydrating.</li>
            <li> They stand behind their products and care that the customers are happy.</li>
            <li> After just 2 uses, the skin around my eyes is much softer.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely cannot beat it for the price.  </li>
            <li> I really like this cream.  </li>
            <li> and I can see a real difference in my complection.</li>
            <li> I am especially happy about the lack of artificial ingredients.  </li>
            <li> My makeup applied nicely over it after giving it a few minutes to soak in.</li>
            <li> It has a green tint, and smells nice.  </li>
            <li> I think when the weather starts to feel more like early springtime, I will only be using it twice a day.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and silky, my face looks smoother and it actually has a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> , i have incredibly sensitive skin, burns and breaks out with almost 9 out of 10 products, love this stuff, definitely reordering</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still in the middle of my own personal trial of testing how well this fades sun spots on my cheekbones.  </li>
            <li> I love how soft it makes face and skin feels younger</li>
            <li> So far I love it, I like that it is a facial and eye moisturizer and makes  traveling easier,</li>
            <li> it is creamy and very gentle on dry skin, a great moisturizer without feeling heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> hands down be friendly Wins!  </li>
            <li> I have been searching high and low for an organic, clean (no chemicals) face cream for so long, and I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the one from BeeFriendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my skin feels so soft and hydrated!!!</li>
            <li> I usually get a mildly burning sensation on my skin with most moisturizers.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t made my skin look a whole lot different, but it has kept it really well hydrated, and I SO appreciate the straightforward ingredient list and lack of fragrance.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely absorb right away</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got it on my elbows right now &amp; they stay soft.  </li>
            <li> I am 62 and my skin is sort of dry, after applying the cream, my skin looks and feels very smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> Like this very much because it is all natural!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and makes my skin so smooth, unfortunately I was allergic to it!</li>
            <li> Bee Friendly has a faint organic smell that reminds you you&#x27;re doing something good for your skin.</li>
            <li> A little does go a long away, which is great if you consider how much you get for the price.</li>
            <li> The natural ingredients are a big plus too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great job Bee Friendly!</li>
            <li> even in summer it is not greasy - I have normal skin!</li>
            <li> Friendly skincare has totally changed my face.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any of the problems mentioned in other reviews about oil collecting on the top.</li>
            <li> Other than that really enjoying this.</li>
            <li> I look forward to trying other products :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars, because I like it as well or better than any other product I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it as a night cream because it&#x27;s rich enough.</li>
            <li> I have found that to be true, only if you use too much.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was too oily when I put it on, but found it really absorbs into the skin, leaving it silky soft.  </li>
            <li> I have been slowly transitioning over to organic beauty products after first switching over with my dietary needs, and I had not found a moisturizer yet that I really liked.</li>
            <li> I have been enjoying clear skin for a long time now which is another benefit</li>
            <li> but that is a small price for good, all natural cream.</li>
            <li> Tore open the package and put it on right away!</li>
            <li> Wanted to love it, but it was really greasy and didn&#x27;t absorb as well as typical moisturizing products.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the first rule of natural skincare that I&#x27;ve learned- never put oils or butters on dry skin, because they won&#x27;t soak in properly, plusthey don&#x27;t provide moisture on their own.</li>
            <li> My skin tone around the eyes is more even , dark circles are lighter and puffines is reduced.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Literally felt that over night my face was more calm and clear, and then after a few days the tone/redness of my skin had evened out.</li>
            <li> decided to buy this product because the eye cream I used every night was in such a teeeny tiiiny bottle I thought surely I could find a product that would work just as well and would last me much longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still pretty young, so I can&#x27;t vouch for the anti-aging properties, but my skin does feel tighter in the morning.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t normally pay that much for a face cream.</li>
            <li> Feels natural on my skin.  ;)</li>
            <li> It goes down very smooth and absorbs quickly, and I have noticed an overall healthier glow of the skin.</li>
            <li> One email was fine; any more than that is irritating.</li>
            <li> This stuff is ok if you like your face to feel greased down.</li>
            <li> Not only did I receive the first order the very next day, but my additional orders arrived very quickly as well.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I did cause I received my Bee Friendly Skincare Product just a few days later</li>
            <li> Not an overwhelming purfume smell, just an organic, slight citrus-y smell that goes away after a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> Less is more.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s super overall.</li>
            <li> being said, this anti-aging moisturizer is refreshingly different from many of the anti-aging moisturizers that are currently out there.</li>
            <li> It is better than the more expensive creams I have used.</li>
            <li> But being summer, I only can use this cream at nite, although it is on the greasy side, it is light, not heavy.</li>
            <li> It not soak into my skin quickly, and with my rushed mornings, it left me running out the door with a shiny face, so I kept to using it before bed.  </li>
            <li> And I love supporting a small business that cares about the environment.</li>
            <li> It is soothing and mild enough that I can also use around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling soft and velvety smooth.</li>
            <li> I just needed more at the same price - or cheaper if possible.</li>
            <li> cream appears solid in the jar but quickly emulsifies into the consistency of an oil as you apply it.</li>
            <li> So, the price/amount ratio is completely realistic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s oily, so I mainly use in winter time.</li>
            <li> Yes I am experiencing a notable improvement in my overall facial health and appearance.</li>
            <li> I know there are many that are more expensive though,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been loving this new face cream, which is super-moisturizing, yet doesn&#x27;t feel oily, It has a light, natural scent, which I appreciate, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This feels so good on my face and under the eye area...just gently dab as a little goes a long way....</li>
            <li> If your current cream stays the same all the time, something is not right and could do more harm than good to your sensitive facial skin!</li>
            <li> She has very sensitive skin and a little goes a long way and because her skin is dry, this cream is perfect.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even been using make-up since I started to use this cream: I just apply a little of it (not too much, since it&#x27;s a little oily) on my red cheeks, and in 10 minutes while I drive to work, my face looks perfect!</li>
            <li> She said It really soaks in and makes her skin feel soft!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone.  </li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone my age.  </li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE.</li>
            <li> is highly concentrated.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s too high.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Olga</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> Everything I used from the high end cosmetics to drug store brands burned my skin.</li>
            <li> Affordable compared to high end retail brands.</li>
            <li> I buy alot of face products &amp; I would highly recommend trying this product.</li>
            <li> And believe me I have spent so much money on expensive and cheap products over the years and have look for so long especially for a good eye cream with not even ok results!</li>
            <li> On the other hand, another popular organic facial cream comes in 0.8 oz (shipping weight) and costs $20 or $22.  </li>
            <li> I would have preferred a little better absorption to the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little be grease, to use it at night its ok, but no for the day.</li>
            <li> That does not mean it doesn&#x27;t work for some people, so that is why the 3 stars.  </li>
            <li> but my skin is super dry and this really helps.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it leaves a light layer of oil on my face after a very light application.</li>
            <li> recommend this product for everyone, and I&#x27;m excited to use it in the winter when my face is really dry</li>
            <li> it is a little oily at first but soaks in and keeps skin smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Without the strong perfumed smells of other products.</li>
            <li> I use the CerVe Cream first on my super dry sensitive skin</li>
            <li> One only needs to use a little bit as it is oily, but it makes my face feel so smooth and light.</li>
            <li> There is no strong smell but a very light scent.</li>
            <li> Have enjoyed trying this product at the promotion price.....takes only a small amount and leaves your face and eye area feeling smooth and soft would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> For years I have used expensive department store eye creams was happy with the results but not the price.</li>
            <li> Nothing great and nothing wrong with it.  </li>
            <li> Use a light hand in the A.M. as it can be shiny till sinks in.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am a busy dude, and to get me to write a review on Amazon really says something.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is very emolient - it could be too greasy for anyone prone to acne or with naturally oily skin.  </li>
            <li> It really does make your skin feel so so soft and moisturized</li>
            <li> it is extremely gentle, it does not sting my sensitive eye skin at all.  </li>
            <li> and I remembered how much I&#x27;d like this natural and organic face &amp; eye cream.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer really makes your skin soft.  </li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer, can only use at night because it leaves a sheen after use, but really like the way it leaves my skin feeling, have been using it on my hands and really like the way it feels.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer makes my skin feel soft but is very greasy.  </li>
            <li> It was very soothing, It kept my skin soft and my burn didn&#x27;t peel.</li>
            <li> I really do like this all natural cream.</li>
            <li> Very greasy...only to be used at night if you have naturally oily skin.</li>
            <li> I am definitely looking forward to use &amp; buying more in the near future.</li>
            <li> I only wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey, but then again it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this cream consistently, because it goes on a bit heavy, and I like light creams that soak faster into the skin.  </li>
            <li> It seems brighter too, will have to update in a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have problems with bags under my eyes or puffiness but I am starting to notice some wrinkling around my eyes when I smile.</li>
            <li> I wash my hand to many times everyday, this really helps to keep my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t leave reviews but this product is a must for everyone to try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok , not for day time wear , it&#x27;s rather heavy.</li>
            <li> I used it again a few nights ago and enjoyed it and have begun using it nightly.  </li>
            <li> prefer to just use their Serum during the day as it definitely makes your face look fresh -</li>
            <li> It was thick, which I liked but worried about since I have oily skin.  </li>
            <li> nice thick cream.</li>
            <li> I live in the arid high mountains, and we need hydration.</li>
            <li> When using on the face, the only down side is that it is too oily, however the oily feeling goes away really quick, like 30 sec after putting it on, the skin absorbed most of it.</li>
            <li> It applies smoothly onto your skin and is light and delicate enough that you can apply it to the most sensitive and most delicate parts of your skin, such as under the eyes, eyelids, etc.</li>
            <li> I have mixed skin, and this product has had no adverse effects in making my skin more oily or dry.</li>
            <li> This is a good heavy moisturizer for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is normally very dry so it might not be as good for someone needing just a little moisture.</li>
            <li> I have a very dry clean.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and I had not a single issue from the first use.</li>
            <li> If I want to wear during the day I have mixed a SMALL amount with my current moisturizer which works great.</li>
            <li> Because I live in Arizona where humidity is VERY low most of the time I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have been keeping it in the fridge because I live in Phoenix</li>
            <li> However I live in GA</li>
            <li> so I decided to try something new.</li>
            <li> I never had a reaction like I sometimes do when trying a new product.</li>
            <li> and I told him it was my new moisturizer with honey in it.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product as my skin is extremely dry in this country (UK) and the lotion is very creamy and really moisturizes my skin.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s absorbed so fast once applied to the skin, the skin surfave doesn&#x27;t look like wet, oily.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this stuff, She says this cream is different than others she has tried and she really likes it.</li>
            <li> And the dry skin on my feet is quickly healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The key is to use a tiny amount and work it into your skin with light fingertip pressure.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Different parts of your face will demand different amounts of this Moisturizer - so be careful as a little bit of this Moisturizer goes a long way and you could end up going from a &amp;#34;Dewey&amp;#34; look to a &amp;#34;Shiny&amp;#34; - which is not so wonderful IMHO... except at nighttime.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little greasy at first but absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It does feel a little greasy when you first put it on, but it seems to absorb quickly.  </li>
            <li> Mostly, I just wanted to start going back to the more natural products (the ones with no chemicals in them), because I started having headaches and even a little irritation from some of the other products.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Skin feels very soft and well moisturized.</li>
            <li> It did make my skin very soft, I still use it on my hands.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and this did not irritate.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin/ acne</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, acne prone skin, and this did not break me out.</li>
            <li> When applied to my face and neck, this cream leaves my skin so very soft.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin but had no problems with this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product as a skin care professional.</li>
            <li> , after a few days that is when the magic started... I have had a dry patch of skin under my right eye for years (yeah, YEARS) and nothing ever seemed to work</li>
            <li> It is ok, I mean the real one is not like the picture.</li>
            <li> sure you REALLY mix it up, and only use a little</li>
            <li> This has started to clear my skin in 3 uses!</li>
            <li> Just started using it and my skin feels so soft!</li>
            <li> Loveeeeeeee this face cream more expensive than I like but worth it!</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel so hydrated and soooo soft!</li>
            <li> how long it would take to be absorbed.</li>
            <li> So far I like it!</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> but after I got it, I was actually surprised at how well it worked!</li>
            <li> The price was a deterrent at first, but I think it will probably last me for months.  </li>
            <li> and so far I am seeing results!  </li>
            <li> I will post another comment after finishing this first jar to let you know my final thoughts.</li>
            <li> The cream&#x27;s first ingredient is extra virgin olive oil, (when it arrives in the mail, you may have to stir it)</li>
            <li> Oh one more thing...if you go overboard and cake this on your hair can stick to it if you have hair.  </li>
            <li> Plus, how you can see the ingredients separating when you first open &amp; take the lid off it.</li>
            <li> You must cleanse your face first in order for it to work properly.  </li>
            <li> I am finishing my first jar of this product &amp; have purchased a 2nd jar.</li>
            <li> This is only my first week of using it</li>
            <li> and I love that its manufactured by a small company.</li>
            <li> Like the fact that it is natural!</li>
            <li> Bee Friendly service seems to be outstanding with follow up emails, I have the feeling I will be taken care of if anything were to go wrong.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need any more than a small amount.</li>
            <li> I put some on my face for the first time yesterday and this morning the wrinkle in the middle of my forehead was dramatically reduced.  </li>
            <li> Want to keep this skin looking and feeling young!  </li>
            <li> Put your product on the skin deep ap ;)</li>
            <li> I can definitely feel it keeping my whole face moisturized!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to report results on my fine lines, but I tend towards dryness</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, nice not have to use a ton of product.  </li>
            <li> I am very careful to clean my hands and sanitizing them as well before dipping my fingers into the jar by the way.  </li>
            <li> I like the light scent &amp; how long this will last me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive nor dry skin, but for some reason my skin got problems for the FIRST time in my life, with this cream!</li>
            <li> I have found this moisturizer really helped even out my skin, calm it down</li>
            <li> Has a very light fragrance that is hard to explain.</li>
            <li> You need a very small amount of this cream and it absorbs super quick.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin that flakes, this moisturizer left my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> The packing looks cheap, and only a little more than half bottle.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, but makes my skin very soft and very fine lines disappear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to cut back on the product I have put on my nose daily to combat breakouts, so I&#x27;m not battling dry, flaky nose skin anymore.</li>
            <li> It is a really good product but no matter how little i use (because a little does go along way)</li>
            <li> I live in an extremely hot and dry desert climate.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you use only a little because otherwise your face will look like you just came out of a sauna.</li>
            <li> only quarrel is that I wish the container was glass, or sealed a little better.</li>
            <li> Might due better for people with dry skin</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for making this affordable natural facial cream!!!</li>
            <li> I can clearly feel that my skin is hydrated and a lot smoother by the time I wake up.</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit since it&#x27;s very rich.</li>
            <li> The color looks green/yellowish in the jar, but goes on clear &amp; there is no powdery residue.</li>
            <li> I really try to use only natural organic skincare products.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling so soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that gets irritated by almost anything and</li>
            <li> this cream leaves the skin soft without any residue...</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I like that the product has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say it does anything for the wrinkles, it does make your skin soft</li>
            <li> Only on day one so not much changed in the mirror but the natural fragrance is yummy, the texture is so smooth, there was separation in the container but no biggie.  </li>
            <li> I have (or should I say had) very oily skin prior to using this product.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for 2 weeks and the daily moisturizer for a month and my skin has really improved (wrinkles/dryness).  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many face creams, like at least 30.</li>
            <li> This is the only face cream I have gotten fast results with and no break outs from.</li>
            <li> it redness going away and skin feels soft no reaction.</li>
            <li> To say the least, I absolutely love the cream.</li>
            <li> has kept my face soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so refreshed and soft.</li>
            <li> It has made my skin amazingly soft.</li>
            <li> but I still recommend for soft skin.</li>
            <li> It soothed his pain and helped considerably.</li>
            <li> I like it so far.</li>
            <li> However, it does seem to soak in after about 10 minutes, and I like that the ingredients are all natural.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a natural moisturizer and after trying many&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was searching Amazon and found this all natural eye cream at 1/2 the cost of the one I was using.  </li>
            <li> Remember this is truly and all natural product without all the chemicals.</li>
            <li> o/o Natural bee cream on AMZ Trader Review on Amazon  </li>
            <li> This cream left my face very moisturized.</li>
            <li> She has sensitive and sun damaged skin.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, so use it sparingly, but it makes my face, neck and chest so soft.  </li>
            <li> I received this over a week ago, and was really surprised that it did not cause me any redness or allergic reaction like a lot of skincare products do.</li>
            <li> I havent noticed wrinkles disappearing before my very eyes yet, but I have only used it three days.  </li>
            <li> By the way, I am 34 years old</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend trying it for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin moist and soft.</li>
            <li> I like the results so far.</li>
            <li> I left them alone, used a gentle exfoliant and kept using the \\&quot;bee cream\\&quot; as I call it.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel really soft</li>
            <li> I am 65 yrs old</li>
            <li> No breakouts at all thus far.</li>
            <li> So far, this cream meets all my expectations... and then some.</li>
            <li> I use it as a night cream for eyes, makes skin moisturised and soft</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every product on the market that says they are all natural or all organic and they work in the beginning</li>
            <li> and wow makes my skin look and feel&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is really sensitive, so if yours is sensitive too, I would not buy this product.</li>
            <li> Also the smell is so natural as all the  ingredients....</li>
            <li> My skin is much smoother and my pores seem to be a lot smaller.</li>
            <li> This product is made from mostly natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Anyone complaining that it is greasy likely applied too much.  </li>
            <li> It does not irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my face soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and hydrated after using this.</li>
            <li> I like to use this in the evening as part of my nightly beauty routine, my skin feels soft and hydrated after using.</li>
            <li> I am 72 years old and have been using it about a week.</li>
            <li> It is not heavily perfumed, so if you&#x27;re allergic to fragrances you don&#x27;t need to worry about that.</li>
            <li> It smells completely natural no chemical or fragrance.  </li>
            <li> and if I was liking it so far.</li>
            <li> I only used under my eyes - would not use on my whole face.</li>
            <li> It just melts into your skin and leaves it feeling soft &amp; moisturized and &#x27;glowing&#x27;.</li>
            <li> My lips are no longer chapped, my skin is moist &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin so soft....</li>
            <li> I have been using a salon facial moisturizer that cost twice as much per container</li>
            <li> I myself at 62 yrs old have found it to be beneficial.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my mother who has extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I like that its all natural and has ingredients I can pronounce.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to all that are into natural products like myself.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and so far, no breakouts.  </li>
            <li> This cream works well to hydrate my skin and leaves it feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> My search for an all natural moisturizer is over.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since it&#x27;s natural, it does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin loves this cream.  </li>
            <li> but ... it hasn&#x27;t so far.  </li>
            <li> The aroma is light and fresh..:like green tea.</li>
            <li> The smell is from the natural ingredients and fades.</li>
            <li> When I take it off in the morning, my skin feels soft and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have sensitive oily skin and have not have any issues with it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a moisturizer with fewer ingredients, natural ingredients, no animal testing and made in the USA.  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t irritate it all, but left a greasy residue and didn&#x27;t moisturize much if that makes any sense.</li>
            <li> My skin stays soft and moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> Because of it&#x27;s natural ingredients, I thought I would apply some to the burn.</li>
            <li> will order again when this one is nearly gone.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li> nothing you can&#x27;t read and no heavy perfumes or dyes.</li>
            <li> My face really doesn&#x27;t feel&amp; look the same without them.  </li>
            <li> As a young adult I worked as a skincare expert and a makeup artist</li>
            <li> I use it at night and it has not made my combination sensitive skin nose break out</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li> Its natural</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and supple and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores at all.  </li>
            <li> put, it feels like it is moisturizing my skin, feels incredibly soft, and is hopefully providing nourishment as well.</li>
            <li> One of the nicest face creams I&#x27;ve ever tried so far.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised it did not aggravate or increase my acne</li>
            <li> This cream is worth every penny I spent on it.</li>
            <li> It feels more like thick oil and has a funky smell.</li>
            <li> I was having dry spots on my chin and this has helped very much in clearing it up.  </li>
            <li> I like Bee Friendly face and eye moisturizer, as it is quite emollient and was very helpful with clearing up my dry skin due to winter months&#x27; chafing.</li>
            <li> The next morning, the tiny breakouts are gone and the bigger bumps are reduced significantly in size.</li>
            <li> ; can still mean &amp;#34;clogs your pores and gives you the largest zit in history&amp;#34; :-)</li>
            <li> actually it&#x27;s more like rotating in around in circles, if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of facial moisturizers (many much more expensive than this product!)</li>
            <li> It is a little rich for me to use under makeup as my T-zone is oily, but I use it at night or days I am not wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> I generally use this at night though, so I apply it a little heavy because it makes my skin feel great the next morning.  </li>
            <li> it is all natural and the scent is very subtle and nice.</li>
            <li> My skin is also very sensitive, and any new ingredient is likely to cause break outs.</li>
            <li> I live in a high desert area so this is not a major problem for me.</li>
            <li> It goes on very rich and a little goes a long way, but I still like the natural way it feels on my skin and how it makes my skin look and feel hydrated.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that truly a little bit goes a long way with this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love it a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> At first it may appear a little glossy depending how much used.  </li>
            <li> around the edges at the top  (very small amount)</li>
            <li> this cream works for the whole family, even though we are very picky with face-products and have different skin types - from oily pimple-prone to dry eczema-prone...</li>
            <li> and..Nothing!&lt;br /&gt;Oddly enough, the &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; oil I was using prior would inflame my skin, and this creme put the fire out in a matter of seconds within the first application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Has an interesting feel due to the honey and other bee products.</li>
            <li> Plus, it has a subtle golden &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34; that gives a nice little light-reflecting glow!</li>
            <li> I just put the top on tight and gently shake it a few times...</li>
            <li> I was thinking about why it has such high rate.</li>
            <li> I have cystic rosacea and have struggled for years - through prescription meds, high end face wash products, multiple dermatologists and what seems like hundreds of moisturizers....</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m happy with that, but I didn&#x27;t take into account that other people are probably used to going through commercial products much quicker than I&#x27;m used to going through the natural products I already use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> recently bought the mask and wow!!</li>
            <li> Since I switched to this cream and an organic chemical free cleanser, my skin is less greasy and I have had only 2 breakouts this month.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing for for dry mature skin.</li>
            <li> Suck ...looking cheap and only half</li>
            <li> I can see this jar lasting for a few months, easily, even with a nightly application.</li>
            <li> So far it has kept my face and eyes skin soft and not dry all day.</li>
            <li> I use this a few nights a week and wake up with super soft skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for three days and my skin is almost back to normal.</li>
            <li> My skin is not totally clear, but has improved so much that everyone I know has noticed.</li>
            <li> To me, this isn&#x27;t going to last as long as other reviews lead me to believe, only because I&#x27;m used to natural products being more concentrated</li>
            <li> I like this line of products, I look forward to using this product during the long, cold, dry winters in NYC, it will be perfect.</li>
            <li> so i can&#x27;t speak to how to does with those, but I really like this product for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Really helped with my dry face and not sticky at all.</li>
            <li> This Facial cream has gave me much needed moisture back into my face and has helped with those wrinkle lines.</li>
            <li> I only use it at night so this is not a big deal, but if you were to wear it during the day you would probably have to apply it VERY</li>
            <li> but the jar is big and since you don&#x27;t need to use much, this will last a while</li>
            <li> When companies make their products flashy, I always wonder how much quality they are if they have to prove it by being over the top.  </li>
            <li> Since winter is fast approaching I will wear it during the day outside to protect my skin from the winter weather.</li>
            <li> but what I did differently was I very thoroughly mixed the cream.</li>
            <li> I have tried all natural oils like jojoba, apricot, rose hip, and expensive brands</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s early in the game to see real effects, however, I can say that while using it as a night cream that I wake up with super soft skin.</li>
            <li> I tried different expensive product, but nothing worked as good as this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, but don&#x27;t worry if you use a bit too much because the excess is quickly absorbed.  </li>
            <li> and this was completely bare skin!</li>
            <li> As the other reviews indicated, it does feel oily at first, so I use it as a night cream and also on days when I have time to spare before applying my makeup so that my skin has time to absorb it.  </li>
            <li> No more dry face :)</li>
            <li> When I opened this jar, the smell was clean and not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> I was kind of worried about this having an extra virgin olive oil base, as I tend to break out easily.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin however and this works very well</li>
            <li> I will updare my review after using for a few weeks but my first impression is that this cream is a keeper!</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount and it arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only thing stopping me from giving this full five stars is because the moisturizer makes your skin a little too shiny.</li>
            <li> I searched high and low for a substitute when I found out that I cannot buy Astalift products outside of Asia.  </li>
            <li> I had ordered your product due to positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I never received my package and complained and the seller sent me a jar free of charge with expedited shipping.  </li>
            <li> It is so silky smooth and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way in making my skin feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I recently started using a Vitamin C serum to clear up wrinkles.</li>
            <li> should also note, I have been using this every night for at least a week now, probably more like two weeks, and have not developed any breakouts from it.</li>
            <li> Searched so long for something free of dyes, fragrances and harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I have rocesea and eczema prone skin and this product not only didn&#x27;t aggravate my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Since I am 50 years old, I have deep wrinkles around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> , I put it on at night before bed, and wake up the next morning with wonderfully soft skin.</li>
            <li> My hands were still soft hours later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple days, but so far my worries seem to be unfounded.</li>
            <li> Its definitely all natural products.</li>
            <li> Since I have oily combo and sensitive skin, I only put it on at night.</li>
            <li> Since it is natural it will separate, so I do use a coffee stir stick every week or so to stir it but no big deal.  </li>
            <li> Not for daytime use, apparently.  </li>
            <li> Finally, an organic and all natural cream that I don&#x27;t worry about using on my skin.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve spent a fortune on products, even as much as 200 for an eyecream.  </li>
            <li> No bitter taste either.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin but for some reason my skin became red and itchy after using this product.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for my Mom, but so far she loves it.  </li>
            <li> far, my only issue is the price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a week so far, but it makes my skin look glowing and radiant.  </li>
            <li> I have received several compliments on how young I am lloking since using the cream</li>
            <li> The texture was unique and not exactly what I expected in a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Creamy, thick, and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Pleasant scent, consistency is thick so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I tried this because it was marked down so much</li>
            <li> As other reviewers mention - at first, it goes on a little greasy but as in a short time it is absorbed into the skin and does not leave a greasy feel.  </li>
            <li> Even in the winter when it&#x27;s hard to keep my skin from getting really dry, this stuff works like magic.  </li>
            <li> Moistures my whole face and no need to reapply unless my skin is very dry that day!</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way and if you have dry skin, like me, you just might love this too.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers are right - a little goes a long way, and I like to have my hands slightly wet when using the product to thin it out more and help it to spread easily.  </li>
            <li> It is a little heavy, but feels very smooth when applying.</li>
            <li> , I wouldn&#x27;t use it if your skin tends to be oily, mine is normal to dry</li>
            <li> I have used Royal Jelly products before and this is pretty close to the one I used previously to this.</li>
            <li> It costs 10 times less than the last facial cream I bought - not kidding, but it feels better than the other one.</li>
            <li> And I have read other comments about the &#x27;oil slick&#x27; on top</li>
            <li> I usually mix it with Vit C or HA serum or DMAE powder or another night cream and apply quickly.</li>
            <li> so I really need something extremely moisturing and soothing.  </li>
            <li> My skin is extremely &#x27;oil-dry&#x27; and very sun damaged.</li>
            <li> What everyone says about a little going a long way is true.</li>
            <li> It is a little more green than what the picture shows, and it does separate as it sits settles, but I shake it up well before I use it and the separation does not seem to affect it.</li>
            <li> I seriously saw a little difference the next day and a good difference a week later.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use much at all, and even in just the small amount needed, it leaves my skin feeling so soft!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my eye area, which is noticeably dry in the New England winter, and is at a pre-wrinkle stage.</li>
            <li> You only need very little to cover a fairly large area, and the moisturizing effect lasts for for pretty long time.</li>
            <li> 44 year old female, with greasy skin prone to occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li> It is true you only need a small amount.  </li>
            <li> I am 63 years old and have tried many rejuvenating/ moisturizing products including extremely expensive creams recommended by dermatologists.  </li>
            <li> My skin is never dry again even in winter time.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and dry skin, and this product soothes and hydrates my face.</li>
            <li> have very sensitive dry skin</li>
            <li> The smell is a little funny</li>
            <li> But because I&#x27;m a little dry I still need moisturizer under my makeup for work and all the creams I was trying (some very very expensive) looked great when I first put on in the AM</li>
            <li> Its thick so use only a little, its not greasy and it smells nice.</li>
            <li> I actually felt like I was putting something very beneficial on my skin,  had no hesitation like with other chemically induced</li>
            <li> I had no trouble as long</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so soft but not greasy all day long.</li>
            <li> It will replace a more expensive cream that was natural and moisturized my face, but had an odor that recently became close to intolerable and which the manufacturer denied was there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - it keeps my skin soft and supple all day long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tossed so much money down the drain looking for a product that will help with my acne scars.</li>
            <li> To much weighs your face down will not help with moisterizing your face.</li>
            <li> Other than that I really like this cream, it is truly the richest cream you can possible get for a dry (and mature) skin.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive dry skin</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin that is prone to cystic acne.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Age 35, skin sensitive to dry</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin (exremely ssensitive around my eyes).  </li>
            <li> so naturally I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is dessert dry at 70yrs old.</li>
            <li> It caused no irritation with my dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Natural and cleared up a dry skin problem I was having.</li>
            <li> Previously, my face always felt dry after a few hours and since I already had makeup on at that point I could not add more moisturizer</li>
            <li> Also, I took the container on an international flight and it is pretty messy.  </li>
            <li> But this amazingness goes deep, leaves my skin glowing and not dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not new to natural skin care at all, but I believe a lot of reviewers are newer.</li>
            <li> The main difference from the previous product (complex 15) I&#x27;ve been using is this is mostly oil based formulation while the other one was water based.</li>
            <li> The scent is a little odd, but it is light enough to ignore.</li>
            <li> I find applying it when my face is still a little wet out of the shower that it absorbs better, so it&#x27;s less oily.</li>
            <li> It transformed  my dry dehydrated skin into soft dewy complexion within days of starting to use it.</li>
            <li> I especially recommend these products for dry or mature skin and for folks with fragrance sensitivity.</li>
            <li> - I really dislike having that tight skin feeling -</li>
            <li> I live in the Southwest where the air is very, very dry and sucks the moisture right out of my body.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a subtle sweet smell to it but not like the flowery girly face creams I steal from my wife.</li>
            <li> The manufactures suggestion to start with a little so that your face can Absorb it does not just sit on the skin was very helpful.  </li>
            <li> A little bit &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; or perhaps I&#x27;m using too much.  </li>
            <li> Just use a little to see how much you need...</li>
            <li> and I was looking for a new moisturizer that would help combate extremely flaky skin.</li>
            <li> I typically have pretty dry skin (especially in the winter) and using this twice a day</li>
            <li> It smelled a little old, maybe I just got an old one.</li>
            <li> And you only need to use a little bit, too much</li>
            <li> Under my eyes I think I would like a product that tightens the delicate eye area a little more.</li>
            <li> truly only takes a little to moisturize your whole face.</li>
            <li> I think it would be too heavy for summer, but has been great in my cold climate.  </li>
            <li> Just minutes after I apply the cream to my (usually irritated and red) skin, it seems to calm in down and give my skin back its natural color.</li>
            <li> And the absence of chemicals is palpable.</li>
            <li> No disgusting fragrance; just nice subtle smell of the ingredients (I hate fragrance).  </li>
            <li> It is highly moisturizing, but it does leave a little shimmer on your face initially because of the thickness and richness of the cream.</li>
            <li> If you have dry patches on your skin or just dry skin, this will completely take care of your problem.</li>
            <li> After a few uses, I felt like my face had a subtle healthy glow to it.  </li>
            <li> I was getting dry patches cause of the harsh cold outside in NYC and needed a natural good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The little trial size jar I ordered during the special offer is going to last a long while which is so nice because it is outrageous how much I spend on beauty products these days.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first using this product since I have sensitive skin but after using it , my skin felt so relaxed and soft .</li>
            <li> Because of that, there is some natural separation in the product, but I just use my finger to mix it once every other week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought brands that were not rich enough and didn&#x27;t feel like it was doing anything to my skin, yet I was reluctant to try something the other reviewers all said was on the rich side, due to my fear of looking oily.</li>
            <li> I thought I ate something wrong and got allergy, but I cook myself and all the food are fresh and normal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had good moisturizers in past years, but I&#x27;ve never experienced anything like using this product!</li>
            <li> (I am vary wary when I see strange chemical names on the ingredients of most face creams).</li>
            <li> I have been using Bee Organic Moisturizer for about 10 days now and have noticed that my skin is very hydrated and better withstanding the cold Chicago winter!  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to put a large amount on, just a small dime size will do.</li>
            <li> I use just a little all over my face during the day and put it on a little more heavily at night.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Saw complaints about absorbing, but I followed the instructions and used very little product and it absorbs nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only moisterizer that can actually moisturize my dry skin well in Colorado without causing breakouts.</li>
            <li> It will be too heavy for summer, but works really well for my dry, Winter skin.</li>
            <li> Like the seller said, a small amount will cover the whole face.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t used it long enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for about a week but did not want to wait to long to leave some feedback.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know how it will affect my wrinkles, but I will continue to use it anyway.</li>
            <li> so I can see this will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> It feels like it&#x27;s actually feeding my skin all day long.  </li>
            <li> and one container should last a long time.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice any miraculous results, so cannot speak to that.&lt;br /&gt;Simply</li>
            <li> I am 64, live in Fl., and have the average dry wrinkled skin for my age.  </li>
            <li> I have completely replaced this cream with all the other crams I have in the cabinet!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many moisturizers through the years, some very expensive, and they all irritate my sensitive skin leaving my face still feeling dry or burning.  </li>
            <li> The product is a little heavy but well worth the texture of it.</li>
            <li> This bottle will last a while remember a lil goes a long way!</li>
            <li> No major difference in skin.</li>
            <li> The jar will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Just not moisturizing enough for my dry skin</li>
            <li> I was ready to drop some serious money on SK-II or La Mer but saw this on Amazon and decided to give it a shot before I made such a big splurge.</li>
            <li> Slightly like honey, very subtle and not at all \\&quot;chemically\\&quot; like so many products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was too strong for around my eyes (causing irritation), so touting it as both an Eye +</li>
            <li> It is thick, yet goes on smooth and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Unlike most other expensive creams I have tried, this one doesn&#x27;t make my skin greasy or oily.</li>
            <li> Not only did I receive said product earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to give another try because I found other similar reviews on red and itchy skin.</li>
            <li> It left my skin very dry.</li>
            <li> A little greasy, but has natural ingredients which I like in a product .....  </li>
            <li> there are not many high quality products that I have not tried yet.</li>
            <li> only negative is that the price is too high.</li>
            <li> If you have normal to oily skin you have to put on very little</li>
            <li> used it for very long, but it seems to be equivalent to other more expensive creams.</li>
            <li> I have tried several face creams, lately, with very short lists of natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to the long term results.</li>
            <li> I love the natural feel of this lotion without any harsh chemicals or artificial smells.</li>
            <li> notice now that my skin stays moist all day long.</li>
            <li> I only have minimal dryness now, and it doesn&#x27;t over saturate my oilyer areas.</li>
            <li> I did have to mix the cream with a toothpick a few weeks back (the Northern Nevada warm fall changed to cold winter</li>
            <li> A bonus to the above is that the cream has absolutely NO smell:  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i have used one name brand for a long time and now it is discontinued.</li>
            <li> I can see myself using this stuff for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Todd</li>
            <li> but that is a minor issue.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using for long</li>
            <li> I hope this product isn&#x27;t going anywhere because I plan to use it for a long long time.</li>
            <li> I will be using this for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> I drink water all day long just to keep from being dehydrated.  </li>
            <li> But, when mine arrived, it was a lot larger than I had expected.</li>
            <li> The oily-feeling is just that..oily-feeling but, in fact, it does not stay that way for long.</li>
            <li> Saves money in the long run.  </li>
            <li> I needed something that was not harsh as I have trouble with my skin.</li>
            <li> , so I&#x27;ll see how long it lasts and if I feel I can afford to continue using it.  </li>
            <li> It stays greasy under my eyes for a bit, but not for too long.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that breaks out on occasion and at other times will be very dry and this is all due to the medication I take because of my Arthritis.</li>
            <li> Yes it is a little oily, but that is because it is made out of olive OIL, honey, essential OILS and other natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> It does have a natural smell to it, but there is not a strong odor to it at all.  </li>
            <li> only remark I have is that the jar was not full enough but</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so it only takes the smallest amount to cover my entire face.</li>
            <li> It penetrates deeply while the other ones just sit on the surface.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product and I will be buying their other products in the future.</li>
            <li> I had a stint of tiny clogged pores, almost like little white blemishes for weeks 2-5.</li>
            <li> I already knew a lil goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I can see myself purchasing this again or trying other products from this company in the future!</li>
            <li> I did miss the glamorous  jar or fancy box &amp; scent of other facial products.</li>
            <li> And I use such a little amount a night that I&#x27;m expecting it to last for a while.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong with any of the bee friendly products.</li>
            <li> I especially like the blending aspect which opens up all kinds of possibilities with using other creams/serums/powders.  </li>
            <li> My skin became RED and a little itchy after using several days.</li>
            <li> After applying this cream skin doesn&#x27;t get too oily or too dry through out the day.</li>
            <li> My face is moist rather than dry, in the morning when I wake up.  </li>
            <li> Also, if I have any breakouts, I wash my face and pat dry, then I apply this cream generously on my face and go to sleep.</li>
            <li> so I gave it to my mother who has dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> I had dry patches and this product has taken them away.  </li>
            <li> Before I used this, my nose was peeling from it being dry.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is subtle citrus and very pleasing.  </li>
            <li> She continues to use it on the dry areas under her eyes.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to anyone who has a problem with droopy lids or dry skin.</li>
            <li> Using it has helped the dry patches on my face to go away.  </li>
            <li> Also works wonders overnight on really dry hands.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I wanted for my dry winter skin.  </li>
            <li> The oil doesn&#x27;t dry off.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> If you suffer from dry skin.</li>
            <li> I just turned 30 and noticed chronic dry skin around my eyes, so i bought this to try.</li>
            <li> But if you have dry, parched skin like I do at this time of year, it may be a salvation.  </li>
            <li> , I am a redhead with sun damage, dry, dry skin etc.</li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t feel so dry (like it will crack)</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be on the dry side</li>
            <li> My skin was dry, flaky</li>
            <li> Maybe during the winter when it gets really dry?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been using it on my dry feet and the eczema on my elbows.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> Then, this winter my skin became so unbelievably dry</li>
            <li> When you buy this cream-and you should if you have dry skin-make</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a skin cream that will help my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> So if your skin is on the dry side, this product would be helpful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone has dry skin.</li>
            <li> it was always dry.</li>
            <li> I was going to deduct a star because some bacterial growth developed in the jar when it was almost empty, but considering this doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh synthetic preservatives it didn&#x27;t surprise me</li>
            <li> No skin breakout or problems after a few weeks of twice daily use--skin actually improved.</li>
            <li> However, it was a bit of a shock to put it on my face initially -- it is an olive green color (not honey yellow as pictured) and second ingredient after water is olive oil, so had a heavy feel to it and left an oily sheen on my face.  </li>
            <li> I have used it a few times on my eyes, but I actually got some eyelid breakouts (possibly from another product)</li>
            <li> I could see a big difference in my skin after only a few days.  </li>
            <li> some in-adorable smell,(I found similar review later, but didn&#x27;t pay attention before buying it), not strong, but I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dehydrated skin, which differs from dry skin in the respect that I still produce enough oil to have acne issues, but my skin is always dry, chapped, tight, and red.</li>
            <li> very oily but not good for my combination skin made me break out.</li>
            <li> or so I noticed that small pores on my skin started disappearing, making my skin feel shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> This past winter, my skin was in dire shape - I wasn&#x27;t sleeping well because my 3 year old was keeping me up all night</li>
            <li> I live in ND and the winter is hard on my face</li>
            <li> A very subtle honey smell which is very soothing especially while going to sleep!</li>
            <li> It is oily so I only wear it at night and a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> You only need a little and it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> This will go a long way because you only use a little amount.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have perfumes in it so it doesn&#x27;t irritate, and a little goes a long way, this is not to be used in big quantities.</li>
            <li> I felt an immediate softness to my skin that I haven&#x27;t had I a very long time!  </li>
            <li> especially the fact that, when she rubbed the cream around her eyes, her eyes did not get red and puffy like when using other creams that have a lot of heavy &amp;#34;manufactured&amp;#34; ingredients and perfumes.</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit skeptical about buying the BeeFriendly facial cream, then I gave in.</li>
            <li> I thought I had written a previous review earlier!  </li>
            <li> With my usual moisturizer, after I would wash my face, apply toner, then moisturizer, then makeup, my skin (especially my forehead and upper cheeks) would flake up</li>
            <li> It goes on feeling slightly greasy, but absorbs well into the skin giving me an overall glow, which I like.  </li>
            <li> so you use less than commercial products.</li>
            <li> I take maybe a pea-sized amount and massage it in small circles all over my face and eye area after cleansing and toning my skin with other natural products, and the regiment seems to be making a world of difference!</li>
            <li> Only a small amount is needed, so I expect this jar will last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman in my late fifties with very sensitive skin and eyes.  </li>
            <li> However, I didn&#x27;t have a single pimple or blackhead while using this cream, which I would have expected.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a cream that contained olive oil because I have very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I am over 50 and have very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> in my business &amp; my skin gets very dry.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, prone to breakouts around my chin area.  </li>
            <li> and i have extremely, very , very dry skin.</li>
            <li> so I would not use it during the day except on very dry areas.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> She has very dry skin and raves about how moisturizing it is.  </li>
            <li> and I hate nothing more than waking up with dry eyes - not only my eyeballs but also the skin around my eyes feeling dry -</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be the excessive olive oil creates a very shiny, oily look in my T zone since I have a combination skin type.</li>
            <li> Only use a little.</li>
            <li> You need only a little on your fingertips to cover face and neck, leaving both feeling luxuriously hydrated.  </li>
            <li> I do only use it at night since it is a little heavier</li>
            <li> It seems a little bit oily initially;</li>
            <li> But it is only for very dry skin as I would not bother with a product this heavy otherwise.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry, yet prone to breakouts with other creams.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that gets fairly dry with some of the other treatments I use to control blemishes.</li>
            <li> I use it overtop of my other treatments at night and don&#x27;t wake up to dry flakey skin.</li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes is usually really dry due to my make up</li>
            <li> I must admit I like rubbing the excess off on my elbows and other dry skin areas after applying this to my face and neck.</li>
            <li> Very very little required, so it&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li> I also use it at night, although I&#x27;m not sure that I need to; there is plenty of cream and it will last you for a long time.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a common occurrence for products that are all natural.</li>
            <li> You only need to apply a small amount -- a lit bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer leaves my face soft and not in the least bit greasy.</li>
            <li> So roughly it is  $15 per oz.  </li>
            <li> a few days back!</li>
            <li> so it does sit on the skin for awhile before it sinks in.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s only a few ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> Initially it feels heavy then after 3-5 minutes</li>
            <li> It is very mosturizing and non irritating.  </li>
            <li> although I *think* a few of my wrinkles have abated since starting this cream</li>
            <li> a few minutes after I put it on, and 3) doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg (for my budget this costs only an arm).  </li>
            <li> When I open the container in the morning there&#x27;s a puddle of &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; on top...very messy.  </li>
            <li> I have to be careful when using it around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product a few times</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times</li>
            <li> This product seems to work, even after only a few days.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely helping me survive a harsh winter.</li>
            <li> And its only been a few weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using for a few days, but my skin already feels softer.</li>
            <li> The cream is a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for and I think it will last a few months.</li>
            <li> Works well under tinted moisturizer and mineral makeup if left to soak in for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Be careful with the amount used.</li>
            <li> I have been getting nonstop compliments on my skin from my family and gf, who had seen it deteriorate over the last few months because of work.</li>
            <li> I always let it sit a few minutes before actually applying my makeup</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t rough to begin with)</li>
            <li> Gave this to my mother because i was curious about it.</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely, it isn&#x27;t thick or sticky and I like the fact that it is 100 0/0 natural.</li>
            <li> agree with the other reviews that you only need a little bit of this on your face for it to work.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve had a small dry red area on my face for years</li>
            <li> I applied a very small amount because a tiny bit will go a long, long way.</li>
            <li> Because I still had other moisture left when I received this, when I opened this cream later and found these problems, it was too late to return</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, dry skin and have been in search of a face moisturizer that 1) does not have weird, unpronounceable/scary ingredients in it, and 2)  moisturizes my face enough so that it doesn&#x27;t feel dry</li>
            <li> I really like the texture and the subtle fragrance of this moisturizer, and my skin seems to like it, too!</li>
            <li> It can go on a little heavy if you are not careful.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long ways though - not much is needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a less expensive replacement for a german night cream that I used 24/7 365 because I also like a bit of oil, just not too much.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is it&#x27;s a little bit oily if I don&#x27;t apply my moisturizing water before I apply this cream on my face!</li>
            <li> I also do this same thing in the morning but use a little less of this</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, my skin soaks it up.</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It does go a long way with just a little.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> Like others have said, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Use it sparingly, since a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way-</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I will keep using it, a little goes a long way, and not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way-</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I little goes a long way and my skin does not feel greasy at all.</li>
            <li> a LITTLE goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way as other reviewers have said.</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with my other organic products and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot just a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> This product is just like the night cream only less heavy.</li>
            <li> and I only applied a small amount.  </li>
            <li> Other than the oiliness, the product is pleasing.</li>
            <li> I warmed it in my hands and used only a small amount.</li>
            <li> The product is oily like other reviews have said, but that isn&#x27;t a problem for me.</li>
            <li> now I have ordered the night cream and clearing all my other creams out fed up with wasting money ,sticking to this .Try</li>
            <li> I often have problems with eye irritation with other products.</li>
            <li> Instead of trying some other site products,  try this stuff.</li>
            <li> This other one was sitting around for 7 months.</li>
            <li> plan on trying the other products by bee friendly.was looking for a cleanser ---</li>
            <li> I prefer a squeeze or pump bottle over a lid container due to hygienic reasons.</li>
            <li> If you have oily skin you probably need only a small amount.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they now have a customer whom trusts them and will be buying other products in their line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I was grateful this doesn&#x27;t smell anything like other face cream.</li>
            <li> (like we often have to with other creams)</li>
            <li> I have tried other products to lessen the appearance of these wrinkles, and none worked.  </li>
            <li> But it is ABSOLUTELY NOT!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way too!</li>
            <li> A small dab will do for each facial area.</li>
            <li> and they weren&#x27;t kidding when they say a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It has properties that make it stand out from other skin creams.</li>
            <li> This cream is extremely concentrated.</li>
            <li> (I suppose it could if I got carried away, but I only need a small amount).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also use the night cream (luxurious) &amp; I am going to purchase other products in this line.</li>
            <li> found this cream is greasy, looking like butter, and it doesn&#x27;t absorb well like other moisture I used.</li>
            <li> No more multiple jars.</li>
            <li> I have other moisturizers to finish before I use this fulltime and am looking forward to that time.  </li>
            <li> was expecting it to ease some small wrinkles that are starting to form, but haven&#x27;t seen any help with that yet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am looking forward to trying other products in their line.</li>
            <li> Now, I simply swipe out a small dab and&lt;br /&gt;dot</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> little goes a very long way and my face stays moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, thin sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money if you have dry skin</li>
            <li> I have tried about half a dozen face creams and never really &amp;#34;clicked&amp;#34; with any of them until now.</li>
            <li> Goes on silky smooth and dries enough to put a base foundation on.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, yet once in the morning and the usual dry areas around my eyes remain moisturized all day.  </li>
            <li> Only con I have is for the price the packaging is not very nice and the label was a little worn, also was expecting to get some sort of card or paper from the company?</li>
            <li> I love only needing one product for my face and knowing that there is nothing artificial in it!!  </li>
            <li> I think I look at least 10 years younger.  </li>
            <li> It really has help with my troubled skin even with makeup.</li>
            <li> Especially for something that is going to be spread on the delicate skin around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin can also be sensitive and this isn&#x27;t irritating at all.  </li>
            <li> The photo can be misleading as the actual product isn&#x27;t as thick.</li>
            <li> I am developing a layering system, and using this as the base with another cream on top to &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s not cheap, a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it greasy at all, but I also only use a very little bit and that&#x27;s truly all that&#x27;s needed!</li>
            <li> A very little goes a very long way...</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and use this everyday year round.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed it does not sting if it works its way down into my eyes.</li>
            <li> I purchased two one for my mother the other for myself!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little greasy so a little goes a long way, but my skin loves this product!!!</li>
            <li> I have oily skin in the t-zone and patchy dry areas that usually get flaky.</li>
            <li> One night of use and my nose was not peeling and none of my skin has dry patches like it usually does.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick product, but you only need a little bit to see results.</li>
            <li> You only need to use a very small amount.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a very small amount.</li>
            <li> This layer tends to fade about half way through the day though.</li>
            <li> ITS A SLIGHT DIF</li>
            <li> I have less acne ,</li>
            <li> The slight scent is of olive oil.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two and half weeks.</li>
            <li> My face looks smoother, healthier and less lined.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s slightly greenish (the color of olive oil)</li>
            <li> one less jar.  </li>
            <li> Typically I put in on, let it soak in, and then wipe my face with a towel.  </li>
            <li> My skin has been slightly ravaged by sun and salt.</li>
            <li> My lines are less noticeable and dark circles a little lighter.</li>
            <li> The only reason it&#x27;s not 4 stars is it is a little thick, and stays a little sticky.</li>
            <li> I ended up using my washcloth to wipe off some of the cream so it wouldn&#x27;t make a mess on my pillow.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would clog my pores since it was a bit oily when first applied</li>
            <li> When I first ordered the product, I was afraid the honey scent would be overpowering</li>
            <li> I wish the price were a little less though.</li>
            <li> I ordered it a few weeks ago, received it in the mail a few days later, and I have used it everyday since!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel tight and sore anymore.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make it feel tight like some age defying creams do, but that is why I like it.  </li>
            <li> I was truly heartbroken, and sadly needed to find something new.  </li>
            <li> Slight smell, feels moisturizing, need a few weeks to try.</li>
            <li> When I first opened product, I was afraid it might be too heavy for my skin.  </li>
            <li> The texture is thick; only a small amount is needed for my face, including the eye area and my neck.</li>
            <li> I live in a cold climate and my skin gets very dry.</li>
            <li> This stuff can make skin very soft, but too oily and difficult to Smear evenly on the face</li>
            <li> I discovered it when I was looking for something natural for my dry skin: I also have a mild rosacea on my face, so any artificial chemicals are just a bad idea.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little greasy</li>
            <li> I peeled off the protective seal and used that little bit of cream on my face.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous putting it on my face.</li>
            <li> It does have a little bit of an olive oil odor...</li>
            <li> A little pricey</li>
            <li> A little oily</li>
            <li> You need just a little at a time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> none of it helped even a LITTLE.</li>
            <li> It stays greasy for a little bit but does absorb over time.  </li>
            <li> A little too greasy for me.</li>
            <li> Just like they say, a little goes a looooong way</li>
            <li> (made my vision a little blurry) but no stinging whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Can be a little oily looking</li>
            <li> It seemed a little pricey to me when I ordered it</li>
            <li> Always massage products into the skin with a little water on your fingers.</li>
            <li> A little on the oily side but blends well with foundation.</li>
            <li> This lotion has worked well for me, although it does leave a little sheen.  </li>
            <li> little goes along way....</li>
            <li> although if you do use it under makeup it does look a little shiny.</li>
            <li> As the cold weather sets in, my skin tends to get dry, but so far, this cream keeps my face well hydrated.</li>
            <li> The BeeFriendly face and eye cream was a little oily and heavy.</li>
            <li> A little heavy</li>
            <li> I am not too crazy about it, Have been using it for 2 weeks straight.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few days</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t have any harsh reactions.</li>
            <li> I found this cream a bit heavy for my oily-to-combination skin.</li>
            <li> Too heavy.</li>
            <li> Then my husband noticed a few weeks after I had been using it.</li>
            <li> Well let me tell you I have been using this product now for a few days</li>
            <li> I have had it for a few weeks and could not be happier.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks now and started noticing a difference in my skin within a few uses.  </li>
            <li> I also use it in my lips a few times a week to treat and prevent chapped lips.</li>
            <li> ( I always looks so dried</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying jars of it for my mom and a few friends.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of this understanding, and the listing posted on Amazon, I expected a thick cream.</li>
            <li> However I can see how this could be a bit heavy for you.</li>
            <li> I waited a few weeks to leave a review</li>
            <li> Did not irritate, did not feel greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I ordered and said if it doesn&#x27;t work I&#x27;ll at least not have spent a lot.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer alleviates the dryness but doesn&#x27;t feel like a heavy barrier.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that is also prone to breakouts, so I was skeptical using a product with olive oil in it.  </li>
            <li> I got this a few days ago</li>
            <li> Been using it for a few months: put it on every morning.</li>
            <li> I found the cream to be to heavy for my combination skin, so I gave it to my mom.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using it everyday.</li>
            <li> A few reviews state</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my skin is already softer and the small wrinkles are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed less wrinkles but will keep using to see!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and luxurious, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Not a strong scent.  </li>
            <li> but it is not easy to find&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I usually wait a little bit to hit the pillow at night.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it greasy enough for the cold and dry air, we are having this winter.  </li>
            <li> My face feels &amp; looks softer, not so drawn &amp; tight!  </li>
            <li> I got a pretty bad sunburn.</li>
            <li> I usually apply this after applying my retinol or urea-based products because it seems help with the irritation from those harsh products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 38 and a few small &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34; around my eyes.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it&#x27;s a little expensive to buy all the time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had horrible, sensitive, acne-prone skin my whole life.</li>
            <li> stopped using this cream for several days, and drunk lots of water everyday.</li>
            <li> We need to do all we can to protect these little miracle workers!</li>
            <li> Also leave the skin with a little glow which is a bonus!</li>
            <li> This super-concentrated moisturizer took a couple of uses to get used to using so LITTLE of it!  </li>
            <li> I am 55, &amp; live in Minnesota where it is currently very cold &amp; dry.  </li>
            <li> For this, I need at least a lima-bean-sized amount for my face and neck, which may be a little for some</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t worry about having a little shine on my face, but if you do, I suggest using this as your night cream or at least waiting until it soaks in before applying make-up.</li>
            <li> Must use very little for it</li>
            <li> Very little does a lot.  </li>
            <li> not sure yet if it has any anti- aging benefits.</li>
            <li> Nighttime was no better.</li>
            <li> I placed it in the fridge for  the rest of the summer and there was no more growth.</li>
            <li> so I thought the cream was too thick for a few days.</li>
            <li> I use small dabs all over my face.</li>
            <li> It has reduced the lines in my face in just a few applications!  </li>
            <li> this, I have followed my usual routine and it has improved the dryness drastically.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lazy,</li>
            <li> So I put just a few drops and rubbed it all over my face and neck!</li>
            <li> Usually creams breakout my skin, not this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this product....</li>
            <li> I find that if I mix it with aloe vera gel it will soak in faster and does not leave an oil slick on my face.</li>
            <li> You need just a small amount.  </li>
            <li> Need a small amount of  the product to apply.</li>
            <li> I am giving this a neutral rating because I was not actually able to try it for any length of time to see if it worked on wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Olive oil tends to be very heavy</li>
            <li> A little thick but does the job!</li>
            <li> The lines on my wrists are hardly visible when using it.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time paying $30+ for a skincare product.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it breaks me out quite a bit, so will be using my sample on my body as I am very dry, but cannot use on my face.</li>
            <li> As far as the reviews saying it smells bad, it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> stated it was TOO LATE.</li>
            <li> The Northern Nevada climate has been reaking havoc on my skin of late.</li>
            <li> While I could not find these reviews listed elsewhere online, I did notice three or four phrases that popped up identically across at least 10 reviews.</li>
            <li> (Some who received samples, some who did not...at least I assume)</li>
            <li> When I saw the price of this one I thought I&#x27;d give it a try because of the reviews, at least if it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> and I wanted to wait until I used the product for at least a month.</li>
            <li> It does go on a bit thick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit too thick for daytime use, so I use it overnight</li>
            <li> It comes out of the jar sort of thick and liquifies immediately on contact with your skin.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, the olive oil in it can separate a bit from the cream base, but I just stir it gently to reincorporate the ingredients and all is well.</li>
            <li> The product is a bit thick for my aging skin.  </li>
            <li> and I have slowly started to see results after one week.</li>
            <li> The cream is indeed thick and sits on my face for about 1/2 hour</li>
            <li> One night I was watching some TV after smearing a thick layer on and I could tell it was getting in my eyes</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too thick.</li>
            <li> it moisturizes unbelievably well!</li>
            <li> no more bumps!</li>
            <li> It is disgusting to dip your fingers into after the first go round, a germ cesspool.</li>
            <li> The negative reviews commenting on the oiliness of this cream means it is not a good match for everyone.</li>
            <li> Was a very small jar which made me question the value.</li>
            <li> Yet, for the price I have not seen the difference in a less expensive brand.</li>
            <li> And all of it cost serious cash.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I tried a few others, but I was not really impressed with any of them.</li>
            <li> some days that I didn&#x27;t want to go out in public and some of the very expensive eye creams I tried just made it worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of its benefits over time but the greasy film left is annoying.  </li>
            <li> I think my skin was just angry with all the chemicals I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> 1 weak</li>
            <li> you can pat it onto the delicate skin around your eyes!</li>
            <li> Thick and moisturizing!  </li>
            <li> Very hard to find a moisturizer that will balance out all of my skin concerns.</li>
            <li> Another positive is when my boyfriend kisses me there isn&#x27;t a nasty residual from the creme.</li>
            <li> The product is very thick and would probably clog my pores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very thick cream</li>
            <li> so I look for very thick, moisturizing eye creams to use at night so they&#x27;ll still feel like they&#x27;re &amp;</li>
            <li> I am not seeing decreased wrinkles</li>
            <li> My only criticism is that the base oil they use to formulate it is olive oil.</li>
            <li> On... I&#x27;m addicted to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My skin looks brighter and I don&#x27;t look as tired around the eyes.</li>
            <li> This is my eye and face cream all in one without all of the unhealthy ingredients.</li>
            <li> I tried lots of moisture, but I&#x27;m not happy about their result on the wrinkle.</li>
            <li> Because of that my acne got really worse..</li>
            <li> Worse than ever before.</li>
            <li> The bees wax has a slight scent, but not at all unpleasant.</li>
            <li> A total failure, the worst beauty product I ever got from Amazon.</li>
            <li> In the past I have used some very expensive creams...</li>
            <li> I am not recommend this product to anyone , bad smell, greasy  and didn&#x27;t do anythings in my skin, waste my money!</li>
            <li> Very thick and luxurious without being greasy!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my face is dryer than before.</li>
            <li> I have never before had skin reactions to facial creams - this was a miserable experience!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s probably not best for day use.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to absord.</li>
            <li> I was slightly disappointed by how small it is.</li>
            <li> That packaging is simplistic, which I like.  </li>
            <li> An esthetician recommended some expensive face care products that I have been using (too expensive).  </li>
            <li> It is always difficult to find a product for your eye area that will show a visible result immediately</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have to stop using.  </li>
            <li> I used to use expensive eye and face creams.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really sorry about that.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s crazy about it.</li>
            <li> The weather here is cold and blustery, and my skin has been taking the brunt of it.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention, the brutally cold weather was just killing my skin.</li>
            <li> those (new) nasty cheek and mouth lines are smoother and softer, instead of nasty grooves!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;you wont be sorry if you buy this product!</li>
            <li> how could you go wrong!  </li>
            <li> Travelling with this is essentially impossible because the oil will leak.</li>
            <li> - it was way oily, and impossible to apply makeup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been very difficult to find a face lotion that doesn&#x27;t have bad chemicals in it and won&#x27;t clog up my pores and make my face break out.  </li>
            <li> and it smells bad.</li>
            <li> - I have seen a lot of remarks that it smells bad -</li>
            <li> Too oil and smell bad.</li>
            <li> I am not saying this is a bad thing either.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
            <li> bottle smell so bad neverbuy again</li>
            <li> I ordered this after a disastrous reaction to a moisturizer containing retinol.  </li>
            <li> Living in the northeast this winter has been brutal.</li>
            <li> However, it turned RANCID and smells horrible now.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE product!</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> It was terrible.  </li>
            <li> hated the smell!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this product so does my face!</li>
            <li> Slight smell, feels moisturizing, need a few weeks to try.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Works very well when face is moist and warm from just washing face or shower. Face is softer and smoother .</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. moistening cream.</li>
            <li> I love how this cream doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. High quality stuff! I will updare my review after using for a few weeks but my first impression is that this cream is a keeper!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. I can&#x27;t use it on my face before make-up but I put it on my face/neck/hands before I go to bed and wake up with hydrated skin. Awesome product!</li>
            <li> Just started using it and my skin feels so soft!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It leaves my skin feeling so soft and hydrated. I love this brand and that it contains natural and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> use it every night...</li>
            <li> It is good but it&#x27;s a little greasy and it says moisturizer in the page but in the product it is managed as an anti aging cream, and I was purchasing it because of the moisturizing offer</li>
            <li> I absolutely love that this face moisturizer is made with all natural and organic ingredients, and that it works! Bee Friendly face moisturizer really hydrated my skin and left it feeling smooth. My makeup applied nicely over it after giving it a few minutes to soak in. I&#x27;m a facial product hoarder and this is definitley one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> This has been a great moisturizer for me.  I have very sensitive skin and this does not cause any irritation or clog my pores.  I have not noticed any difference in fine lines, etc.  However, it does provide great lasting moisture.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  It&#x27;s very important to me that I use as natural ingredients as I can find and this product fits the bill.  It does go on a bit thick but it&#x27;s not uncomfortable and absorbs fairly quickly.  I wear it under my makeup in the mornings and alone before going to bed.  It&#x27;s made my skin so much softer and evened out lots of the wrinkles!  Great purchase!!</li>
            <li> love it...my face is very soft....does not feel greasy.....would recommend to friends...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this moisturizing cream.  I wanted a cream that contained olive oil because I have very dry skin.  This cream not only hydrated my skin but it also served as an eye cream, neck cream and decollete cream.  A great savings with buying one cream versus four creams.  I will continue to purchase the product.</li>
            <li> Feels wonderful! I have sensitive skin that gets irritated by almost anything and this made my skin happy  :P It feels like putting honey in ur face without the whole stickyness of it since its a cream  :)</li>
            <li> I have a very dry clean. I read the reviews in amazon and thought I had found the best product. The cream is greasy, but it vanishes fairly fast (10 minutes). I like the texture. Unfortunately, my face is dryer than before. I wasted my money. I guess it may be a good moisturizer if you do not have dry skin. Don&#x27;t waste your money if you have dry skin</li>
            <li> Greasy and it smells bad. Wouldn&#x27;t reorder!</li>
            <li> This cream is nice and gentle, but I don&#x27;t really like it that much.  It&#x27;s kind of &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; if that makes any sense and I didn&#x27;t feel it really helped my skin that much.</li>
            <li> This is a great natural face moisturizer. It makes my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> this cream works for the whole family, even though we are very picky with face-products and have different skin types - from oily pimple-prone to dry eczema-prone... this cream leaves the skin soft without any residue...&lt;br /&gt;we&#x27;ve been using it for a week only, so cannot comment on its anti-aging effect, but it cleared up pimples and eczema within 3-4 days</li>
            <li> I love this cream it has just enough moisturizer. After applying this cream skin doesn&#x27;t get too oily or too dry through out the day.Skin feels very soft and well moisturized. After a week or so I noticed that small pores on my skin started disappearing, making my skin feel shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> The skin gets softer, kinda baby face feeling. My skin tone around the eyes is more even , dark circles are lighter and puffines is reduced.&lt;br /&gt;Very light, good smell. Absorbs well!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfaied with the product, worth every cent!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> It seems to be helping but I haven&#x27;t used it long enough.</li>
            <li> Love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the moisturizer 3 days since it arrived and can already see the difference in my skin.  My face is moist rather than dry, in the morning when I wake up.  Works well under make up - not too oily. Feels natural and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li> Love the product, it&#x27;s really moisturizing and feels and smells amazing plus I love that it doubles as an eye cream too! And the ingredients are awesome!</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizing cream and would recommend in a heart bit to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> Yessssss! Best product. I go to sleep and when i wake up, my skin looks so radiant. Will be buying again once i run out.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few days and I love it so far. The texture is great and its really moisturizing</li>
            <li> It has been a week since I started using the cream, and the results are amazing. Love this product! Great customer service too.</li>
            <li> I was sceptical about this, but it is wonderful to my skin. It absorbs nicely and makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit too thick for daytime use, so I use it overnight and my skin looks great when I wake.  It also works great on my hands.  The lines on my wrists are hardly visible when using it.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST product if you have dry skin. This Facial cream has gave me much needed moisture back into my face and has helped with those wrinkle lines. My hands also feel softer since I would rub the remainder into my hands afterwards. A little does go a long way. I also use it on my Neck and Throat area as so many forget those areas and the Wrinkles to sneak up on you there. I would recommend all ladies to get this product.</li>
            <li> Living in AZ for 12 years and have spent so much money searching for the best face cream for my extremely dry and sensitive skin.  I forgot to mention that I work outside and use sunscreens and lots of retin A on top of that so I really need something extremely moisturing and soothing.  Well I found it and will continue to order it.  It&#x27;s very rich but not in a greasy on the surface way.  It penetrates deeply while the other ones just sit on the surface.  I have zero breakouts. I have tried all natural oils like jojoba, apricot, rose hip, and expensive brands but this is by far the best cream EVER.</li>
            <li> Amazing, after just a few days my face feels &amp;#34;better&amp;#34;. I have extremely sensitive dry skin and this appears to be doing well! I have tried all the best and the cheapest creams I may have found one I will use for a long time...</li>
            <li> I love the all natural ingredients in this cream.  It goes on real  good and as others have said you just need a small amount.  This definitely will last a good 4 months if using  every day.  I use mine only once/day.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! Best night and eye cream I have ever found!! And believe me I have spent so much money on expensive and cheap products over the years and have look for so long especially for a good eye cream with not even ok results! I have rocesea and eczema prone skin and this product not only didn&#x27;t aggravate my sensitive skin but it actually calmed the redness and irritation! It feels amazing when applying the product, so soft and moisturizing! Plus I love the smell! A very subtle honey smell which is very soothing especially while going to sleep! I combine it with their serum and love the results! I use it all over my face, neck and eyes at night, and as an eye cream only during the day. I will say it&#x27;s great for anyone from normal to dry or sensitive skin, very moisterizing And I must say that after less than a week of use the lines under my eyes seem to have diminished and my skin seems smoother and more moisterized! It&#x27;s also great underneath eye make up! Keeps the area moisterized the whole day without drying up the concealer or settleling in the lines...I will continue to use this product together with the serum! My skin texture has definitely improved! So happy to have found such a great natural product please keep on making this product and keep the resonable price!!</li>
            <li> Smells lovely. I have sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t have any harsh reactions. Not too oily, feels light on your skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and my skin feels and looks rested in the morning. I use it at night as it is a little oily and although my skin has become dry as I&#x27;ve gotten older, this is best at night. It doesn&#x27;t smell great but the way it makes my skin look and feel in the morning is well worth it!</li>
            <li> I like that the product has natural ingredients. I use just a little all over my face during the day and put it on a little more heavily at night.&lt;br /&gt;It keeps my face moisturized. You do have to let it absorb into the skin for a few minutes before applying makeup for the best results.&lt;br /&gt;And it does separate as noted when I purchased the product. I just use a clean toothpick to it up before applying.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure yet if it has any anti- aging benefits. I will have to continue to use it to see if I notice any results</li>
            <li> Loveeeeeeee this face cream more expensive than I like but worth it! A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I started this cream about 1 wk ago.  Since I am 50 years old, I have deep wrinkles around my eyes.  After using this cream twice a day in 2 days,  I already can see the great result.  I first apply some vitamin E oil with Q-tip around  my eyes and then use this cream to seal it to keep it hydrates.- AM and PM. Now after 1 week, my wrinkles under eyes are almost disappeared.  I think I look at least 10 years younger.  Also, the cream has a mild lavender scent and it smells very nice  when I sleep at night.  I apply it on my face, neck and hands.  My hands look like when I was 40 now with vitamin E oil and this cream.  This cream comes in 2oz jar. So roughly it is  $15 per oz.  On the other hand, another popular organic facial cream comes in 0.8 oz (shipping weight) and costs $20 or $22.  So this cram&#x27;s price is more affordable and also every effective.  Thank you so much for making this affordable natural facial cream!!!</li>
            <li> Actually this cream made my wrinkles more pronounced, I guess it is because it is oily and has a shine too it when you apply to your face.  It did make my skin very soft, I still use it on my hands.  Can&#x27;t say it does anything for the wrinkles, it does make your skin soft, I wouldn&#x27;t use it if your skin tends to be oily, mine is normal to dry and it is too greasy for me and I only applied a small amount.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Regenerist for years, and this is even better.  Great product for my combination, 65 - year- old skin.</li>
            <li> I literally just received my face cream and I&#x27;m already impressed. I peeled off the protective seal and used that little bit of cream on my face. Immediately loved the way it feels. Rich, smooth and not greasy. The ever-so-slight tightening I&#x27;m feeling is an added surprise. I&#x27;m looking forward to the long term results. The natural ingredients are a big plus too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great job Bee Friendly!</li>
            <li> I bought this because there was a deal. The product is very thick and would probably clog my pores. Upon arrival, I opened it and found oil was separated out of the product and stirred it back in. It keeps separating any way. I use it as eye makeup remover and it works very well for that purpose. Other than the oiliness, the product is pleasing.</li>
            <li> It IS the greatest cream I have used that really showed results right away.  Love it!</li>
            <li> It is ok, I mean the real one is not like the picture. and some oil transude from cream. cheap bottle.</li>
            <li> This night cream is AWESOME.  In the morning I didn&#x27;t even want to take it off.  Only on day one so not much changed in the mirror but the natural fragrance is yummy, the texture is so smooth, there was separation in the container but no biggie.  My face after 18 hours mid-winter still feels relaxed from moisture.  Good job!  This is the most real cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  (I&#x27;m 55)</li>
            <li> great product for dry skin!! Soaks right in and softens the look of those &amp;#34;old lady wrinkles&amp;#34;!!!....I am 77, so I know what I&#x27;m talking about!!!!!</li>
            <li> Seems that it provides the necessary moisture I was seeking for my entire face</li>
            <li> it is quite oily but good thing is it is all natural for skin to absorb so it doesn&#x27;t really leave a greasy film on your skin. it shines tho so I only use before bed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a while and it works really well! I love the feeling of it.</li>
            <li> Me and my wife like it, we always use it every day. It&#x27;s not oily, doesn&#x27;t have perfume smell, it&#x27;s absorbed so fast once applied to the skin, the skin surfave doesn&#x27;t look like wet, oily.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Very concentrated as mentioned. My skin looks and feels more hydrated.  I would purchase again In a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> Absolutely perfect!! I have dry, sensitive skin that is prone to cystic acne. And wrinkles. Very hard to find a moisturizer that will balance out all of my skin concerns. I read some reviews that people found this product to greasy to put under makeup. I have found that to be true, only if you use too much. I had no trouble as long I warmed it in my hands and used only a small amount. I have found this moisturizer really helped even out my skin, calm it down and it helped heal some acne. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I found this cream a bit heavy for my oily-to-combination skin. Sill recommend.</li>
            <li> very oily but not good for my combination skin made me break out. Might due better for people with dry skin</li>
            <li> I have (or should I say had) very oily skin prior to using this product.  I was hesitant to buy it because I was worried about how oily my skin was.  I think my skin was just angry with all the chemicals I&#x27;ve used in the past.  Since I switched to this cream and an organic chemical free cleanser, my skin is less greasy and I have had only 2 breakouts this month. My skin looks healthier and dare I say...dewey? Thanks for the great product!! I plan to buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> The best stuff out there. The only problem is that it&#x27;s a little expensive to buy all the time but you pay for what you get and the price is right for the product</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. I didn&#x27;t like the texture or the smell. Not for me! I was a little nervous putting it on my face. I only used it two or three times then put in a drawer somewhere. It smelled a little old, maybe I just got an old one.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel.  My skin looks great!</li>
            <li> Amazing moisturizer and helps replenish skin and clear breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have used this for 2 weeks and the daily moisturizer for a month and my skin has really improved (wrinkles/dryness).  Love this product and plan on continuing to use it.  Thanks Bee Friendly!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer, I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I think I have tried every product out there, and I am so glad I found this product. Not only do I love how it makes my skin look, I love the short list of ingredients! It&#x27;s perfect to apply at night and I also use each morning before applying my makeup. Please do not ever stop making this product!!</li>
            <li> The best ever ,i love it !</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer in my opinion. Use nightly.</li>
            <li> I am finding a replacement for my wonderful but expensive Shiseido Bio. BeeFriendly so far is working just as good!  I have been using for almost a month &amp; very pleased. I am 33, my skin is combo. This is a great moisturizer.  However, I use only during nighttime. It might be too greasy for daytime but it&#x27;s super overall. I am definitely looking forward to use &amp; buying more in the near future. Oh, BeeFriendly customer service is awesome! PLEASE DON&#x27;T STOP MAKING IT...!</li>
            <li> Too heavy. Smells great.  2.5 stars</li>
            <li> Love this cream, it feels wonderfully moisturizing and healthy on my skin.</li>
            <li> I wash my face in the morning and keep this Bee Friendly face and eye moisturizer in the refrigerator. I have been using it on my face, under eye, neck, and décolleté area. Using it once in the morning makes my face feel hydrated all day. It has a very neutral smell. It has no perfume or sweet smell. I have oily skin in the t-zone and patchy dry areas that usually get flaky. I have found this cream to take care of that with only one application in the morning. I&#x27;m very satisfied since this is my second time trying out an 100% organic/natural moisturizer that works way more consistently for an 8-hour day as opposed to some $100 moisturizers I&#x27;ve bought in the past. It&#x27;s worth it and my skin doesn&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
            <li> Great product.  It really great moisturizer.  You might need to stir it when you get it, and it works wonderfully under the eyes as well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!!!! This product makes my skin look incredible!!! I don&#x27;t necessarily like the smell, but I love the results so I don&#x27;t care too much. It&#x27;s a little greasy so a little goes a long way, but my skin loves this product!!!</li>
            <li> I have used it for a week now, and I love it. The consistency and olive-oil scent are amazing.</li>
            <li> This is so rediculously greasy I couldn&#x27;t use it. Day time wear is out of the question. You can&#x27;t wear makeup over the cream. Nighttime was no better. I ended up using my washcloth to wipe off some of the cream so it wouldn&#x27;t make a mess on my pillow. It went in the trash.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I have tried so many face creams, like at least 30. This is the only face cream I have gotten fast results with and no break outs from. I seriously saw a little difference the next day and a good difference a week later. Then my husband noticed a few weeks after I had been using it. He said my skin had a glow to it and looked so much better and this was completely bare skin! The product is oily like other reviews have said, but that isn&#x27;t a problem for me. I find applying it when my face is still a little wet out of the shower that it absorbs better, so it&#x27;s less oily. Also when oil has settled to the top of the container just shake it and it mixes back perfectly.</li>
            <li> I just love this stuff!!  wish it came in a larger container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only hassle is that you have to mix it once in a while!</li>
            <li> Excellent product!!!!! absolutely love it!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE!!! This is the best moisturizer! It makes my face feel so hydrated and soooo soft! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Try the night cream too!!! BeeFriendly LOVEEEEE!</li>
            <li> When I recieved this product ,I could not use straight away as I had an allergic reaction to another foundation product .which made my face lobster red and swollen and had to go to the doctors.Well let me tell you I have been using this product now for a few days and I like it redness going away and skin feels soft no reaction.Wish they made tinted moisturizer .So now I have ordered the night cream and clearing all my other creams out fed up with wasting money ,sticking to this .Try it you will like it.</li>
            <li> This cream is fantastic - took me a while to find a way to get this to wear well with my foundation powder. I mix my foundation powder with the cream into a smooth paste, and then I dot it all over my face and blend it out. It wear very well, keeps my skin hydrated throughout the day. Also, if I have any breakouts, I wash my face and pat dry, then I apply this cream generously on my face and go to sleep. The next morning, the tiny breakouts are gone and the bigger bumps are reduced significantly in size. I&#x27;m very happy with this cream and will definitely repurchase. Thank you Bee Friendly Skincare!</li>
            <li> This product feels amazing! I&#x27;ve only used it for about a week but did not want to wait to long to leave some feedback. I can clearly feel that my skin is hydrated and a lot smoother by the time I wake up. Overall satisfied with the purchase and quality of the product.</li>
            <li> I really love  my Beefriendly skincare ,how imoisturizes my under eye , it  removes the dryness of my face ! My second order is on its way...</li>
            <li> I bought this face cream and it was wonderful for the first 2-months. However, it turned RANCID and smells horrible now. I tried to return the product and Amazon.com stated it was TOO LATE. HORRIBLE product! Do NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing. I live in an extremely hot and dry desert climate. My skin is dry, yet prone to breakouts with other creams. I&#x27;ve used Bee Friendly for two weeks and see a huge difference in my complexion. And no breakouts! I use it after cleansing twice a day. Great results. Great under makeup. Highly recommend! Will order again.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes after reading many of the very positive reviews, but you&#x27;ve got to be kidding! This stuff does not absorb into the skin. It just stays on top...and looks and feels very greasy. I set it aside because I actually broke out from it; then I remembered I could return it with Amazon Prime. So it&#x27;s heading back to the bee farm.</li>
            <li> I have just received it and used only once. It feels and smells great, a rich cream for a very dry skin. I don&#x27;t like creams which absorbed right away, I really want to have some moisture on my face, and this cream fits the bill. Delivery was fine, everything as expected.&lt;br /&gt;The only remark I have is that the jar was not full enough but it maybe because of the big container (?). Other than that I really like this cream, it is truly the richest cream you can possible get for a dry (and mature) skin. Love it.</li>
            <li> Moisturizing, good for dry skin, but not much effects on fine lines as it claims.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift for my Mom and she loved it!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I got to review this. It feels great in my skin. I like to apply it after a warm shower. A little bit goes a long way, my skin soaks it up. I can&#x27;t wait to use it everyday and see how great the results are.</li>
            <li> I suffer from dermatitis and this cream is amazing!!! My skin looks amazing and deep lines are barely visible. The tone of my skin is also looking great! I use the night cream as well. Highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> too greasy for my combo skin.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite face moisturizer!! My face is smooth and looks much more even. Very happy I chose this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a love-hate relationship with facial moisturizers. I&#x27;ve tossed so much money down the drain looking for a product that will help with my acne scars. At first I was a bit skeptical about buying the BeeFriendly facial cream, then I gave in. To say the least, I absolutely love the cream. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks now and have noticed a huge difference on my skin. My skin is now softer and the acne scars are diminishing. I&#x27;m in love. I only wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey, but then again it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a good moisturizer but it is also very oily.  I typically have pretty dry skin (especially in the winter) and using this twice a day has kept my face soft and moisturized.  My skin can also be sensitive and this isn&#x27;t irritating at all.  It&#x27;s very important to massage it in though, or you will have a shiny face for quite awhile (plus it won&#x27;t moisturize quite as well).  I do like it a lot though as it definitely accomplishes it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> Great product . Makes my skin feel so soft but not greasy all day long. I will purchase this product again and think I have found the face moisturizer for me.</li>
            <li> Only moisturizer I use! Makes my skin feel so refreshed and soft. It is greasy but I don&#x27;t mind as I don&#x27;t use it when I&#x27;m going out. I was going to deduct a star because some bacterial growth developed in the jar when it was almost empty, but considering this doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh synthetic preservatives it didn&#x27;t surprise me (I had been using my fingers to apply). Just make sure to use a clean applicator stick or something(I use wood coffee stirrers) or this might happen to you! The product worked too well do deduct any points for something that was easily preventable.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is so rich and does a great job moisturizing my skin. I will definitely keep using it.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff! It does take awhile to absorb into the skin, but I apply it just before going to bed.A little does go a long way. It has made my skin amazingly soft. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know how it will affect my wrinkles, but I will continue to use it anyway. I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for about a month now and the results are truly beyond amazing. The ingredients list is what sold me. I have very dry, thin sensitive skin. My skin actually absorbs this cream like it is parched. It feels so luxurious. Unlike most other expensive creams I have tried, this one doesn&#x27;t make my skin greasy or oily. A little does go a long away, which is great if you consider how much you get for the price. I use it on the back of my hands, my face, neck and d&amp;eacute;colletage.  I am in the sun All the time. This product is Literally reversing the effects of sun damage. I&#x27;d post pictures if I knew how. It is truly amazing. The area between my breasts used to look wrinkly and unattractive, now it looks smoother and younger. I will continue to use this product and I will be buying their other products in the future. I am so glad I discovered Bee Friendly. You Have to try this.</li>
            <li> Too greasy, the product leaks out of the container and gets all over.</li>
            <li> I am over 50 and have very dry skin.  Some complain that this is oily, but that is just what I need.  I also really like that it does not irritate my eyes.  I often have problems with eye irritation with other products.</li>
            <li> Perfect for dry skin!</li>
            <li> The all natural ingredient list is great, but this moisturizer is quite oily on the face and eye area.</li>
            <li> It is okay.  Doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  I don&#x27;t find it greasy enough for the cold and dry air, we are having this winter.  It does have a different smell. Kind of mentholated. I don&#x27;t think I will buy again.  It is costly and I do have to use a lot.</li>
            <li> I love the way this feels on my face. Smells good too. I am not seeing decreased wrinkles but I still recommend for soft skin.</li>
            <li> When I first opened product, I was afraid it might be too heavy for my skin.  This proved not at all true.  I am loving the idea of having just one product for both face and eyes, and I am a big fan of anything that has honey in it for skin care.  After using this product for a couple of weeks, I continue to be very enthused over it, and am especially thrilled at the moisturizing effect it has on the small dry areas I get on my face every winter.  Will definitely continue using this product.</li>
            <li> Have experienced soothing results from your skin care product!  I thought I had written a previous review earlier!  Very moisturizing, non oily, works nicely under foundation and before bedtime!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I great cream for night wear.  Love how&#x27;s it made and what it is made with!  Use sparingly. Very rich. Once absorbed skin smooth.</li>
            <li> The best product for wrinkles around eyes and face. I&#x27;ve noticed the difference over time of using it. I put cream under the eye area and eyelids and sides of mouth. Apply to neck. I focus on any wrinkle areas.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is smooth textured and and appears less wrinkled and with a more youthful appearance.&lt;br /&gt;Great product! I am allergic to many skin products. This product did not cause any breakouts nor allergic reactions when I used it.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product both as a day cream and a night cream for my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer.  Skin feels soft and smooth and is not greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> great moisturizer leaves your skin very moisturize and it all natural</li>
            <li> Truly love this product. It is rich, blends directly into my skin - feels very much like Im nourishing my skin. And the absence of chemicals is palpable. This is my favorite skin cream ever. It does have a little bit of an olive oil odor...doesnt bother me, but prepared!</li>
            <li> Great for what dry michigan winters does to my skin!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only lotion that continues to keep my face moisturized over time. I have combination skin that gets fairly dry with some of the other treatments I use to control blemishes. This is the only lotion I&#x27;ve used that balances out the more drying products. I use it overtop of my other treatments at night and don&#x27;t wake up to dry flakey skin. Love!</li>
            <li> Even though I haven&#x27;t had a breakout in YEARS, I realized that &amp;#34;organic and natural&amp;#34; can still mean &amp;#34;clogs your pores and gives you the largest zit in history&amp;#34; :-)</li>
            <li> I waited until I have been using for several months before reviewing this product. It has a very nice, subtle scent, and is light in texture. When first applied, I thought that it would blend right into my skin, that was how thin and light it is. It does blend in but will leave the skin somewhat shiny (even a bit oily). I don&#x27;t mind though, I put it on at night before bed, and wake up the next morning with wonderfully soft skin. It even looks a bit brighter (even though this moisturizer does not have a lightening component). It is very gentle and does a great job moisturizing. I was afraid it would clog my pores since it was a bit oily when first applied but nope, it doesn&#x27;t. In fact, my face seems clearer since I&#x27;ve been using it. I usually apply this after applying my retinol or urea-based products because it seems help with the irritation from those harsh products. Definitely recommend. Great price too.</li>
            <li> I used the Best Face and Eye Moisturizer first on the tops of my hands to see how it felt and how long it would take to be absorbed. This is an amazing product. My hands were still soft hours later. I used it on my freshly washed face as instructed and love love love it! It doesn&#x27;t bother me at all that you may have to stir it up a bit if it separates. Rather have that than some chemical additive. I would definitely buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;As an added bonus, the customer service staff at BeeFriendly are top notch!!</li>
            <li> I really do like this cream. However, it does not soak in very fast, so I use it at night or mornings when I&#x27;m going to be home for the day. My makeup looks too shiny over it. The light honey scent is great. I do use it on my hands, because I&#x27;ve read that propolis can help fade age spots. I think I see them fading. I also used this on my friend&#x27;s cracked fingers he gets in the wintertime. It soothed his pain and helped considerably. I paid $40 for this jar, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again at a higher price.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It is truly the best moisturizer I have ever used. I have been searching for a product that encompasses all the benefits honey for 2 years now. I have finally found it!! Bee Friendly please don&#x27;t ever stop making it!!!</li>
            <li> I freakin love this stuff.  A little pricey but I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great for face use daily.</li>
            <li> The absolute best moisturizer! I&#x27;ve had good moisturizers in past years, but I&#x27;ve never experienced anything like using this product! My skin responded immediately and became much more soft and had a better clarity. I love it so much I bought the body moisturizer and serum. Outstanding products as well. The serum is a bit rich for combination skin so I gave it to my mother who has dry skin. She&#x27;s crazy about it. It leaves skin with a healthy glow. I will not be looking further for skin care. I&#x27;m 100% sold!</li>
            <li> I finally have found a moisturizer that truly works! It is so silky smooth and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It is very smooth. A little oily but feels good. you only need a tiny amount.  It has a green tint, and smells nice.  I like it so far.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this cream consistently, because it goes on a bit heavy, and I like light creams that soak faster into the skin.  It&#x27;s definitely a night cream.  However, it does seem to soak in after about 10 minutes, and I like that the ingredients are all natural. Plus, I&#x27;m a great believer in bee products - they have amazing healing properties.  I may update this review after continued use.</li>
            <li> Reviews are spot on. One week in and my skin is visibly looking younger.</li>
            <li> This cream is awesome! It has made my skin so soft and works beautifully under my eyes to lessen fine lines. I&#x27;m very happy with it and the great customer service.</li>
            <li> I love the natural feel of this lotion without any harsh chemicals or artificial smells. It goes down very smooth and absorbs quickly, and I have noticed an overall healthier glow of the skin. Don&#x27;t expect it to get rid of your wrinkles overnight, but I definitely see the smoothening affect after a month of use.</li>
            <li> I really like this product as my skin is extremely dry in this country (UK) and the lotion is very creamy and really moisturizes my skin. It is oily so I only wear it at night and a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer. Deep penetrating. A little goes a long way. Great scent and organic.</li>
            <li> These are working very well for me. My forehead has psoriasis and this seems to soothe it. I am quite pleased so far.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I love how rich and creamy it is and how well it moisturizers my skin.  I love that it is organic also.  I highly recommend this to anyone.  I will definitely be looking at the rest of their product line.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I have been looking for a natural moisturizer and after trying many&lt;br /&gt;this is the best so far! I use it on my hands also since I am always washing&lt;br /&gt;dogs in my business &amp; my skin gets very dry. Great stuff, can&#x27;t wait to try their other products!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a week now and am very pleased. I keep toothpick next to the jar and stir it up every couple of days. This makes sure no separation occurs, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any so far. After you stir the cream with the toothpick, you can then use what&#x27;s on the toothpick to spread on your face. It works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice now that my skin stays moist all day long. I also use it at night, although I&#x27;m not sure that I need to; there is plenty of cream and it will last you for a long time. What everyone says about a little going a long way is true. I would recommend this to anyone, and that&#x27;s why I have given it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Instead of trying some other site products,  try this stuff. It works very well. Read the instructions and follow them to happiness.</li>
            <li> Great product, a little bit goes long way,it leaves my skin really soft and smooth, I love it and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> A little creasy, but skin feels good.  Cannot wear during the day, but a nice night cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman in my late fifties with very sensitive skin and eyes.  I have great difficulty finding a moisturizer to use around my eyes that doesn&#x27;t cause itching, irritation, redness and swelling.&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer is fantastic for me!  I love how it keeps the skin around my eyes moist and supple without any irritation at all.  My skin feels nourished, not irritated and inflamed.  I love the fragrance, too!&lt;br /&gt;I really appreciate a product that has so many natural, healthy, wholesome ingredients.  No doubt that&#x27;s why this moisturizer works so well for me!</li>
            <li> Feels like heaven on your face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 53 and need help with hydration and puffiness.  This definitely did nothing for my the dryness, bags or fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> It feels wonderful going on, but unfortunately, caused some breakouts.</li>
            <li> This feels so good on my face and under the eye area...just gently dab as a little goes a long way....no after greasy feel and my face feels great.  I absolutely love Bee Friendly Skincare products.  I&#x27;m planning on buying the mask for after shaving.  I&#x27;m a big fan of the honey bee and so should you.  Buy this product and bliss out on how good it feels.</li>
            <li> Great seller - awesome product</li>
            <li> For years I have used expensive department store eye creams was happy with the results but not the price. I was searching Amazon and found this all natural eye cream at 1/2 the cost of the one I was using.  I have had it for a few weeks and could not be happier.  I think this product works better them my high priced department store cream.  I will be reordering.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing! Great for parched, dry skin. I have been using it on my face, neck and hands. I&#x27;m a nurse and I can tell a huge difference in my hands using this product with/without cotton gloves at night. When I first ordered the product, I was afraid the honey scent would be overpowering but it&#x27;s not. Scent is light, pleasant and disappears quickly. Ordering my second jar today!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just an update: Still love this formula but it did start to get some mold (?) around the edges at the top  (very small amount) when I stopped using it in the summer.  I placed it in the fridge for  the rest of the summer and there was no more growth. Now using the bottle for the winter and it has been fine, but keeping it in the fridge. Remember this is truly and all natural product without all the chemicals. I had no problems with the first bottle because I used it within 3 months of purchase. This other one was sitting around for 7 months.</li>
            <li> I found this Best Face and Eye Moisturer 100 o/o Natural bee cream on AMZ Trader Review on Amazon  a few days back! had to get it. I also have Amazon Prime so I got it FREE!! this is great stuff and I am looking forward to the changes!&lt;br /&gt;Everyone should try this and Amazon PRIME!!! ITs more than just free 2 day shipping people. it&#x27;s AMAZING deals on Amazing products!</li>
            <li> absolutely love it!! even in summer it is not greasy - I have normal skin!</li>
            <li> This is my third time ordering!!&lt;br /&gt;I really like this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin. You know, the kind that is constantly peeling and molting. I question if my real father is a lizard. With that being said, I have to use an intense moisturizer to keep my skin balanced and hydrated. This one is very good. It&#x27;s a thick product, but you only need a little bit to see results. Honestly, after applying it to my face, I see immediate results. My skin soaks it up quickly, and I&#x27;m left with a nice glow. I almost look human. I probably use more than the normal person needs, but if you have dry skin, this moisturizer is a great option.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I&#x27;ve been using it a few weeks, and my skin feels amazing.  I think it&#x27;s helped with wrinkles &amp; lines, too.</li>
            <li> amazing product. ive only used it for 4 days and i notice a difference already. without a doubt the best moisturizer ive used without causing breakouts. i dont want any chemicials on my face!  plan on trying the other products by bee friendly.was looking for a cleanser --- but didnt see one.&lt;br /&gt;you wont be sorry if you buy this product!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this seems to help quite a bit!  I have been keeping it in the fridge because I live in Phoenix so I have not noticed any separation - I have seen a lot of remarks that it smells bad - I think it&#x27;s super light and smells good!</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot of money on moisturizers but this one is the best and is a lot cheaper.  I had dry patches and this product has taken them away.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> This cream left my face very moisturized. I only have to use it about once a week to keep my face moisturized.</li>
            <li> nice and light on the face</li>
            <li> A friend told me that my skin looks radiant and asked me what I have been using.  I like the way this makes my skin look and feel.  It is a great price, too!</li>
            <li> Love this cream. It&#x27;s lightweight yet is very moisturizing. Pretty much odorless too for those who might be concerned about that.</li>
            <li> This is the best face lotion I have ever used. I am currently pregnant and have been looking for something organic.  I have very dry skin, prone to breakouts around my chin area.  I was worried from the reviews that it would be too greasy and cause more breakouts.  For me, it has not.  For the first time ever my skin feels perfectly moisturized. As far as the reviews saying it smells bad, it doesn&#x27;t.  It does have a natural smell to it, but there is not a strong odor to it at all.  And lastly to address the &amp;#34;cheap packaging&amp;#34;comments, if you buy products based on packaging, then this is not your product.  I care more about what is inside than the look of the package, but that is just me :)</li>
            <li> Just ok.  Will stick with name brand.</li>
            <li> Skin feels really smooth. You only need a small amount and it arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> Nice product, I actually see improvement in my skin. It&#x27;s not &amp;#34;magical&amp;#34; like others have written, but it has a great texture and does appear to have helped with some of my neck droppines! I&#x27;ll buy more products from this seller. Way better than some really expensive creams I&#x27;ve purchased. Mix well when you get it...I didn&#x27;t so I thought the cream was too thick for a few days. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Wow this stuff is amazing. I wanted to wait and see how it would do after two weeks and honestly after the first night I could see a difference in my face. Before I used this, my nose was peeling from it being dry. One night of use and my nose was not peeling and none of my skin has dry patches like it usually does. The skin around my eyes is usually really dry due to my make up and this has improved that greatly. Anytime I don&#x27;t use this product at night I can tell since I wake up with my skin being too dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with the other reviews that you only need a little bit of this on your face for it to work. I use small dabs all over my face.</li>
            <li> Fast results and love the smell and feeling!</li>
            <li> seem like a good product</li>
            <li> I love this product and I love this company. A product I was using formerly stopped producing the formula I like, so I decided to try Best Face. I am extremely satisfied and love the feel and results of this moisturizer. BTW I have extremely sensitive skin, and have been delighted with the results from Bee Friendly.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife, best cream she has ever used, she loves it. Says it makes her skin feel fantastic.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I have been using it for a week so far, and I already notice that my skin looks better!! Love it!</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, yet once in the morning and the usual dry areas around my eyes remain moisturized all day.  There is no dominant smell, and if you notice an oily surface layer, just shake the bottle.  I love using this cream, and am now looking for a similar hand cream from Bee Friendly Skincare.</li>
            <li> Feels great, doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts and lasts a while.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. I have made my own homemade lotion/moisturizer before but its a bit of a pain to make. I&#x27;m really happy I found this because its basically the same as my homemade stuff. Yes it is a little oily, but that is because it is made out of olive OIL, honey, essential OILS and other natural ingredients. It does go a long way with just a little. Has a very light fragrance that is hard to explain.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a night cream and you don&#x27;t have to use much!  After 1-2 nights I felt an immediate softness to my skin that I haven&#x27;t had I a very long time!  I highly recommend this cream and will buy nothing else from now on!  It has reduced the lines in my face in just a few applications!  I will never change!</li>
            <li> I have only used it twice and I can already tell it&#x27;s going to be a keeper!  I don&#x27;t find it greasy at all, but I also only use a very little bit and that&#x27;s truly all that&#x27;s needed!</li>
            <li> This rich and gentle moisturizer is my absolute favorite. Perfect for dry skin day and night, works as a night cream for other skin types. Absorbs quickly and smells great.</li>
            <li> I love how this moisturizer is made from all natural ingredients and I appreciate the honesty of the seller mentioning that about 85% of the ingredients used are organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this anti-aging moisturizer is refreshingly different from many of the anti-aging moisturizers that are currently out there. It applies smoothly onto your skin and is light and delicate enough that you can apply it to the most sensitive and most delicate parts of your skin, such as under the eyes, eyelids, etc. It seeps into your skin and gives it a nice radiant glow. The scent is a little odd, but it is light enough to ignore. The formula itself may not be for people with oily skin as you are essentially adding more oils onto your skin. However, this is great for people with dry or normal skin conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing stopping me from giving this full five stars is because the moisturizer makes your skin a little too shiny. Because of this, I only use this moisturizer at night. Although most of it is absorbed to condition your skin, there is still a layer of oil that ends up being rubbed onto my pillow during sleep. I can see the oil residues on my pillow the next time when I unconsciously rub my face into my pillow. I am also not a fan of the container format. I prefer a squeeze or pump bottle over a lid container due to hygienic reasons. I hope BeeFriendly Skincare comes out with an alternative container bottle in the future!</li>
            <li> A really nice moisturizer.  Very rich and silky. No sickening scents added. Pure and perfect for my mature dry skin.</li>
            <li> Applause for its natural ingredients, and customer service, which has been reaching out to make sure everything&#x27;s alright, showing that they really care. But wouldn&#x27;t use it as a summer cream for my combination skin as it feels a bit on the oily side. But it&#x27;s pretty good for the winter.</li>
            <li> This Cream is amazing. Yes it is a bit oily but that&#x27;s because it has Olive Oil! It&#x27;s great to use and night and it has worked wonders for my skin. I was getting dry patches cause of the harsh cold outside in NYC and needed a natural good moisturizer. It also has helped reduce the redness whenever I get a pimple or break out during that time.  For those with acne it&#x27;s actually better to use an oil on your face at night so your skin doesn&#x27;t need to produce natural oils on its own which makes your skin actually break out more. I am a happy customer!</li>
            <li> a great moisturizer.  it is kind of whipped, i stirred it because the products start to seperate from each other and the product kind of lost its volume. it still does its job though.</li>
            <li> I was kind of worried about this having an extra virgin olive oil base, as I tend to break out easily. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple days, but so far my worries seem to be unfounded. My only complaint is that it leaves a light layer of oil on my face after a very light application. This layer tends to fade about half way through the day though.</li>
            <li> I was for 2 weeks on the beach and my skin looks perfect</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandmother for mother&#x27;s day. She has sensitive and sun damaged skin. She also loves organic products! This product was delivered In only 3 days.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many moisturizers through the years, some very expensive, and they all irritate my sensitive skin leaving my face still feeling dry or burning.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks now and started noticing a difference in my skin within a few uses.  This cream works great, very light, and it absorbs quickly.  I do not like chemicals on my face.  Facial skin is the most important part of me and I am willing to use good product to protect it. This is a great product; it moisturizers without being greasy. A little goes a long way, but don&#x27;t worry if you use a bit too much because the excess is quickly absorbed.  It goes on light and gives my skin a fresh, almost dewy look.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Wonderfully formulated cream.  The scent, which is very light before vanishing is more reminiscent of &amp;#34;garden&amp;#34; to me, quite pleasant.  I&#x27;ve been searching for a less expensive replacement for a german night cream that I used 24/7 365 because I also like a bit of oil, just not too much.  Shaking the jar before use works very well.  Another thought is refrigerating to keep olive oil blended.  For me, I ended up using Best Face Night Cream which is now my new adaptable 24/7 365 cream with a very silky feel and yes, has no separation issue.  My skin has looked really smooth having used this day and night only for 2 days so far.&lt;br /&gt;I lost a good bit of weight now back to my high school weight, but at my age my face has wrinkled suddenly because of that and Best Face is showing a very positive improvement even at this early point of use those (new) nasty cheek and mouth lines are smoother and softer, instead of nasty grooves!  Also, I can still feel this cream in the morning which is saying a lot.&lt;br /&gt;BeeFriendly actually sent me this to try out (2 days ship!) and I am so pleased and grateful to them...best customer service ever.  Next I plan to try the serum as well.  What an amazing company and good people running it.  Thank you BeeFriendly!</li>
            <li> So far I like it! A little oily, but skin feels good. I wonder how my skin will feel like in a couple months.</li>
            <li> This cream is the best emollient I have ever used on my face and neck.  It does not leave a super greasy clogging feeling, but moisturizes all day.  The fragrance is subtle citrus and very pleasing.  It really does rejuvenate and reduce wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I really like this face cream.  not greasy at all.very good deal.  I like that it is mostly organic but dont like being told how long a review to write, js.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer for the eyes and the dry skin areas of your face. For my over 50 skin, it works great. For my under 30 daughter though, it caused her oily skin to break out in the &amp;#34;t-zone&amp;#34; oily areas. She continues to use it on the dry areas under her eyes. Nothing works miracles on wrinkles, but this helps to keep my face moisturized and protected against the elements.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after a disastrous reaction to a moisturizer containing retinol.  I love this moisturizer.  I have oily skin, so use it sparingly, but it makes my face, neck and chest so soft.  It is not oily by the end of the day, either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of different eye creams looking for one that would actually eliminate puffiness. My eyes have been so baggy some days that I didn&#x27;t want to go out in public and some of the very expensive eye creams I tried just made it worse. I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much when I bought Bee Friendly but I was pleasantly surprised the very first time I used it. My eyelids are lifted. They look better than they have in years.  I&amp;#34;m happy with my results and I would recommend it to anyone who has a problem with droopy lids or dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this wonderful moisturizer for 3 weeks and it has been so good for my skin. Previously, my face always felt dry after a few hours and since I already had makeup on at that point I could not add more moisturizer so I ended up with dry skin most of the day. That is not the case any longer and I have incredibly soft skin that looks smooth and feels great. Yay!</li>
            <li> Love this cream!  Was just looking for something to make my skin feel moisturized and did the job.</li>
            <li> I received this over a week ago, and was really surprised that it did not cause me any redness or allergic reaction like a lot of skincare products do. It feels great on the skin and leaves my face clear, bright and moisturized the next morning. If you have oily skin you probably need only a small amount.&lt;br /&gt; I am looking forward to using this in the winter as well, it will be great for my dry skin. Really happy with this product!! :)</li>
            <li> Wow!  It really does work immediately!  I am 64, live in Fl., and have the average dry wrinkled skin for my age.  This day cream has performed a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; on the overall texture of my face.  My face is definitely more hydrated, my makeup goes on smoother, my skin feels VERY soft, and smooth, and it looks healthier.  My husband even noticed.  I am excited about trying the night cream, although I&#x27;m not even sure why I need it now!  I havent noticed wrinkles disappearing before my very eyes yet, but I have only used it three days.  What I have noticed is worth shouting about!  I highly recommend this product for anyone my age.  My hands are significantly improved also!  I keep touching them in disbelief!  By the way, I should add here that I have tried many different products, ranging in price from $3.00 to $300.00 per jar/tube.  This beats them All!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!!!! Using it has helped the dry patches on my face to go away.  I use it morning and at night.  Love this stuff and roils not hesitate on purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> You can just feel the quality in this cream as soon as you put it on your skin. It moisturizes really well. My only criticism is that the base oil they use to formulate it is olive oil. Olive oil tends to be very heavy so it does sit on the skin for awhile before it sinks in. The great thing though is that this cream is completely natural. There&#x27;s only a few ingredients in it. I don&#x27;t even think there is a chemical preservative. They say it should be used up within 6 months and stored at room temp. I won&#x27;t have a problem with that!</li>
            <li> Love ittttttttt a lot</li>
            <li> It can go on a little heavy if you are not careful.  I generally use this at night though, so I apply it a little heavy because it makes my skin feel great the next morning.  Also works wonders overnight on really dry hands.  I haven&#x27;t tried to use it during the day under makeup so I can&#x27;t tell you how well that works.  I love that it is all natural and how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much. Still needed to use all of my normal skin care, no need to add one more thing with no additional benefits.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer. It is better than the more expensive creams I have used. Two days after tring it I ordered a second jar so that I would not have to go without.  I love the natural glow that remains after it has soaked into the skin. The glow is still there the next morning. My sister tried it and loved it so much that I shipped a jar to her for her birthday.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I wanted for my dry winter skin.  It has the consistency and color of whipped avocado.  It doesn&#x27;t completely absorb right away but that&#x27;s fine with me. It&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE MOSTLY ORGANIC INGREDIENTS AND I NOTICED A DIFFERENCE IN TWO DAYS OF MY FINE LINES AND WRINKLES.  ITS A SLIGHT DIF BUT TO SEE IT IN TWO DAYS I;M EXCITED TO KEEP USING IT AND SEE HOW MUCH OF A DIF IT WILL MAKE.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer feels great on the skin. A little bit goes a long ways though - not much is needed. I&#x27;ve found the best time to use it is with a clean face at night--especially on dryer spots on my face. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Very nice moisturizer. Must use very little for it is highly concentrated. The company asked me to test this product and gave me a substantial discount to do so. When I run out I will probably purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful in every way. I love that I can use it around my eyes, with no irritation, and on my face and neck for exceptional moisturizing. Two products in one...and it does both exceptionally well. So worth the money!</li>
            <li> I so love this product!!!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my skin after a couple of days of using the product. My skin felt like a baby, &amp; I am a customer for life. Please don&#x27;t stop selling this product as my skin appreciate it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week and I can already tell a difference. I&#x27;m 38 and a few small &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34; around my eyes. I also have hereditary puffiness. I can tell some improvement in both areas.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that really does what it says it&#x27;s going to do. I will definitely be re-ordering it!</li>
            <li> It was out of my expectation. I was thinking about why it has such high rate. After one week&#x27;s use, it deserves the 5 stars rate. My skin soft and the light wrinkle of my eyes are reduced a lot. I will re-order.Thank you. By the way, I am 34 years old and I hadn&#x27;t used any skin protection except my baby&#x27;s lotion for over 1.5 years. Coz I am a breast feeding mom now.</li>
            <li> I tried this because it was marked down so much and I was looking for a new moisturizer that would help combate extremely flaky skin. With my usual moisturizer, after I would wash my face, apply toner, then moisturizer, then makeup, my skin (especially my forehead and upper cheeks) would flake up and I would have to apply more lotion, and then more makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this, I have followed my usual routine and it has improved the dryness drastically.  I only have minimal dryness now, and it doesn&#x27;t over saturate my oilyer areas. A little goes a long way so I can see this will last me a long time. I am considering ordering again so that I have a stock; while it is on sale.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have a review at this time as I just start using this product.  I like the way it absorbs into my skin and not greasy.</li>
            <li> After looking around for a good anti-aging cream, I decided to purchased this product mainly because it was organic and had olive oil in it but after I got it, I was actually surprised at how well it worked! I know a lot of these products have pie in the sky claims and I try to do my best to read through the lines and expect some of the hype to be that, just hype, but have to say after I put this on my skin, I immediately saw a difference, and now after 4 days of use I can happily say I am sold and will be re-ordering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I want to talk about the sellers honesty in the product labeling. I know there are no product labeling standards in most cosmetic products and the manufacture can put whatever they want on the label. Meaning, these guys &amp;#34;could&amp;#34; of put 100% organic, (like most do in this and other industries) but since not ALL of the ingredients could be honestly labeled as such, they were honest about it and put 87% organic on their label. Now there is something to be said for that and they now have a customer whom trusts them and will be buying other products in their line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and this cream smells delightful, goes on smooth and I even use on my hands. :-)</li>
            <li> I loved it!!! It is pretty good to my skin and lasts for a long time... Worth it!</li>
            <li> Bought this on Amazon after it was recommended by a friend, and gave it to my wife in her Christmas stocking along with a loofah body sponge and some bath oils and soaps. She absolutely loves! In her words: &amp;#34;I love the way it makes my skin feel and what it&#x27;s doing for my complexion.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy wife, happy life... I will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> I have hyper-sensitive skin where most fragrance free, natural moisturizers don&#x27;t work for me. I usually get a mildly burning sensation on my skin with most moisturizers. I loved Physician&#x27;s Formula Collagen Cream Concentrate but they&#x27;ve stopped making it. This one works pretty well. I need to give it more time but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found so far. I&#x27;d recommend trying it for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am not recommend this product to anyone , bad smell, greasy  and didn&#x27;t do anythings in my skin, waste my money!</li>
            <li> I love it, it soaks in well and it doesn&#x27;t have a over powering fragrance like some many products have.</li>
            <li> Great item. Only use a little. Initially it feels heavy then after 3-5 minutes it turns weightless and non greasy too</li>
            <li> I love it!! I ordered it a few weeks ago, received it in the mail a few days later, and I have used it everyday since!! I love the fact that truly a little bit goes a long way with this moisturizer. You don&#x27;t have to use much at all, and even in just the small amount needed, it leaves my skin feeling so soft!! The little trial size jar I ordered during the special offer is going to last a long while which is so nice because it is outrageous how much I spend on beauty products these days. The thought of not having to buy moisturizer for awhile is awesome, and it&#x27;s just an added bonus since I love this product!! I also love the fact that it is organic and all natural. I have been slowly transitioning over to organic beauty products after first switching over with my dietary needs, and I had not found a moisturizer yet that I really liked. I tried a few others, but I was not really impressed with any of them. I liked my Bee Friendly from the very first day I tried it!! I have also gotten some really great compliments on my skin since I have been using it as well which is amazing! I have always been told I have very pretty skin, but I have gotten some other compliments lately about my skin looking brighter and smoother, and it&#x27;s a great feeling!! I definitely will be ordering again!!</li>
            <li> This product works really well under my eyes; even when redness occurs under my eyes this product works wonders</li>
            <li> I think that this is really working. My lines are less noticeable and dark circles a little lighter. The only reason it&#x27;s not 4 stars is it is a little thick, and stays a little sticky. I live in a high desert area so this is not a major problem for me. I would recommend this to women or men. I am in my mid 60s and it works for me.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!!  At first I wasn&#x27;t sure, as it is a bit thicker that the one I currently use, but it sinks right in to your skin and leaves a beautiful glow.  I have noticed my skin looks smoother and more even toned.  I have very sensitive skin, and this did not irritate.  Thank you for this product at such a nice price.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin moist and soft.</li>
            <li> I like this line of products, I look forward to using this product during the long, cold, dry winters in NYC, it will be perfect. But being summer, I only can use this cream at nite, although it is on the greasy side, it is light, not heavy. I like the results so far. Very good quality.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I use the Bee Friend Skincare 100% All natural product, It words for me, I love it</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USE IT FOR 2 MONTH, DIDN&#x27;T SEE ANY IMPROVEMENT....BUT IT IS ALL NATURE. THAT IS WHAT I LIKE IT ABOUT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been loving this new face cream, which is super-moisturizing, yet doesn&#x27;t feel oily, It has a light, natural scent, which I appreciate, and a little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve used it as a night cream and under foundation during the day, and it works equally well for both uses. As the cold weather sets in, my skin tends to get dry, but so far, this cream keeps my face well hydrated. Great find!</li>
            <li> This cream smells good but it very oily. The oil doesn&#x27;t dry off. I bought it because of the excellent reviews and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> The Northern Nevada climate has been reaking havoc on my skin of late. Chapped cheeks and chin that prevent any makeup as it shows more. This stuff has been a miracle. I&#x27;ve been using it for three days and my skin is almost back to normal. It seems brighter too, will have to update in a few more weeks. I&#x27;ve tried everything, even drenching in various oils and no diy treatment holds a candle to this! It&#x27;s a sweet earthy smell- my husband even commented that my face smells good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update- I&#x27;ve been using this for a six weeks now and I am more than pleased. I had a stint of tiny clogged pores, almost like little white blemishes for weeks 2-5. I left them alone, used a gentle exfoliant and kept using the \\&quot;bee cream\\&quot; as I call it. My skin is now flawless. I truly think it was pulling out imperfections. I&#x27;m lazy, a once a day face washer and am floored by how smooth, moisturized, and youthful my skin looks and feels. I did have to mix the cream with a toothpick a few weeks back (the Northern Nevada warm fall changed to cold winter and it got a bit separated). A little does go a long way. I also use it in my lips a few times a week to treat and prevent chapped lips. Love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Age 35, skin sensitive to dry</li>
            <li> Love this product!  This over 60 years &amp;#34;young&amp;#34; woman saw and felt results after the first two nights!  Will re-order and will also try the Night Cream and Body Moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and works great!</li>
            <li> Best ever natural from heaven moisturizer i have used it....</li>
            <li> Extremely happy with this moisturizer. A small amount goes a long way in making my skin feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Ordered this stuff strictly from the reviews.  So far it seems pretty good.  Nothing great and nothing wrong with it.  Just make sure you use only a little because otherwise your face will look like you just came out of a sauna.</li>
            <li> I really am liking this skin cream.  I have been using it as a night cream.  I have dry, sensitive skin (exremely ssensitive around my eyes).  It is very mosturizing and non irritating.  A little goes a long way, nice not have to use a ton of product.  Leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients in this product. It makes my skin feel really soft and I have not had any break outs which I tend to get with most products.</li>
            <li> While I love the idea of a natural product, this one leaves my skin feeling and looking greasy.  Also, I took the container on an international flight and it is pretty messy.  Might be better to replace with a squeeze container.</li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t speak as much for the anti-wrinkle properties (although I *think* a few of my wrinkles have abated since starting this cream but I haven&#x27;t noticed an overwhelming turn-back-the-clock affect otherwise), I can honestly say that my bitchy, pimple-prone skin has been SUPER CLEAR since using this product. Nary a pimple to be found. Yes, the cream is a bit dense/heavy. And I have read other comments about the &#x27;oil slick&#x27; on top - here&#x27;s a hint -  just put the top back on and shake it up and it remixes quite wonderfully! I leave my face moist post-shower and then smooth it on and let it combine with the water droplets for maximum moisture. Now with that being said, it&#x27;s rather uncommon such a lubricating product would not normally make me break out, but THIS ONE DOESN&#x27;T. I have been enjoying clear skin for a long time now which is another benefit - you use it sparingly so one jar lasts and lasts. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, dry skin and have been in search of a face moisturizer that 1) does not have weird, unpronounceable/scary ingredients in it, and 2)  moisturizes my face enough so that it doesn&#x27;t feel dry a few minutes after I put it on, and 3) doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg (for my budget this costs only an arm).  My 10 year search is over.  A bonus to the above is that the cream has absolutely NO smell:  no fragrance or funky ingredient smell.  It will replace a more expensive cream that was natural and moisturized my face, but had an odor that recently became close to intolerable and which the manufacturer denied was there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream also absorbs right in, isn&#x27;t greasy at all.  I love it!</li>
            <li> excellent product, great if you suffer with dry skin and normal moisturizer just don&#x27;t do it no more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy that I found this product, I&#x27;m 43 years old and was looking for a good organic facial cream for a long time. This one is a keeper for sure! I put on my face every night and mornings my skin looks radiant. You don&#x27;t need to put a large amount on, just a small dime size will do. It moisturize my skin perfectly, and I really like the smell of it. Great cream, and a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li> Works great! A little oily but I use it at night. Very hydrating. Its definitely all natural products. Works well</li>
            <li> Very greasy. When I open the container in the morning there&#x27;s a puddle of &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; on top...very messy.  Does feel good on my face though.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift, and it was good for a night cream.  It not soak into my skin quickly, and with my rushed mornings, it left me running out the door with a shiny face, so I kept to using it before bed.  It moisturized well, and kept my skin looking refreshed in the morning.</li>
            <li> Its thick so use only a little, its not greasy and it smells nice.</li>
            <li> Not only did I receive said product earlier than expected! It was one of the best orders I&#x27;ve made! I purchased two one for my mother the other for myself! I couldn&#x27;t wait I was like a kid on Christmas! Tore open the package and put it on right away! I already knew a lil goes a long way! So I put just a few drops and rubbed it all over my face and neck! The feel of my skin afterwards was amazing! To know I&#x27;m putting good stuff not only on but in my body! My future is looking bright! We need to do all we can to protect these little miracle workers! Bees,bees,bees make so much possible and without our protection not only are we hurting them we r inevitably hurting our future for without them there will be no &amp;#34;us&amp;#34; anymore! This bottle will last a while remember a lil goes a long way! The smell is awesome and the texture devine! By the end of the day my skin looks just as good as when I walked out of the house that morning! The customer service blew me away! You don&#x27;t get that kind of service nowadays! There is still hope out there yet! I&#x27;m definitely a return customer for sure! Give it a try you will be happy you did!! Thanks again for making my day you rock!</li>
            <li> WOW, this is the most amazing cream!&lt;br /&gt;I am 55 years young, very fair and blond. I have lived in Florida most of my life so my skin has seen a lot of sun and with three boys (now men) we loved the beaches. I started taking ReJuvenate rice phytoceramides and saw a wonderful change in my skin. But because I&#x27;m a little dry I still need moisturizer under my makeup for work and all the creams I was trying (some very very expensive) looked great when I first put on in the AM but by noon my skin was again needing moisture. This Bee Friendly cream is the best moisturizer I have ever tried in my life! It feels like it&#x27;s actually feeding my skin all day long.  I come home from work at about 6:30 pm and my face look as great as I did when I left. My husband tells me how wonderful I look.( I always looks so dried out)&lt;br /&gt;I love love love this cream!!!</li>
            <li> Quality, moisturizing product -- from a company of caring people !</li>
            <li> I am 65 yrs old so naturally I have dry skin. I have been using a cosmetic olive oil on my skin for several years. It&#x27;s a really good moisturizer but pricy. I was reading about this product and the price point was very good so I ordered it. Did not think it would replace my olive oil but it has. I have only been using it a week and love it. If you don&#x27;t want the chemicals and just want to moisten your skin this is it. After its on it is totally absorbed and non greasy. No breakouts at all thus far. I like it and will keep on keeping on with it!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. Leaves a nice texture on the skin. Would highly recommend trying it. Especially great for the drier climates..</li>
            <li> I think it works great!  I have noticed that my skin looks smoother and younger. I will be 55.  For the price its a good deal!</li>
            <li> This product exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Feels great. I love that it has no alcohol in it. My skin is starting to look better. It may be an eye irritant though. I have to be careful when using it around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Love the way it made my skin feel didn&#x27;t help wrinklws</li>
            <li> This cream arrived a week ago, but it took me a week to test it out in order to leave a review. Came nicely packaged and sealed. Upon opening the seal, I was hit with a nice pleasant smell. Not an overwhelming purfume smell, just an organic, slight citrus-y smell that goes away after a couple minutes. Too much purfume smell gives me a headache so I was grateful this doesn&#x27;t smell anything like other face cream. I took off a star because of the feel of the cream after applying on my face the first time around, I didn&#x27;t know how much was needed so I put what I thought was just enough, but it came out a bit oily. Like others have said, a little goes a long way. Since I have oily combo and sensitive skin, I only put it on at night. My face does feel nice in the morning, it doesn&#x27;t have dry patches after I wash the cream off in the morning.</li>
            <li> I love this Face and Eye Moisturizer. It is very moisturizing. I have dry skin and this makes my face feel so good.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I love only needing one product for my face and knowing that there is nothing artificial in it!!  Amazing product!</li>
            <li> Love love love....&lt;br /&gt;Just melt in your skin&lt;br /&gt;It is not oily at all !!&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin/ acne and this product helps to calm my acne .&lt;br /&gt;Great buy ! I&#x27;ll definately recommend to my friends and family .</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Even in the winter when it&#x27;s hard to keep my skin from getting really dry, this stuff works like magic.  I&#x27;ll never buy another brand of face cream</li>
            <li> Very little does a lot.  It softens the face nicely.  It gets absorbed into the skin quickly and is not greasy.  It may appear greasy when it first goes on, but it quickly gets absorbed.</li>
            <li> Have tried so many name brand moisturizers, to me this is the best. My skin is dessert dry at 70yrs old. This one feels like butter going on at night, but is fully absorbed by morning.  Use a light hand in the A.M. as it can be shiny till sinks in.</li>
            <li> I have tried several face creams, lately, with very short lists of natural ingredients.  My favorite for many years, Rosa Mosqueta face cream from Aubrey, is no longer available.  I was truly heartbroken, and sadly needed to find something new.  I tried one recently that smelled of licorice and had a gritty texture; I didn&#x27;t love it, but used it anyway until I found something I liked better. Then I tried this one from BeeFriendly. It is particularly lovely.  Creamy, thick, and smooth.  And I love the smell of it.  You need only a little on your fingertips to cover face and neck, leaving both feeling luxuriously hydrated.  I use it for both day and night cream.  It goes on feeling slightly greasy, but absorbs well into the skin giving me an overall glow, which I like.  The price was a deterrent at first, but I think it will probably last me for months.  Overall, I believe this to be a good value for the money, and I haven&#x27;t yet found anything else I like nearly as well.</li>
            <li> What a nice face moisturizer.  Use it every day.  My skin is glowing.  Thank You.</li>
            <li> This was an easy purchase and I really like this moisturizer. It&#x27;s a little greasy at first but absorbs quickly. Just don&#x27;t use too much. A little goes a long way. My skin feels suple and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I love the texture and the nice aroma.  I was having dry spots on my chin and this has helped very much in clearing it up.  Thanks for the sample</li>
            <li> I love this cream. It works great on my skin. Usually creams breakout my skin, not this one. This moisturizer is very creamy and smooth.</li>
            <li> SO refreshing and moisturizing. Literally felt that over night my face was more calm and clear, and then after a few days the tone/redness of my skin had evened out. LOVE IT! I will definitely keep buying it.</li>
            <li> This is fabulous!! Very smooth and silky and makes your skin feel wonderful!! I would definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product a few times but I find it leaves a residual greasiness.  I&#x27;m not sure of its benefits over time but the greasy film left is annoying.  I had hoped it would have absorbed better, leaving your face feeling silky and smooth instead of greasy.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this stuff, She says this cream is different than others she has tried and she really likes it.</li>
            <li> Great find! So far, this cream meets all my expectations... and then some. It&#x27;s a terrific moisturizer under makeup and at night for my aging skin. The difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance is immediate. Love that it&#x27;s a natural product and non-irritating to my sensitive skin and eyes. If you&#x27;re wondering whether to buy, definitely give it a try.</li>
            <li> This cream has caused my face, neck and hands to break in to a blistery, itchy rash that took over a week to subside.  It took me a while to determine the cause.  I have never before had skin reactions to facial creams - this was a miserable experience!&lt;br /&gt;I will be tossing it into the trash, good riddance!</li>
            <li> Perfect moisturizer. I use it as a night cream for eyes, makes skin moisturised and soft</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product. The quality of the ingredients could not be any better. I have very sensitive and dry skin, and this product soothes and hydrates my face. It doesn&#x27;t feel tight and sore anymore. A very little goes a very long way...you only need to use a tiny bit. The jar will last a very long time. And I love supporting a small business that cares about the environment. I would love to try the whole line, especially the honey mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only negative is that the price is too high. It is definitely worth the sale price (in the $30s), but the full retail price is too much. I do believe that premium ingredients deserve a premium price. You do get what you pay for. But, it&#x27;s too high. I will be a customer for life if it stays at the sale price.</li>
            <li> This is the best face cream on the market!!  I have very sensitive skin that breaks out on occasion and at other times will be very dry and this is all due to the medication I take because of my Arthritis. I have tried almost every product on the market that says they are all natural or all organic and they work in the beginning and then my skin gets used to it and starts to break out.&lt;br /&gt;Bee Friendly skincare has totally changed my face. The Daytime face and eye cream is great and hydrates my skin all day and is not oily. I am also using the serum, and night cream. I have had no breakouts and my skin is very soft.&lt;br /&gt;I recently bought the mask and wow!! It made my skin feel so soft.&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the products is great as well and what I love the most is that all of their products are natural and organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Bee Friendly Skincare for helping me to love my skin again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful feel. Makes your skin nice and soft. Love the organic aspect. No harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and it was not irritated by this (many products do).  However I live in GA (it is currently summer), and i have found that even with the lightest of applications my skin feels &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; for quite some time.  I also have combination skin, so oil is constantly an issue.  However, I didn&#x27;t have a single pimple or blackhead while using this cream, which I would have expected.  I must admit I like rubbing the excess off on my elbows and other dry skin areas after applying this to my face and neck.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing moisturizer! It transformed  my dry dehydrated skin into soft dewy complexion within days of starting to use it. I love applying it &amp; how it makes my skin feel super soft &amp; hydrated.Ive tried many pricy dept store brands(pale in comparison) before finding this gem &amp; I will never go back! Bee Friendly is my new go to product that I won&#x27;t be without!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT !!! LOVE IT !!! LOVE IT !!! THE GREAT ALL IN ONE FOR ALL !!! SIMPLE AND AWESOME !!! THANK YOU !!!</li>
            <li> Ok so I read about this skin care product on Facebook and I quickly headed over to Amazon.com cause how good could it be if they&#x27;re nearly giving it away but I ordered  anyway and I am so glad I did cause I received my Bee Friendly Skincare Product just a few days later and wow makes my skin look and feel&lt;br /&gt;better than ever.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a facial moisturizer I would love for years and this is it! Light, natural scent (sweet but not sickly so), thick and rich, but sinks in quickly and deeply instead of lying on top of the skin...I am using it on neck and hands too! I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to report results on my fine lines, but I tend towards dryness and this is so lovely that I will use it even if I don&#x27;t see results with my fine lines. Thanks for a great product, I&#x27;m a bee-liever!</li>
            <li> For a natural product, this absorbs very well and is very light. I just started using it, so time will tell how well it works, but I am also using as more preventative rather than corrective work.</li>
            <li> best cream ever, it does not hurt my skin and my skin, it feels so good.&lt;br /&gt;i have used one name brand for a long time and now it is discontinued. so please keep making the cream,&lt;br /&gt;i love it.&lt;br /&gt;i am not a young woman but my skin sure feels like it.&lt;br /&gt;try it it really works, and the price is good.</li>
            <li> Hello i like it much&lt;br /&gt;After 1 weak i have orders</li>
            <li> This is actually a very good product. I had to wait a week before I could come to this decision, but after a good week&#x27;s worth of applying this moisturizer morning and night, I really think I&#x27;m seeing a smoothing-out of my skin. This stuff does feel very oily, but it does absorb into the skin and really softens your face. And it does not have any substances that can cause irritations like runny and stinging eyes. The ingredients will separate, but I just shake the jar and everything&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> This is a very good cream. Keeps skin Hydrated. You need just a little at a time.&lt;br /&gt;I need to give it more time for me to post results..What I love most is that it&#x27;s natural without chemicals.</li>
            <li> this is a great product It would be nice if it had a SPF . I will order it again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this with a promo code and LOVE it.  You only need a little and it goes a long way.  Its greasy at first when you put it on but it soaks in fast.  I love it as a night cream.  I will be buying more of it in the future for sure</li>
            <li> I have tried about half a dozen face creams and never really &amp;#34;clicked&amp;#34; with any of them until now. I gotta tell ya, this stuff is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a subtle sweet smell to it but not like the flowery girly face creams I steal from my wife. Heck, it even tastes good.. yes I tried it after reading that it is organic and noticing that I actually know what all the ingredients are (I am vary wary when I see strange chemical names on the ingredients of most face creams). With stuff like honey, vitamin E and olive oil you can&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon first use, it felt nice but nothing ground breaking...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, after a few days that is when the magic started... I have had a dry patch of skin under my right eye for years (yeah, YEARS) and nothing ever seemed to work but this Bee Friendly cream has wiped it out COMPLETELY in 4 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a busy dude, and to get me to write a review on Amazon really says something. The fact that I am taking time to review a face cream is practically a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars and 2 thumbs up to you, BeeFriendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a great product. I can see myself using this stuff for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Todd</li>
            <li> I like this cream, probably will buy it again.</li>
            <li> It made me break out. My skin is really sensitive, so if yours is sensitive too, I would not buy this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too oily. After using it, my face is lighting because of its oily</li>
            <li> I love this product because: 1-It&#x27;s all natural and 2-it does a great job of moisturizing my skin, and doesn&#x27;t cause that greasy feeling. I use it in the morning and before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> It is a good cream. I need to use it longer to see if my skin improves, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best anti wrinkle cream I have ever used! It&#x27;s so good I&#x27;m buying jars of it for my mom and a few friends.</li>
            <li> love the product.  like the idea of having a cream that takes care of everything, face, neck, and especially the eyes.  don&#x27;t like the smell too much but that is a minor issue.</li>
            <li> I love this cream! I use as a night moisturizer, because it is too oily for the day. I noticed my skin became more fresh in the morning when I started to use Bee friendly cream in the nights. Also the smell is so natural as all the  ingredients....</li>
            <li> Too oil and smell bad.And it needs shake to mix before use,which makes the cream keeps going out even covered and makes my desk oil!</li>
            <li> I am 72 years old and I have been searching for a face cream  for most of my life. Recently my complexion has changed dramatically. My pores are larger, aging spots, etc. I found this cream on Amazon and after reading most of the reviews decided to give yet one more face cream a try. It has been about two or so weeks now and so far I am seeing results!  My skin has improved a good 50%. My skin is much smoother and my pores seem to be a lot smaller. Also, the aging spots that were quite large and dark....are indeed fading. At this point I am very pleased.  It is true you only need a small amount.  I am very careful to clean my hands and sanitizing them as well before dipping my fingers into the jar by the way.  I will post another comment after finishing this first jar to let you know my final thoughts. So far so good for now and at this point I would suggest trying it to others. I might add I was not fond of the smell at first , but it grew on me as time went by.  If you are one who likes a perfume type smell in your face cream.......You might not like it.  But performance is key here and I am pleased.</li>
            <li> love this skin cream! My skin needs a very good moisturizer and this works perfectly. Also leave the skin with a little glow which is a bonus! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to use around my eyes because it says it is safe for around the eyes. I tried it all over my face the night I got it, and fell in love. I have since purchased more because my husband is in love with it as well. We use it everynight and our skin looks and feels really good! Customer service is out of this world. Not only did I receive the first order the very next day, but my additional orders arrived very quickly as well. One of the jars was cracked, and they told me today a replacement will be sent! I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Manufacturer claims this as &#x27;REJUVENATING AND ANTI-AGING MOISTURIZING CREAM&#x27; I don&#x27;t know about that part, I use this as a moisturizing face cream. The main difference from the previous product (complex 15) I&#x27;ve been using is this is mostly oil based formulation while the other one was water based. So if you are okay with oil based formulation, this is a 5 star product. At first, I didn&#x27;t like very much, after used for a week, I started to liking it. This product is made from mostly natural ingredients. You only need very little to cover a fairly large area, and the moisturizing effect lasts for for pretty long time. Overall it&#x27;s pretty good, does the job.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I have a drawer full of other organic and natural face creams.  This one by far is my favorite!  My skin has improved over only a couple weeks and is more moisturized.  No disgusting fragrance; just nice subtle smell of the ingredients (I hate fragrance).  It is soothing and mild enough that I can also use around my eyes.  This will go a long way because you only use a little amount.  Anyone complaining that it is greasy likely applied too much.  It quickly absorbs into the skin and is not greasy in my opinion.  No skin breakout or problems after a few weeks of twice daily use--skin actually improved. Since it is natural it will separate, so I do use a coffee stir stick every week or so to stir it but no big deal.  It just fluffs right up. I actually appreciate it doesn&#x27;t have additives and would rather stir occasionally.  I cannot say enough good about this product.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it a little bit goes a long way. Since it&#x27;s organic and looks so fresh, I store it in fridge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too oily. I used it for one month and didn&#x27;t see any changes in my skin.</li>
            <li> Great eye cream! I would endorse this product for sure!</li>
            <li> I love the way this product makes my skin feel!  You only need to use a very small amount.  The manufactures suggestion to start with a little so that your face can Absorb it does not just sit on the skin was very helpful.  I look forward to trying more products from this company!!</li>
            <li> my response to their email:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually returned the cream. The ingredients listed on Amazon, while correct, were not in the correct order. This is misleading to customers that understand how ingredient listings work. I.e., with the highest proportions listed first, then descending from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of this understanding, and the listing posted on Amazon, I expected a thick cream. What was in the container is a light-weight lotion. Not what I wanted. I gave it a chance anyway, for 3 days. In those three days my skin became quite dry, fine lines around my eyes becoming more apparent with the sustained TEWL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your concern. I do hope you rewrite your listing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melissa&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I read almost all the reviews. While I could not find these reviews listed elsewhere online, I did notice three or four phrases that popped up identically across at least 10 reviews. I do believe some of these are plants. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I believe that I&#x27;ve found my new favorite night cream. After auditioning many products, this cream seems to be the one. It is just a bit oily in texture but fine for night. A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I went crunchy months ago but could not find a homemade mixture I liked for my face. This stuff is wonderful. Love the way it feels and smells and my face feels fresh in the morning. Love that it has honey, which is so good for do many things.</li>
            <li> I love the natural ingredients. However it does not satisfy my crow&#x27;s feets around my eyes. It definitely moistens. Yet, for the price I have not seen the difference in a less expensive brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this product.... I can&#x27;t tell if it does all it promises, but I have two issues with it. 1. it is too oily, and it takes forever for this feeling to go off. I use it in in the morning and I need to wait couple of minutes before I can put makeup on. 2. it says that it good for the eyes as well, but if it accidentally get into your eyes (even hours later) it stings.</li>
            <li> This face Moisturizer is just lovely. It goes on nicely, it isn&#x27;t thick or sticky and I like the fact that it is 100 0/0 natural. I will certainly purchase this again, probably sooner than I planned as I think my daughter is using it too.</li>
            <li> Iam in love with this. Im 23 and i have extremely, very , very dry skin. And anything i tried would feel like it would only moisturize the top layer of my skin. But this amazingness goes deep, leaves my skin glowing and not dry and flaky. If you suffer from dry skin. This is your answer. It has a light scent to it wich smells amazzingggg! I have less acne ,Yay!!And its sooo good for your skin cuz its all organic.I just wanna stock up on this stuff so i can use it forever! so Anyways just buy it. cuz its awesomness!!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, good smell and feel when applied on face. My only complaint would be the excessive olive oil creates a very shiny, oily look in my T zone since I have a combination skin type. If you have similar skin type, be aware that this might only be a good choice for night cream.</li>
            <li> Goes on nice and smooth..not greasy.</li>
            <li> This is the best face &amp; moisturizer cream I have ever used.  If used daily it gives your skin a nice dewy glow and remains even after you&#x27;ve washed it off.  Also clears up complexion and leaves skin smooth.  It won&#x27;t get rid of wrinkles but it helps to fill them in so their not so pronounced.  I even use this on my lips instead of lip balm. Stays on better and no cracked lips.</li>
            <li> I love the way this cream feels on my skin. It has a light, sweet scent &amp; it helped to hydrate my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  My felt looked and felt great after using it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this cream.  The texture is smooth and the scent is pleasantly natural from the butters and oils.</li>
            <li> This is a great face cream went on smooth and made my face feel soft but I could see firming around those fine lines.I love this cream so much and will love to see more of their products.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I recently started using a Vitamin C serum to clear up wrinkles. It left my skin very dry. I put this on after and it feels amazing. I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, olive-oil-based moisturizer with good, natural ingredients in the plainest of containers.  It does not irritate my sensitive skin.  It leaves my skin shiny, so it&#x27;s better for night than for day.  I have dry skin and don&#x27;t find it to be exceptionally moisturizing, but it&#x27;s adequate.  The slight scent is of olive oil.  I don&#x27;t plan to buy it again soon because I need something more moisturizing for winter.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I have found for my very, very dry skin. I&#x27;m so happy that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> Amazing cream, one of the best natural creams I tried. I wish I only wish I have a really big jar of it. Loving it!</li>
            <li> I have cystic rosacea and have struggled for years - through prescription meds, high end face wash products, multiple dermatologists and what seems like hundreds of moisturizers....none of it helped even a LITTLE. And all of it cost serious cash.&lt;br /&gt;I am delighted with BeeFriendly organic Face &amp; Eye cream. My skin is not totally clear, but has improved so much that everyone I know has noticed. And living in Denver - dry, dry, dry climate - the BeeFriendly has a wonderful moisturizing effect. I slather it on before bed...it feels amazing. And in the morning I apply it more carefully and wear it under makeup with no problem. It comes out of the jar sort of thick and liquifies immediately on contact with your skin.  I wait about 5 minutes to allow it to absorb, and wipe off any excess before applying makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the fact that it works great as both a facial moisturizer AND a luxurious eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one caution...My 3 ShiTzu&#x27;s sleep on our bed, and now that I use BeeFriendly they wake me up when they try to lick my tasty face cream off my face!</li>
            <li> This is a good product, I use it a night time. Leaves my face soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I love anything with BEE products! My skin feels so soft and hydrated after using this. I like to use this in the evening as part of my nightly beauty routine, my skin feels soft and hydrated after using. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Now that I know not to try and use gobs of it (like we often have to with other creams) I am very happy!&lt;br /&gt;My husband of 33 years just said &amp;#34;keep doing what you are doing, you are absolutely glowing!&amp;#34; - who doesn&#x27;t love their husband look at them the way they used to decades ago....&lt;br /&gt;Love this cream, in fact - I have 2 now - may gift one, since I won&#x27;t use it up as fast as I thought I might.&lt;br /&gt;It was great to ask the seller questions and receive a personalized answer!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, but makes my skin very soft and very fine lines disappear. I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Face and Eye Cream By BeeFriendly as a night cream. It&#x27;s quite greasy but it&#x27;s what makes it quite nourishing I think. Very useful during winter months. I haven&#x27;t been using for long so I don&#x27;t know about the anti-aging and wrinkle properties yet, but I believe the ingredients are good and safe for the skin.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. I get compliments on my skin all the time. This is the first time I have written a review but I feel letting people know that Bee Friendly really does work is worth the effort.</li>
            <li> I really like this face cream.  It is a bit greasy so, for me, I would not be apt to use it during the day BUT I love using it as a night cream.  It stays greasy for a little bit but does absorb over time.  I would recommend to try it.  I love it is all natural and the scent is very subtle and nice.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve used, and I love that it&#x27;s for both face and eyes as am very lazy with these things</li>
            <li> I have been using Bee Organic Moisturizer for about 10 days now and have noticed that my skin is very hydrated and better withstanding the cold Chicago winter!  The moisturizer is very emolient - it could be too greasy for anyone prone to acne or with naturally oily skin.  I think it would be too heavy for summer, but has been great in my cold climate.  A very good value - a little moisturizer goes a long way.  While I haven&#x27;t seen any fine lines disappear yet, overall I am very happy with this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer feels great on my face. I put it on before bed and my skin feels refreshed in the morning.</li>
            <li> I love the clean ingredients and the smell and how it moisturizes. Unfortunately, it breaks me out quite a bit, so will be using my sample on my body as I am very dry, but cannot use on my face.</li>
            <li> This does seem to be a homemade product with good ingredients -- it smells and feels natural.  However, it was a bit of a shock to put it on my face initially -- it is an olive green color (not honey yellow as pictured) and second ingredient after water is olive oil, so had a heavy feel to it and left an oily sheen on my face.  Not for daytime use, apparently.  I might use as night cream in the winter, but for the warmer months, this would be overkill.  I did find a great use for it, however, as a hand cream.  My hands love it, so it is intensely moisturizing.  And a little goes a long way as other reviewers have said.</li>
            <li> Excellent creme. There is no strong smell but a very light scent. It glides on smoothly over the skin. I applied a very small amount because a tiny bit will go a long, long way. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so it&#x27;s early in the game to see real effects, however, I can say that while using it as a night cream that I wake up with super soft skin. Overall, I love it.</li>
            <li> This cream is wonderful.  Goes on nice and smooth and no oily feeling.  I will surly buy again.</li>
            <li> I really like it. Skin feels good.</li>
            <li> I had sun damage from years of being in the sun.  Wrinkles around my eyes, etc.  I have tried other products to lessen the appearance of these wrinkles, and none worked.  This product seems to work, even after only a few days.  Use it sparingly, since a little goes a long way.  If product appears to separate, just stir it with anything but your finger.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I didn&#x27;t have any of the problems mentioned in other reviews about oil collecting on the top. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too heavy, and has a wonderful scent. It is excellent if you have dry skin, and is very soothing. It caused no irritation with my dry sensitive skin. No burning, tingling or redness. This would be a fantastic cream to use during the winter months.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this cream. I am 72 years old and have been using it about a week. I can see the great results on the softening of lines and wrinkles by looking in the mirror. Works well for sensitive skin which I have and believe it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s free of all of the chemicals found in brand name products. Received product quickly and hope they never stop making it. I will be a dedicated user of this cream from now on.</li>
            <li> Great natural product! Love how it feels on my skin. Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> A little too greasy for me. I only purchased this because it was $5. Won&#x27;t purchase again</li>
            <li> After reading all of the positive reviews about this face cream, I decided to take a gamble and try it. I am so glad I did! First of all, I must have the most sensitive, acne-prone skin on the planet for an old lady in her 60&#x27;s. I have to be extremely careful when I put anything on my face because even those creams that are formulated for sensitive skin have been known to cause irritation and break-outs on me. Well, this cream hasn&#x27;t given me any problems, and it makes my face feel like velvet. It is not heavily perfumed, so if you&#x27;re allergic to fragrances you don&#x27;t need to worry about that. Even though it&#x27;s not cheap, a little goes a very long way. I expect the jar to last me quite a while, assuming I don&#x27;t bathe in it. Now that I think about it, that&#x27;s not a bad idea.... Anyway, the olive oil in it can separate a bit from the cream base, but I just stir it gently to reincorporate the ingredients and all is well. That&#x27;s a common occurrence for products that are all natural. This cream is worth every penny I spent on it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  My skin feels refreshed when I wake up and although it&#x27;s a tiny bit greasy, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it after being on your skin for a minute.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It adds a nice glow to the skin. Works well on the face. I use this in combination with my other organic products and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot just a little goes a long way so it&#x27;s lasting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks and I really like it! It really does make your skin feel so so soft and moisturized I just ordered the serum&lt;br /&gt;I will review it after I&#x27;ve used it a couple of weeks.... I also really like the fact that there is nothing but organic ingredients in it, I have lupus and try to eat organic and take whole food vitamins I feel what I put on my skin is just  as important as what goes in it...</li>
            <li> This is a good heavy moisturizer for dry skin.  Without the strong perfumed smells of other products. Bee Friendly has a faint organic smell that reminds you you&#x27;re doing something good for your skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream. It&#x27;s very moisturizing and I love that it&#x27;s all natural. I have very sensitive, acne prone skin, and this did not break me out. It&#x27;s a very thick cream so it&#x27;s probably not best for day use. I use it before I go to bed. I&#x27;m overall very happy with the product and I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I am completely in love with this face cream.  I searched high and low for a substitute when I found out that I cannot buy Astalift products outside of Asia.  Astalift was the best skin care range I had ever used.  I now think that this stuff might be even better, and it&#x27;s way cheaper.  I have been using it for 3 weeks now and my skin is positively radiant.  I hope this product isn&#x27;t going anywhere because I plan to use it for a long long time.</li>
            <li> I just turned 30 and noticed chronic dry skin around my eyes, so i bought this to try. it is extremely gentle, it does not sting my sensitive eye skin at all.  i don&#x27;t have wrinkles (yet) so i can&#x27;t speak to how to does with those, but I really like this product for dry skin. it is creamy and very gentle on dry skin, a great moisturizer without feeling heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> Too greasy. It is difficult to absord.</li>
            <li> Only used it twice but so far so good. Really helped with my dry face and not sticky at all.</li>
            <li> I originally started using Honey Girl Organics and fell in love with this very interesting formula.  My skin never looked and felt better. I actually felt like I was putting something very beneficial on my skin,  had no hesitation like with other chemically induced brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed a cheaper alternative,  so I ordered Bee Friendly face cream.  The ingredients are identical.&lt;br /&gt;When I received it,  I was slightly disappointed by how small it is. Though it&#x27;d be bigger.&lt;br /&gt;But, when I opened it,  there it was, a beautiful mellow yellow,  sweet smelling, delicate and luxurious to the touch creme. Applied it right away and waited for a skin reaction. Waiting..waiting..and..Nothing!&lt;br /&gt;Oddly enough, the &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; oil I was using prior would inflame my skin, and this creme put the fire out in a matter of seconds within the first application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st day,  very impressed.  The following morning,  my skin was flawless, dewy, and so soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I. Can&#x27;t. Stop. Putting. It. On... I&#x27;m addicted to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this creme, super product. Will definitely order again, or better yet, give it a whirl and try making my own lol</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first using this product since I have sensitive skin but after using it , my skin felt so relaxed and soft .</li>
            <li> I like the texture of this product, the fact that it&#x27;s all natural and that it can safely be applied to the eye area.  I thought the price for it was pretty good.  It gave me a nice dewey look.</li>
            <li> The cream is amazing. It is little greasy, but it works for wrinkles and smooth the skin just perfectly. My skin looks much better. I am definitely going to order it again. I tried different expensive product, but nothing worked as good as this moisturizer. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two and half weeks. It is definitely helping me survive a harsh winter. It&#x27;s rich and a bit oily, but that&#x27;s what is needed for the dryness in the air both indoors and out-doors. I find that it moisturizes for about 8 -10 hrs before I need to apply again. I just bought a second jar.</li>
            <li> So far, I love it. It&#x27;s luxurious. Nice scent, very smooth! Quickly shipped, nicely packaged!</li>
            <li> I am a licensed Sr. Aesthetician in Virginia. I have been using this cream for about a week.  The weather here is cold and blustery, and my skin has been taking the brunt of it.  The cream is thick and has a pleasant fragrance to it. The ingredients are 100% organic and there are no fillers or preservatives in this cream  The cream&#x27;s first ingredient is extra virgin olive oil, (when it arrives in the mail, you may have to stir it) so it can feel greasy.  But if you have dry, parched skin like I do at this time of year, it may be a salvation.  I have been using it with a 100% hyalauronic acid serum that I apply first and let sink into my skin, then I apply this cream.  There have been  two days when I have had to apply extra, especially when I had been outside, but the cream has helped my skin feel nourished.  I think when the weather starts to feel more like early springtime, I will only be using it twice a day.  It&#x27;s very nice.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully emollient, easily absorbed into the delicate areas of the face.  After just one application, my face feels absolutely nourished, and am confident I will order again, and again!... ;*)</li>
            <li> I am always looking for pure organic face products so was thrilled to find this great product.  It is certified organic product which is important to me.  Very concentrated so you don&#x27;t need to use much to be effective.  I&#x27;ll definitely be trying more of their products.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer I bought is amazing. It keeps my skin betrayed the entire day. It goes on smooth not greasy..but very rich at the same time.  It smells completely natural no chemical or fragrance.  I love it!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this cream and will be ordering it again, thank you!,</li>
            <li> Very rich, which I like since I am 50 and tend to have dry skin. My skin looks really good in the morning as I use it both day and night. I love the fact that it is more natural than other products. Overall, pretty happy. However I can see how this could be a bit heavy for you.</li>
            <li> This product will probably be great in the winter as it is very heavy and rich moisturizer. For use in the current temps. I find that if I mix it with aloe vera gel it will soak in faster and does not leave an oil slick on my face. But it is only for very dry skin as I would not bother with a product this heavy otherwise. It is very good, almost immediate difference in my skin, fragrance free etc. and one container should last a long time. It is a good deal for the money, if, like me, you can make it work for you.  After using this product for 2 months I must say it is incredible! I am 55 30 yr smoker(quit last year), I am a redhead with sun damage, dry, dry skin etc. The results of daily use have been great. My skin is firmer, and looks younger. I will be using this for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> Purchased this moisturizer a couple of weeks ago and have no complaints. It does take a bit to soak in well so I usually wait a little bit to hit the pillow at night. It does separate here and there but I just use the end of a makeup brush to stir it up, not a big deal to me at all. Pleasant scent, consistency is thick so a little goes a long way. I can see this jar lasting for a few months, easily, even with a nightly application. I can see myself purchasing this again or trying other products from this company in the future! I had to edit to add about the amazing customer service, I&#x27;ve received several emails just to see if I received the product and if I was liking it so far. Very impressive in this day and age, in my opinion!</li>
            <li> The BeeFriendly face and eye cream was a little oily and heavy. Used only a tiny bit but would prefer a lighter lotion.  No scent, which is good. I only used under my eyes - would not use on my whole face.</li>
            <li> By fare the best skin care product I have ever used.  In the past I have used some very expensive creams...hands down be friendly Wins!  The radiance glow it gives your skin is amazing.  It really moisturizing and soaks into skin very well.  At first it may appear a little glossy depending how much used.  I tried both...and to my surprise when I put .ake up on it did not make under eye concealer extremely smooth.  As well as, my BB cream and foundation.  It really has help with my troubled skin even with makeup. It looks amazing now and my friends have complimented.  Asking what I use.  I am a strong believer in this product.  Oh one more thing...if you go overboard and cake this on your hair can stick to it if you have hair.  Less is more.  A must try!</li>
            <li> Great product... felt great on my skin !  Not a strong scent.  Would purchase again !</li>
            <li> absolutely love it !!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I waited a few weeks to leave a review so I could have a good chance to rate this cream.  I LOVE IT!  I do only use it at night since it is a little heavier and I need the extra staying power while sleeping.  It goes on wonderfully smooth and has a nice scent.  I have noticed that my skin is already softer and the small wrinkles are less noticeable.  Just like they say, a little goes a looooong way so it is a good value too.  I will be reordering this for my daughters also.  Great product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and makes my skin so smooth, unfortunately I was allergic to it!</li>
            <li> Simple, no weird smells, amazing. The only moisterizer that can actually moisturize my dry skin well in Colorado without causing breakouts. Many many thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I read all these good reviews and thought this product was going to be great. But it is ABSOLUTELY NOT! The product is really greasy and does not get absorbed. And also, my skin is somehow more sensitive and there are acnes coming out. SO BE AWARE THOSE WHO MAY REACT TO BEE PRODUCTS!</li>
            <li> A little bit &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; or perhaps I&#x27;m using too much.  The product is a bit thick for my aging skin.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, but others might like it.</li>
            <li> I love how this cream has such a nice light scent (has a natural dried grass scent with a hint of honey) and goes on like butter! It just melts into your skin and leaves it feeling soft &amp; moisturized and &#x27;glowing&#x27;. I love that it&#x27;s so gentle you can pat it onto the delicate skin around your eyes! Really happy with it &amp; totally recommend it to people with sensitive skin wanting a natural &amp; eco-friendly product (it&#x27;s from Hawaii too!)&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;So here it is almost 2 years later and I remembered how much I&#x27;d like this natural and organic face &amp; eye cream. I&#x27;d tried many others along the way, but for some reason, I remembered this one and I thought I&#x27;d try getting more to see if it would help with some of my skin issues. Mostly, I just wanted to start going back to the more natural products (the ones with no chemicals in them), because I started having headaches and even a little irritation from some of the other products. Anyways when I got this, I guess I forgot about the gooey consistency and how kind of sticky it is. Plus, how you can see the ingredients separating when you first open &amp; take the lid off it. Like the instructions say, you should stir it before using it. I just put the top on tight and gently shake it a few times...actually it&#x27;s more like rotating in around in circles, if you know what I mean. It goes on very rich and a little goes a long way, but I still like the natural way it feels on my skin and how it makes my skin look and feel hydrated. It actually makes my skin look kind of oily at first, but later on or the next morning, it just looks nice and more youthful. The last time I bought this my daughter &#x27;took off with it&#x27;, but this one, I&#x27;m keeping for myself.</li>
            <li> there are so many creams out there but i must say i made a great choice....i have already noticed a difference since i started using this&lt;br /&gt;product...it&#x27;s nice that it is all natural...and has become part of my daily routine...so thanks for a great product !!!</li>
            <li> Love the face cream.  My face doesn&#x27;t feel so dry (like it will crack) when I get up in the morning.  Love that it is natural!!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Would order again for sure . xoxoxo</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the way this makes my skin feel! Plus, it has a subtle golden &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34; that gives a nice little light-reflecting glow! A little goes a long way too!</li>
            <li> This cream makes your skin soft, supple, and lovely.  I would definitely purchase it again!</li>
            <li> Like this very much because it is all natural! Feel good about putting it on my face. A little heavy so I use it at night.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get the hype about this product! This is absolutely way too greasy that it makes my face shinny (pea size). I even checked the reviews if it would cause acnes but I just don&#x27;t think this product is for me. TOO OILY.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s greasy but when it&#x27;s been absorbed by your skin it feels really good.</li>
            <li> I really like this night cream. I have super sensitive skin and will break out from almost anything. I can safely say that I have been using this product and no breakouts. Additionally, it has kept my skin very moisturized. I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s a natural product and I can pronounce all of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Have now used this face cream daily &amp; nightly for over a week. This cream does what it promises. You must follow the directions for cleaning the face first, &amp; most important use sparingly. A small dab will do for each facial area. My lips are no longer chapped, my skin is moist &amp; soft. I did miss the glamorous  jar or fancy box &amp; scent of other facial products. The important item &amp; what I am paying for are the contents &amp; what they do for my skin. This facial cream delivers. Did not irritate, did not feel greasy or heavy. However you must not over apply. I wish this company continued success, as I will want to be able to be a repeat customer. When an item works, I stick with it.</li>
            <li> Took it on a trip to Florida--very soothing, not greasy--especially good around eyes--this was a hard-water area--seemed to lessen the pores on face--would buy it again!</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Best cream ever!&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive dry skin and it&#x27;s perfect match for me. At age 41 I tried so many different creams, nothing work perfect...&lt;br /&gt;Finally I fell in love with &amp;#34;Bee Friendly &amp;#34;!!!</li>
            <li> So far I am loving this product! Leaves my skin so soft....and they weren&#x27;t kidding when they say a little goes a long way! Only con I have is for the price the packaging is not very nice and the label was a little worn, also was expecting to get some sort of card or paper from the company? Other than that really enjoying this.</li>
            <li> Finally, an organic and all natural cream that I don&#x27;t worry about using on my skin. This moisturizer is smooth and silky and definitely not &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;. I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it! This is the best face cream I have ever tried. I just bought another jar to give as a gift.</li>
            <li> Great consistency, Have been using it for a few days now and my skin seems to love it. I am getting all sorts of allergies and skin problems all the time (eczema, rashes, redness etc.) and this product is working wonders with no side effects. The smell is a little funny but that is a small price for good, all natural cream. Will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> I love this cream! It has reduced the appearance of fine lines and my skin feels softer and smoother and my complexion looks more even highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product. It leaves my face feeling so smooth and I have slowly started to see results after one week. My eyes seem brighter and softer and the crows feet are diminishing.Thanks for sending this to me. Loving it!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product.  Been using for one week...already see a difference.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer! It left my skin feeling soft and velvety smooth. I was very impressed with this product!</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is best used at night since it leaves a strong shine.  But it feels very good on the skin and I actually use it while out there on a snowy day, shoveling.....</li>
            <li> I really like the texture and the subtle fragrance of this moisturizer, and my skin seems to like it, too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a few weeks now and I love it! No petroleum, no emulsifiers, no synthetic fagrance or color. My skin is extremely &#x27;oil-dry&#x27; and very sun damaged. This cream replenishes the moisture in my skin, giving a nice glow and softens the appearance of wrinkles. Not only do I use it before bed, but I&#x27;ve found that for me, it works perfectly as a make-up primer. The bees wax has a slight scent, but not at all unpleasant. I would recommend stirring the cream occasionally with a toothpick before use, to re-mix the ingredients. As a retired esthetician, I give it 2 thumbs up!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using a salon facial moisturizer that cost twice as much per container and it doesn&#x27;t even compare to this stuff! In just 5 uses my face already looks and feels amazing. My skin feels soft and silky, my face looks smoother and it actually has a healthy glow. My blemishes and spots seemed to have evened out and faded away. I look 5 years younger (I&#x27;m 30)! I love this moisturizer and will never use anything different again! It&#x27;s definitely a night cream though because it takes a few hours to really sink in. I wash my face about 2 hours before bedtime, apply and just let it do it&#x27;s magic. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The negative reviews commenting on the oiliness of this cream means it is not a good match for everyone. I myself at 62 yrs old have found it to be beneficial. The cream is indeed thick and sits on my face for about 1/2 hour but then it soaks in. I like the way it makes my skin feel. There does seem to be a light coat that remains on my face all day.  This coating acts as a protective layer against the elements I think. I live in the Southwest where the air is very, very dry and sucks the moisture right out of my body. I drink water all day long just to keep from being dehydrated.  So this cream actually is a wonderful surprise for me - it keeps my skin soft and supple all day long. The ingredients appear to be clean, though not all organic.  It is my hope they are caring for the the bees responsibly and not taking shortcuts with gmo sugar water and corn syrup products.  I would prefer the container was glass, not plastic since there is no mention of it being BPA Free. Otherwise, I am currently pleased with my purchase of this cream. Should anything change in the future I will make note of it in my review.</li>
            <li> I have seen so many customer reviews that have been disclosed at the end that the product was supplied to them in exchange for an honest review - and while I don&#x27;t really have a problem with that, I still think I have more appreciation for reviews where the customer was NOT compensated in any way. This is one of those reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to buy this product because the eye cream I used every night was in such a teeeny tiiiny bottle I thought surely I could find a product that would work just as well and would last me much longer. I searched for a product with similar ingredients as the one I previously used because honestly I thought it was a good product. I just needed more at the same price - or cheaper if possible. My search brought up this item. It had very positive feedback from it&#x27;s buyers. (Some who received samples, some who did not...at least I assume) It also had a very &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; ingredient list which is a must for me. Especially for something that is going to be spread on the delicate skin around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little about my skin: I&#x27;m only 28 and have taken very good care of my skin thus far. I don&#x27;t have problems with bags under my eyes or puffiness but I am starting to notice some wrinkling around my eyes when I smile. (yes, I admit I am a bit obsessive....) My skin tends to be on the dry side and I hate nothing more than waking up with dry eyes - not only my eyeballs but also the skin around my eyes feeling dry - so I look for very thick, moisturizing eye creams to use at night so they&#x27;ll still feel like they&#x27;re &amp;#34;with me&amp;#34; even after a full night&#x27;s sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream appears solid in the jar but quickly emulsifies into the consistency of an oil as you apply it. I liked how silky it felt as I smoothed it around my eyes. It wore well throughout the night and my skin still felt moisturized when I woke up the next day. I have also noticed it does not sting if it works its way down into my eyes. One night I was watching some TV after smearing a thick layer on and I could tell it was getting in my eyes (made my vision a little blurry) but no stinging whatsoever. That is a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also note, I have been using this every night for at least a week now, probably more like two weeks, and have not developed any breakouts from it. So if you&#x27;re worried about it being &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; and causing your skin to break out - chances are you have nothing to worry about. But I don&#x27;t claim to be able to speak for everyone&#x27;s skin.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only caution: It definitely does have some &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; to it. I only use it at night so this is not a big deal, but if you were to wear it during the day you would probably have to apply it VERY thinly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a fantastic product and I plan on using it for a long time!! :)</li>
            <li> It is a very good moisturizer, I like to put it on my hand as well. I wash my hand to many times everyday, this really helps to keep my skin soft. When using on the face, the only down side is that it is too oily, however the oily feeling goes away really quick, like 30 sec after putting it on, the skin absorbed most of it.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer!  Like the fact that you don&#x27;t have to use separate eye cream.  It does take a minute to absorb but after my make up applied beautifully.</li>
            <li> The cream appears a bit oily, but it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily. Very very little required, so it&#x27;ll last a long time. I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> wonderful stuff, really enjoying it.</li>
            <li> love this helps all over ,makes MY EYE LOOK GREAT ,WILL BUY AGAIN</li>
            <li> Using it for few days now, very satisfied with the moisturizing effect.&lt;br /&gt;I have mixed skin type but it is not easy to find&lt;br /&gt;a cream for both face and eyes. This is what I have been looking for&lt;br /&gt;and healthy to the skin. Thanks.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know what is in this stuff that makes my skin so glowy in the morning but it is AMAZING, i have incredibly sensitive skin, burns and breaks out with almost 9 out of 10 products, love this stuff, definitely reordering</li>
            <li> I see no improvement in my skin after three weeks of use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a night cream!  Thick and moisturizing!  I haven&#x27;t noticed less wrinkles but will keep using to see!  I have very dry skin however and this works very well - I really dislike having that tight skin feeling - this alleviated that feeling!</li>
            <li> I love it and I will continue buy it. Good product, definitely natural.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my mother who has extremely sensitive skin. She loves the product ... especially the fact that, when she rubbed the cream around her eyes, her eyes did not get red and puffy like when using other creams that have a lot of heavy &amp;#34;manufactured&amp;#34; ingredients and perfumes. She liked this cream so much I purchased a second jar for myself.   I use this only a night. If used in the morning, I would have to wipe the excess moisturizer off my face to use cosmetics. When applied to my face and neck, this cream leaves my skin so very soft. Very highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Great for my skin - gets a little shiny though...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this once or twice a day for a couple of weeks now. It hasn&#x27;t made my skin look a whole lot different, but it has kept it really well hydrated, and I SO appreciate the straightforward ingredient list and lack of fragrance. It&#x27;s also nice to have just one single product that can be used for face and eyes. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a couple days. It is very greasy. I am not saying this is a bad thing either. Just don&#x27;t expect a lotion/cream feel. I like that its all natural and has ingredients I can pronounce. I need to use it more to get an overall opinion on whether I think it will help improve fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Nice face cream- I use it mostly for my eyes. Pleasant smell, absorbs very quickly, and works well so far under my concealer.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this cream....my skin feels so soft and hydrated!!!</li>
            <li> I love this cream!!! I discovered it when I was looking for something natural for my dry skin: I also have a mild rosacea on my face, so any artificial chemicals are just a bad idea. Just minutes after I apply the cream to my (usually irritated and red) skin, it seems to calm in down and give my skin back its natural color. I haven&#x27;t even been using make-up since I started to use this cream: I just apply a little of it (not too much, since it&#x27;s a little oily) on my red cheeks, and in 10 minutes while I drive to work, my face looks perfect! I also love how it smells, very pleasant. The oily feeling on my skin only lasts for a couple minutes: maybe because of the dryness too, but it seems to be absorbed pretty quickly! I will definitely get it again, after this one is finished!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference as of yet, but I do like it, its a good moisturizer!</li>
            <li> This works good for dry skin. If you have normal to oily skin you have to put on very little otherwise your skin will feel oily. I really like this product. I have used Royal Jelly products before and this is pretty close to the one I used previously to this. I got this as a deal for $1 for a review. I would recommend it to all that are into natural products like myself.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer! I use it at night. It also softens my hands!</li>
            <li> I love the way this feels on my face!! Having only used it for a short while I cannot comment to effectiveness but I will tell you that it goes on smooth, not unpleasant odor and really feels nice on the skin. Order was received timely. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I love the product! It makes my skin look very healthy and glowing! Will definitely purchase again! Great product!!</li>
            <li> I use everywhere except my tzone.  As an eye cream and face moisturizer it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;m 48 and I&#x27;ve spent a fortune on products, even as much as 200 for an eyecream.  I ordered and said if it doesn&#x27;t work I&#x27;ll at least not have spent a lot. It was Fantasy! !!  Plus it got rid of my rosacea on my checks!!</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of facial moisturizers (many much more expensive than this product!) and I think this is the best. I live in a cold climate and my skin gets very dry. This moisturizer alleviates the dryness but doesn&#x27;t feel like a heavy barrier. It&#x27;s organic goodness gets absorbed into the skin and just FEELS good for you! I was really surprised at how amazing this product was for the price.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this cream! I am 62 and my skin is sort of dry, after applying the cream, my skin looks and feels very smooth and soft! Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Olga</li>
            <li> Wow.  I wish I had 50 gallons of this stuff so I could bathe in it. So awesome. A touch greasy but is perfect for my dry to normal skin.</li>
            <li> My skin was dry, flaky so I decided to try something new. To my surprise, in two days the dead skin fell off and my skin was nice and smooth. I normally don&#x27;t leave reviews but this product is a must for everyone to try. I&#x27;m 55 years of age and I was giving up. With Bee Fiendly Skin Care there&#x27;s still hope for a youthful face. I can&#x27;t wait to see how much better my skin will improve in a week. Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Good stuff and does not irritate eyes.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a night cream for face and eyes and it works well. It provides the hydration I was looking for without any irritation, or any clogged pores (using it for a month now). No bitter taste either. It does look very shiny so I would not use it during the day except on very dry areas.</li>
            <li> I am really impressed with this product. Because I live in Arizona where humidity is VERY low most of the time I have very dry skin. This product is wonderful. Really improves the feel and texture of my face. I would recommend this to anyone. And I will be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 2 months and my skin is so soft and smooth.  I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Yes, I do like this products.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I am always too lazy to write reviews lol unless the product blows me away. Well it did! I have dry skin and my skin feels so soft and has looked really good since using. I love that the ingredients are natural, there are no chemicals that will age your skin, and it supports an earth friendly mindset! Hopefully more products will come out with this company. I am in love!!</li>
            <li> This is a great natural moisturizer for a decent price. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok , not for day time wear , it&#x27;s rather heavy. It smells like bees waxs candles. Not bad I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll get it again or not.</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that this was organic and made with honey. I have sensitive skin so I was intrigued. It just didn&#x27;t work me. I found that it made my skin feel too greasy or moisturized. I ended up giving it to my Mom and she liked it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  I&#x27;m still in the middle of my own personal trial of testing how well this fades sun spots on my cheekbones.  So far it looks very promising!  And its only been a few weeks and I already see improvement.  Plus I love that it uses the best ingredients.</li>
            <li> I am 63 years old and have tried many rejuvenating/ moisturizing products including extremely expensive creams recommended by dermatologists.  I have never been as pleased with any of them as I have been with this product.  My face feels and looks younger.  I love the fact that it is  made of natural ingredients and after 3 weeks of use, I see a definite difference in my skin.  I will be ordering more products from this company.!!!!</li>
            <li> Just to know that I am putting something 100% natural and organic on my face and eyes gives me a good feeling about this cream.  You only need to apply a small amount -- a lit bit goes a long way.  I love the fact that it has beeswax as an ingredient -- even though it may seem a little sticky when you apply it, it just feels great on your skin.  I&#x27;d highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> I am currently using this cream as my night cream and I love it. I wake up with skin so fresh and hydrated. I will order again. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer. I&#x27;m always looking for safe products to use on my skin. I came across this while searching and thought I&#x27;d give it a chance since the ingredients agreed with me. Honey is great for skin. I used it after a detox mask and my face really soaked it up. You must cleanse your face first in order for it to work properly.  The smell is pleasant in my opinion. After a few uses, I felt like my face had a subtle healthy glow to it.  I don&#x27;t feel the need to look for another moisturizer now that I found this.  Thank you for hand making each jar!</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer. I use it ever night and can tell it is softening the wrinkles around my eyes and mouth. It is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t break you out. I will continue using it. It does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used the product a couple of times, but it has been great.  One only needs to use a little bit as it is oily, but it makes my face feel so smooth and light. I have sensitive skin that is also prone to breakouts, so I was skeptical using a product with olive oil in it.  However, the vitamins in the cream seem to balance out the oils and I&amp;#34; haven&#x27;t noticed any breakouts or pore-clogging!  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to using chemical-laden products again!</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li> It is a really good product but no matter how little i use (because a little does go along way) it doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin well. I put it on before I go to bed though and wake up and my skin feels amazing!</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and so far, no breakouts.  I use this a few nights a week and wake up with super soft skin.  Yes, this products contains oils, so it&#x27;s best to use at night.  And a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I found a keeper with this product makes my skin feels so much better and with the winter upon us this is really going to be wonderful</li>
            <li> I love how soft it makes face and skin feels younger</li>
            <li> Have been using this cream for about 3 weeks and I LOVE it! My face looks smoother, healthier and less lined. Even my hands look younger and smoother from rubbing any excess cream into them after applying it to my face. Very impressed!</li>
            <li> I love this!  It does feel a little greasy when you first put it on, but it seems to absorb quickly.  I use this every morning and night.  I wish the price were a little less though.</li>
            <li> Terrible. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin but for some reason my skin became red and itchy after using this product. I tried giving it a chance a couple of times but I had the same reaction every time.</li>
            <li> Love this natural moisturizer! I have sensitive skin and it works great on my face and even around my eyes!</li>
            <li> I can say that this does have a nice natural feel to it, but it&#x27;s basically oil. The emulsion breaks as soon as I rub it between my palms to apply it to my face. Also, it&#x27;s slightly greenish (the color of olive oil) and I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so buttery in the product image. I cannot imagine using it even at night. Maybe during the winter when it gets really dry? I have used it a few times on my eyes, but I actually got some eyelid breakouts (possibly from another product) so I will probably stop that too. If I&#x27;m able to find a good use for it I will update my review.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase.  The moisturizer really makes your skin soft.  The company is also very interested in keeping the customer happy.  Very pleased with the whole experience</li>
            <li> The BEST skin care I have ever used! I&#x27;m 35. I&#x27;ve tried so many different types of face products! This is completely different from any of the others. In a class all it&#x27;s own. I had been breaking out like a teenager for the last 2-3 months. Nothing else helped. This has started to clear my skin in 3 uses! After one use, my forehead lines were reduced about 50%! Nature at it&#x27;s best here!</li>
            <li> This stuff can make skin very soft, but too oily and difficult to Smear evenly on the face</li>
            <li> Love this cream! I have very dry skin and this makes me dewy and gives a great glow. I can use this all over my face, including the ye area with no problems. Perfect for very dry skin!</li>
            <li> I love how your organic creams makes my face and eye area feel so soft. I have very sensitive skin. I will continue to buy your creams also like the fact that it is organic.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this cream! A lil bit goes a very long way, great value. Gives my skin a dewy glow. Very impressed!!</li>
            <li> Very good if you have dry skin.  Can be a little oily looking but my skin is super dry and this really helps.  It&#x27;s nice that it is just a few ingredients and mostly organic and natural.</li>
            <li> This cream works well to hydrate my skin and leaves it feeling soft.  The oil was separated a bit but I just stirred it and it was fine.  You need just a small amount.  I like the fact I can use it on my face and the area around my eyes.</li>
            <li> So far so good! I love the way it goes on smoothly and soaks in quickly. It looks greasy at first, but quickly soaks in. It has a very mild, pleasant scent too. I&#x27;ve only been using for a few days, but my skin already feels softer. The cream is a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for and I think it will last a few months. Great to know there are no harmful toxins or synthetic fragrances!</li>
            <li> what a fantastic product! I am now on my 2nd jar and will eventually buy the body cream and serum. My fine lines seemed to have diminished,which is probably due to this creams rich emollient properties. My makeup adheres beautifully and you only need a little.At the age of 59,I have purchased MANY products at very high prices that did not come close to the lasting dewy ness of this quality product,I love it and it is totally affordable ! Thank You Bee Friendly for a great product.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful cream, it really does make my skin feel softer, I have used morning and night. I will certainly purchase more when this runs out, but that may be a while, you don&#x27;t need to use that much. Update 7/1/15 I&#x27;ve purchased again, I love this cream and I&#x27;m glad to have found an affordable cream that I like.</li>
            <li> Really enjoying this multi-purpose cream ~ it&#x27;s texture is great, rich &amp; creamy, and it only takes a little bit to moisturize face, eyes, chest ~ I also love the minimal and very healthy ingredients.  My skin loves it too!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I am using for under my eyes at night.  I have really sensitive skin and get rashes easily.  I have not had any problems with this product. It is very moisturizing. A little goes a long way- It will last forever!</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would work for me. Great ingredients, nice texture and aroma, absorbs well, can put sunscreen on top without issues. Just not moisturizing enough for my dry skin</li>
            <li> Very mild scent, a little goes a long way and best of all, it doesn&#x27;t annoy my skin thanks to the natural ingredients.  It seemed a little pricey to me when I ordered it but the jar is big and since you don&#x27;t need to use much, this will last a while and it&#x27;s excellent value for the money.  It&#x27;s very soothing for my aging (56 y/o) skin.</li>
            <li> This is some very good, 100% organic, moisturizer.  I like that it is safe to use around your eyes.  It is definitely a product I would recommend.</li>
            <li> The photo can be misleading as the actual product isn&#x27;t as thick. It&#x27;s really more of an oil and very lightweight. I still like it though and can see an improvement in my skin. My skin is normally very dry so it might not be as good for someone needing just a little moisture.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for my Mom, but so far she loves it.  She has very sensitive skin and a little goes a long way and because her skin is dry, this cream is perfect.  She said It really soaks in and makes her skin feel soft!  We will buy again!!!  Love the gentle ingredients too!</li>
            <li> Wonderful moisturizer, a little goes a long way. My search for an all natural moisturizer is over.</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer, can only use at night because it leaves a sheen after use, but really like the way it leaves my skin feeling, have been using it on my hands and really like the way it feels.</li>
            <li> Just wonderful, the smell is pleasant and natural</li>
            <li> That packaging is simplistic, which I like.  When companies make their products flashy, I always wonder how much quality they are if they have to prove it by being over the top.  When I opened this jar, the smell was clean and not overwhelming.  The texture was unique and not exactly what I expected in a moisturizer.  It was thick, which I liked but worried about since I have oily skin.  But, I used this at night to begin with and I loved the feel.  It went on smoothly and felt great but the better part was that after eight hours of tossing and turning (I don&#x27;t sleep well), my face still felt amazing and moisturized.  I waited a couple of days before using it again to see if it would break me out and it didn&#x27;t.  I used it again a few nights ago and enjoyed it and have begun using it nightly.  A little goes a long way so I think the jar will last forever and I&#x27;m really enjoying this new staple!  I&#x27;d highly recommend to anyone wanting to use a natural but effective product!</li>
            <li> This is a rich and smooth cream and I love it. It is soft and silky and makes my skin feel so soft it is amazing. It is a little rich for me to use under makeup as my T-zone is oily, but I use it at night or days I am not wearing makeup. My skin really seems to love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several weeks now and can see an improvement in my since and the lines around my lips.  This is a greasy formula though and needs to be dabbed off a bit with a Kleenex once applied.  I am happy with the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming scent which I cannot use.</li>
            <li> No words can express how much I love this cream. It costs 10 times less than the last facial cream I bought - not kidding, but it feels better than the other one. I&#x27;ve been looking for a good facial cream that is good and doesn&#x27;t cost too much. I&#x27;ve had a lot of disappointments. When I saw the price of this one I thought I&#x27;d give it a try because of the reviews, at least if it didn&#x27;t work I wouldn&#x27;t lose too much money. But even on the first day I noticed my skin was very moisturized, which I was impressed. The next day it still looked amazing. Then I kept using it and everytime I was getting more and more excited!!! Then I just thought to stock this amazing cream. Please never stop selling it. I&#x27;m a forever customer now and I totally recommend it. I&#x27;m in awe. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> BeeFriendly organic face and eye cream is great!  Its natural, easy to apply, feels great on you face, reduces fine lines and wrinkles, and you feel great because you look great!  I highly recommend this product!!!!!</li>
            <li> Really like this beauty product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had horrible, sensitive, acne-prone skin my whole life. I&#x27;ve never felt comfortable going anywhere or doing anything without make-up on in attempt to hide my acne and scars. Recently, I&#x27;ve been doing research on different skin care items and trying them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best thing I&#x27;ve tried so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it&#x27;s natural, it does not irritate my skin. It is oily, so I only wear it at night, and I do use it as an eye cream, too. When I wake up in the morning, my acne that I had the night before has vanished. My skin looks brighter and I don&#x27;t look as tired around the eyes. I&#x27;m still pretty young, so I can&#x27;t vouch for the anti-aging properties, but my skin does feel tighter in the morning. I&#x27;ve also noticed my acne scars beginning to dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was skeptical to buy because of the price, and because so many people left reviews saying the size was so small. But, when mine arrived, it was a lot larger than I had expected. And I use such a little amount a night that I&#x27;m expecting it to last for a while. So, the price/amount ratio is completely realistic. (I&#x27;m a broke college student so believe me when I say it&#x27;s something worth spending the money on)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for everyone, and I&#x27;m excited to use it in the winter when my face is really dry and I need the extra moisture during the day, too.</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin loves this cream.  As I have issues with dry eyes &amp; blepharitis, it&#x27;s wonderful to have a product that can be applied to my eyelids which doesn&#x27;t irritate them.  I&#x27;m no longer having to use any other products to address the blepharitis, and my eyelids are much more comfortable.  Thank you for this excellent cream!</li>
            <li> Love this.  It seems a little bit oily initially; but, my skin seems to drink it in pretty well.</li>
            <li> love the feel/texture of product. Use it nightly as it&#x27;s a bit greasy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is ok if you like your face to feel greased down. To much weighs your face down will not help with moisterizing your face. I really thing this stuff is not what it claims. I could not use this on my face cause it was greasy and left my face feeling to oily.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dehydrated skin, which differs from dry skin in the respect that I still produce enough oil to have acne issues, but my skin is always dry, chapped, tight, and red. My skin is also very sensitive, and any new ingredient is likely to cause break outs. I&#x27;ve been using this daily, every night and most mornings too. It soaks in quickly and smells lightly of honey. I&#x27;ve also been using it on my dry feet and the eczema on my elbows. My redness has been minimized greatly, and my skin feels &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;- soft, comfortable, not greasy, not like there&#x27;s a film on my skin. Best of all I would swear it&#x27;s calmed my acne as bit, which is believable because honey has antibacterial properties. The bumps and scales on my elbows are smoothed over now, but come back if I don&#x27;t keep up with this. And the dry skin on my feet is quickly healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not new to natural skin care at all, but I believe a lot of reviewers are newer. To me, this isn&#x27;t going to last as long as other reviews lead me to believe, only because I&#x27;m used to natural products being more concentrated so you use less than commercial products. For this, I need at least a lima-bean-sized amount for my face and neck, which may be a little for some but I&#x27;m used to &amp;#34;a drop of this and two drops for that,&amp;#34; so while this will go further than a drugstore brand for sure. I expect it&#x27;ll time for me to buy more in 3 or 4 months. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m happy with that, but I didn&#x27;t take into account that other people are probably used to going through commercial products much quicker than I&#x27;m used to going through the natural products I already use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you need to apply this to damp skin. There&#x27;s no water component to this, so you need to add the moisture to your skin yourself before sealing it in with the butters and oils in this cream. That&#x27;s the first rule of natural skincare that I&#x27;ve learned- never put oils or butters on dry skin, because they won&#x27;t soak in properly, plusthey don&#x27;t provide moisture on their own. I believe that&#x27;s the problem a lot of people are having when they say this is greasy or doesn&#x27;t sink in. Hope that helps someone!</li>
            <li> Nourishing and moisturizing. Need a small amount of  the product to apply. Perfect for night time facial care. tank you!</li>
            <li> Awesome product ..love the natural scent very mild and leaves skin hydrated and soft..</li>
            <li> I am finishing my first jar of this product &amp; have purchased a 2nd jar. I am 55, &amp; live in Minnesota where it is currently very cold &amp; dry.  This product is creamy &amp; rich &amp; moisturizers my skin with a modest amount applied and keeps it moist all day. It does not clog my pours or have much of a scent, which I like. It will be too heavy for summer, but works really well for my dry, Winter skin. No break outs from it either. I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Like it. Like the seller said, a small amount will cover the whole face. It&#x27;s oily, so I mainly use in winter time.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer makes my skin feel soft but is very greasy.  Like all moisturizers, I found no long-term beneficial effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus I did not appreciate getting three emails from Bee Friendly Skincare, urging me to review its product.  One email was fine; any more than that is irritating.</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer. It has properties that make it stand out from other skin creams.</li>
            <li> Saw complaints about absorbing, but I followed the instructions and used very little product and it absorbs nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REALLY REALLY can not stand the smell! The smell fades, but it just smells disgusting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does make my skin feel softer though. Trying my best to deal with the smell!!</li>
            <li> Good product and very nice customer services . I recommended it is reasonable price and efficient on the skin .T H A N K S !</li>
            <li> Yes I am experiencing a notable improvement in my overall facial health and appearance. The product is a little heavy but well worth the texture of it. I wear it around the house and at night. Since winter is fast approaching I will wear it during the day outside to protect my skin from the winter weather. I will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Very Moisturizing! I&#x27;ve got it on my elbows right now &amp; they stay soft.  I don&#x27;t have to keep applying it.  My face feels &amp; looks softer, not so drawn &amp; tight!  100% Natural-can&#x27;t beat that!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> An esthetician recommended some expensive face care products that I have been using (too expensive).  I saw the good reviews on BeeFriendly&#x27;s Face and Eye moisturizer so I thought I would try it.  This is only my first week of using it but so far - is works beautifully.  I was concerned that it may cause acne but ... it hasn&#x27;t so far.  I love that it&#x27;s an all natural product.  As other reviewers mention - at first, it goes on a little greasy but as in a short time it is absorbed into the skin and does not leave a greasy feel.  It just leaves the skin a more supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the information on the product sent by emails from BeeFriendly.  They serve with excellence and although buying online have implemented the &amp;#34;human factor&amp;#34; which many sellers forget is extremely important.</li>
            <li> I really like how this feels on my face after its on it for a bit, my face feels nice and soft, that said I am not fond of the smell of this product</li>
            <li> These products rock! I&#x27;ve worked in the skin care industry for nearly 30 years and have never been able to find an all natural product that is worth using until now. I especially recommend these products for dry or mature skin and for folks with fragrance sensitivity. You won&#x27;t go wrong with any of the bee friendly products. Always massage products into the skin with a little water on your fingers. The product spreads farther and will lock in the added moisture. No, I don&#x27;t work for this company but maybe I should!</li>
            <li> great moisturizer. it is a little oily at first but soaks in and keeps skin smooth and hydrated. my new favorite.</li>
            <li> I love this  moisturizer!! It smells wonderful, it feels great on my skin and it is not too oily, IMO. A little goes a very long way and if you have dry skin, like me, you just might love this too. I use it both night and day. I would buy this again. It shipped quickly, too</li>
            <li> TRULY A MARVELOUS MOISTURIZER! Unfortunately, it was too strong for around my eyes (causing irritation), so touting it as both an Eye + Face Moisturizer is why I couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars. Both my face and neck look &amp; feel SPECTACULAR after using this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Different parts of your face will demand different amounts of this Moisturizer - so be careful as a little bit of this Moisturizer goes a long way and you could end up going from a &amp;#34;Dewey&amp;#34; look to a &amp;#34;Shiny&amp;#34; - which is not so wonderful IMHO... except at nighttime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer to just use their Serum during the day as it definitely makes your face look fresh - and I don&#x27;t use any products over this - including  foundations, BB creams, etc.  I apply both products at night.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product!!!!!!!! Thank you so much for making and selling it, much appreciated.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, it&#x27;s definitely a night cream for me though,it has a nice natural scent to it and it goes on nice but its got a somewhat greasy feel once applied.&lt;br /&gt;If i tried to apply make-up over it, I&#x27;d be very shiny by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Great product! Great service, they make sure everything is perfect as possible when you get it, and if not, they replace it! I really appreciate that. I look forward to trying other products :-)</li>
            <li> Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smooth &amp; feels light on my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great when there&#x27;s time to let it soak in, but would love a lighter version.</li>
            <li> So far I love it, I like that it is a facial and eye moisturizer and makes  traveling easier, one less jar.  So far it has kept my face and eyes skin soft and not dry all day.</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about this product.  It does soften the skin; however, I found that even though it was applied sparingly, it left a sticky sheen on my face. Further, I had to wash my hands after applying, because that stickiness made stubborn prints on anything I touched (i.e. phone and tablet screen).  I would have preferred a little better absorption to the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect moisturizer for my face and I think I&#x27;ve finally found it! This moisturizer leaves my face soft and not in the least bit greasy. And you only need to use a little bit, too much and you do get shiny. :)</li>
            <li> Ok moisturizer, but WAY TO OULY! Not seen the difference it makes, yet.  Grand jct</li>
            <li> Bought this for a family member. They raved and ranted about its awesomeness !</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer... It has become a staple for sure.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be excellent . It is all natural and organic which I really like and very easy to apply .</li>
            <li> Great cream for your face ..</li>
            <li> Nice product. good moisturinzer.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Your skin will feel wonderful! The aroma is light and fresh..:like green tea. Just use a little to see how much you need...I have dry skin so I use several dabs.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it. applies well. living in MA, it&#x27;s perfect for the weather here. great that i can use the same cream for the eyes as well and it is working well for the same</li>
            <li> Have enjoyed trying this product at the promotion price.....takes only a small amount and leaves your face and eye area feeling smooth and soft would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have never written a review before. I bought this moisturizer because I wanted something different that was organic and at a good price. This product should only be worn at night. It is very greasy and doesn&#x27;t soak in very quick, BUT in the morning your skin will be very supple!! I like that it is very very lightweight and I can put it around my eyes. But just warning anyone who purchases it is greasy. If I want to wear during the day I have mixed a SMALL amount with my current moisturizer which works great. My moisturizer that I use during the day just feels like it doesn&#x27;t moisturize that well, and using a small amount of this with it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I bought the night cream and liked it so I decided to try the moisturizer. This product is just like the night cream only less heavy. It can be used as a night cream also which I&#x27;ve done. As with the night cream, this moisturizer is oily-feeling and have a waxy smell to it and looks just like it is pictured. The smell is from the natural ingredients and fades. The oily-feeling is just that..oily-feeling but, in fact, it does not stay that way for long. I usually mix it with Vit C or HA serum or DMAE powder or another night cream and apply quickly. I say quickly because as soon as you put some in your hand, it starts to melt. However, it blends easily and all melts(and stays) on my face. When I take it off in the morning, my skin feels soft and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product. I have sensitive oily skin and have not have any issues with it. I especially like the blending aspect which opens up all kinds of possibilities with using other creams/serums/powders.  I would/will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Ok, so when I first got this cream I thought I was following directions my mixing it up but still found it be very oily. Then, this winter my skin became so unbelievably dry so I decided to try this again--but what I did differently was I very thoroughly mixed the cream. This made ALL the difference and I have to say, this makes my skin feel unreal. So soft, so moisturized, I really couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more. When you buy this cream-and you should if you have dry skin-make sure you REALLY mix it up, and only use a little</li>
            <li> It seems to be a good product! in reference to results, I did not notice any visible results  besides moisturized skin(about two weeks using it). It is always difficult to find a product for your eye area that will show a visible result immediately</li>
            <li> I have used so many face creams in my life.. and I wanted to wait until I used the product for at least a month. And I gotta say I absolutely love this product! First of all,  I love the pure natural ingredients. And secondly I love the result. Under my eyes I think I would like a product that tightens the delicate eye area a little more. But overall, the quality of my skin has has become  better becausr of this product. I have gotten several compliments recently on my face! This product will give your face a nice glow and nice even texture.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes my normal-dry skin very well. My favorite natural face lotion.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this product after reading the reviews. I got this a few days ago and I already notice the difference in my skin! My skin tone is a lot more even. The product goes on really smooth without feeling like it&#x27;s clogging your pores. A little on the oily side but blends well with foundation. Leaves a smooth, refreshed look. I also am noticing fine lines are starting to disappear! Even though this is the &amp;#34;day&amp;#34; cream, I have been applying it at night and during the day after I wash my face. I think it works great for any time.</li>
            <li> I love it! It makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a skin cream that will help my dry skin.  This moisturizer is just what I have been looking for!  It is very rich and absorbs beautifully.  I believe this will make a huge difference to my skin this winter.  I also recommend the night cream.  What a wonderful find!</li>
            <li> I have been using this mostly as an eye cream, and occasionally as a night cream, for about a month. So far I love it. It is a little heavy, but feels very smooth when applying. It has not caused any break outs or skin irritation, and I will continue to use it as is. It is a little more green than what the picture shows, and it does separate as it sits settles, but I shake it up well before I use it and the separation does not seem to affect it.</li>
            <li> It took me awhile to find that this works very well. Not an overnight miracle, as some products advertise. My husband is using it too so I just ordered my second jar! I love that it is Organic so safe to use on my face!</li>
            <li> I really love this moisturizer! Works great for very dry skin!</li>
            <li> Just what I have been looking for. I have you cream on my face for years. So many have been dis-continued. I love your product has all natural ingredients</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a week now, and I am in love! I am 29, so I don&#x27;t have too many fine lines or wrinkles yet to evaluate the product&#x27;s effectiveness on; however, it has made my (sensitive) skin so smooth and soft. My skin looks clearer and more luminous than it has in awhile. I am pregnant and have been experiencing some breakouts and dryness, and this seems to have zapped those issues right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It truly only takes a little to moisturize your whole face. I take maybe a pea-sized amount and massage it in small circles all over my face and eye area after cleansing and toning my skin with other natural products, and the regiment seems to be making a world of difference! I absolutely love this product and will be buying again when the tub runs out.</li>
            <li> Love this face cream. It&#x27;s great for the winter months  when it&#x27;s hard to keep your skin moisterized</li>
            <li> I like this cream.  I have noticed a difference is my skin texture, especially around my eyes.  I really love that this cream is both an eye and face cream.  Saves money in the long run.  As with other reviewers, I agree that it does not soak into the skin very quickly, but this is fine with me as i do not wear much makeup.  It works very well as a night cream.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have to stop using.  Cause breakouts/rosecia (had to go to derma) cause it was around my eyes.</li>
            <li> This past winter, my skin was in dire shape - I wasn&#x27;t sleeping well because my 3 year old was keeping me up all night and I had just turned 40 and my fine lines were getting more pronounced. Not to mention, the brutally cold weather was just killing my skin. I was ready to drop some serious money on SK-II or La Mer but saw this on Amazon and decided to give it a shot before I made such a big splurge. Amazingly, after applying this stuff for a week, my skin was glowing. My wrinkles and fine lines had nearly vanished. My friends were commenting on how healthy my skin looked. I was ecstatic. I am a total convert. Recently a woman at my yoga class demanded to know what I used on my face and of course I enthusiastically told her about Bee Friendly. I will say it&#x27;s a bit greasy and the packaging could use some improvement - visually it&#x27;s a bit of a turn off - but the important thing is that the product works. I love that its mostly organic and I love that its manufactured by a small company. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I like this cream a lot! It gets absorbed quickly and ingredients are excellent. Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I used to use expensive eye and face creams. Not anymore!! This is my eye and face cream all in one without all of the unhealthy ingredients. This cream is extremely concentrated. I have dry skin and use this everyday year round. I used to use Shiseido Benifiance eye cream and Kiehl&#x27;s Abyssine face cream. I save so much money and this cream is so much healthier for my face. My skin is moist and supple and chemical free!!</li>
            <li> This cream has everything I wanted in an all-natural product that would provide exceptional moisturizing without synthetic chemicals my skin doesn&#x27;t need. The texture is thick; only a small amount is needed for my face, including the eye area and my neck. I apply the cream at night before bed; in the morning it has been fully absorbed by my skin, leaving my skin feeling soft and looking fresh.</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with perioral dermatitis.  Many chemicals and ingredients seemed to set off the rash.  It was terrible.  It&#x27;s been very difficult to find a face lotion that doesn&#x27;t have bad chemicals in it and won&#x27;t clog up my pores and make my face break out.  This lotion has worked well for me, although it does leave a little sheen.  Typically I put in on, let it soak in, and then wipe my face with a towel.  It does have a very nice texture overall.</li>
            <li> I am a senior citizen and had some quite deep wrinkles  I have been using this product for a few weeks and see a very noticeable difference. Yes, the wrinkles are still there but they are not as deep and they appear softer. It only takes a very small amount. I think this is a great product.  My skin is looking the best it has in years!</li>
            <li> Wanted to love it, but it was really greasy and didn&#x27;t absorb as well as typical moisturizing products.</li>
            <li> This is honestly just oil that completely separates from possibly wax? It is not like a moisturizer, it never absorbs. It is disgusting to dip your fingers into after the first go round, a germ cesspool. A total failure, the worst beauty product I ever got from Amazon. I wouldn&#x27;t even put it on my elbows, but at 25 bucks, I can&#x27;t throw it out. Put oil on your face and see if you enjoy that, it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
            <li> I like Bee Friendly face and eye moisturizer, as it is quite emollient and was very helpful with clearing up my dry skin due to winter months&#x27; chafing. It is a bit thicker ( as described online) than most moisturizers, but it does the job. So if your skin is on the dry side, this product would be helpful.</li>
            <li> I love this cream! It&#x27;s very thick and luxurious, a little goes a long way. It&#x27;s very moisturizing for for dry mature skin. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> 44 year old female, with greasy skin prone to occasional breakouts. I bought this for my eye area, which is noticeably dry in the New England winter, and is at a pre-wrinkle stage. The rest of my skin on my face is greasy where I can only apply serum. I&#x27;ve bought brands that were not rich enough and didn&#x27;t feel like it was doing anything to my skin, yet I was reluctant to try something the other reviewers all said was on the rich side, due to my fear of looking oily. It is rich but not at all greasy, it is absorbed very well, and is feels silky smooth within minutes of it being absorbed. It feels really great and I am tempted to buy one for my gym bag as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth, feels good and has great texture.  I was looking for a moisturizer with fewer ingredients, natural ingredients, no animal testing and made in the USA.  I needed something that was not harsh as I have trouble with my skin. I&#x27;ve only used it about 5 days and so far so good. Just hope my skin continues do this well!</li>
            <li> Product is OK but I won&#x27;t purchase it again. It&#x27;s to greasy and doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin right away.</li>
            <li> Very light scent, immediately softens facial skin &amp; hands when I use it. Have used under sunscreen &amp; has not clogged my pores. I love that it&#x27;s a natural product. Very helpful &amp; friendly communication from seller.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 6 months now. It started out okay, but the more I use it the more I realize that my skin is not as hydrated as it should be and the greasy quality of this lotion makes my face break out more than it ever has before. I would not use it again.</li>
            <li> this cream is seriously good.  just ordered my second jar. I could see a big difference in my skin after only a few days.  I will continue using it</li>
            <li> Been using it for a few months: put it on every morning. I&#x27;ve noticed my skin has a bit more of a healthy look to it.</li>
            <li> Very good product! Noticed the difference within a week!  Recieved several compliments of how nice my skin looks, I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This was too greasy for my taste. I have very sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t irritate it all, but left a greasy residue and didn&#x27;t moisturize much if that makes any sense.</li>
            <li> Awesome and smells good!</li>
            <li> I really love this face cream!  I&#x27;ve had it for about a week, and I&#x27;m very impressed by it.  I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars, because I like it as well or better than any other product I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Does not irritate my skin - I have very sensitive skin, and many \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; or \\&quot;hypo-allergenic\\&quot; products cause my skin to become flaky.&lt;br /&gt;2. Smells great!  Slightly like honey, very subtle and not at all \\&quot;chemically\\&quot; like so many products.&lt;br /&gt;3. Absorbs well.&lt;br /&gt;4. Only a small amount is needed, so I expect this jar will last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;5. Moisturizes very well, but doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all (I suppose it could if I got carried away, but I only need a small amount).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, my only issue is the price.  I have a hard time paying $30+ for a skincare product.  Its a great product though, so I&#x27;ll see how long it lasts and if I feel I can afford to continue using it.  I know there are many that are more expensive though, I just don&#x27;t normally pay that much for a face cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a week so far, but it makes my skin look glowing and radiant.  I like that I can use it under my eyes, too. It stays greasy under my eyes for a bit, but not for too long.  I am 47 with smile and squint lines that seem to look better when I put the cream on.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim with a coupon and am really glad I did. It is a wonderful moisturizer. It is thick, yet goes on smooth and a little bit goes a long way. Has an interesting feel due to the honey and other bee products. Very special.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!!! I can&#x27;t say enough about it. I put it on in the morning and at night. My skin stays soft and moisturized all day. I will be recommending this product to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good! I have very sensitive skin and it Doesn&#x27;t bother me... A little thick but does the job!</li>
            <li> My husband David ordered this for me, he knows what I like. It feels so good on my skin and make my face glow. Another benefit that I received came after a day in the sun. I got a pretty bad sunburn. Because of it&#x27;s natural ingredients, I thought I would apply some to the burn. It was very soothing, It kept my skin soft and my burn didn&#x27;t peel.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely smelling organic cream. I have used it on my face, lips, eye area, hands, elbows and scars. This is a healing balm. Great product! I will be getting more for this winter for sure.</li>
            <li> This product is very greasy and doesn&#x27;t absorb well into my skin</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer once you know how much to use.  It doesn&#x27;t take much for coverage!  I have used this product along with the night cream for almost  a month and have seen an incredible improvement in the overall appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> awesome moisturizer, thick and creamy. little goes along way....skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is best Face Moisturizer I have ever tried.  I will keep using it, a little goes a long way, and not greasy at all.  I use it a.m. and p.m..  I&lt;br /&gt;see a difference in my skin.  I am 77, so to me, that is amazing.  It feels good on my skin and gives me color after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;I will order again when this one is nearly gone.</li>
            <li> I found the cream to be to heavy for my combination skin, so I gave it to my mom. She fell in love with it! She has very dry skin and raves about how moisturizing it is.  She has seen a reduction in fine lines and an increase in the firmness of her skin.</li>
            <li> excellent moisturizer-I have been looking to a replacement for the Kiehl&#x27;s imperial moisturizing balm which has been discontinued.  This works great with or without makeup. It is absorbed quickly and does not cause eye makeup to smear.  I am very satified and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little be grease, to use it at night its ok, but no for the day.</li>
            <li> This is a great all around moisturizer. A little goes a long way. Works well under tinted moisturizer and mineral makeup if left to soak in for a few minutes. I will be repurchasing this product.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot!  Not sticky and love the ingredients!</li>
            <li> I bought this cream about 3 weeks ago and I&#x27;ve been using it everyday. I use it on my eye area and the face. You only need a little bit since it&#x27;s very rich. I&#x27;m happy with this product and will purchase it again. I use it as the final layer to seal the moist in my skin. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone has dry skin.</li>
            <li> did return this product.  I think it was ordered in error.  Was a very small jar which made me question the value.</li>
            <li> Soo far I&#x27;m happy with the product. Be careful with the amount used. Can be a bit greasy. A little bit goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. I have sensitive skin and this cream hasn&#x27;t bothered my skin at all, in fact I think it has taken some of the redness from rosacea away. It seemed pricey when I ordered it but I think jt was worth it.</li>
            <li> I have completely replaced this cream with all the other crams I have in the cabinet! I do not know if it has helped any anti-wrinki&lt;br /&gt;ling but I don know that after a month of daily use my skin feels incredible and other people have noticed a glow. although if you do use it under makeup it does look a little shiny.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. I have very sensitive skin but had no problems with this product. I have extremely dry skin that flakes, this moisturizer left my skin smooth. Will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This is a great face cream for the price. Makes my face feel dewy and youthful looking.</li>
            <li> First of all I would to say Thank You for a wonderful and amazing product, I love the silk feeling of the product, It makes my skin nice and soft and youthful. I love that its organic and its one of the best products I tried!!!</li>
            <li> Love the product! Smells great, feels great on, absorbs quickly and leaves my skin moisturized without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and moisturized, I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This is very gentle, and feels great on the skin. I never had a reaction like I sometimes do when trying a new product.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful stuff!  After receiving one jar, I ordered another.  I live in the arid high mountains, and we need hydration. Also I am over 60.&lt;br /&gt;Many face creams seem to sit on the surface and form a seal.  This product penetrates and it smells lovely, not perfumey. I am developing a layering system, and using this as the base with another cream on top to &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34;.  They have done an amazing job inventing this product.</li>
            <li> I am giving this a neutral rating because I was not actually able to try it for any length of time to see if it worked on wrinkles.  The cream made me break out after the first use.  That does not mean it doesn&#x27;t work for some people, so that is why the 3 stars.  It just isn&#x27;t good for my skin.  The company has been very good in providing me with an immediate return label to ship it back.</li>
            <li> I am really in love with this product. It is great when you find a great product that&#x27;s made from great ingredients. No chemicals you have no clue about..nothing you can&#x27;t read and no heavy perfumes or dyes. This product made my skin so soft and it felt silky smooth. I love when a product does what it advertises to do. I will definitely buy from this line again.</li>
            <li> Very greasy! hated the smell! I returned this!</li>
            <li> Bought both this product &amp; the SERUM they make. A wonderful combination, especially if you live in the northeast where this winter just doesn&#x27;t want to stop! I really can&#x27;t say enough wonderful comments about this (these) products. My face really doesn&#x27;t feel&amp; look the same without them.  Thank u , thank u , thank u.</li>
            <li> Best product ever!!! Searched so long for something free of dyes, fragrances and harsh chemicals. Thought I had found one but turned it it had the preservative BHT. But now my search is over. This product is truly amazing!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE this cream.  My skin feels amazing</li>
            <li> I like it! The only thing is it&#x27;s a little bit oily if I don&#x27;t apply my moisturizing water before I apply this cream on my face!</li>
            <li> Great cream..excellent moisture..definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> A little greasy, but has natural ingredients which I like in a product .....  :) so will continue to use</li>
            <li> Was okay. Boing exceptional</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worked for a high end retail cosmetics line &amp; used their products for years with healthy glowing skin. Then I hit 50 years of age &amp; my skin changed.  I had dryness under my eyes and peeling skin on my eye lids. I could no longer use eyeshadow or cover up as the product would not go on smoothly.  Everything I used from the high end cosmetics to drug store brands burned my skin. I deceided to look for a made in the USA, organic and cruelty free product.  I tried this cream for eyes and face. It didn&#x27;t burn when I put it on and healed my cracked skin. I did break out a bit, but I was expecting that from working in cosmetics, people usually break out at first when switching skin care products. I started to reduce the amount I used &amp; my skin adjusted accordingly &amp; cleared up within a couple days. Now, my skin feels silky and I have noticed a softer look to my face. The key is to use a tiny amount and work it into your skin with light fingertip pressure. I like the light scent &amp; how long this will last me. Affordable compared to high end retail brands. The color looks green/yellowish in the jar, but goes on clear &amp; there is no powdery residue. I do use a spf 15 or spf 30 sunscreen over this product during the day, again, just a tiny amount to cover my face for sun protection. I also use the night cream (luxurious) &amp; I am going to purchase other products in this line. I would recommend this to anyone needing to heal their skin.</li>
            <li> I love this cream, and it makes my skin feel really soft and hydrated.  As the other reviews indicated, it does feel oily at first, so I use it as a night cream and also on days when I have time to spare before applying my makeup so that my skin has time to absorb it.  I especially love it after a day at the beach!</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer ever!!!! Next purchase will be the eye serum.</li>
            <li> After read the reviews in amazon, I held lots of hope for this product. I tried lots of moisture, but I&#x27;m not happy about their result on the wrinkle. So I decided to try this one. However, it is ABSOLUTELY NOT!&lt;br /&gt;I found this cream is greasy, looking like butter, and it doesn&#x27;t absorb well like other moisture I used. Meanwhile, it has some in-adorable smell,(I found similar review later, but didn&#x27;t pay attention before buying it), not strong, but I don&#x27;t like it. The packing looks cheap, and only a little more than half bottle. Because I still had other moisture left when I received this, when I opened this cream later and found these problems, it was too late to return it.&lt;br /&gt;Then I gave it a try, and deeply regret it now. My skin became RED and a little itchy after using several days. I don&#x27;t have sensitive nor dry skin, but for some reason my skin got problems for the FIRST time in my life, with this cream! I thought I ate something wrong and got allergy, but I cook myself and all the food are fresh and normal. Then I realized it&#x27;s this cream.&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using this cream for several days, and drunk lots of water everyday. The red gets better now. I don&#x27;t want to give another try because I found other similar reviews on red and itchy skin. I didn&#x27;t listen to these reviews before buying it, then I got paid by having problems of my skin. I&#x27;ll listen to them this time to protect myself!&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this cream is great for somebody, but definitely not me. Hope you could consider my story before wasting your money.</li>
            <li> My new favorite!  Natural ingredients, very moisturizing, lovely consistency and smell.</li>
            <li> I am rarely blown away by products, not because they may not be good but because I rarely see any difference in my skin.  As a young adult I worked as a skincare expert and a makeup artist so I&#x27;ve taken good care of my skin for about 25 years.  When I don&#x27;t see amazing results described by others I chalk it up to having taken good care of my skin for so long, and think others see results because maybe they have not been using good products forever. I can honestly say this product lives up to the reviews of others who love it.  I use it at night and it has not made my combination sensitive skin nose break out (unprecedented) and leaves my skin nicely moisturized and glowing the next day.  I&#x27;ve been able to cut back on the product I have put on my nose daily to combat breakouts, so I&#x27;m not battling dry, flaky nose skin anymore. Also, I&#x27;ve had a small dry red area on my face for years my dermatologist wouldn&#x27;t do anything about, and for the first time it no longer flakes and the redness is going away.  My neck and decollete look plumper and moisturized, too.  Other reviewers are right - a little goes a long way, and I like to have my hands slightly wet when using the product to thin it out more and help it to spread easily.  Great product, and I love that it is made naturally in Hawaii - Mahalo nui loa!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for sensitive and combination to dry skin! I highly recommend this product as a skin care professional. Works great under makeup and wonderful to use a small amount during the day and a bit more at night as a treatment! Lots of clients I work with rave about this cream! It&#x27;s definitely worth trying! The only downside is that you need to mix it about 1-2 times per week. BUT that&#x27;s a GOOD THING!! It means it&#x27;s all REAL INGREDIENTS that you can pronounce and are healthy and natural to your skin!! If your current cream stays the same all the time, something is not right and could do more harm than good to your sensitive facial skin!</li>
            <li> This is amazing! I love how good it moisturizes my skin without clogging it or making it oily. It doesn&#x27;t have perfumes in it so it doesn&#x27;t irritate, and a little goes a long way, this is not to be used in big quantities. Will be buying this and only this from now on!</li>
            <li> My new favorite moisturizer!  Silky smooth and totally organic... love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter.  She is very happy with the product , Thank you.</li>
            <li> Amazingly moisturizing. Very good product and it moisturizes unbelievably well! Love this stuff. Non-irritating and pleasant to use as it just glides on your face. A little goes a long way. Like the fact that it is natural!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best moisturizer out there on the market.  With happy bees from Hawaii how could you go wrong!  Try it.  Works well morning and night.  Hydrates the eye area as well.  I will be purchasing their body lotion cause I am so excited about the face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Received for free for review. I love using in the morning and at bedtime it works great for making my skin nice and soft and smooth. My skin already feels so much better with this product.</li>
            <li> You need a very small amount of this cream and it absorbs super quick. It leaves my face feeling silky smooth, and since I&#x27;ve started using this I have been getting nonstop compliments on my skin from my family and gf, who had seen it deteriorate over the last few months because of work. The ingredients are simple, and that was something very important to me. Because of that, there is some natural separation in the product, but I just use my finger to mix it once every other week. I have mixed skin, and this product has had no adverse effects in making my skin more oily or dry. It&#x27;s just perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only quarrel is that I wish the container was glass, or sealed a little better. Travelling with this is essentially impossible because the oil will leak.</li>
            <li> I just returned from a trip to Cape Cod. My skin has been slightly ravaged by sun and salt. I had ordered your product due to positive reviews. Lucky for me it was waiting at the door. You product is wonderful! The smell is nuetral and my skin feels nourished. Another positive is when my boyfriend kisses me there isn&#x27;t a nasty residual from the creme. A few reviews state it&#x27;s too thick. I disagree! One just needs to warm it up with your fingertips before you apply it. The anti aging factor abilities? We&amp;#34;ll see.😄. The customer service has been great. I recieved follow up notes asking how I liked the product. Very personal approach. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This cream is awesome!  It makes your skin feel so soft.  I have had several compliments. I will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product. It has softened my skin dramatically. I haven&#x27;t had a problem applying this under my make-up. A little goes a long way- I always let it sit a few minutes before actually applying my makeup and it goes on flawlessly. I use this twice a day. I highly recommend this, the quality is fantastic and it ships quickly!</li>
            <li> warning for acne people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer contains olive oil that can clog pores. Because of that my acne got really worse.. Before that, I was using teatree oil, almost removed all my acne, but with this moisturizer, All coming back.&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using it n that also stopped acne coming back, n I&#x27;m really sorry about that. Cause This cream was fantastic for my super dry skin. SUPER hydrating, which is damn work by olive oil.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m planing to give it to my mom n sure she will love this.</li>
            <li> I love the product.  When finished with the face and eye moisturizer, I will try more of their products.</li>
            <li> A good product and a good value.  Easy to use one product for eyes as well as the rest of your face.  Like that it&#x27;s natural.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t used it for very long, but it seems to be equivalent to other more expensive creams.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. My skin looks and feels fabulous. The first jar lasted 3 months with twice a day use. I absolutely love the fact I can use it as an eye cream and face/neck cream. No more multiple jars. Bee Friendly service seems to be outstanding with follow up emails, I have the feeling I will be taken care of if anything were to go wrong.</li>
            <li> Great product.  No more dry face :)</li>
            <li> This is by far the best moisturizer I have ever used on my face. Living in the northeast this winter has been brutal. Worse than ever before. My skin is very sensitive and I had not a single issue from the first use. Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> Lovely moisturizer.  I have other moisturizers to finish before I use this fulltime and am looking forward to that time.  It goes on easily , disappears into the skin, and my skin feels just wonderful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful moisturizer. I&#x27;ve always believed in olive oil for the skin, and this really delivers. My skin has improved after only one jar. The added essential oils are very pleasant. I just wish they would list which oils are in the product.</li>
            <li> Great product, does not leave my face oily when applied in small amounts. You don&#x27;t need any more than a small amount. My face looks clear an fresh.</li>
            <li> It is the best anti age product I have tried. I put some on my face for the first time yesterday and this morning the wrinkle in the middle of my forehead was dramatically reduced.  I am also so happy that the ingredients are all natural.  I will order this again!!</li>
            <li> I really do like this all natural cream. I love the thickness and the way it feels. Moistures my whole face and no need to reapply unless my skin is very dry that day! Awesome and would purchase again :)</li>
            <li> Its okay. Its natural so i guess it can&#x27;t do any harm. It feels more like thick oil and has a funky smell. I am not too crazy about it, Have been using it for 2 weeks straight. No major difference in skin. Skin is soft(mine wasn&#x27;t rough to begin with) was expecting it to ease some small wrinkles that are starting to form, but haven&#x27;t seen any help with that yet.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is just ok product. Don&#x27;t get the hype</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  Very thick and luxurious without being greasy!  The best part is not having to worry about what you are putting on your face.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my mother because i was curious about it. SHE LOVES IT! The quality is way beyond the price for it. Bonus, it smells like a dream.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I love the fact that it is 100% organic and that it is truly healthy for my skin;  It makes my skin feel soft and moisturized, and is absorbed fast so there is no greasy look or feel.  I have been using it for one week and expect that it will continue to improve the look of my skin.</li>
            <li> nice thick cream. happy w/ purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer.  It feels great on my face.</li>
            <li> I love this face cream.  Very moisturizing and gives my face a nice glow.  A little bit goes a long way.  I use it under my eyes as well.</li>
            <li> I never leave feedback for products, but this facial cream is absolutely outstanding! I have been searching high and low for an organic, clean (no chemicals) face cream for so long, and I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the one from BeeFriendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a very long way and my face stays moisturized all day. I don&#x27;t wear make-up and I don&#x27;t worry about having a little shine on my face, but if you do, I suggest using this as your night cream or at least waiting until it soaks in before applying make-up. It is highly moisturizing, but it does leave a little shimmer on your face initially because of the thickness and richness of the cream. I LOVE that it makes my face feel so soft and cared for. Also, there&#x27;s really not too much of a scent to this cream, which I find really wonderful since it&#x27;s a natural moisturizer and shouldn&#x27;t be loaded with scent anyway. It&#x27;s an all-around gem of a moisturizer and I am looking forward to trying other products in their line. Thank you for this excellent product, BeeFriendly!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Very moisturizing and hydrating. Leaves my skin feeling so smooth and soft. A little goes a long way so it only takes the smallest amount to cover my entire face. Very gentle and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.&lt;br /&gt;Customer service at this company is amazing. They stand behind their products and care that the customers are happy. I will be buying more from this company and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> So far, this cream has been great! I little goes a long way and my skin does not feel greasy at all.</li>
            <li> great customer service and product</li>
            <li> Feels silky going on my face. I have received several compliments on how young I am lloking since using the cream</li>
            <li> This super-concentrated moisturizer took a couple of uses to get used to using so LITTLE of it!  A tiny amount does a great job of moisurizing - even older skin.  This product is amazing; it is a gift I appreciate!!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  It doesn&#x27;t sting around your eyes and it moisturizes your skin.  It doesn&#x27;t make it feel tight like some age defying creams do, but that is why I like it.  The smell is okay, smells like honey.  They say because it is organic you have to stir yours for separation, but I haven&#x27;t had to stir mine.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Very greasy...only to be used at night if you have naturally oily skin.</li>
            <li> If you have dry patches on your skin or just dry skin, this will completely take care of your problem. I had been using shea butter all over my face at night after using tretoinen. I always had embarrassing scaly patches. Within two days they never resurfaced again. This is my second jar. I use it as a night cream because it&#x27;s rich enough. I don&#x27;t Iike the price but ats also an eye cream so it&#x27;s not that bad. This is the stuff.</li>
            <li> After just 2 uses, the skin around my eyes is much softer.  Thanks for the great product!</li>
            <li> 5 Star cream!  Absolutely cannot beat it for the price.  I received as sample in my Ipsy subscription and got hooked.  My skin is so soft and supple and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores at all.  I&#x27;m only 24 but I am big on moisturization and skin care.  Want to keep this skin looking and feeling young!  I have to give a 5-star just for customer service.  I never received my package and complained and the seller sent me a jar free of charge with expedited shipping.  I will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> 5 Stars on this product! Really like the product &amp; the results! Thank you Bee Friendly!</li>
            <li> a LITTLE goes a LONG way. feels like silk on skin. EXCELLENT customer service. I buy alot of face products &amp; I would highly recommend trying this product.</li>
            <li> Nice organic eye cream causes no problems for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!!! I live in ND and the winter is hard on my face it was always dry. This did the trick!!! My face feels AMAZING!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product with amazing results. Goes on silky smooth and dries enough to put a base foundation on. It&#x27;s all natural and effective</li>
            <li> Very nice morsturizer. I like the way it makes my skin feel. I like that it&#x27;s an all natural product and feel like I&#x27;m doing something good for my skin.</li>
            <li> Wonderful affordable product.  Not greasy on my skin, no nasty perfume smell.  Great that i have the luxury to rub it around my eye area as well. Feels natural on my skin.  ;)&lt;br /&gt;Much mahalos beefriendly.  Put your product on the skin deep ap ;)</li>
            <li> Great results to far.</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer! One of the main reasons that I like it is that it does not cause breakouts which is a huge plus!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this moisturizer. I never seem to have enough moisture on my skin, and once I figured out the correct amount to apply, I became a fan. At first, I was applying too large a dab - it was way oily, and impossible to apply makeup. Now, I simply swipe out a small dab and&lt;br /&gt;dot my face and neck before massaging in the cream. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice any miraculous results, so cannot speak to that.&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, it feels like it is moisturizing my skin, feels incredibly soft, and is hopefully providing nourishment as well.</li>
            <li> Wow, this product is so awesome and moisturizing for my super flakey and dry skin.  I use the CerVe Cream first on my super dry sensitive skin and then I put this on.  It makes my face feel truly moisturized and super soft in the morning.  I also do this same thing in the morning but use a little less of this and my face feels very comfortable all day even into the evening without feeling like my face is going to dry out underneath my foundation.  Great buy and great price.</li>
            <li> The best cream for dry skin. My skin is never dry again even in winter time. I love it. The price is also very reasonable.</li>
            <li> My second time ordering.  This is a great product!  One of the nicest face creams I&#x27;ve ever tried so far.  Love the ingredients, consistency, and mild scent.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream.  It is not oily and feels good on my face.  I like that I can also used it close to my eyes without any irritation.  The cream is excellent in holding moisture in the skin and has a plumping anti wrinkle effect.  There is no noticeable scent. I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product, so rich and smooth, I love it!!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy. My skin looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> Suck ...looking cheap and only half bottle smell so bad neverbuy again</li>
            <li> Nothing removes wrinkles but good moisturizers like this one temporarily plumps up and fills in fine lines.  My husband rolled over in bed the first night I wore it and said, &amp;#34;I smell scones&amp;#34; we had a good laugh and I told him it was my new moisturizer with honey in it.  The smell is a bit strong for both of us.  I was surprised it did not aggravate or increase my acne and it gave my skin a nice healthy glow.  I have a surplus of moisturizers: Ageloc, Skinceuticals, Skinmedica, Elta MD, Nerium, Glymed...there are not many high quality products that I have not tried yet. This one is a keeper because it is both affordable and moisturizes adequately.</li>
            <li> This cream is so rich and smells GREAT.Love this purchase and I would defenetly recommend to everyone to nourish the skin Especially on winter time.</li>
            <li> Feels wonderful on the skin and I can see a real difference in my complection. Reccommend using with Bee Friendly Mask.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Natural and cleared up a dry skin problem I was having.</li>
            <li> Loved the Best Face and Eye Moisurizer. I use it morning and night and love the fact that I can use it on my face as well as under my eyes. I can definitely feel it keeping my whole face moisturized! Love it!</li>
            <li> A friend recently told me about Best Face and Eye Moisturizer by Bee Friendly Skincare.  I really try to use only natural organic skincare products.  I placed my order and immediately had my order (I believe it was within a day or two!!  GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!  I have been using the Best Face and Eye Moisturizer for 2 weeks now and I can already see an improvement in my skin.  I LOVE IT and recommend.  It is nice to find something that is good for your skin, is reasonable and truly works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my night time cream and I also put in on before I work out. it works really good.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizing cream.  At first I thought it was too oily when I put it on, but found it really absorbs into the skin, leaving it silky soft.  I am especially happy about the lack of artificial ingredients.  I used to use Aubrey Organics moisturizers for years, but ditched them when they came out with their flashier, non user-friendly containers, and frankly I find this Bee Friendly product far superior.  So glad I switched!</li>
            <li> Loving this cream! My face is smooth and soft, no more bumps! Great for dry skin. I am looking younger and more fresh. Very happy with this product. I am 57.</li>
