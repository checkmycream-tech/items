    <ol>
            <li>Conditioner works great!</li>
            <li>The scent is great!</li>
            <li>Problem is the conditioner is not all that wonderful.</li>
            <li>This is a great combo to change to for variety.</li>
            <li>I got this for use after her swim class and thought the moisturizing would be good after all the chlorine as well.</li>
            <li>works good without added weight</li>
            <li>Love this line from Dove!</li>
            <li>This conditioner has a great scent and feels rich and creamy.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is better than the shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love love love this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell, the wash it washes and how my hair dries and styles with it.</li>
            <li>my goodness I am in love with Dove Oxygen Moisture Conditioner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a horrible product considering</li>
            <li>I may have to use this a bit more to judge.</li>
            <li>The bottle looks cool!</li>
            <li>When used with the shampoo it leaves my hair manageable and easy to style.</li>
            <li>Use this with every wash and my hair is tangle free and easy to style.</li>
            <li>The fragrance was light</li>
            <li>I will definitely pay the extra money for it but the best way to order it is to &amp;#34;add</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty cheap, but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li>but I’m looking for something more to make hair look and feel real soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Gentle and light weight</li>
            <li>It gives great volume and my hair smells fantastic for at least 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Thrilled I do not have to pay salon prices for a quality conditioner that actually works on my hair!</li>
            <li>I wish bigger botltles were available!</li>
            <li>It made my hair feel so light and soft.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is different than most because it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair waxy.</li>
            <li>If anything I think the dry oil line by Dove is better.</li>
            <li>My hair is also thick so this product may be more suited to fine hair.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t had much luck in making it appeare fuller.</li>
            <li>This conditioner was light and left my hair with a lot of body and bounce.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m very liberal with conditioner, pouring it in, and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I have fine to normal hair and after drying, it doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling waxy or heavy.</li>
            <li>I could see maybe a little volume in my hair but the most notable was the residue it seemed to leave behind.</li>
            <li>so I had high hopes of this adding some extra moisturizing to my hair.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend this one (second only to the Dove Pure Care Dry Oil Conditioner).</li>
            <li>recently received a sample and it keeps hair soft.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m a dad, and I know little about girls hair, but when I have to wash my daughter&#x27;s hair, which for some reason seems to become a birdsnest on a daily basis, I need something to help smooth all the tangles that doesn&#x27;t result in her crying from pulled hair.</li>

            <li> This conditioner is much more expensive than other mid level brand conditioners.</li>
            <li> Even with this conditioner, my hair felt dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> Made my hair extremely dry and made my face, neck and hairline break out.</li>
            <li> but when my hair is dry ( I air dry)</li>
            <li> it looks and feels dry.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comb my hair either dry or wet after using this without my hair breaking off or tangling.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry</li>
            <li> Girls with thick dry natural curly hair listen up.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel well conditioned while its still wet</li>
            <li> I found out about this Shampoo/Conditioner line from one of my favorite beauty bloggers and it hasn&#x27;t disappointed me.</li>
            <li> and it wasnt weighed down at all.</li>
            <li> I have had a lot of trouble with some other conditioners leaving my hair with a waxy, weighed down feeling.</li>
            <li> Caused me to develop itchy little bumps on my forehead and along my hairline.</li>
            <li> BUT IT IS FOR US curly tops with thick hair too!</li>
            <li> The Dove oxygen care package says it is for thin hair</li>
            <li> Granted the shampoo of the same line is god awfully drying, but this conditioner is like using water on your hair afterwards, might as well save your money and use nothing.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair</li>

            <li> Conditioner works great! recently received a sample and it keeps hair soft. The conditioner is better than the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love this line from Dove! Use this with every wash and my hair is tangle free and easy to style.</li>
            <li> Gentle and light weight</li>
            <li> I found out about this Shampoo/Conditioner line from one of my favorite beauty bloggers and it hasn&#x27;t disappointed me. I now use this as my staple shampoo/conditioner and it gives me bounce/volume and makes my hair feel lighter overall.  I always recommend this to my friends/sisters.  It&#x27;s one of my favorites now.  I wish bigger botltles were available!</li>
            <li> This conditioner does not condition at all. I can&#x27;t comb my hair either dry or wet after using this without my hair breaking off or tangling. Granted the shampoo of the same line is god awfully drying, but this conditioner is like using water on your hair afterwards, might as well save your money and use nothing.</li>
            <li> When used with the shampoo it leaves my hair manageable and easy to style. This is a great combo to change to for variety.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair and I haven&#x27;t had much luck in making it appeare fuller. I used this once and saw instant results. It made my hair feel so light and soft. I will continue to buy this line!</li>
            <li> Love love love this shampoo and conditioner.  I love the smell, the wash it washes and how my hair dries and styles with it.</li>
            <li> Girls with thick dry natural curly hair listen up. The Dove oxygen care package says it is for thin hair BUT IT IS FOR US curly tops with thick hair too! Ohh my goodness I am in love with Dove Oxygen Moisture Conditioner. Thrilled I do not have to pay salon prices for a quality conditioner that actually works on my hair! IT smells divine too! Do yourself a favor and try it! You will not be sorry !</li>
            <li> Caused me to develop itchy little bumps on my forehead and along my hairline. It left my hair with no shine and frizzy. It&#x27;s not a horrible product considering it&#x27;s pretty cheap, but it&#x27;s not for me. If anything I think the dry oil line by Dove is better.</li>
            <li> MAKES MY SKIN BREAK OUT.</li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t do it for me in terms of smell, or the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> The scent is great! The bottle looks cool! Problem is the conditioner is not all that wonderful. I could see maybe a little volume in my hair but the most notable was the residue it seemed to leave behind. Even with this conditioner, my hair felt dry and brittle. Would not use again.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is different than most because it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair waxy. I have had a lot of trouble with some other conditioners leaving my hair with a waxy, weighed down feeling. I have fine to normal hair and after drying, it doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling waxy or heavy. It gives great volume and my hair smells fantastic for at least 24 hours. The only downside to this conditioner is the price. This conditioner is much more expensive than other mid level brand conditioners. I will definitely pay the extra money for it but the best way to order it is to &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34; to a pre-existing order. By doing this you pay 50% the price you would pay ordering it individually!</li>
            <li> Made my hair extremely dry and made my face, neck and hairline break out.</li>
            <li> This conditioner was light and left my hair with a lot of body and bounce. I only used it to condition my hair (without using the shampoo from this line). I had no residue on my hair and it wasnt weighed down at all. The fragrance was light and I would highly recommend this one (second only to the Dove Pure Care Dry Oil Conditioner).</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m a dad, and I know little about girls hair, but when I have to wash my daughter&#x27;s hair, which for some reason seems to become a birdsnest on a daily basis, I need something to help smooth all the tangles that doesn&#x27;t result in her crying from pulled hair. So I&#x27;m very liberal with conditioner, pouring it in, and it gets the job done. I got this for use after her swim class and thought the moisturizing would be good after all the chlorine as well.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has a great scent and feels rich and creamy. My hair is very dry so I had high hopes of this adding some extra moisturizing to my hair. It makes my hair feel well conditioned while its still wet but when my hair is dry ( I air dry) it looks and feels dry.  It leaves me with flyaways. My hair is also thick so this product may be more suited to fine hair.</li>
            <li> I like the way that it makes the hair bouncy but I’m looking for something more to make hair look and feel real soft and silky. I may have to use this a bit more to judge.</li>
            <li> works good without added weight</li>
