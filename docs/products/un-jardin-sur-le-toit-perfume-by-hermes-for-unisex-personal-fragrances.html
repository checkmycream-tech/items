            <li>I can spray a decent amount of this on and feel great.  </li>
            <li>Most fragrances tend to be too strong and give me a headache.  </li>
            <li>love the fact that it is light and refreshing..</li>
            <li>Unlike most light fragrances this one doesn&#x27;t lose it&#x27;s edge after 20 mins.  </li>
            <li>Girlfriend loved it, that is really all that matters .  </li>
            <li>I love it because it has a unique smell that reminds me of gardens.</li>
            <li>You will be amazed at how fresh, light and spring-like it smells!</li>
            <li>It is truly fantastic.</li>
            <li>Light flowery scent, very fresh - not over powering.  </li>
            <li>Very fresh scent.</li>
            <li>it is light and really unique, and I like that it is a grown up smell.</li>
            <li>It smells so perfectly clean and literally makes me want to smell myself when I wear it.</li>
            <li>I used it when I got back onboard the ship and the fragrance was so sweet and refreshing!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend for someone who likes fresh, light fragrances!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for a creative, sophisticated modern man that wants to have a scent unlike anything else out there.</li>
            <li>I still like it because the smell is fresh and not so overpowering.  </li>
            <li>My favorite is still D&amp;G light blue though.</li>
            <li>I am beyond THRILLED with this complex, clean, SEXY fragrance.</li>
            <li>Sephora, and it looks exactly right.</li>
            <li>It came quickly, and overall i am 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li>I am stopped consistently and asked what I am wearing.</li>
            <li>spoiled apples layered with crisp apples,&lt;br /&gt;Fresh cut grass and carrot juice,&lt;br /&gt;Carrot and tomatoes and salt,&lt;br /&gt;Back</li>
            <li>Bought a real Hermes perfume today.</li>
            <li>A real hermes lasts days.</li>
            <li>I really like this perfume.</li>
            <li>Still, I personally love it as its definitely for those with character that love green nature aromas.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d gotten many compliments from other guests</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to perfumes, and so I have to be pretty particular about which I choose.</li>
            <li>As is consistent with Hermes&#x27; Un Jardin line, Le Toit is a natural smelling fruit fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Le Hermes being one of the few out there to actually manufacturer their own product using higher quality ingredients and doesn&#x27;t give me a headache like so many other fragrances on the market.</li>
            <li>I wanted to leave a quick review to let other potentially interested buyers know - the perfume that I got was real.</li>
            <li>and I do think that it wears off a little like others say, but I am ok with that</li>
            <li>Fresh, green, fruity, sweet.</li>
            <li>I was shopping in a nice perfume shop in St. Barts I&#x27;d been to a few years prior when I found the bottle I was searching for.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>

            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just not a masculine fragrance.</li>
            <li> Although this is a unisex fragrance it definitely skews slightly towards male side of the spectrum.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was atrocious: I pay annual Prime fees and expect 2-day shipping (okay, an extra day or two wouldn&#x27;t kill me), but this package got lost in translation somewhere in its journey across America, and took a week to get to California.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> down to lingering flowers,&lt;br /&gt;The sweetness of over-ripened apples.</li>
            <li> A little closer to the women&#x27;s side of the unisex marketing, I still borrow this from my wife on a sunny occasion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Opens really green and vegetal,&lt;br /&gt;Slightly</li>
            <li> /&gt;The grassy notes tone down and balance the apple and pear notes, so that it doesn&#x27;t smell like conditioner; Pear in fragrances always makes me cautious because of frags usually entering the hair product zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve officially obsessed with Hermes.  </li>
            <li> Just realized it was fake.</li>
            <li> FAKE!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Light flowery scent, very fresh - not over powering.  A wonderful indulgence.</li>
            <li> This smells sooooo good.  Great price!!</li>
            <li> This fragrance is amazing. It is unisex but I truly find it almost suits a man better. It smells so perfectly clean and literally makes me want to smell myself when I wear it. I am stopped consistently and asked what I am wearing. It also stays with me thru the day and can smell it on my clothes when doing laundry, so those reviews they say doesn&#x27;t stick with you are incorrect in my opinion. Highly recommend for a creative, sophisticated modern man that wants to have a scent unlike anything else out there.</li>
            <li> What a scent!  I&#x27;ve officially obsessed with Hermes.  Most fragrances tend to be too strong and give me a headache.  I can spray a decent amount of this on and feel great.  If anything, I am blowing thru the bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! I am very sensitive to perfumes, and so I have to be pretty particular about which I choose. I&#x27;m almost through my 3rd bottle of this and I still can&#x27;t get enough. It is very light (which I like) and I do think that it wears off a little like others say, but I am ok with that because I think the light, refreshing smell is perfect! Highly recommend for someone who likes fresh, light fragrances!</li>
            <li> Great and not over bearing fragrance for the springtime. ..love the fact that it is light and refreshing..like candy..sweet and powdery</li>
            <li> Bought a real Hermes perfume today. I Bought from this seller six months ago, it was cheaper, smelled the same. Just realized it was fake. Lasts on my skin for ten minutes. A real hermes lasts days. DO NOT BUY. FAKE!</li>
            <li> no way is this a unisex fragrance.  it&#x27;s totally feminine.  couldnt even imagine a man using this.  it&#x27;s just not a masculine fragrance.</li>
            <li> I sampled this aroma at an Hermes store and loved it. I was delighted to find it on Amazon at a very good price. Even the box was lovely. It makes me dream of returning to Paris.</li>
            <li> I wanted to leave a quick review to let other potentially interested buyers know - the perfume that I got was real. I compared it to an authentic bottle @ Sephora, and it looks exactly right. Batch numbers on the bottom of the bottle match the batch number printed onto the box. Shipping was atrocious: I pay annual Prime fees and expect 2-day shipping (okay, an extra day or two wouldn&#x27;t kill me), but this package got lost in translation somewhere in its journey across America, and took a week to get to California.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent itself is intoxicating: Fresh, green, fruity, sweet. After spraying and waiting, here are my scent notes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opens really green and vegetal,&lt;br /&gt;Slightly spoiled apples layered with crisp apples,&lt;br /&gt;Fresh cut grass and carrot juice,&lt;br /&gt;Carrot and tomatoes and salt,&lt;br /&gt;Back to grass and lemons and sunshine, salt lingers&lt;br /&gt;Dies down to lingering flowers,&lt;br /&gt;The sweetness of over-ripened apples.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend he had some that he had gotten when overseas in the navy and we could not find it in the states smells wonderful</li>
            <li> My signature fragrance - and it&#x27;s absolutely spectacular. Light, clean, grassy, smells like a beautiful garden in Italy....love it! Mulitple compliments every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> this is my fav, and it doesn&#x27;t break the bank</li>
            <li> Although this is a unisex fragrance it definitely skews slightly towards male side of the spectrum.  Unlike most light fragrances this one doesn&#x27;t lose it&#x27;s edge after 20 mins.  Le Hermes being one of the few out there to actually manufacturer their own product using higher quality ingredients and doesn&#x27;t give me a headache like so many other fragrances on the market.</li>
            <li> Just love it. Thought I would just wear it in the spring but this year I&#x27;ve been wearing it through the fall/winter. Definitely a great price. It&#x27;s a $100 at Sephora and Bloomingdale&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I was shopping in a nice perfume shop in St. Barts I&#x27;d been to a few years prior when I found the bottle I was searching for.  When I paid for my purchase, I was given two samples and one was this Hermes.  I used it when I got back onboard the ship and the fragrance was so sweet and refreshing!  I&#x27;d gotten many compliments from other guests so I decided to look it up when I got home.  I hadn&#x27;t seen it in any store around, so I turned to Amazon and there it was!  I&#x27;m out again and since I&#x27;m not headed to St. Barts any time soon, so I&#x27;ll have to order another bottle here.  You will be amazed at how fresh, light and spring-like it smells!</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loved it, that is really all that matters .  Also helped that it was thirty dollars cheaper than nordstrom.</li>
            <li> I really like this perfume. it is light and really unique, and I like that it is a grown up smell. The cost of this was 50 dollars cheaper than buying it through Nordstrom, which is amazing! It came quickly, and overall i am 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> As is consistent with Hermes&#x27; Un Jardin line, Le Toit is a natural smelling fruit fragrance.  A little closer to the women&#x27;s side of the unisex marketing, I still borrow this from my wife on a sunny occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grassy notes tone down and balance the apple and pear notes, so that it doesn&#x27;t smell like conditioner; Pear in fragrances always makes me cautious because of frags usually entering the hair product zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not as citrusy as Le Nil, not as earthy as Mediterranee, and not as rotten fruit-like as Mousson.  Women should appreciate this one!</li>
            <li> love love love it! Very fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Blessings to everyone who wrote a review on this fragrance!! You were so clear and thrilled with this beautiful fragrance that I bot it. It arrived today! WOW! I am beyond THRILLED with this complex, clean, SEXY fragrance. I LOVE a great fragrance and haven&#x27;t had one in many YEARS. Bingo!! I haven&#x27;t never had one built like this. It is truly fantastic. Not since ANTONIA&#x27;S FLOWERS have I felt so well shown and shared by a fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;No matter how we laud this fragrance~ our words can&#x27;t approach the experience of this exquisite beauty! THE perfect Spring treat!</li>
            <li> I went to the store to smell this parfume.  I sprayed it on the paper that they had provided.  I really liked the smell on the paper so I decided to purchase it from Amazon.  Now that I have been using it, it doesn&#x27;t smell the same on my body.  I still like it because the smell is fresh and not so overpowering.  My favorite is still D&amp;G light blue though.</li>
            <li> Love this scent, Saved about 40.00 over retail.&lt;br /&gt;Authentic IMOP</li>
            <li> This perfume is not for everyone. I love it because it has a unique smell that reminds me of gardens. However, sometimes it might feel kinda heaving when you are in the mood of something lighter. Still, I personally love it as its definitely for those with character that love green nature aromas.</li>
