            <li>You can&#x27;t complain about this product and the price was as good as Walmart too.</li>
            <li>lol Thanks for the  great prices too AMAZON!</li>
            <li>Works great without strong deodorant perfume.  </li>
            <li>It smells amazing and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>However, I still buy the plum kind on occasion, just for variety.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked Dove products, so I decided to give their deodorant a shot.</li>
            <li>It smells really nice too.</li>
            <li>Fragrance is nice.</li>
            <li>This deodorant is just like any dove kind you buy at the store.  </li>
            <li>IS A GREAT ADDITION TO THE LINE OF DOVE&#x27;S GO FRESH REBALANCE PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li>the cucumber scent was my first love, but Dove kept on putting out more great scents.  </li>
            <li>I love this deodorant and plan to get the body wash as well.</li>
            <li>I prefer the pomegranate-scented variety a bit more.  </li>
            <li>and I am glad that I used it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell as well.</li>
            <li>Lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li>i love this smell.</li>
            <li>:) i love dove, they always know how to treat me</li>
            <li>then after a couple hours it don&#x27;t seem to work any more.  </li>
            <li>have had better deodorant</li>
            <li>I put in many items on here for her and the kids.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found it here.</li>
            <li>My favorite Dove product&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>If you like dove you will love this one product.</li>
            <li>this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>and i love dove products</li>
            <li>my own taste, the smell of this plum and sakura deodorant is a bit too sweet, for lack of a better word.  </li>
            <li>maybe I got used to the smell because it wasn&#x27;t so strong anymore.</li>
            <li>I love Subscribe and Save, and this is another worthy choice on that program.</li>
            <li>Love this light fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>Smell is so so compared to other Dove deodorants, kind of fruity but good price</li>
            <li>I smelled it at first, but then the more I used it</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found this very nice, fresh without being overbearingly fruity scent on the shelf at my local grocery store.</li>
            <li>I bought dove deodorant and for the first time was able to get the new plum scented deodorant and love it.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful, kind of like fruit and cedar/pine, and stays fresh a long time without getting that sour smell.</li>
            <li>The smell is very mild and once you wear in the morning it works whole day.</li>
            <li>My favorite anti-perspirant by far!</li>
            <li>although not as powerful.</li>
            <li>Smells fresh and not overpowering, but there is sweat breakthrough.</li>
            <li>DOVE GO FRESH ANTIPERSPIRANT DEODORANT, REBLANCE</li>
            <li>Like many folks, I&#x27;ve got sensitive underarms.</li>
            <li>VERY GOOD DEOORANT NO WHITE SMEARS ON YOUR CLOTHES AND KEEPS YOU FRESH AND DRY ALL DAY</li>
            <li>RIGHT HERE ON AMAZON.</li>
            <li>very sweet, fruity, and natural.  </li>
            <li>The deodorant is okay, but not good/strong enough to keep me fresh all day.</li>
            <li>I rarely (if ever) have an issue of getting it on my clothes (I apply it after getting dressed); however, if you ever do get any on your shirt, rub it with pantyhose (yes, really) and that will take the deodorant stains right off.  </li>
            <li>They moisturize and do exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>Every time you get hot the smell comes out</li>
            <li>It worked well for me during these hot summer days and that&#x27;s all I ask for is a deodorant that will work.</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that when the dispenser is almost empty/pushed to the top, the &amp;#34;puck&amp;#34; of deodorant gets wobbly and can fall out, wasting a good chunk of usable product.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the whole dove line of products, but I think my other deodorant did a better job at keeping my dry.</li>
            <li>Now after a work out I need to head straight for the shower and then reapply, but that is with any deodorant for me.</li>
            <li>YOU CAN CHECK OUT DOVE&#x27;S WHOLE LINE</li>
            <li>It really does smell like plum, not like a Jolly Rancher or Slurpee like a lot of \\&quot;fruit\\&quot; scented products.</li>
            <li>This is a great add on to any order because a 2-pk costs less than a single at rite-aid/Walgreens and the like.</li>
            <li>scent and nice feeling as usual</li>
            <li>the scent is a little strong when first put it on.  </li>
            <li>A good way to test whether you will like the scent is to go to the store and sniff the body washes from the same line (since the deodorant is usually sealed for protection).</li>
            <li>I wanted to try a new scent</li>
            <li>first time ans will buy the same product again</li>
            <li>It was fun to go shopping on here and add allot of the things you can&#x27;t afford as a single parent to it.</li>
            <li>I was happy because I was able to get a double pack at a price that was less expensive than going to my local stores and with my Prime account</li>
            <li>With my busy schedule</li>
            <li>I really like the smell &amp; have been using Dove for at least 14 years now, thanks for making new scents &amp; keeping the old scents to boot!!</li>
            <li>Subtle, easy on sensitive skin, and works as an antiperspirant for upwards of 24 hours.</li>
            <li>even the little kids were excited to open the goody box...</li>
            <li>/&gt;This lasts quite a long time and is effective enough that I never have to fear embarrassment from deodorant failure.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and especially during the summer have to watch what products I use and have been using Dove Deodorant because I never have any problems with my skin.</li>
            <li>This is an okay alternative to Secret Clinical Strength..</li>

            <li> This is an okay alternative to Secret Clinical Strength.. although not as powerful.</li>
            <li> Very Happy with my order!! :)</li>
            <li> unfortunately this product does not work. It is neither an antiperspirant nor a deodorant, and has no trace of plum sakura fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dove deodorant and body wash because I think the products are great.  They moisturize and do exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to do.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant and plan to get the body wash as well. The price was good and the frangrance is awsome!! Every time you get hot the smell comes out</li>
            <li> Have to reapply this deodorant since it does not last like other deodorants do. Smells fresh and not overpowering, but there is sweat breakthrough.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and there are very few anti-perspirants/deodorants I can use without getting itchy.  This line from Dove is one of the only ones left that works for me.  I can use any and all of the scents from the Dove Ultimate line without issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lasts quite a long time and is effective enough that I never have to fear embarrassment from deodorant failure.  I rarely (if ever) have an issue of getting it on my clothes (I apply it after getting dressed); however, if you ever do get any on your shirt, rub it with pantyhose (yes, really) and that will take the deodorant stains right off.  (I typically wear dark-colored clothing.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my own taste, the smell of this plum and sakura deodorant is a bit too sweet, for lack of a better word.  I prefer the pomegranate-scented variety a bit more.  However, I still buy the plum kind on occasion, just for variety.  A good way to test whether you will like the scent is to go to the store and sniff the body washes from the same line (since the deodorant is usually sealed for protection).</li>
            <li> The deodorant is okay, but not good/strong enough to keep me fresh all day. Perhaps i wil try another one sometime.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the whole dove line of products, but I think my other deodorant did a better job at keeping my dry.</li>
            <li> The price is what drew my attention and I am glad that I used it. It worked well for me during these hot summer days and that&#x27;s all I ask for is a deodorant that will work. I smelled it at first, but then the more I used it maybe I got used to the smell because it wasn&#x27;t so strong anymore.

            <li> DOVE GO FRESH ANTIPERSPIRANT DEODORANT, REBLANCE IS A GREAT ADDITION TO THE LINE OF DOVE&#x27;S GO FRESH REBALANCE PRODUCTS. YOU CAN CHECK OUT DOVE&#x27;S WHOLE LINE RIGHT HERE ON AMAZON.</li>
            <li> This is a great add on to any order because a 2-pk costs less than a single at rite-aid/Walgreens and the like.</li>
            <li> My fave scent. Can&#x27;t find in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Lovely fragrance. Helps prevent irritation after shaving.</li>
            <li> The smell is very mild and once you wear in the morning it works whole day. I like this product.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell &amp; have been using Dove for at least 14 years now, thanks for making new scents &amp; keeping the old scents to boot!! You have made m a very happy customer!!</li>
            <li> Plum and Sakura Blossom Scent. My mother hates anything Raspberry and she says it smells a little like that. I didn&#x27;t think so but I like raspberries. It&#x27;s not the best smelling scent but it works.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and especially during the summer have to watch what products I use and have been using Dove Deodorant because I never have any problems with my skin. I bought dove deodorant and for the first time was able to get the new plum scented deodorant and love it. It smells really nice too. I was happy because I was able to get a double pack at a price that was less expensive than going to my local stores and with my Prime account had it delivered to my door within two days.</li>
            <li> Like many folks, I&#x27;ve got sensitive underarms. For some reason, almost all solid antiperspirant instantly causes my skin to get ingrown hairs, rashes, etc. I was stuck using gels - which worked alright, no skin complaints - but never seemed to offer the dryness protection of solids, and would always rub off on my clothes before drying on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter this antiperspirant. It smells wonderful, kind of like fruit and cedar/pine, and stays fresh a long time without getting that sour smell. It does come off a little on clothing, but I&#x27;ve never seen it make a stain. My only complaint is that when the dispenser is almost empty/pushed to the top, the &amp;#34;puck&amp;#34; of deodorant gets wobbly and can fall out, wasting a good chunk of usable product.</li>
            <li> i love this smell. makes me happy to smell myslef all day. :) i love dove, they always know how to treat me</li>
            <li> Works well and I like getting a two pack.  Good deal, it is cheaper on Amazon than in the store.</li>
            <li> the scent is a little strong when first put it on.  then after a couple hours it don&#x27;t seem to work any more.  have had better deodorant</li>
            <li> I bought a goody box of stuff for my daughter who is a single mom and this is one of the things in it. You can&#x27;t complain about this product and the price was as good as Walmart too. It was fun to go shopping on here and add allot of the things you can&#x27;t afford as a single parent to it. She called me up and said MOM what surprise and thank you! I put in many items on here for her and the kids. She runs a child care and even the little kids were excited to open the goody box...lol Thanks for the  great prices too AMAZON!</li>
            <li> The only deodorant my daughter and I will use.  It&#x27;s lame that it&#x27;s off the shelves and I have to buy them online.</li>
            <li> It works as expected. Fragrance is nice. Subtle and not overbearing. This is a great size too. Should last a normal person at least a couple of months.</li>
            <li> I love Subscribe and Save, and this is another worthy choice on that program. I haven&#x27;t found this very nice, fresh without being overbearingly fruity scent on the shelf at my local grocery store. I&#x27;m glad I found it here. It really does smell like plum, not like a Jolly Rancher or Slurpee like a lot of \\&quot;fruit\\&quot; scented products. Subtle, easy on sensitive skin, and works as an antiperspirant for upwards of 24 hours.</li>
            <li> My favorite Dove product&lt;br /&gt;Not first time ans will buy the same product again&lt;br /&gt;Nice scent and nice feeling as usual</li>
            <li> I mean its deodorant what can I say? If you like dove you will love this one product. It smells great as I was hoping. Works great but I used dove already. If you like dove I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This deodorant is just like any dove kind you buy at the store.  It&#x27;s a great deal for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is, why did Amazon make it signature confirm???  I had to take time out of my day to go pick it up from UPS bc they required a signature, and it was just a two pack of deodorant!  Come on Amazon, get a grip!</li>
            <li> Love this light fresh scent.  Works great without strong deodorant perfume.  Sadly this fragrance is hard to find - but I love it!</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD DEOORANT NO WHITE SMEARS ON YOUR CLOTHES AND KEEPS YOU FRESH AND DRY ALL DAY</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Dove deodorant for years.  the cucumber scent was my first love, but Dove kept on putting out more great scents.  this one is my favorite.  it smells great.  very sweet, fruity, and natural.  it doesnt smell artificial at all.  it keeps me dry all day, although I do reapply before working out for extra protection.</li>
            <li> My favorite anti-perspirant by far! It smells amazing and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> With my busy schedule I just caved in and picked up my deodorant on Amazon. I knew I wasn&#x27;t going to have time to shop that week and was running low and i&#x27;m glad I did. The price was comparable to the local drug store. I wanted to try a new scent and it&#x27;s very pleasant. The scent, unfortunately, doesn&#x27;t last terribly long once applied, but the antiperspirant works very very well. No sweat or stink!</li>
            <li> Smell is so so compared to other Dove deodorants, kind of fruity but good price and i love dove products</li>
