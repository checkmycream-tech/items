            <li>The scissors is nice and good quality.</li>
            <li>Scissors are a good value but not as good as the scissors costing 5 times more.  </li>
            <li>these scissors are amazing</li>
            <li>staff member liked</li>
            <li>And I guess because of the kind of product it is, every time it&#x27;d refuse to cut, I would think nothing of it and just attempt it three or four times until it worked.</li>
            <li>Amazon itself is more than good.</li>
            <li>The comb is kind of a joke...  </li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t flimsy like the kind you get in nail trimming kits.</li>
            <li>I bought this set looking for a nice set of scissors to keep my bear trimmed.</li>
            <li>mustache trim perfectly and have a nice clean cut.. very easy to handle and very convenient ..</li>
            <li>For the price I was quite pleased.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>Most satisfied with my purchase of these products.</li>
            <li>Ended up pulling a couple hairs out forcibly.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>so I just kept using the better ones I already had.  </li>
            <li>I just stick with the comb that came with my electric hair trimmer since it fits better in my hand and doesn&#x27;t pull.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Funny story, this was listed as an add-on item, so I bought more stuff...</li>
            <li>if you are looking for scissors that are more elaborate than go ahead and spend 20 30 or 40 dollars</li>
            <li>The scissor finger holes are a good size even for my large fingers.</li>
            <li>nice and sharp - good tool!</li>
            <li>can think of product names that better fit an item  advertised specifically as a moustache trimming set than “Sally Hansen.”  </li>
            <li>Thanks to the selling company (Makeup Planet) which was good and helpful.</li>
            <li>for the price I could not be happier they are very sharp and also the mustache comb is awesome .</li>
            <li>scissors are fine.</li>
            <li>The scissors are fine if thats all you care about.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>THe comb was too fine and was pulling out my moustache hairs.</li>
            <li>However, the comb is way too fine and plucks out my mustache hairs, so I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>The comb is so fine it may go through the hair on a newborn child&#x27;s head, but not a grown man&#x27;s moustache.  </li>
            <li>The little comb makes it a lot easier to trim the mustache perfectly.</li>
            <li>Would be great for all facial hair.</li>
            <li>If you only need the scissors though they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li>Very worth it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care too much about whether or not the price is fair, but I am very happy with these little tools.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it was okay.</li>
            <li>Scissors are impeccable especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>The comb is a lot smaller than I originally thought which is nice to be able to stuff it into the watch pocket of your jeans.  </li>
            <li>great, sharp, precise scissors</li>
            <li>The comb is very fine, perfect for combing my beard, and the small scissors are nice for trimming the lip line and getting any other rogue hairs.</li>
            <li>Good pair of facial trimming scissors.</li>
            <li>It allows for a cool look.</li>
            <li>This is the reason why you find some scissors are good and some are not from the same production name and trade mark.</li>
            <li>Save your money and spend a little more to purchase a good pair of scissors.</li>
            <li>Nothing too fancy, just a quick cleanup around the edges or lips.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very pretty pair of scissors.</li>
            <li>This is one very quality made and comfortable pair of grooming scissors.  </li>
            <li>is nothing fancy and it will impress no one but it cuts straight, has good quality, and  fits larger hands.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still well worth my money though.</li>
            <li>Without the fix I applied it would have been worth a 1.</li>
            <li>Even still, this was worth the price.</li>
            <li>the scissor and comb where the right size for the job...</li>
            <li>The scissors are nicely made, with the blades fitting tightly together (i.e. not sloppy) and operating</li>
            <li>I have a long handlebar mustache and it does the trick nicely.</li>
            <li>It does not cut a good *half* of the time.</li>
            <li>It has a Huge gap respectively that results in a pretty huge margin of error when trying to cut hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not cut paper, hair, anything...</li>
            <li>The scissors were nice and sharp and the comb is just the right size for straightening out the stache.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 6&#x27;4\\&quot; with big hands and am able to use the scissors with ease.  </li>
            <li>I’m going to give it a four—with a caveat—be ready to do some grinding!</li>
            <li>I bought this set because it contained exactly the moustache comb I was looking for.</li>
            <li>exactly what you get.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see myself using the comb very often, but the scissors are just right, and well-priced.  </li>
            <li>The scissors are nice and sharp.  </li>
            <li>Loses a star because it didn&#x27;t immediately make me any more handsome really.</li>
            <li>It was more precise than an electric trimmer in small areas.</li>
            <li>Sharp scissors and a cool little comb make a great combo for the price.</li>
            <li>the teeth are so fine, I can&#x27;t get it through any of my facial hair.  </li>
            <li>isn’’t a particularly large piece of real estate.</li>
            <li>Nice little trimmers.</li>
            <li>The scissors are sturdy, sharp, long and perfect for facial hair.</li>
            <li>Great scissors for tough bristles poking out...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really know what I was going to do.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and quality product as described.</li>
            <li>I dont really have any snagging/pulling problems with them.</li>
            <li>This comb is smaller than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sissors cut nice, comb does actually comb.  </li>
            <li>The scissors super sharp and fun to use!</li>
            <li>The scissors are a nice size and mine were sharp enough for the job right out of the plastic.  </li>
            <li>Sharp and quality for sure.</li>
            <li>I take back my original review.</li>
            <li>Amazing price considering how expensive these tiny combs are on their own.</li>
            <li>Excellent little tools.&lt;br /&gt;Scissors are very sharp and the comb is much easier to use than a big comb.</li>
            <li>Just hilarious looking for my 6&#x27;5&amp;#34; ass to use a comb smaller than my pinky finger to comb my entire beard/moustache.</li>
            <li>I noticed I&#x27;d naturally go for a large pair of kitchen scissors to cut my extraneous beard hairs over these -my dedicated &amp;#34;beard scissors&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>“Bjorn Pettersson,” for example, would carry the aura of a little more ruggedness, or, perhaps “Bubba O’Shaunessy” if retention of the Scandinavian touch is not considered important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are very high quality, and have a professional feel to them.</li>
            <li>that I&#x27;ve felt like crying after most uses.</li>
            <li>The comb when used in the normal manner catches hairs and either gets stuck</li>
            <li>i got a while back, its bigger and not as fine and that one works</li>
            <li>Love the scissors -- great weight, feel, sharp edge, but the comb (as many have said) is awful about pulling hairs.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;How much am I willing to sacrifice to properly tend to my beard?&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>The scissors are sharp, and while they sometimes don&#x27;t cut my mustache hair on the first snip, they&#x27;re better than any other beard / mustache scissors I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super small, and you have to use it at a right angle to the face or else</li>
            <li>My pair were nice and sharp and the little comb is very helpful.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal if you have any facial hair.</li>
            <li>He used to complain that the old scissors would pull the hairs as I cut - these don&#x27;t at all.</li>
            <li>I found an old beard/moustache comb that came with an electric razor set</li>
            <li>should mention that the scissors work equally well with either right or left hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Actually ordered primarily for the little comb, but was surprised by the quality of the scissors.</li>
            <li>Mini-comb is cute but easily tangles painfully in my mustache.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>The ordinary pocket comb, although OK for a full beard,  is much too large to be anything but awkward as a moustache groomer.</li>
            <li>I have so much pent-up aggression towards this thing now that I notice how much of my time it has wasted.</li>
            <li>Can cut right down to skin with them as if you shaved.</li>
            <li>It is not sharp.</li>
            <li>Not sharp at the tip.</li>
            <li>While I admit that the provided comb’s shape is a bit reminiscent of the early Barbie period, its size is just right to groom either the right of left half of my moustache at a time with a single stroke—two if I’m in no hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>short session with a fine grit grinding wheel  and touch up with a fine whetstone was all it took to reverse the cutting edge bevel.</li>
            <li>Although the little comb was worth the money, Plus for what I paid</li>
            <li>Wow, total control of my style.</li>
            <li>A heavy tool, &amp;#34;blind&amp;#34; edge scissor, extracts the hair not cutting.</li>
            <li>4 stars for being prett good at cutting.</li>
            <li>They do not feel or look cheap and are less expensive then most big stores</li>
            <li>The scissors are sharp, tight and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>comb teeth much too close to each other.  </li>
            <li>The scissors are a little stiff on the opening and closing, perhaps they will loosen a bit after more use.</li>
            <li>to the fun some reviewers poked at the small size of the comb that  came with the scissors, it should be remembered that a moustache</li>
            <li>Not sure about the little comb- seems more novelty than practical.  </li>

            <li> It does not cut a good *half* of the time.</li>
            <li> It has a Huge gap respectively that results in a pretty huge margin of error when trying to cut hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not cut paper, hair, anything...</li>
            <li> The scissors were nice and sharp and the comb is just the right size for straightening out the stache.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 6&#x27;4\\&quot; with big hands and am able to use the scissors with ease.  </li>
            <li> I’m going to give it a four—with a caveat—be ready to do some grinding!</li>
            <li> I bought this set because it contained exactly the moustache comb I was looking for.</li>
            <li> exactly what you get.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see myself using the comb very often, but the scissors are just right, and well-priced.  </li>
            <li> The scissors are nice and sharp.  </li>
            <li> Loses a star because it didn&#x27;t immediately make me any more handsome really.</li>
            <li> It was more precise than an electric trimmer in small areas.</li>
            <li> Sharp scissors and a cool little comb make a great combo for the price.</li>
            <li> the teeth are so fine, I can&#x27;t get it through any of my facial hair.  </li>
            <li> isn’’t a particularly large piece of real estate.</li>
            <li> Nice little trimmers.</li>
            <li> The scissors are sturdy, sharp, long and perfect for facial hair.</li>
            <li> Great scissors for tough bristles poking out...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really know what I was going to do.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and quality product as described.</li>
            <li> I dont really have any snagging/pulling problems with them.</li>
            <li> This comb is smaller than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sissors cut nice, comb does actually comb.  </li>
            <li> The scissors super sharp and fun to use!</li>
            <li> The scissors are a nice size and mine were sharp enough for the job right out of the plastic.  </li>
            <li> Sharp and quality for sure.</li>
            <li> I take back my original review.</li>
            <li> Amazing price considering how expensive these tiny combs are on their own.</li>
            <li> Excellent little tools.&lt;br /&gt;Scissors are very sharp and the comb is much easier to use than a big comb.</li>
            <li> Just hilarious looking for my 6&#x27;5&amp;#34; ass to use a comb smaller than my pinky finger to comb my entire beard/moustache.</li>
            <li> I noticed I&#x27;d naturally go for a large pair of kitchen scissors to cut my extraneous beard hairs over these -my dedicated &amp;#34;beard scissors&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> “Bjorn Pettersson,” for example, would carry the aura of a little more ruggedness, or, perhaps “Bubba O’Shaunessy” if retention of the Scandinavian touch is not considered important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are very high quality, and have a professional feel to them.</li>
            <li> that I&#x27;ve felt like crying after most uses.</li>
            <li> The comb when used in the normal manner catches hairs and either gets stuck</li>
            <li> i got a while back, its bigger and not as fine and that one works</li>
            <li> Love the scissors -- great weight, feel, sharp edge, but the comb (as many have said) is awful about pulling hairs.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;How much am I willing to sacrifice to properly tend to my beard?&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> The scissors are sharp, and while they sometimes don&#x27;t cut my mustache hair on the first snip, they&#x27;re better than any other beard / mustache scissors I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super small, and you have to use it at a right angle to the face or else</li>
            <li> My pair were nice and sharp and the little comb is very helpful.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal if you have any facial hair.</li>
            <li> He used to complain that the old scissors would pull the hairs as I cut - these don&#x27;t at all.</li>
            <li> I found an old beard/moustache comb that came with an electric razor set</li>
            <li> should mention that the scissors work equally well with either right or left hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Actually ordered primarily for the little comb, but was surprised by the quality of the scissors.</li>
            <li> Mini-comb is cute but easily tangles painfully in my mustache.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> The ordinary pocket comb, although OK for a full beard,  is much too large to be anything but awkward as a moustache groomer.</li>
            <li> I have so much pent-up aggression towards this thing now that I notice how much of my time it has wasted.</li>
            <li> Can cut right down to skin with them as if you shaved.</li>
            <li> It is not sharp.</li>
            <li> Not sharp at the tip.</li>
            <li> While I admit that the provided comb’s shape is a bit reminiscent of the early Barbie period, its size is just right to groom either the right of left half of my moustache at a time with a single stroke—two if I’m in no hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> short session with a fine grit grinding wheel  and touch up with a fine whetstone was all it took to reverse the cutting edge bevel.</li>
            <li> Although the little comb was worth the money, Plus for what I paid</li>
            <li> Wow, total control of my style.</li>
            <li> A heavy tool, &amp;#34;blind&amp;#34; edge scissor, extracts the hair not cutting.</li>
            <li> 4 stars for being prett good at cutting.</li>
            <li> They do not feel or look cheap and are less expensive then most big stores</li>
            <li> The scissors are sharp, tight and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> comb teeth much too close to each other.  </li>
            <li> The scissors are a little stiff on the opening and closing, perhaps they will loosen a bit after more use.</li>
            <li> to the fun some reviewers poked at the small size of the comb that  came with the scissors, it should be remembered that a moustache</li>
            <li> Not sure about the little comb- seems more novelty than practical.  </li>
            <li> These were dull right out of the box, I had to sharpen them.</li>
            <li> High quality, heavy scissors.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it for minor trims and shaping of facial hair.</li>
            <li> The scissors seem to be fine, but unfortunately, I purchased this for the mustache comb.  </li>
            <li> They are sufficient though, works a bit better than the hair cutting scissors I was using, so that&#x27;s the reason for the 4.</li>
            <li> As long as you go ahead and order a sharpener along with it, you might be alright.</li>
            <li> The scissor are two large and it does not have a sharp point for to cut small hairs.  </li>
            <li> Nice pair of scissors very sharp and procise however the brush does pull so its a little uncomfortable but it might just be me</li>
            <li> Combing my beard with this was actually uncomfortable due to the fact that the comb was too fine and was pulling at my beard hair.  </li>
            <li> The psychological effect of using something over a long span that fails at its function, of which it only has one, really does a number on one&#x27;s</li>
            <li> The scissors don&#x27;t clip very well, and the comb constantly catches and pulls out hair unless it is used very slowly and carefully.</li>
            <li> The mini comb is a bit useless though as most facial hair is too thick for the tooth size of the comb.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using it sparingly over months for loose beard hairs.</li>
            <li> They actually have a little bit of weight to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I expected anymore.</li>
            <li> I absolutely do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These are a little larger then I expected, making trimming around the mustache line a little tougher, but I am nitpicking.</li>
            <li> Sharp</li>
            <li> Pointy sharp scissors.</li>
            <li> I did not have any sharp scissors.</li>
            <li> Sharp and does the job</li>
            <li> The scissors are sharp and cut well.</li>
            <li> but the edges are sharp.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have stated, the comb is going to yank out your hairs</li>
            <li> Comb tends to pull hair a bit but scissors have stayed sharp and no rust.</li>
            <li> comb is pretty useless.</li>
            <li> So you have to be very careful.</li>
            <li> Thus a average of 3.</li>
            <li> Razor sharp!</li>
            <li> Heavy wait and sharp.</li>
            <li> I was looking for some high quality scissors, but unfortunately these were not them.</li>
            <li> The scissors weren&#x27;t that tight</li>
            <li> so my righty scissors need to be really tight to work well.</li>
            <li> My mustache was looking pretty rough before I got these bad boys.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read the other reviews where people complained about the scissors not being sharp.</li>
            <li> Neat little scissors.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well for me though because the teeth are too fine for how thick my hair is so it winds up just painfully pulling out my beard hairs.</li>
            <li> The comb is waste.</li>
            <li> comb is roughly the size of my pinky, and while it gets the job done, it both takes forever and looks ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> The handle on the comb is a little small for a man&#x27;s hand but it works..</li>
            <li> Inspection with a low power magnifier instantly revealed the problem—the very slight bevel of the cutting edges of both blades actually slanted in the wrong direction!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than return an object so inexpensive, I decided to attempt a remedy</li>
            <li> it looks like used and very cheap material, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s frustrated me so much over the span of it&#x27;s attempted use</li>
            <li> The comb is so small it looks like it&#x27;s for a doll.  </li>
            <li> Not able to use at all on my beard.</li>
            <li> Too small for my husband to use, as it tugged his mustache.</li>
            <li> Mustache comb is really small</li>
            <li> To small for a man&#x27;s hand.</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied with this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the trouble it would take to return it, but I am truly annoyed.</li>
            <li> The scissors were bending my hairs instead of cutting them unless I cut them near the axis.</li>
            <li> I took me way too long to realize just how useless it was.</li>
            <li> The comb is VERY small, like my pinky finger small.</li>
            <li> The comb snags, pulls and is hard to clean.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> scissors are a little heavy and difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> My husband has complained that the comb grabs and pulls hairs, so he has stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I have Read  people giving  negative reviews</li>
            <li> scissors weren&#x27;t that sharp and tool was useless</li>
            <li> You have to ask yourself a serious question.  </li>
            <li> it will seriously pull your &#x27;stache hair.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Secret Santa gift for a co-worker with a thick moustache.</li>
            <li> The comb is crazy small (think something that would come with a barbie doll), and</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> However the scissor is bad.</li>
            <li> So be warned that if you comb with the wrong angle its going to be very painful.</li>
            <li> I am not to disappointed with these.</li>
            <li> Very bad.</li>
            <li> in function, it&#x27;s disgusting.</li>
            <li> Horrible comb -</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great Product.......staff member liked</li>
            <li> Good pair of facial trimming scissors. Sharp</li>
            <li> For the price I was quite pleased.</li>
            <li> I love these. I didn&#x27;t really know what I was going to do. Get a shaver? Get a electronic shaver? Then I found these. Wow, total control of my style. It allows for a cool look. Try them out. Very worth it. I find over time though, it may need for TLC... I find after 6 months they are not chopping as efficiently. Perhaps this is the case with all hair tools though.</li>
            <li> The comb is so small it looks like it&#x27;s for a doll.  My husband can&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;The scissors are fine.</li>
            <li> Nice little trimmers. Sharp and quality for sure. Can cut right down to skin with them as if you shaved. The set itself is perfect for beard timing and styling.</li>
            <li> This is good for beard/mustache trimming. Nothing too fancy, just a quick cleanup around the edges or lips. Or when that it is not happening maybe even eyebrow combing trimming. It was more precise than an electric trimmer in small areas. Worked well. Pointy sharp scissors. Tiny comb. Sturdy.</li>
            <li> I did not have any sharp scissors. These have allowed me to get the trim I want.  Hey, I still have an upper lip!</li>
            <li> Not good. Very bad. I take back my original review. It&#x27;s a very pretty pair of scissors. No argument there.&lt;br /&gt;But in function, it&#x27;s disgusting. The blades are not properly aligned to cut at every part of the blade. It has a Huge gap respectively that results in a pretty huge margin of error when trying to cut hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not cut paper, hair, anything... I&#x27;ve tried using it sparingly over months for loose beard hairs. It does not cut a good *half* of the time. It&#x27;s frustrated me so much over the span of it&#x27;s attempted use that I&#x27;ve felt like crying after most uses. I&#x27;m not kidding. The psychological effect of using something over a long span that fails at its function, of which it only has one, really does a number on one&#x27;s daily mood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing is, it&#x27;s a pair of scissors. I took me way too long to realize just how useless it was. At first I thought it was okay. And I guess because of the kind of product it is, every time it&#x27;d refuse to cut, I would think nothing of it and just attempt it three or four times until it worked. But I got used to this frustration. I noticed I&#x27;d naturally go for a large pair of kitchen scissors to cut my extraneous beard hairs over these -my dedicated &amp;#34;beard scissors&amp;#34;. I have so much pent-up aggression towards this thing now that I notice how much of my time it has wasted.</li>
            <li> The scissors are nice and sharp.  They work well.  My husband has complained that the comb grabs and pulls hairs, so he has stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Great for trimming my beard and mustache. My pair were nice and sharp and the little comb is very helpful.</li>
            <li> comb teeth much too close to each other.  Not able to use at all on my beard.</li>
            <li> These were dull right out of the box, I had to sharpen them. Although the little comb was worth the money, Plus for what I paid I am not to disappointed with these.</li>
            <li> The comb is VERY small, like my pinky finger small. Too small for my husband to use, as it tugged his mustache. but I use it and  the scissors to trim his eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Husband seems to like these and they&#x27;re very easy to use! Comb is a nice addition!</li>
            <li> Nice pair of scissors very sharp and procise however the brush does pull so its a little uncomfortable but it might just be me</li>
            <li> Horrible comb - the space between the teeth tapers to a point so it snags the hair and pulls it out.....</li>
            <li> Scissor is good, comb rips your hairs out til you cry.</li>
            <li> Sharp and does the job</li>
            <li> The scissors are sharp and cut well. They are sized perfectly to working on my mustache. The scissors gets a 5. The comb when used in the normal manner catches hairs and either gets stuck or I have to pull out hairs(ouch). The only solution I found was to use it with the back in the lead at an angle. The comb gets a 0. Thus a average of 3.</li>
            <li> Neat little scissors. I didn&#x27;t want the comb so I can&#x27;t comment on that.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal if you have any facial hair.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be a good quality at a great price. The scissor finger holes are a good size even for my large fingers.</li>
            <li> Great quality tools.  Works perfectly and easily in trimming and combing my moustache.  Most satisfied with my purchase of these products.</li>
            <li> I use this to trim my husband&#x27;s eyebrows, and they work great. He used to complain that the old scissors would pull the hairs as I cut - these don&#x27;t at all. Would be great for all facial hair.</li>
            <li> This is a get set to keep the crumb catcher in shape.</li>
            <li> One of the blades ended up with a burr on it, which made the scissors &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; when closing. Ended up pulling a couple hairs out forcibly. After the burr wore away, they work okay. I was looking for some high quality scissors, but unfortunately these were not them. They are sufficient though, works a bit better than the hair cutting scissors I was using, so that&#x27;s the reason for the 4. I would give them a 3.5 if I could though.  The comb is nice!</li>
            <li> Scissors are good quality. Mini-comb is cute but easily tangles painfully in my mustache. I only bought the product for the scissors though.</li>
            <li> Perfect size, great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but the edges are sharp. So you have to be very careful. Also after using for a while, I feel that the blades lost their sharpness. The comb is waste. I thrown it immediately.</li>
            <li> As long as you go ahead and order a sharpener along with it, you might be alright. Also, it squeaks quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have stated, the comb is going to yank out your hairs and it won&#x27;t feel good. Look elsewhere. The scissors are fine if thats all you care about.</li>
            <li> The scissors don&#x27;t clip very well, and the comb constantly catches and pulls out hair unless it is used very slowly and carefully. Threw away after a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> Mustache comb is really small and I haven&#x27;t quite figured out how to trim while holding the blade against the comb...</li>
            <li> Scissors are of great quality and do a great job.  The comb is a lot smaller than I originally thought which is nice to be able to stuff it into the watch pocket of your jeans.  Doesn&#x27;t work well for me though because the teeth are too fine for how thick my hair is so it winds up just painfully pulling out my beard hairs.</li>
            <li> The scissors seem to be fine, but unfortunately, I purchased this for the mustache comb.  The comb is crazy small (think something that would come with a barbie doll), and the teeth are so fine, I can&#x27;t get it through any of my facial hair.  It gets stuck immediately, and if I apply pressure, it just rips out the hair.  Looks elsewhere for a mustache comb.</li>
            <li> Way smaller then they look in add. To small for a man&#x27;s hand.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the selling company (Makeup Planet) which was good and helpful. It arrived in time. Amazon itself is more than good. However the scissor is bad. A heavy tool, &amp;#34;blind&amp;#34; edge scissor, extracts the hair not cutting. It is not sharp. It is made in Pakistan where, I think, no quality control over their products. This is the reason why you find some scissors are good and some are not from the same production name and trade mark.</li>
            <li> Sharp scissors and a cool little comb make a great combo for the price.</li>
            <li> it looks like used and very cheap material, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love the scissors -- great weight, feel, sharp edge, but the comb (as many have said) is awful about pulling hairs.</li>
            <li> High quality, heavy scissors.  Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> My mustache was looking pretty rough before I got these bad boys.  They do not feel or look cheap and are less expensive then most big stores</li>
            <li> nice and sharp - good tool!</li>
            <li> Does the job.  Scissors are a good value but not as good as the scissors costing 5 times more.  The handle on the comb is a little small for a man&#x27;s hand but it works..</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Secret Santa gift for a co-worker with a thick moustache. I don&#x27;t know how well the items worked, but it was a perfect gag gift.</li>
            <li> I use it all the time and is of excellent quality!&lt;br /&gt;Manscaping my eyebrows is a must!&lt;br /&gt;The comb does it&#x27;s job as well!</li>
            <li> The scissors are a nice size and mine were sharp enough for the job right out of the plastic.  I&#x27;m 6&#x27;4\\&quot; with big hands and am able to use the scissors with ease.  The comb however was much smaller and finer than anticipated.  Combing my beard with this was actually uncomfortable due to the fact that the comb was too fine and was pulling at my beard hair.  I found an old beard/moustache comb that came with an electric razor set i got a while back, its bigger and not as fine and that one works/feels great.  So in summary, scissors good, comb not-so-much.</li>
            <li> The scissors super sharp and fun to use! The little comb makes it a lot easier to trim the mustache perfectly.</li>
            <li> Amazon Prime for $9.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its is nothing fancy and it will impress no one but it cuts straight, has good quality, and  fits larger hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good bargain</li>
            <li> Not sharp at the tip.</li>
            <li> The scissors were nice and sharp and the comb is just the right size for straightening out the stache.</li>
            <li> The scissor are two large and it does not have a sharp point for to cut small hairs.  It may be my stache I have fine hair it would work for thicker hair.</li>
            <li> These are a little larger then I expected, making trimming around the mustache line a little tougher, but I am nitpicking. They are very high quality, and have a professional feel to them. Razor sharp! Comb is like a bonus.</li>
            <li> Excellent little tools.&lt;br /&gt;Scissors are very sharp and the comb is much easier to use than a big comb.</li>
            <li> Scissors are impeccable especially for the price.  The comb is kind of a joke...  Still well worth my money though.</li>
            <li> Great scissors for tough bristles poking out... Not sure about the little comb- seems more novelty than practical.  I would buy again...</li>
            <li> The comb works well and I use it daily.  The scissors weren&#x27;t that tight so I just kept using the better ones I already had.  They work but not as well as my &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; ones that I&#x27;ve had for a hundred years.  Of note though, I&#x27;m a lefty so my righty scissors need to be really tight to work well.</li>
            <li> You have to ask yourself a serious question.  &amp;#34;How much am I willing to sacrifice to properly tend to my beard?&amp;#34;  I bought this thinking, &amp;#34;Oh hell yeah, now I can comb my beard and it won&#x27;t look so dissheveled.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb is roughly the size of my pinky, and while it gets the job done, it both takes forever and looks ridiculous.  Imagine the comb that came with a Barbie doll.  This comb is smaller than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sissors cut nice, comb does actually comb.  Just hilarious looking for my 6&#x27;5&amp;#34; ass to use a comb smaller than my pinky finger to comb my entire beard/moustache.</li>
            <li> The scissors are sturdy, sharp, long and perfect for facial hair. I have a long handlebar mustache and it does the trick nicely. I can&#x27;t use the comb though, the teeth are so close together that it doesn&#x27;t go through my mustache it gets stuck in it and would try to yank them out. If you only need the scissors though they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li> The scissors are nicely made, with the blades fitting tightly together (i.e. not sloppy) and operating smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the scissors came they snagged on the hair rather than cut. Inspection with a low power magnifier instantly revealed the problem—the very slight bevel of the cutting edges of both blades actually slanted in the wrong direction!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than return an object so inexpensive, I decided to attempt a remedy myself.&lt;br /&gt;A short session with a fine grit grinding wheel  and touch up with a fine whetstone was all it took to reverse the cutting edge bevel. The cure worked and the scissors now cut beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention that the scissors work equally well with either right or left hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the fun some reviewers poked at the small size of the comb that  came with the scissors, it should be remembered that a moustache isn’’t a particularly large piece of real estate. The ordinary pocket comb, although OK for a full beard,  is much too large to be anything but awkward as a moustache groomer. While I admit that the provided comb’s shape is a bit reminiscent of the early Barbie period, its size is just right to groom either the right of left half of my moustache at a time with a single stroke—two if I’m in no hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can think of product names that better fit an item  advertised specifically as a moustache trimming set than “Sally Hansen.”  “Bjorn Pettersson,” for example, would carry the aura of a little more ruggedness, or, perhaps “Bubba O’Shaunessy” if retention of the Scandinavian touch is not considered important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the scissors had arrived with a properly ground blade-edge bevel I’d give the set a five star rating. Without the fix I applied it would have been worth a 1. But considering how it turned out I’m going to give it a four—with a caveat—be ready to do some grinding!</li>
            <li> scissors weren&#x27;t that sharp and tool was useless</li>
            <li> Comb tends to pull hair a bit but scissors have stayed sharp and no rust.</li>
            <li> Great quality items for the price. Actually ordered primarily for the little comb, but was surprised by the quality of the scissors. Heavy wait and sharp. Great items for the price!</li>
            <li> The scissors are sharp, and while they sometimes don&#x27;t cut my mustache hair on the first snip, they&#x27;re better than any other beard / mustache scissors I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb is pretty useless. It&#x27;s super small, and you have to use it at a right angle to the face or else it will seriously pull your &#x27;stache hair. I just stick with the comb that came with my electric hair trimmer since it fits better in my hand and doesn&#x27;t pull.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read the other reviews where people complained about the scissors not being sharp. Well, they aren&#x27;t razor blades, but the cut my hair well enough.  The comb works well. The scissors are a little stiff on the opening and closing, perhaps they will loosen a bit after more use. They aren&#x27;t flimsy like the kind you get in nail trimming kits. They actually have a little bit of weight to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny story, this was listed as an add-on item, so I bought more stuff...they shipped this by itself.  Haha..stupid!</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied with this product.&lt;br /&gt;The scissors are a little heavy and difficult to work with. The comb snags, pulls and is hard to clean.&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for. Sorry but, I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> the scissor and comb where the right size for the job... mustache trim perfectly and have a nice clean cut.. very easy to handle and very convenient .. thank you.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004KRVENQ/ref&#x3D;ox_sc_sfl_title_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;smid&#x3D;A14YJ33ILRH4KU</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> The scissors cut hair and the comb gets all my pubey face hairs caught in it. I don&#x27;t think I expected anymore. 4 stars for being prett good at cutting. Loses a star because it didn&#x27;t immediately make me any more handsome really.</li>
            <li> Perfect quality &amp; price</li>
            <li> I bought this set because it contained exactly the moustache comb I was looking for. When it arrived, the package had been opened and there was no comb. It&#x27;s not worth the trouble it would take to return it, but I am truly annoyed.</li>
            <li> exactly what you get.</li>
            <li> Bought these to trim my beard for no shave November they worked like a charm, good quality material used for the scissors.</li>
            <li> Very good tools for grooming</li>
            <li> great, sharp, precise scissors</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband who absolutely loved it. Amazing price considering how expensive these tiny combs are on their own.</li>
            <li> This is one very quality made and comfortable pair of grooming scissors.  I have a full goatee and use these perfectly sized scissors to trim my moustache and goatee hair.  The scissors are sharp, tight and easy to use.  I don&#x27;t see myself using the comb very often, but the scissors are just right, and well-priced.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Just what the job need</li>
            <li> Scissors work great. The comb is junk. Get a Kent mustache Combe.  They are hand made.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and quality product as described.</li>
            <li> The size is great and would be awesome if the comb didn&#x27;t catch your hairs and yank the s*** out of them. So be warned that if you comb with the wrong angle its going to be very painful.</li>
            <li> I bought this set looking for a nice set of scissors to keep my bear trimmed. These ones do the trick and seem to be rather durable. I dont really have any snagging/pulling problems with them. The mini comb is a bit useless though as most facial hair is too thick for the tooth size of the comb. Even still, this was worth the price. I recommend it for minor trims and shaping of facial hair.</li>
            <li> these scissors are amazing I have Read  people giving  negative reviews and I say to myself what do you expect when you&#x27;re paying this amount for the scissors. for the price I could not be happier they are very sharp and also the mustache comb is awesome . if you are looking for scissors that are more elaborate than go ahead and spend 20 30 or 40 dollars I can tell you  will have the same results</li>
            <li> THe comb was too fine and was pulling out my moustache hairs. The scissors were bending my hairs instead of cutting them unless I cut them near the axis. I need scissors that cut at the tip not bend. I absolutely do not recommend this product. Save your money and spend a little more to purchase a good pair of scissors.</li>
            <li> Works well! For dog eye bogies.</li>
            <li> The scissors is nice and good quality. I use it for my mustache and eyebrows. However, the comb is way too fine and plucks out my mustache hairs, so I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> The comb is so fine it may go through the hair on a newborn child&#x27;s head, but not a grown man&#x27;s moustache.  Waist of money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care too much about whether or not the price is fair, but I am very happy with these little tools.  The comb is very fine, perfect for combing my beard, and the small scissors are nice for trimming the lip line and getting any other rogue hairs.</li>
