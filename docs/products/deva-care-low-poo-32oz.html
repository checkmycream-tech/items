            <li>There has to be a better alternative!</li>
            <li>Perfect for curly hair that you want to keep clean and healthy without having to wash every day.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve embraced my outer curliness) and can recommend it without hesitation, plus here on Amazon you&#x27;ll find the best price for the large bottle.</li>
            <li>I use it throughout my hair (not just on my scalp as some curly girl websites would advise you to do) and it works amazing.  </li>
            <li>It is fabulous because it is still sulfate free but gives me a great lather!  </li>
            <li>It does smell nice, though.</li>
            <li>It smells nice though, and I&#x27;ll probably mix the two shampoos together to see if that helps.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have curly hair, but I do have a very sensitive scalp and this shampoo works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Initially it worked nicely, my curls looked great!</li>
            <li>I like the Devachan better</li>
            <li>I love the lime scent of most deva products, but this does not smell like lime at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wondering if they just add more water to make it cheaper to produce.  </li>
            <li>I feel like their products used to be better quality</li>
            <li>Hoping it would be ok for my oily hair.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love how it makes my waves look</li>
            <li>I love what this does for my curls.  </li>
            <li>These products were created by the greater powers of the universe in order to come to the aide of people with out of control hair.</li>
            <li>love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I like this shampoo better than the No Poo.  </li>
            <li>I wish this would lather more....</li>
            <li>I have used this shampoo for almost a year and still love it.</li>
            <li>and I have used every anti frizz shampoo on the market and never was satisfied with results of any..until now..  </li>
            <li>I love Deva care and Deva curl products.  </li>
            <li>Love the results love my hair now..</li>
            <li>and I get compliments that my hair is even more curlier than it was before and more shiny.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect balance between actually cleaning the hair and not gunking it up, but not drying it out either.  </li>
            <li>I also love the conditioner.</li>
            <li>Enjoying this product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work any better then</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t your mother&#x27;s shampoo, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>and it makes my naturally wavy hair look amazing!</li>
            <li>I am a HUGE fan of the Deva products so since my hair is colored</li>
            <li>I have to use this product because it is sulfa free</li>
            <li>Great for fragile color treated and curly hair.</li>
            <li>I have been sulfate &amp; silicone free since August 2010.  </li>
            <li>and I hoped to cure the frizz by going sulfate free.  </li>
            <li>love the way it makes my hair feel right after washing</li>
            <li>I was delighted to see the Low Poo for such a good price for a large bottle and was confident I&#x27;d love it.</li>
            <li>I felt that I needed a lathering clean periodically</li>
            <li>2) clean, 3) curly without frizz.</li>
            <li>It smells better than No-Poo, but still doesn&#x27;t really suds up, which is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the product and it came here fast when I needed it.</li>
            <li>For a girl with very curly hair, I love this product.</li>
            <li>I was using another low-poo shampoo for normal to oily hair and was able to go a week between washes without my hair looking oily.</li>
            <li>LOVE the great fragrance with Deva Care - subtle orange/citrus.  </li>
            <li>My new favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have really curly, oily hair and am allergic to almost everything, but this works just fine for me.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the whole product line of Deva products.</li>
            <li>The shampoo smells very nice (like orange) and definitely won&#x27;t strip your hair, whether chemically processed in some manner or just naturally curly.</li>
            <li>The big size makes more sense economically.</li>
            <li>I really like this variation of the product, my scalp feels clean and my color hasn&#x27;t faded as fast</li>
            <li>I can only find smaller bottles at the store, so this larger size is an excellent deal.</li>
            <li>I use no poo for color treated most days and once a week I use low poo.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend said he couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and full my hair looked and felt.</li>
            <li>Love the way my hair looks when I blow dry it after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Ignore the labeled \\&quot;for oily\\&quot; part, this shampoo is definitely mild, not harsh.</li>
            <li>I really need the suds to get the product to go through all of my hair.  </li>
            <li>This phosphate free product is gentle and I really do see a difference from when I use regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very thankful to have found a product that keeps my hair</li>
            <li>This stuff made my hair feel really greasy.</li>
            <li>I ended up using a whole handful at a time, which means I didn&#x27;t end up saving money after all.</li>
            <li>I used to have problems with a very itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>and now I am itch-free, thanks to DevaCare/DevaCurl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My hair thanks you.</li>
            <li>This says it is for normal to oily hair, and mine is pretty oily.</li>
            <li>If you are curly, this shampoo was developed by the original salon that learned how to manage their clients&#x27; curly hair -- no harsh chemicals, light touch, no or low blow drying.</li>
            <li>and it was the only product that worked well on my hair, this product keeps my hair feeling clean all day.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the conditioner made by Deva Care.</li>
            <li>I tried this because I wanted a little more soap feel</li>
            <li>I have tried both drugstore and more expensive cleansers, some more natural and some not, but always return to this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this shampoo.</li>
            <li>My curls are soft and stand up to the toughest humidity!</li>
            <li>My hair feels brittle and tangled after shampooing - unlike the soft, almost conditioned feel after no poo.</li>
            <li>am also thankful that Amazon offers this line as it is cheaper to order on here than in salons or stores.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have been using it for years now, a bit expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li>Also, my hair can get pretty dry when I use this</li>
            <li>I used the No Poo for a little while but couldn&#x27;t get used to not having that squeaky clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Like this shampoo, paired with DevaCare OneCondition - my split ends have been so much reduced since starting to use this that I didn&#x27;t have any after waiting 6 months to cut my hair recently so that it grew from chin to shoulder length.</li>
            <li>The only issue is that when I do occasionally use products with silicone or harder to break up substances I have to clarify with a shampoo full of sulphates to get everything out of my hair again.</li>
            <li>The fact that this shampoo is designed for naturally curly hair was an extra perk for me.</li>
            <li>, I just went to a relative&#x27;s home and they are using DevaCurl Low Poo and WOW</li>
            <li>If the ship were sinking, and I could only grab a few items, I would grab this ;-)</li>

            <li> If the ship were sinking, and I could only grab a few items, I would grab this ;-)</li>
            <li> For my hair (coarse, wavy, tendency to be dry)</li>
            <li> and so I have not lathered my hair for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered for so long with an itchy scalp....</li>
            <li> I use to straighten my hair because I had no idea what to do with it..now my long curly hair is my trademark.  </li>
            <li> Plus since it&#x27;s so watery, it&#x27;s difficult to get the full handful onto my head without dripping</li>
            <li> It did come with loose cap and some was lost in the bag it was put in</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but I&#x27;ve tried every other brand out there and none compare, so I finally feel that the expense is worth it.</li>
            <li> After giving birth to my daughter my hair has been super oily and greasy and I was tired of it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed less breakage when combing through and my curs (naturally tight spirals to middle of my back) are defined and have bounce.</li>
            <li> I feel like I need to put 3 handfuls into my sopping wet hair in order to get it to spread.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been no/low-poo for about a year and have been washing once/week for the last few months.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair once every other day</li>
            <li> I have only used Deva Care products for the past 2 years or so</li>
            <li> Never again will I use other products...</li>
            <li> She explained that this is a heavy shampooo, for those very dry curls.  </li>
            <li> tried every dandruff shampoo out there with no success....</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> This leads me to believe that the company I ordered from is watering it down.</li>
            <li> I will never use any other hair products again!</li>
            <li> I was specifically looking for a shampoo to make my hair LESS oily but that would protect my color.</li>
            <li> I get the concept of moisturizing skin to make it less oily but there was no mention of oily hair.</li>

            <li> I boughtt this before I actually consulted with a devva stylist.  When I did, she immediately put me into the regular Deva shampoo--despite my color,  She explained that this is a heavy shampooo, for those very dry curls.  I like the Devachan better</li>
            <li> I love the lime scent of most deva products, but this does not smell like lime at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also It is quite runny/watery.  I feel like I need to put 3 handfuls into my sopping wet hair in order to get it to spread.  I&#x27;m wondering if they just add more water to make it cheaper to produce.  I&#x27;m not a fan at all.  Plus since it&#x27;s so watery, it&#x27;s difficult to get the full handful onto my head without dripping (wasting) some in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally, when I use conditioner after using this product, my hair feels weird.  Nothing meshes well, and I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of conditioners (Keihl&#x27;s, Knot Today, Matrix, etc.).  Even DEVA conditioner doesn&#x27;t work well with it.  I feel like their products used to be better quality but I&#x27;m probably never buying these again.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for years now, a bit expensive but worth it. I have to use this product because it is sulfa free and it was the only product that worked well on my hair, this product keeps my hair feeling clean all day.</li>
            <li> A great alternative to nopoo.  I really need the suds to get the product to go through all of my hair.  This phosphate free product is gentle and I really do see a difference from when I use regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> I ordered this shampoo after searching for &amp;#34;shampoo for oily color treated hair&amp;#34;. After giving birth to my daughter my hair has been super oily and greasy and I was tired of it! I was specifically looking for a shampoo to make my hair LESS oily but that would protect my color. The fact that this shampoo is designed for naturally curly hair was an extra perk for me. When the bottle arrived I noticed that it didn&#x27;t mention oily hair anywhere. As a matter of fact it said it was moisturizing. I get the concept of moisturizing skin to make it less oily but there was no mention of oily hair. I looked at the Deva Care website and still no mention of oily.&lt;br /&gt;I went ahead and used it. Hoping it would be ok for my oily hair. I wash my hair once every other day and I can&#x27;t get one day without my hair feeling greasy again.&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it makes my hair feel right after washing and it makes my naturally wavy hair look amazing! I am still questioning if I want to continue using this shampoo in the future. I absolutely love how it makes my waves look but I hate that my hair feels dirty again after a day.&lt;br /&gt;A note on the conditioner though: I thoroughly dislike it. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel conditioned at all. My waves do look great using it but I am not sure if it&#x27;s the shampoo or the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE fan of the Deva products so since my hair is colored I thought I would try the one for colored hair.  I was not to impressed with this and not to impressed with the smell think I will go back to the Reg Deve care Loo Poo</li>
            <li> I love what this does for my curls.  I use it throughout my hair (not just on my scalp as some curly girl websites would advise you to do) and it works amazing.  My curls are soft and stand up to the toughest humidity!</li>
            <li> Have I told you about Deva Curl? If you knew me in person, I would have already. These products were created by the greater powers of the universe in order to come to the aide of people with out of control hair. If the ship were sinking, and I could only grab a few items, I would grab this ;-)</li>
            <li> My Husband loves this stuff.  I am a &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; girl myself!  Great for fragile color treated and curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have been sulfate &amp; silicone free since August 2010.  I have fairly tight, frizzy curls and I hoped to cure the frizz by going sulfate free.  I can&#x27;t say that my problems have been solved, I still have frizz - especially in humid weather.  I do feel like my hair is softer and healthier though, also my hair color lasts a lot longer!  I have only used Deva Care products for the past 2 years or so and so I have not lathered my hair for a long time.  I felt that I needed a lathering clean periodically so I ordered the Low Poo.  It is fabulous because it is still sulfate free but gives me a great lather!  That being said, I only plan on using the low poo a couple times a month.  LOVE the great fragrance with Deva Care - subtle orange/citrus.  Deva Care does not disappoint and the BEST prices are on amazon.com</li>
            <li> When I got this shampoo I noted that it smells of orange but also has a distinctly bad odor, as if the product has spoiled or something. The shampoo itself is almost viscous...like mucous.  Also, my hair can get pretty dry when I use this so I have been trading off regular shampoo and Deva Care.  I just figured people are raving about this; I need to give it a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I just went to a relative&#x27;s home and they are using DevaCurl Low Poo and WOW, it smells fantastic!!  I think there is something wrong with this bottle. But I called Deva and they say Amazon is &amp;#34;not an authorized dealer and they can&#x27;t guarantee the integrity of their product if purchased through Amazon.  So, Amazon, can you somehow become an authorized dealer? What needs to change here?  Can I somehow return my bottle as defective?</li>
            <li> I have really thick, oily hair and it just didn&#x27;t feel like the No-Poo was getting the job done. I really like this variation of the product, my scalp feels clean and my color hasn&#x27;t faded as fast (and I&#x27;m a tie-dyed redhead). It smells better than No-Poo, but still doesn&#x27;t really suds up, which is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very thankful to have found a product that keeps my hair 1) red, 2) clean, 3) curly without frizz.</li>
            <li> This stuff made my hair feel really greasy. There has to be a better alternative! I had such high hopes for this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I tried this because I wanted a little more soap feel but it is not nearly as good as no poo. My hair feels brittle and tangled after shampooing - unlike the soft, almost conditioned feel after no poo. I will use it all, but I won&#x27;t order it again.</li>
            <li> made my hair impossible, split ends, not soft, not shiny, made me hair feel like straw, it dried out my hair A LOT!</li>
            <li> I got the big bottle to save money, but hated this shampoo. It&#x27;s supposed to still have some lather but it doesn&#x27;t lather at all. I ended up using a whole handful at a time, which means I didn&#x27;t end up saving money after all. It does smell nice, though.</li>
            <li> Since I started using DevaCare products, the look and feel of my hair are awesome!! I get compliments about the shine and my perfectly shaped non-frizz curls, all the time. I have recommended this products to all my curly-haired friend. So if youre looking for a great product for your curly hair...DevaCurl or DevaCare is it!!</li>
            <li> What a great deal! I love the product and it came here fast when I needed it. Best deal ever!</li>
            <li> I used to have problems with a very itchy scalp. My hair stylist recommended Deva Care because she suspected I may have an allergy to sulfates (causing the itch). My hair is NOT curly, but decided to try this hair care line anyway. THIS HAS CHANGED MY LIFE. I will never use any other hair products again! I have suffered for so long with an itchy scalp....tried every dandruff shampoo out there with no success....and now I am itch-free, thanks to DevaCare/DevaCurl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also thankful that Amazon offers this line as it is cheaper to order on here than in salons or stores.</li>
            <li> love this stuff. I have been using it for 4 years and will never use anything else</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo better than the No Poo.  I have to have a little lather and soap in my shampooing process. Great scent too!</li>
            <li> I wish this would lather more....</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for almost a year and still love it. I have really curly, oily hair and am allergic to almost everything, but this works just fine for me. I can only find smaller bottles at the store, so this larger size is an excellent deal. The only issue is that when I do occasionally use products with silicone or harder to break up substances I have to clarify with a shampoo full of sulphates to get everything out of my hair again.</li>
            <li> For a girl with very curly hair, I love this product. I enjoy the whole product line of Deva products. My hair thanks you. Bye.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this shampoo. It&#x27;s expensive, but I&#x27;ve tried every other brand out there and none compare, so I finally feel that the expense is worth it. The big size makes more sense economically.</li>
            <li> Im a wavy/curly type hair and I have used every anti frizz shampoo on the market and never was satisfied with results of any..until now..  I love Deva care and Deva curl products.  I use no poo for color treated most days and once a week I use low poo.  Love the results love my hair now..and I get compliments that my hair is even more curlier than it was before and more shiny.  I use to straighten my hair because I had no idea what to do with it..now my long curly hair is my trademark.  Never again will I use other products...Deva is my hero!</li>
            <li> I have tried both drugstore and more expensive cleansers, some more natural and some not, but always return to this shampoo.  It&#x27;s the perfect balance between actually cleaning the hair and not gunking it up, but not drying it out either.  For my hair (coarse, wavy, tendency to be dry) it is the best all around.  Hair doesn&#x27;t seem to &#x27;get used to it&#x27;, it always works, for five or six years now.  Amazon has the best price, so this is where I buy it.</li>
            <li> I have used Deva products on and off for years. Even though I get my hair straightened, I still use the AnGel religiously. I also love the conditioner. I used the No Poo for a little while but couldn&#x27;t get used to not having that squeaky clean feeling. I was delighted to see the Low Poo for such a good price for a large bottle and was confident I&#x27;d love it. I don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s so runny, not at all like the quality I expect from Deva Curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t be buying this one again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I was in a well known drug store today which carries Deva products. The consistency in the bottle of low poo shampoo was wayyyyyy thicker than what I received. This leads me to believe that the company I ordered from is watering it down. Very bad form.</li>
            <li> My new favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for approx. 6 months and it no longer cleans my hair! Also my scalp has issues that seems to be related to not being cleansed properly. My husband tried to use it as well for his shoulder length hair and had the same results. Initially it worked nicely, my curls looked great! Now I have scalp problems and no longer cleans my hair. Don&#x27;t recommend these products because of this...and they are expensive!</li>
            <li> Perfect for curly hair that you want to keep clean and healthy without having to wash every day.  I highly recommend the conditioner made by Deva Care.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have curly hair, but I do have a very sensitive scalp and this shampoo works wonderfully. It is now the only shampoo I will use and leaves my hair smelling faintly of oranges.</li>
            <li> Love the way my hair looks when I blow dry it after using this shampoo. Best when used with the conditioner</li>
            <li> Like this shampoo, paired with DevaCare OneCondition - my split ends have been so much reduced since starting to use this that I didn&#x27;t have any after waiting 6 months to cut my hair recently so that it grew from chin to shoulder length. I have wavy / curly hair.</li>
            <li> This says it is for normal to oily hair, and mine is pretty oily. I&#x27;ve been no/low-poo for about a year and have been washing once/week for the last few months. When I wash my hair with this, my hair is oily by the end of the day. I was using another low-poo shampoo for normal to oily hair and was able to go a week between washes without my hair looking oily. So this is a bit of a disappointment. It smells nice though, and I&#x27;ll probably mix the two shampoos together to see if that helps.</li>
            <li> Enjoying this product. It did come with loose cap and some was lost in the bag it was put in</li>
            <li> the best shampoo for colored and oily hair.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after the first time I used it. My boyfriend said he couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and full my hair looked and felt. I&#x27;ve noticed less breakage when combing through and my curs (naturally tight spirals to middle of my back) are defined and have bounce. Will definitely purchase this and the matching conditioner again! BEST EVER!</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s not worth it. It doesn&#x27;t work any better then a botanical cleanser I get at target for $5</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t your mother&#x27;s shampoo, that&#x27;s for sure. It is very low sudsing and has no sulfates, which are a no-no for people who straighten their hair. If you are curly, this shampoo was developed by the original salon that learned how to manage their clients&#x27; curly hair -- no harsh chemicals, light touch, no or low blow drying. The shampoo smells very nice (like orange) and definitely won&#x27;t strip your hair, whether chemically processed in some manner or just naturally curly. Ignore the labeled \\&quot;for oily\\&quot; part, this shampoo is definitely mild, not harsh. I&#x27;ve used it for years (I&#x27;ve embraced my outer curliness) and can recommend it without hesitation, plus here on Amazon you&#x27;ll find the best price for the large bottle.</li>
            <li> Excellent oriduct &amp; excellent service.</li>
