            <li>/&gt;However, the smell is very light and refreshing.</li>
            <li>My curls kind of parched up one day, and when I used this, it re set my waves/curls, leaving them soft and bouncy, and very healthy looking!</li>
            <li>I really love the smell...</li>
            <li>Love this -</li>
            <li>It also really works great as a detangler.</li>
            <li>It is a great de-tangler that is natural and free of dyes, parabens, and alcohol.</li>
            <li>I have medium length hair that is fine</li>
            <li>It is paraben free and seems to work well on my fine, wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I spray lightly and scrunch.</li>

            <li>If you have fine hair make sure not to spray too much on.  </li>
            <li>It works great on dry hair; although the instructions say to use on damp hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really lovely, very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>So soft, so nice, no product on the hair</li>
            <li>This leave in cond is very good for forming my curls and taking away the frizz with out being stiff.  </li>
            <li>I still like Nexxus products even though there are so many new brands out there.  </li>
            <li>it is a fresh scent and reminds me of the salon.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product for myself for the purpose of untangling my freshly washed thinning hair.  </li>

            <li>I will most likely purchase again.</li>
            <li>but I primarily love it for my two toddlers who have long hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product and I&#x27;ll stay with it as long as I can!</li>
            <li>My only drawback is that it that spraying it really has that strong hair spray odor.</li>
            <li>It really does smell botanical, like flower - water garden or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost like you just got out of the shower, but very light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used this on both damp and dry hair and must say it works fine either way.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that is voluminous post wash but loses volume pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly on the ends with my fine hair so that they don&#x27;t get so dry.  </li>
            <li>A+ item.&lt;br /&gt;female-mixed ethnicity-long wavy normal thickness hair</li>
            <li>live in a high humidity area.</li>
            <li>It does work well on damp, but the true test - for me - is when I put it on dry hair.</li>
            <li>I like that it is free of parabens and other chemicals that may be harmful.</li>
            <li>Will certainly be purchasing in the future!!</li>
            <li>It is not heavy or greasy...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy, and it doesn&#x27;t stick with you all day - my pet peeve with products like this.</li>
            <li>Not heavy not extra residue.</li>
            <li>This conditioner does not weigh my hair down, at the same time manages my hair just right.</li>
            <li>If I use too much it can make my hair a little weighed down, but that&#x27;s simple enough--don&#x27;t use too much!</li>

            <li> Greatest leave in conditioner I have every had.  I have very fine hair but still needs conditioning.  Works great.  Not heavy not extra residue.</li>
            <li> This leave in conditioner is excellent! I use it for myself but I primarily love it for my two toddlers who have long hair. It is a great de-tangler that is natural and free of dyes, parabens, and alcohol. It is not heavy or greasy...actually you would never know it was in the hair! I also use and love the shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> I have semi curly hair and hard water which cause it to be rather dry. This leave in cond is very good for forming my curls and taking away the frizz with out being stiff.  Used it for 4 years. I spray lightly and scrunch.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00243FKSS Nexxus Nourshing Botanical Leave-In Conditioner Botanluxe, 8.5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]]  This is great stuff for styling your hair, even on days you don&#x27;t shampoo, and it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling as though its full of \\&quot;product\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I used to use a pantene spray leave-in conditioner but it eventually went off the market and was hard to find. I love this product and I&#x27;ll stay with it as long as I can! Great price for two, and it&#x27;s Prime YAY!&lt;br /&gt;Smells great and fresh, but it does not linger on. This plus the nexxus heat protexx and I&#x27;m good to go and style away! A+ item.&lt;br /&gt;female-mixed ethnicity-long wavy normal thickness hair</li>
            <li> Great smooth lightless conditioner for fine hair. it will not weight hair down, easy to use, better than enythig else.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that we can&#x27;t purchase locally</li>
            <li> I have medium length hair that is fine but there is a lot of it. I bought this because although my roots have a tendency to get oily, my ends are dry and prone to breakage due to being over-processed. I have used this on both damp and dry hair and must say it works fine either way. I really love the smell... it is a fresh scent and reminds me of the salon. I just wished it lingered longer. As for a conditioning effect I have not noticed any. If anything this works well as a detangler and I would recommend it only for that purpose. Oh, and If you do happen have oily roots like mine this spray is lightweight enough to not weigh your hair down or add to oiliness.</li>
            <li> I still like Nexxus products even though there are so many new brands out there.  If you have fine hair make sure not to spray too much on.  I find that this product works well with frizz and softness.  I use it mainly on the ends with my fine hair so that they don&#x27;t get so dry.  Works well for me!</li>
            <li> It really does smell botanical, like flower - water garden or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the smell is very light and refreshing. It&#x27;s not heavy, and it doesn&#x27;t stick with you all day - my pet peeve with products like this. It&#x27;s almost like you just got out of the shower, but very light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really lovely, very moisturizing. It works great on dry hair; although the instructions say to use on damp hair. It does work well on damp, but the true test - for me - is when I put it on dry hair. Then I see if the chemicals are mostly good or bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in a high humidity area. My curls kind of parched up one day, and when I used this, it re set my waves/curls, leaving them soft and bouncy, and very healthy looking! So soft, so nice, no product on the hair feel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars</li>
            <li> Perfectly priced package of two bottles of leave in conditioner. It is paraben free and seems to work well on my fine, wavy hair. I will most likely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that is voluminous post wash but loses volume pretty quickly. This conditioner does not weigh my hair down, at the same time manages my hair just right. I use it with [[ASIN:B000RU5GZM H2O + Milk Shampoo with Silk Proteins &amp; Vitamins, 12 Fl. Oz.]] and I think they have improved the quality of my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this - it smells delicious, leaves hair extremely soft, and helps w/ tangles!!! Will certainly be purchasing in the future!!</li>
            <li> Smells great! Keeps hair moist and seems to improve shine. Best of all, NO PARABENS or DYES! All for a nice and affordable price.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my  toddler&#x27;s hair which sometimes looks like a rat&#x27;s nest in the morning. It smells really nice without being overpowering. It also really works great as a detangler. I like that it is free of parabens and other chemicals that may be harmful.</li>
            <li> This conditioner helps to keep my frizzies under control. If I use too much it can make my hair a little weighed down, but that&#x27;s simple enough--don&#x27;t use too much! I love it!</li>
            <li> This is really the lightest and best leave in I have found.  I bought it after not using it for a few years and I&#x27;m so glad I did!  My only drawback is that it that spraying it really has that strong hair spray odor.</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse hair. The spray helps a little to defrizz it and make it easier to,comb through. But I have to use quite a bit. Thick hair really needs a heavier duty product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for myself for the purpose of untangling my freshly washed thinning hair.  I sprayed same on my hairbrush and it just glided through my hair.  I then bought another bottle for my granddaughter who has thick, curly hair and never wanted to brush it because &amp;#34;it hurts&amp;#34;.  She now does the same thing i do and loves to brush her hair.  No more tangles!</li>
