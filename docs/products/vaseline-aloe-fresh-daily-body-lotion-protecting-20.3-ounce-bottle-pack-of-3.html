            <li>This lotion is great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy they&#x27;re making body lotion with sunscreen in it!</li>
            <li>The price is great too!</li>
            <li>Very happy with the Vaseline lotion.</li>
            <li>A great product!  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite lotion EVER!!!!  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied!</li>
            <li>I would prefer an odorless lotion, but you can&#x27;t win them all.     </li>
            <li>Great for the summer.</li>
            <li>The best available for the money!</li>
            <li>Put it all over your body for good non greasy protection.  </li>
            <li>to be able to obtain it online it great.  </li>
            <li>Has a very nice light CLEAN scent.</li>
            <li>i have very fair, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I love Vaseline products.</li>
            <li>It is light and smells nice and has SPF 15.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Love that this is SPF 15.</li>
            <li>Good price and fast shipment.</li>
            <li>I purchased this Vaseline SPF 15 lotion simply because I wanted sunscreen, and the price was great.  </li>
            <li>Regular Intensive Care lotion is great, but lacks SPF.  </li>
            <li>Was having problems finding it on local shelves, so was quite pleased to see it available on line at a fair price.  </li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT CONTAINING SUNSCREEN WITH DAILY MOISTURIZER AND NOT HEAVY OR GREASY!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I love this lotion and have not been able to purchase in stores for several years.</li>
            <li>I love the product but the price was a bit high.</li>
            <li>This stuff absorbs fast, leaves your skin feeling smooth &amp; hydrated.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Vaseline should state more clearly that even if you use this lotion, you still need to use sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>A dependable sunscreen is still necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Vaseline Consumer services for more information about Vaseline Aloe Fresh Daily Body Lotion - Protecting SPF</li>
            <li>Feels really smooth and silky - skin remains soft for hours.  </li>
            <li>However, when I first started buying it it was in the $6 range; now it&#x27;s around $10.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted... it has been discontinued at Vaseline...</li>
            <li>Vaseline Intensive care has been my long time favorite after shave care.  </li>
            <li>The regretful thing about this product is that it is very hard to find on retail shelves (I am guessing it&#x27;s because a store would prefer that you spend $15 on 2 ounces of fancy \\&quot;Facial SPF\\&quot; than $5 on 20 ounces of something that&#x27;s just as good or better.)    </li>
            <li>Thanks...</li>
            <li>I would have saved my money and just bought real sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I like this product so much</li>
            <li>Really like this lotion because of the SPF 15.  </li>
            <li>There is the sunburn kind, and the really dangerous kind which causes skin cancer.  </li>
            <li>For a few dollars, I get an &#x27;every day&#x27; lotion with SPF that feels really nice on my face and arms.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;Daily body lotion with SPF 15 sensories...is a lightweight aloe formula, which absorbs quickly and has an SPF 15 that will protect skin from PERIODIC exposure to UV rays.  </li>
            <li>I&#x60;d strongly suggest anyone looking for a product with SPF for ACTUAL skin protection skin look elsewhere for a product that indicates BROAD SPECTRUM PROTECTION.</li>
            <li>One of the very few light, daily moisturizing lotions with healthy botanical ingredients as well as SPF 15.</li>
            <li>but okay for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I live in New York City and can&#x27;t find it at drugstores.  </li>
            <li>It may not provide the complete protection needed from sun exposure\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Light and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or small like sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I always wanted a good after shave lotion that did not cost an arm and a leg like the the tiny expensive stuff my wife buys.  </li>
            <li>Nowhere did it say it had broad spectrum protection.  </li>
            <li>My favorite active lotion is Banana Boat Sport, since it doesn&#x27;t smell and sticks through sweat and swim, but as an everyday SPF lotion, the water proof ones can give me pimples and also feels noticably sticky and makes my skin shiny.    </li>
            <li>I like this product - it is light enough to wear everyday, and the SPF provides a bit of protection which we should have daily (not just when we remember to apply!)</li>
            <li>Upon a little research, it appears I was right.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, sinks into your skin quickly and provides SPF 15 protection.</li>

            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTING, especially coming from a product from Vaseline, which I&#x60;ve always thought of as a reputable skin care line.  </li>
            <li> I purchased 2 bottles of this product on sale, thinking I&#x27;d finally found a body lotion with an SPF that I could use everyday.  </li>

            <li> So happy I found this! Wish it wasn&#x27;t discontinued but I&#x27;m stocked for a bit! Thanks...</li>
            <li> It moitsurizes nicely but it clumps up so badly when I try to rub it in that I have to wipe it off with a towel. I won&#x27;t finish the bottle.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it.  Hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I like this product - it is light enough to wear everyday, and the SPF provides a bit of protection which we should have daily (not just when we remember to apply!)</li>
            <li> The best available for the money!</li>
            <li> I purchased this Vaseline SPF 15 lotion simply because I wanted sunscreen, and the price was great.  Unfortunately this product may not offer&lt;br /&gt;sufficient protection from the sun.  A dependable sunscreen is still necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Vaseline Consumer services for more information about Vaseline Aloe Fresh Daily Body Lotion - Protecting SPF 15.&lt;br /&gt;Vaseline stated that this is NOT a Sunscreen Replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is Vaseline&#x27;s reply:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Daily body lotion with SPF 15 sensories...is a lightweight aloe formula, which absorbs quickly and has an SPF 15 that will protect skin from PERIODIC exposure to UV rays.  HOWEVER, this product is NOT waterproof NOR a sunscreen replacement\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot; This product should not be used solely as a sunscreen, as it is not marketed as such. It may not provide the complete protection needed from sun exposure\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vaseline should state more clearly that even if you use this lotion, you still need to use sunscreen.  If I had know this, I would not have purchased it.  I would have saved my money and just bought real sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 bottles of this product on sale, thinking I&#x27;d finally found a body lotion with an SPF that I could use everyday.  I tend to neglect my hands, so I thought I&#x27;d finally I found one I could put by the sink.  I read the bottle and was skeptical because it said \\&quot;protection from sunburn and the drying effect of heat&#x60;.  Nowhere did it say it had broad spectrum protection.  It bought it anyways because it was a deal.  Upon a little research, it appears I was right.  There are 2 types of UV rays, which I already knew.  There is the sunburn kind, and the really dangerous kind which causes skin cancer.  It appears this product only protects against sunburn, but DOES NOT contain the ingredients which protect against the dangerous UV rays.  VERY DISAPPOINTING, especially coming from a product from Vaseline, which I&#x60;ve always thought of as a reputable skin care line.  I fear this product could provide the user with a false sense of security.  I&#x60;d strongly suggest anyone looking for a product with SPF for ACTUAL skin protection skin look elsewhere for a product that indicates BROAD SPECTRUM PROTECTION.</li>
            <li> Vaseline Intensive care has been my long time favorite after shave care.  I always wanted a good after shave lotion that did not cost an arm and a leg like the the tiny expensive stuff my wife buys.  Regular Intensive Care lotion is great, but lacks SPF.  For a few dollars, I get an &#x27;every day&#x27; lotion with SPF that feels really nice on my face and arms.  The lotion itself is not too greasy, and doesn&#x27;t smell bad like many other products. I would prefer an odorless lotion, but you can&#x27;t win them all.     The fact it is NOT a water proof sports sunblock is also a big plus.  My favorite active lotion is Banana Boat Sport, since it doesn&#x27;t smell and sticks through sweat and swim, but as an everyday SPF lotion, the water proof ones can give me pimples and also feels noticably sticky and makes my skin shiny.    For some, Vaseline Intensive Care is not greasy enough.  My fix for that is simply, \\&quot;apply as needed\\&quot; or add a dab of petrolatum.  Since it is inexpensive, use all you want!    The regretful thing about this product is that it is very hard to find on retail shelves (I am guessing it&#x27;s because a store would prefer that you spend $15 on 2 ounces of fancy \\&quot;Facial SPF\\&quot; than $5 on 20 ounces of something that&#x27;s just as good or better.)    Anyway, I like this product so much, I&#x27;m actually buying it online.  I live in New York City and can&#x27;t find it at drugstores.  Best after shave I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years.  It protects and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or smell like regular sun screen.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT CONTAINING SUNSCREEN WITH DAILY MOISTURIZER AND NOT HEAVY OR GREASY!!!!!! LOVE IT, DON&#x27;T KNOW WHY THEY TOOK IT OFF STORE SHELVES???????</li>
            <li> This lotion is great! I&#x27;m so happy they&#x27;re making body lotion with sunscreen in it! This stuff absorbs fast, leaves your skin feeling smooth &amp; hydrated. Has a very nice light CLEAN scent. Very satisfied! The price is great too!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the Vaseline lotion.</li>
            <li> i have very fair, sensitive skin.  i found this product a few years ago and can no longer find it locally.  to be able to obtain it online it great.  i never sunburn using this, my skin stays moist, and it is not sticky.  i hope i can always obtain this product.</li>
            <li> I like this Vaseline lotion, moisturizing but lightweight for summer. Not enough SPF for a day at the beach but okay for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  It keeps me from getting a sunburn and does not stain my clothing like other sunscreens.  I am very disappointed that it has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> Great for the summer. Light and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or small like sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Feels really smooth and silky - skin remains soft for hours.  And I think the 15 SPF works - was in the sun for a few hours and my arms did not burn.  The aroma is also quite pleasing.</li>
            <li> Put it all over your body for good non greasy protection.  I love Vaseline products.</li>
            <li> Not greasy, little odor and spf 15.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and have not been able to purchase in stores for several years. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, sinks into your skin quickly and provides SPF 15 protection. This is my every day lotion to protect my skin when I&#x27;m doing errands, etc. I will buy this forever.</li>
            <li> One of the very few light, daily moisturizing lotions with healthy botanical ingredients as well as SPF 15.</li>
            <li> A great product!  Was having problems finding it on local shelves, so was quite pleased to see it available on line at a fair price.  Personally, I find this product  rejuvenating to my skin; but also, it&#x27;s subtle fragrance, for some reason, transports me back to the summers of my youth. I look forward to a &amp;#34;splash&amp;#34; of this on my face after the shower and shave, since it&#x27;s invigorating both to my skin and my &amp;#34;soul&amp;#34; .</li>
            <li> Really like this lotion because of the SPF 15.  However, when I first started buying it it was in the $6 range; now it&#x27;s around $10.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion EVER!!!!  It is light and smells nice and has SPF 15.  So I use it daily!!  Just wish it wasn&#x27;t discontinued at every store :(.</li>
            <li> I love the product but the price was a bit high.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. Use it all summer, every day after a shower.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want the SPF, and didn&#x27;t notice it when I bought it. I had to send back</li>
            <li> Love that this is SPF 15. No need to add extra sun screen.</li>
            <li> Good price and fast shipment.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted... it has been discontinued at Vaseline... so this is it!!</li>
