            <li>brilliant brilliant  </li>
            <li>This time it looked beautiful and after charging it initially..looked forward to using it..</li>
            <li>Although it didn&#x27;t give a very good shave, I tried to be fair and give it time, as the instructions said it took a couple of weeks for your face to adjust to the blade.    </li>
            <li>on Amazon with great reviews.</li>
            <li>This thing is really great</li>

            <li>It works just as great as they say it dose.</li>
            <li>It works great as a stubble remover.</li>
            <li>So I figured a rechargeable one would be great.</li>
            <li>and it does a great job.</li>
            <li>Great produce for the price</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>

            <li>its just the best for traveling and best all around I&#x27;ve used even with my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The price is great, the product is amazing and he will definately order another one.</li>
            <li>seems best for light shaves.</li>
            <li>Looked like a good idea, but was not.</li>
            <li>kit  -good battery life    </li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>Good packaging.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it is a good shaver.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s all well and good</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t always lather up and take the time to get a good shave..</li>
            <li>Yes, it does work best on light beards,</li>
            <li>I tried it in the shower, with good results.</li>
            <li>I guess if there is one good thing about this product</li>
            <li>It is good for reducing stubble around mustache, goatee and beard.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t shave it at all would not buy or recommend to anyone I have bought lots and lots off amazon and loved everything I had bought</li>
            <li>it is that good.  </li>
            <li>It is rechargeable and it is really good for traveling. . .</li>
            <li>I suspect that the people who gave a good review to this shaver just can&#x27;t  admit to themselves that they got ripped-off.</li>
            <li>Great  cut and rechargeable too nice</li>
            <li>It did as good as my 6 blade Gillette disposable razors.</li>
            <li>For the price this is a good on the go shaver.</li>
            <li>Please this regard the reviews where it gets one star for not being a good beard trimmer or shaver.</li>
            <li>u cannot depend on it for good</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;rechargeable&amp;#34; shaver is good for ONE shave and then you have to recharge it.</li>
            <li>he loved it</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this to anybody it pulls the hair on my face and will not shave good at all</li>
            <li>work good for every day shave</li>
            <li>All Good ... Recommended ...</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s worth its weight in plastic at best.</li>
            <li>I Love It and the company was great on their service.</li>
            <li>I must say that I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Use it as an after shave stubble touch up and you will be extremely satisfied!</li>
            <li>Love this cheapo brand!</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s why, first of all it shaves extremely incredibly astonishingly close!!!</li>
            <li>Just amazing...</li>
            <li>The price is quite amazing</li>
            <li>but does not hold a charge for more than one good shave.</li>
            <li>Excellent product very durable battery.</li>
            <li>The set looks nice.</li>
            <li>I own the model that runs on 2 AAA batteries sold in retail stores.</li>
            <li>It was nice while it lasted.</li>
            <li>Honestly, this thing gives me a closer shave than any electric I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>The advertisement says it comes with a handy shaving kit.  </li>
            <li>For me who is often travel it is nice</li>
            <li>Works nicely in the shower as well.  </li>
            <li>Had one like this before and really liked it.</li>
            <li>Its a good machine, you can&#x27;t demand more for the money paid.</li>
            <li>I can keep one in my bag, and have a nice shave after some time in the Steam Sauna.</li>
            <li>nice.</li>
            <li>W Apt 107</li>
            <li>If you want a quick and easy day-to-day stubble remover, THIS IS THE PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li>The shaver is cute, cheap, and a lot of people say it works great.  </li>
            <li>It is great for a quick touch up.</li>
            <li>But as far as working out of the box, I can tell you that it does an excellent job.</li>
            <li>I wanted a good cheap shaver that could be used in the shower.</li>
            <li>Photo of product seems to show case standing more effectively than it does.  </li>
            <li>It took a month to arrive and no way to cancel the order, from $10 it went to $51.98 I opened one of them yesterday when it arrived and it cannot even shave the very fine hair on my hand....</li>
            <li>It was incredible compact, decently powerful, and lasted about 5 days per full charge.</li>
            <li>I own another Shavepro Microforce shaver and it has been fine.</li>
            <li>Let me give a list of items I would consider to be better to shave with.     </li>
            <li>ok, you get the idea.  </li>
            <li>Interesting differences of opinion about these here.     </li>
            <li>As said elsewhere here, it is not for heavier beards - but it DOES shave OK if you&#x27;re already used to electric.</li>
            <li>This is better than a safety razor.</li>
            <li>It just couldn&#x27;t get those parts no matter how many times I went over</li>
            <li>I have now bought many for Christmas gifts for the men.  </li>
            <li>It holds a charge for more than a one time use.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s best potential.   </li>
            <li>In the course of my lifetime I have owned many battery operated shavers.</li>
            <li>For $10.- it is an interesting conversation starter, at the gym, in the shared bathroom.    </li>
            <li>This is better than one of those even 200 dollar shavers.</li>
            <li>Better than my Braun 360.</li>
            <li>After that, you can use it daily and be very pleased!!</li>
            <li>I would not have bought it simply because you can find excellent travel shavers from Braun, Panasonic etc.</li>
            <li>Like many travel shavers, there is no clipper, just the foil.</li>
            <li>results kept unsatisfying me more and more</li>
            <li>If you are shaving everyday than this will be a good shaver for you (might I suggest some shaving cream?), but if you are a once a week shaver, this might not be the best.</li>
            <li>It worked marginally okay</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s more convenient than one, but at the cost of your face screaming out in pain after you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li>Does better than disposable blades.....  </li>
            <li>And I love the inexpensive price.       </li>
            <li>I love that it is cordless.</li>
            <li>I also have the non rechargeable, battery Microforce and love it.  </li>
            <li>This shaver works great for fast close shave.</li>
            <li>Shaver works great, but they wear out fast.</li>
            <li>It does not cut at all ...tried so many ways and just does not work..</li>
            <li>Had better.</li>
            <li>Pay a bit more and buy a Philips one.</li>
            <li>For men this might be okay.  </li>
            <li>I love using it.</li>
            <li>A nice smooth shaved surface on your skin.</li>
            <li>Or safe.  </li>
            <li>a good and useful product</li>
            <li>it will not go through the hair on top of your head</li>
            <li>I have had many electric shavers in my life, none of them more than 4 on a scale of 1-10, 10 being a shower shave with a motorized blade razor.      </li>
            <li>It will not remove more than stubble from your face.</li>
            <li>When This One Break&#x27;s :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got this.</li>
            <li>If anyone knows if they even make a car charger for this I would love to know, basically it&#x27;s ok for an emergency to get rid of stubble, but if you have time</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re better off using the blade.</li>
            <li>You are honestly better off shaving with a butter knife, but thats what you get for 10 bucks.</li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>Now I use this most of the time.</li>
            <li>Quality is just OK</li>
            <li>love this thing relly works well</li>
            <li>Works great, but you will need to have a razor blade shave first, after that you can easily maintain a close shave.</li>
            <li>know why one shaver works great but is unusable, and the other works great.  </li>
            <li>I am amazed with its power, love the size and it cuts for a very clean shave.</li>
            <li>and that is still too much!!!!</li>
            <li>I ordered it at midnight online with the deluxe kit by the time i realized there were 2 shavers ordered instead of an upgrade to the original</li>
            <li>It comes with manicure kit which is really useful and a very elegant leather case.    </li>
            <li>Size and shaving good but does not hold the charge for very long,not sure I would recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li>This shaver does a fine job for me &amp; has for many months.</li>
            <li>Just let it glide lightly against your skin and it will work much better.  </li>
            <li>All in all, it provides a closer and more comfortable shave at a price that equals buying razor blades.</li>
            <li>Made in China and is nothing more than a cheaply made toy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This could be the best $10.00 I have ever spent.</li>
            <li>so it takes a good amount of time to shave a whole face.</li>
            <li>Works very well and a really good value</li>
            <li>&quot; he shaves the razor is good for removing leftover stubble, but I think if you buy this as your main razor you are going to be very dissapointed, and if you buy it for travel you are probably not going to make a good impression wherever you go.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s just the thing when you need a quick and easy shave (like before a date or a business meeting!)</li>
            <li>Compact and fits easily in travel kit.  </li>
            <li>While the shaver is worth the money, it isn&#x27;t necessarily the best shaver.</li>
            <li>There easy to recharge and the charge lasts for about a week.</li>
            <li>it 2 weeks--still runs strong-</li>
            <li>Liked the first one we bought, but it ran out of battery within two months.  </li>
            <li>it kind of worked on the first time I used it but</li>
            <li>&quot; I have fine sand colored hairs on my arms and the microforce basically did the equivalent of a lint roller.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s cheap, seem to work well, the replacement blades on my rotary are more than $37, so this is great for my purpose, I have only used for 2 months so far so good.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with it, esp when I paid less that £10 including postage on Ebay.</li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>they work just fine........</li>
            <li>I am very happy with my little shaver and have even considered buying another as a backup or travel kit razor.</li>
            <li>-built cheaply    </li>
            <li>It is also very portable and handy.</li>
            <li>Before even using it I can tell how cheap it feels.</li>
            <li>So cheap, should I buy it?</li>
            <li>It leaves smooth skin, but razor irritations.</li>
            <li>It is a flimsy, cheap piece of junk, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying it for ANY reason.</li>
            <li>There are cheap plastic tabs on the side to hold the foil in place.</li>
            <li>and my face is extremely smooth.</li>
            <li>I had a light shadow of stubble and decided to give the Microforce shaver</li>
            <li>and I like that it&#x27;s lightweight and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>If you want a comfortable, close shave, put a light coat of shaving foam</li>
            <li>He is CHEAP and squekes when he walks.</li>
            <li>But if you shave in the morning, this does a fantastic job of cleaning up and keeping you neat in the afternoon</li>
            <li>Fantastic product for the price.</li>
            <li>I find that if I use this thing during the day, I come out smooth as a cue ball.</li>
            <li>I also have the battery powered one with me for my trips as I fly for a living and it also works equally as well.</li>
            <li>baby smooth....</li>
            <li>my skin is so smooth after wards.well done for this product.thank you.c spencer.</li>
            <li>This is the third one I have had, they are great.  </li>
            <li>This is a great second shaver.  </li>
            <li>If you never have problems with sensitive skin, might be a good fit.</li>
            <li>it shaves great!i have a top of the line braun and this shaver keeps right up with it.trust me its worth it!</li>
            <li>I find myself sitting in my recliner  watching TV and picking it up for a quick and easy shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean and the price certainly is right.</li>
            <li>After about a week of trying, I tried something else: I shaved my face with a razor, then used the Microforce the next day to remove the stubble, and it worked great, but if I dabbed on a little Lectric Shave right before, it worked PERFECTLY!    </li>
            <li>Your better off using a straight razor!</li>
            <li>He agrees that if you have really long hairs, it doesn&#x27;t do a great job.  </li>
            <li>Then another wait--4 to 6 hours for the battery to charge up again,  I recommend getting rechargeable batteries and the original razor.</li>
            <li>I have the AAA battery version which is compact and travel friendly.  </li>
            <li>fantastic little shaver ideal to take on holiday</li>
            <li>Still, it is great to be able to shave on the run - saves me a few minutes anyway.</li>
            <li>However, if you need an inexpensive portable care free razor for a quick trip-</li>
            <li>how helpful found via this cleanly transportable SHAVEPRO appearance helper or assistant is.</li>
            <li>Start with a clean microforce and end with it clean</li>
            <li>I just bought one of these \\&quot;razors\\&quot; today in the hope that its \\&quot;9000 RPM\\&quot; head would shave my face &amp; head faster than my Norelco rotary, and be easier to clean to boot:</li>
            <li>I keep one in each car so that I can &#x27;clean up&#x27; when needed.  </li>
            <li>I purchased one of these little things because I needed an \\&quot;on the go\\&quot; shaver, figuring that the size and portability of the product was ideal.</li>
            <li>It says basically that the shave won&#x27;t be so good at first, but in two weeks time it will improve considerably.  </li>
            <li>This product is good for grass like hair only.     </li>
            <li>It charges quick and gives a razor clean shave.</li>
            <li>And finally, it claims to be \\&quot;WET/DRY\\&quot; -- good for boating.    </li>
            <li>The next day it took away bristle just as good as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>for\\&quot; is true.</li>
            <li>I shave in the morning with my regular Norelco razor but the Microforce is good for touch-ups.</li>
            <li>lightweight portability is crucial, just get a good disposable razor and use it.</li>
            <li>so I can get a quick clean up before meetings.</li>
            <li>He was well pleased to receive this and states it works very well.</li>
            <li>If you use it every day, the shave is not bad though.</li>
            <li>Still&#x27; for the pprice not bad for just a protective cover.</li>
            <li>Once and a while it will pull a hair or two but other than that it works great.</li>
            <li>Works well and holds charge for an adequate amount of time.</li>
            <li>The shave does actually get better through continued use and it also seems to work better if you don&#x27;t press it too close to your face but let it glide over your skin.</li>
            <li>No problem with packaging or shipping, product came quickly.</li>
            <li>but after your skin gets used to it, it will give you a super close shave and your face</li>
            <li>/&gt;It shaves very close, recharges well and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Also the battery power runs out quickly.</li>
            <li>I keep one in my car for when I just need a quick shave and one at home.</li>
            <li>AND you lose the original shipping and handling charges as well, which is almost the cost of the darn thing right there.    </li>
            <li>I Was Kind Of Sketchy About Buying This Product , Because Of All The Bad Reveiw&#x27;s People Kept Saying About It, But Honestly It Worked Great On Me</li>
            <li>infact ideal to take anywhere as its so small</li>
            <li>It takes a long time to get a good shaving on your face, but forget about shaving your neck with it, it just doesn&#x27;t work and it irritates a lot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sorry!</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t see how anyone could give this 5 stars unless they have never used a good shaver or their expectation was super low to start.</li>
            <li>This is really a great little shaver.</li>
            <li>The little bugger works great on my type of beard...</li>
            <li>These little shavers are great gifts for my girlfriends.</li>
            <li>Its a great little travel razor to throw in the briefcase...</li>
            <li>These little razors work great for me.</li>
            <li>I was a little discouraged when I read that it doesn&#x27;t for great for longer hair, but I bought it anyway.</li>
            <li>Hopefully this help you and have fun shaving</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t worth 99 cents.</li>
            <li>May not be even worth the one star.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this shaver before and obviously liked it enough to purchase again.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t shave worth a damn.</li>
            <li>so hopefully, I can add some useful</li>
            <li>but its worth it.</li>
            <li>powerful.</li>
            <li>I prefer to use the standard version but use my own rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li>Would of liked a refund bur Amazon didn&#x27;t get back to me about it.</li>
            <li>I use it on my legs and other more sensitve areas and it gives me very smooth skin.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;This is a very handy little compact shaver.</li>
            <li>They are wild about them.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a quick send and easy to do business with you.</li>
            <li>Right to the point...</li>
            <li>my razor misses on the right side of my neck every time I shave</li>
            <li>I guess they&#x27;re right then...  </li>
            <li>It started right up.  </li>
            <li>Price was right, delivery was prompt with no hassles  </li>
            <li>or it won&#x27;t work, but if your hair is the right length it&#x27;ll shave like a pro...</li>
            <li>For it&#x27;s size, it&#x27;s pretty powerful.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this shaver hoping it worked half as good as the ads.</li>
            <li>If you absolutely have to try it, then get it from a brick and mortar shop so you can return it quickly and inexpensively.    </li>
            <li>Other than the 2 points above, it is a VERY good razor that cuts as close as anything I have ever used and because of the size, it maneuvers well around the face.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Reading the other reviews gave me nice and useful information on how to use it to</li>
            <li>Good little shaver, and</li>
            <li>That said it is a good little razor for the price.</li>
            <li>The unit is very powerful despite the size, but I had some skin reaction to the unit when I use it dry, but for the wet shaving is great......</li>
            <li>Moreover, the areas stayed smooth for days on end from such a clean, close trim.</li>
            <li>The grooming kit it comes with was quite a nice bonus (particularly for the LOW price I paid for everything).    </li>
            <li>Interestingly, they write this letter that is included with the product that claims \\&quot;it takes two weeks for your facial hair to adjust to the razor\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Hmmm, I&#x27;m not so sure that my facial hair has any awareness as to how its being cut...  </li>
            <li>Works better with water, but what&#x27;s the point of a touch-up shaver that needs water to work and makes your face look red and patchy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to show up for an meeting or event undershaved than with red patchy shave and irritated skin.    </li>
            <li>After that, get on here and do the same thing to pay it forward so more people don&#x27;t get ripped off.    </li>
            <li>The first day I received it I charged it for 6 hours like it says and used it.</li>
            <li>On the first night I used Microforce, I couldn&#x27;t believe how close of a shave it gave me.</li>
            <li>I depend on the back of my hand more than on my reflection to determine how close of a shave I gave myself.</li>
            <li>My husband got this as a birthday gift from his sister and on the first day it would not shave at all.</li>
            <li>but the overall shave quality is ok.</li>
            <li>The first one was years ago when they first came out</li>
            <li>Then shave again using the old Microforce shaver that does give me a close, smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I bought the shaver in the first place to have something that could give me a real quick shave when I&#x27;m running short on time.  </li>
            <li>We tried many different ways over - and - over - and - over.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful and fast.  </li>
            <li>after about 5 mins of back and forth with the liar she said ok</li>
            <li>Shaves are okay, not equivalent to an actual razor for closeness but passable to keep you stubble-free.</li>
            <li>you can just stick it in your pocket,dont be fooled by the size though as i find it better than the big shavors</li>
            <li>first shave was a shocker.</li>
            <li>: In order for it to work properly, you must make sure that it has fully battery.</li>
            <li>My husband received the shaver and the first day the on/off switch stopped working.</li>
            <li>Useful to take on trips for touch up or fast shave.</li>
            <li>The first got lost.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my legs, but I read the reviews first.</li>
            <li>The gentle, tiny foil reached and trimmed the fine hairs much more effectively and painlessly than anything else I ever tried (big electric rotor razors, rotary personal groomers, etc).     </li>
            <li>the battery powered one and they&#x27;re just good shavers, better than bigger more expensive ones I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way more powerful than I expected</li>
            <li>This is good for regular shaves only.</li>
            <li>So, this will cut short, coarse, stubby hairs in a snap, works good.</li>
            <li>And sure enough it pulls the hairs so much that it is unusable.  </li>
            <li>A razor that is only good for about a year, but the closeness of the shave is of such quality that I bought another one.</li>
            <li>not like the commercial have a guy in a shower and able to shaved and cut a whole lot of a face show of a stuble of a beard.</li>
            <li>Far from the last razor one buys but handy in</li>
            <li>You might still get a minor irritation but much better then</li>
            <li>make sure its fully charged,and you wont have any problems with pulling on wiskers.it holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>Purchased this product at a CVS for around $10 since I was interested in a cordless close electric shave, which this product did provide very well.</li>
            <li>If you shave everyday or every other day, this should work perfectly.     </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it INSTEAD of my razor, but as long as it is used as I am sure it is intended....</li>
            <li>My current main electric shaver is a top of line Norelco.</li>
            <li>Yes, you will have to go over most areas of your face a few times to get a smooth shave, but personally I DO get a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>bought this back in March, still going strong.</li>
            <li>honestly, I really question the validity of positive reviews on this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also possible your skin will be fine with rotary shaver, but not a foil one or vice versa.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had purchased this item before and it worked fine until it was necessary to recharge it....</li>
            <li>This actually worked fine for me.</li>
            <li>COMPACT AND NICE LITTLE SHAVER, TIME WILL TELL ABOUT IT...</li>
            <li>First of all, it doesn&#x27;t shave long hairs, even fine line hairs.</li>
            <li>But I am a lady and for those little patches of softer facial hair as well as legs, this shaver works great.  </li>
            <li>And it would be a great little gizmo if the damned thing actually worked.</li>
            <li>This little guy worked so good that it completely replaced the Braun I was using.</li>
            <li>You do need to clean it as per the instructions and I put rubbing alcohol to lubricate and clean it once per week, but I did that with other shavers I have had.</li>
            <li>Well it didn&#x27;t seem to do much at all for stubble.      </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t so powerful as to injur delicate skin, but it has enough power to do the job great.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much from it, but a friend of mine swears by his</li>
            <li>Reason at lower speed hairs tend to be not so gently pulled --</li>
            <li>I ran the back of my fingers over my cheeks and was amazed at how smooth my face felt.</li>
            <li>I really did expect the Shaver to sharper.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone looking for a credit card size shaver that you could use wet/dry!  </li>
            <li>cuts skin very often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for and in this case, it ain&#x27;t much.    </li>
            <li>That means if you have any longer hairs, it won&#x27;t do much for you.</li>
            <li>This item really sucked it doesn&#x27;t work very well at all</li>
            <li>It also gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li>a try straight out of the box.  </li>
            <li>Does not shave very well.</li>
            <li>Also it would leave my neck VERY irritated.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>If you wants improve the performance must replace the springs below the blades.</li>
            <li>And, it really is water-proof.</li>
            <li>These are cheap enough to keep one in your car, office desk, or even in your pocket.</li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>And it was very inexpensive from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t need to shave</li>
            <li>And, as women age and hormone levels change, there&#x27;s sometimes a stray chin hair that pops up just when you&#x27;re getting ready to leave the house.</li>
            <li>he really like it...</li>
            <li>How do I no when it is fully charge , does the red indicator light change any at all</li>
            <li>It works very well,</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>First thing first, I was surprised that the battery still held factory charge.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>I liked the wet/dry use for such a low price.  </li>
            <li>have only used it very rarely</li>
            <li>It is small, light, but easy to use.</li>
            <li>And the battery lasts a long  time and charges easily.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great when it works, but it doesn&#x27;t work for long - and works only on short stubble.</li>
            <li>It works best if you don&#x27;t press down hard.</li>
            <li>I tried shaving with this thing for 20 straight minutes and couldn&#x27;t get a decent shave.</li>
            <li>I bought this item and found that while it does shave you, it&#x27;s not as good as a blade, it leaves behind hairs and leaves my skin feeling sore and irritated, the battery life is not great either, but my biggest complaint is that while it comes with a pack of accessories most men would not use, it DOESNT come with one item I would have thought to be the best accessory to include, a car charger.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my special needs son, I didn&#x27;t want him to cut himself with a traditional razor.  </li>
            <li>not worth buying unless you can&#x27;t afford some thing better</li>
            <li>Yesterday, after a full charge, I unplugged it and left it on my counter.</li>
            <li>Here is what I have discovered with this shaver: It does not work well on more than a 36 hour growth of the average beard.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving for more than half a century.</li>
            <li>I apologize for this and would therefore raise my rating from one star to four stars if I could (but can&#x27;t seem to do this) mainly based on the razor&#x27;s portability and ease of use.</li>
            <li>So I thought, ok maybe it only cuts really short stubble.  </li>
            <li>Save your money and get a decent battery powered or electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I bought this tiny shaver thinking I could do a quick job on the move</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a simple item to make so why not make it a better design.</li>
            <li>It worked decently well (again) for 7 months</li>
            <li>it works ok but is not good as the same model it replaced - do not like need for 7 more words</li>
            <li>high Quality</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t tried one I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>i love this little guy..</li>
            <li>Spent another $10.00 and bought a cheap electric at Walmart.</li>
            <li>Does a reasonable job however it takes a lot of patience to get a complete shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a neanderthal man type, but do have a normal beard.      </li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than the switch issue, this shaver is definitely useful for travel purposes (i.e. short term use).  </li>
            <li>/burst. !?!?! That doesn&#x27;t seem normal.</li>
            <li>Great little shaver to get in those tight spots when cleaning up the Taint and Balls.</li>
            <li>Shaves really close along the cheeks, sideburns, and most of the upper lip IF your facial hair is really really short.....    </li>
            <li>This is a nice small unit and mine came with a nice travel set of other items such as clippers and an extra foil etc.    </li>
            <li>This will allow your skin to adjust to the new shaver.</li>
            <li>I discovered this out of curiosity and found that it&#x27;s my new shaving</li>
            <li>It does a decent job for what it was designed but clearly its not something I would use every morning as is just too small.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this little thing!  </li>
            <li>It has a tough time handling a full day of growth so it would not be good as your only shaver unless you planned to shave multiple times per day.  </li>
            <li>One interesting thing about it: the tiny, rounded trimmers lent themselves to trying on the difficult, fine hair around (and just inside!)</li>
            <li>Be aware for future purchases.</li>
            <li>It is REALLY SMALL and cute.</li>
            <li>Significant Other&#x27;s Review:  </li>
            <li>Not only that, but an entire 24-hours later, it still felt smooth!</li>
            <li>but you may need another razor to get you short first.  </li>
            <li>at first for daily shaves.</li>
            <li>UPDATE: bought a second unit just to see if the first unit I received was just defective.</li>
            <li>I first found these in my local drugstore, but they don&#x27;t have them any longer.  </li>
            <li>When I received the 2 new ones I ordered, I used the new power cord to charge the old razor.  </li>
            <li>So I have two, one old and one new.....</li>
            <li>The rechargeable version, while still good, does not have a very long battery life and less power overall.  </li>
            <li>Well, they are true, but only last me about ~10 charge cycles</li>
            <li>Now the experience: First it shaves well, in my case, sensitive skin, moderate beard -- no skin irritation.</li>
            <li>For $10.00 it really is a good small devise for touch ups, and the occasional entire face shave.</li>
            <li>This one was simply a replacement since my previous one of many years needed a replacement charging cord.</li>
            <li>facial hair has to be a certain length</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;high speed\\&quot; motor is only high speed when you&#x27;re not shaving.</li>
            <li>May take a little practice, but you&#x27;ll wind up with a confortable shave and a face smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s when this little shaver really comes in handy to correct these little missed spots.</li>
            <li>I bought one of these at Walmart because my beloved Remington DA 307 finally gave up the ghost after several decades of hard use(RIP).</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find out that this tiny shaver gave me a closer shave than the razor I used to shave with that very morning.</li>
            <li>It will give you a \\&quot;close clean shave in half of the time\\&quot; and you can \\&quot;shave anywhere-anytime-even in the shower.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Let&#x27;s be clear about my 5-star rating.</li>
            <li>Absolute garbage - ripped my facial hair rather than shaved it.   </li>
            <li>a 24yrs old woman</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>So far the product has been satisfactory and has lived up to it&#x27;s name.</li>
            <li>I recommend this shaver to anyone with a light to heavy beard.</li>
            <li>I am glad I ignored the negative reviews and took a chance with this product.  </li>
            <li>This product should really have a zero out of five stars, but I suppose that isn&#x27;t an actual rating.  </li>
            <li>By applying virtually no pressure to my face, the micropuller managed to jam up every time I brought it to my chin, resulting in loud obscenities.      </li>
            <li>Now, as a college sophomore, I found the kit digging through my old stuff.</li>
            <li>It not only shaves, but it is a really close shave,</li>
            <li>I suppose the old addage, \\&quot;you get what you pay</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t recommend this shaver for soft, non-stubbly hairs like those of someone just beginning to shave.</li>
            <li>I received the Microforce Shaver in early February.</li>
            <li>Now I cant speak to durability, and if it craps out in short order i would lower my 5* rating, but it gives a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>The shaver holds up very well, I only wish there was a way to have it sharpened rather than replacing it.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, I would say give it a pass.</li>
            <li>this one was a joke  loud  kept&lt;br</li>
            <li>Use on medium stubble in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of a travel razor I could use if I was running late, but it just didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>It works better after a few initial shaves, like the instructions say.</li>
            <li>this is a fabulous little shaver--it works great-and so small and easy to carry-even in your shirt pocket-try that with your norelco-i have not had to recharge yet-tho</li>
            <li>It gives me a very close shave, may be a bit of skin irritation for the first few days, but you get that from every new shaver anyway.</li>
            <li>this little shaver is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>We have found it works only on a beard that is short stubble, and you have to go over it several times to get it clean shaven.</li>
            <li>It gives a very smooth shave as long as your beard is still short (less than a days growth).  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that the battery charge lasts a long time and that the size is very convenient.</li>
            <li>For the past year I would follow the shave up with the Microforce and it made my skin as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>I have used the battery-powered version of this product for a long time, and have had very satisfactory performance, except for having to change batteries.  </li>
            <li>I dont use electric shavers because they don&#x27;t normally shave closely enough for my taste.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good little shaver, I use it off and on, I will use it when I&#x27;m away from home as it does not take hardly any space in my suit case.</li>
            <li>Although this does give a good, close shave (it may take several passes to get that shave), my skin is always a little raw for a couple days after using it.</li>
            <li>The new Miicroforce razor seems to be abig improvement over the one I bought several years ago.</li>
            <li>But if you use it daily and don&#x27;t let to grow past short, it works amazingly well and does get closer than my conventional straight blade razors.      </li>
            <li>this doesn&#x27;t cut hair... and without cutting hair, i don&#x27;t see how anything else is worth mentioning :)</li>
            <li>Crappy shaver that did not do a good job, was uncomfortable to use and after 6 uses the foil is starting to tear.</li>
            <li>A+ brand new, small and powerful shaver.</li>
            <li>However, it is not very good for shaving after more than 2 days growth (i.e. a long weekend without shaving).</li>
            <li>the price is right, and when the blades get dull after a year or so - I just buy a new one!</li>
            <li>I received this small in stature but large in worthlessness piece of junk for Christmas, which was convenient since I had lost a part to me REAL electric shaver during my travel home.  </li>
            <li>The second day it stopped working completely, so I saw it pointed me to throw it</li>
            <li>Exact same scenario only this time the busted open device left an oil stain on my carpet.</li>
            <li>this thing can barely cut peach fuzz.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve had several stop working and had to cannibalize old ones for parts) but the price is cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li>In fact, if you don&#x27;t shave everyday, this thing doesn&#x27;t even attempt to cut hair longer than a days worth of beard growing.</li>
            <li>razor shaves at least as good, if not better, than all of the $50.00-$100.00 electrics from Remington, Braun, and Norelco (trust me, I have had them all at one time or another).</li>
            <li>and it is dead right now.  </li>
            <li>I liked the size but the quality was very poor.</li>
            <li>To begin with, I don&#x27;t use it as my main shaver because it&#x27;s definitely rough on the skin...</li>
            <li>would ship this garbage back to to shipper, but it isn&#x27;t worth the trouble.  </li>
            <li>This little bugger will do exactly as the packagage describes.  </li>
            <li>your face may feel irritated the first few days you use it</li>
            <li>While it did shave some of my facial hair, it would leave many strays behind... especially on the neck area.  </li>
            <li>When I shave my neck/chest hair with this it is very difficult because it doesn&#x27;t get a good grip on softer hair.</li>
            <li>NiMH have 10% less voltage, and that means 20% less available power to the motor.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I had to give up and borrow my step father&#x27;s razor to finish the job, a gross, but unavoidable solution to the mess it left on my face.  </li>
            <li>I tried using it several times and it barely cut and left my skin irritable.</li>
            <li>Nice little shaver!!!!!</li>
            <li>I have a medium beard, and certainly you have to use this everyday for effectiveness</li>

            <li> brilliant brilliant  </li>
            <li> This time it looked beautiful and after charging it initially..looked forward to using it..</li>
            <li> Although it didn&#x27;t give a very good shave, I tried to be fair and give it time, as the instructions said it took a couple of weeks for your face to adjust to the blade.    </li>
            <li> on Amazon with great reviews.</li>
            <li> This thing is really great</li>

            <li> I am happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works just as great as they say it dose.</li>
            <li> It works great as a stubble remover.</li>
            <li> So I figured a rechargeable one would be great.</li>
            <li> and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> Great produce for the price</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>

            <li> The price is great, the product is amazing and he will definately order another one.</li>
            <li> seems best for light shaves.</li>
            <li> Looked like a good idea, but was not.</li>

            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> Good packaging.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it is a good shaver.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s all well and good</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t always lather up and take the time to get a good shave..</li>
            <li> Yes, it does work best on light beards,</li>
            <li> I tried it in the shower, with good results.</li>
            <li> I guess if there is one good thing about this product</li>
            <li> It is good for reducing stubble around mustache, goatee and beard.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t shave it at all would not buy or recommend to anyone I have bought lots and lots off amazon and loved everything I had bought</li>
            <li> it is that good.  </li>
            <li> It is rechargeable and it is really good for traveling. . .</li>
            <li> I suspect that the people who gave a good review to this shaver just can&#x27;t  admit to themselves that they got ripped-off.</li>
            <li> Great  cut and rechargeable too nice</li>
            <li> It did as good as my 6 blade Gillette disposable razors.</li>
            <li> For the price this is a good on the go shaver.</li>
            <li> Please this regard the reviews where it gets one star for not being a good beard trimmer or shaver.</li>
            <li> u cannot depend on it for good</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;rechargeable&amp;#34; shaver is good for ONE shave and then you have to recharge it.</li>
            <li> he loved it</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this to anybody it pulls the hair on my face and will not shave good at all</li>
            <li> work good for every day shave</li>
            <li> All Good ... Recommended ...</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s worth its weight in plastic at best.</li>
            <li> I Love It and the company was great on their service.</li>
            <li> I must say that I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Use it as an after shave stubble touch up and you will be extremely satisfied!</li>
            <li> Love this cheapo brand!</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s why, first of all it shaves extremely incredibly astonishingly close!!!</li>
            <li> Just amazing...</li>
            <li> The price is quite amazing</li>
            <li> but does not hold a charge for more than one good shave.</li>
            <li> Excellent product very durable battery.</li>
            <li> The set looks nice.</li>
            <li> I own the model that runs on 2 AAA batteries sold in retail stores.</li>
            <li> It was nice while it lasted.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this thing gives me a closer shave than any electric I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> The advertisement says it comes with a handy shaving kit.  </li>
            <li> For me who is often travel it is nice</li>
            <li> Works nicely in the shower as well.  </li>
            <li> Had one like this before and really liked it.</li>
            <li> Its a good machine, you can&#x27;t demand more for the money paid.</li>
            <li> I can keep one in my bag, and have a nice shave after some time in the Steam Sauna.</li>
            <li> nice.</li>
            <li> W Apt 107</li>
            <li> If you want a quick and easy day-to-day stubble remover, THIS IS THE PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> The shaver is cute, cheap, and a lot of people say it works great.  </li>
            <li> It is great for a quick touch up.</li>
            <li> But as far as working out of the box, I can tell you that it does an excellent job.</li>
            <li> I wanted a good cheap shaver that could be used in the shower.</li>
            <li> Photo of product seems to show case standing more effectively than it does.  </li>
            <li> It took a month to arrive and no way to cancel the order, from $10 it went to $51.98 I opened one of them yesterday when it arrived and it cannot even shave the very fine hair on my hand....</li>
            <li> It was incredible compact, decently powerful, and lasted about 5 days per full charge.</li>
            <li> I own another Shavepro Microforce shaver and it has been fine.</li>
            <li> Let me give a list of items I would consider to be better to shave with.     </li>
            <li> ok, you get the idea.  </li>
            <li> Interesting differences of opinion about these here.     </li>
            <li> As said elsewhere here, it is not for heavier beards - but it DOES shave OK if you&#x27;re already used to electric.</li>
            <li> This is better than a safety razor.</li>
            <li> It just couldn&#x27;t get those parts no matter how many times I went over</li>
            <li> I have now bought many for Christmas gifts for the men.  </li>
            <li> It holds a charge for more than a one time use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s best potential.   </li>
            <li> In the course of my lifetime I have owned many battery operated shavers.</li>
            <li> For $10.- it is an interesting conversation starter, at the gym, in the shared bathroom.    </li>
            <li> This is better than one of those even 200 dollar shavers.</li>
            <li> Better than my Braun 360.</li>
            <li> After that, you can use it daily and be very pleased!!</li>
            <li> I would not have bought it simply because you can find excellent travel shavers from Braun, Panasonic etc.</li>
            <li> Like many travel shavers, there is no clipper, just the foil.</li>
            <li> results kept unsatisfying me more and more</li>
            <li> If you are shaving everyday than this will be a good shaver for you (might I suggest some shaving cream?), but if you are a once a week shaver, this might not be the best.</li>
            <li> It worked marginally okay</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s more convenient than one, but at the cost of your face screaming out in pain after you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> Does better than disposable blades.....  </li>
            <li> And I love the inexpensive price.       </li>
            <li> I love that it is cordless.</li>
            <li> I also have the non rechargeable, battery Microforce and love it.  </li>
            <li> This shaver works great for fast close shave.</li>
            <li> Shaver works great, but they wear out fast.</li>
            <li> It does not cut at all ...tried so many ways and just does not work..</li>
            <li> Had better.</li>
            <li> Pay a bit more and buy a Philips one.</li>
            <li> For men this might be okay.  </li>
            <li> I love using it.</li>
            <li> A nice smooth shaved surface on your skin.</li>
            <li> Or safe.  </li>
            <li> a good and useful product</li>
            <li> it will not go through the hair on top of your head</li>
            <li> I have had many electric shavers in my life, none of them more than 4 on a scale of 1-10, 10 being a shower shave with a motorized blade razor.      </li>
            <li> It will not remove more than stubble from your face.</li>
            <li> When This One Break&#x27;s :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got this.</li>
            <li> If anyone knows if they even make a car charger for this I would love to know, basically it&#x27;s ok for an emergency to get rid of stubble, but if you have time</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re better off using the blade.</li>
            <li> You are honestly better off shaving with a butter knife, but thats what you get for 10 bucks.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> Now I use this most of the time.</li>
            <li> Quality is just OK</li>
            <li> love this thing relly works well</li>
            <li> Works great, but you will need to have a razor blade shave first, after that you can easily maintain a close shave.</li>
            <li> know why one shaver works great but is unusable, and the other works great.  </li>
            <li> I am amazed with its power, love the size and it cuts for a very clean shave.</li>
            <li> and that is still too much!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered it at midnight online with the deluxe kit by the time i realized there were 2 shavers ordered instead of an upgrade to the original</li>
            <li> It comes with manicure kit which is really useful and a very elegant leather case.    </li>
            <li> Size and shaving good but does not hold the charge for very long,not sure I would recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> This shaver does a fine job for me &amp; has for many months.</li>
            <li> Just let it glide lightly against your skin and it will work much better.  </li>
            <li> All in all, it provides a closer and more comfortable shave at a price that equals buying razor blades.</li>
            <li> Made in China and is nothing more than a cheaply made toy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This could be the best $10.00 I have ever spent.</li>
            <li> so it takes a good amount of time to shave a whole face.</li>
            <li> Works very well and a really good value</li>
            <li> &quot; he shaves the razor is good for removing leftover stubble, but I think if you buy this as your main razor you are going to be very dissapointed, and if you buy it for travel you are probably not going to make a good impression wherever you go.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just the thing when you need a quick and easy shave (like before a date or a business meeting!)</li>
            <li> Compact and fits easily in travel kit.  </li>
            <li> While the shaver is worth the money, it isn&#x27;t necessarily the best shaver.</li>
            <li> There easy to recharge and the charge lasts for about a week.</li>
            <li> it 2 weeks--still runs strong-</li>
            <li> Liked the first one we bought, but it ran out of battery within two months.  </li>
            <li> it kind of worked on the first time I used it but</li>
            <li> &quot; I have fine sand colored hairs on my arms and the microforce basically did the equivalent of a lint roller.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s cheap, seem to work well, the replacement blades on my rotary are more than $37, so this is great for my purpose, I have only used for 2 months so far so good.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with it, esp when I paid less that £10 including postage on Ebay.</li>
            <li> It works fine.</li>
            <li> they work just fine........</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my little shaver and have even considered buying another as a backup or travel kit razor.</li>
            <li> -built cheaply    </li>
            <li> It is also very portable and handy.</li>
            <li> Before even using it I can tell how cheap it feels.</li>
            <li> So cheap, should I buy it?</li>
            <li> It leaves smooth skin, but razor irritations.</li>
            <li> It is a flimsy, cheap piece of junk, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying it for ANY reason.</li>
            <li> There are cheap plastic tabs on the side to hold the foil in place.</li>
            <li> and my face is extremely smooth.</li>
            <li> I had a light shadow of stubble and decided to give the Microforce shaver</li>
            <li> and I like that it&#x27;s lightweight and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> If you want a comfortable, close shave, put a light coat of shaving foam</li>
            <li> He is CHEAP and squekes when he walks.</li>
            <li> But if you shave in the morning, this does a fantastic job of cleaning up and keeping you neat in the afternoon</li>
            <li> Fantastic product for the price.</li>
            <li> I find that if I use this thing during the day, I come out smooth as a cue ball.</li>
            <li> I also have the battery powered one with me for my trips as I fly for a living and it also works equally as well.</li>
            <li> baby smooth....</li>
            <li> my skin is so smooth after wards.well done for this product.thank you.c spencer.</li>
            <li> This is the third one I have had, they are great.  </li>
            <li> This is a great second shaver.  </li>
            <li> If you never have problems with sensitive skin, might be a good fit.</li>
            <li> it shaves great!i have a top of the line braun and this shaver keeps right up with it.trust me its worth it!</li>
            <li> I find myself sitting in my recliner  watching TV and picking it up for a quick and easy shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean and the price certainly is right.</li>
            <li> After about a week of trying, I tried something else: I shaved my face with a razor, then used the Microforce the next day to remove the stubble, and it worked great, but if I dabbed on a little Lectric Shave right before, it worked PERFECTLY!    </li>
            <li> Your better off using a straight razor!</li>
            <li> He agrees that if you have really long hairs, it doesn&#x27;t do a great job.  </li>
            <li> Then another wait--4 to 6 hours for the battery to charge up again,  I recommend getting rechargeable batteries and the original razor.</li>
            <li> I have the AAA battery version which is compact and travel friendly.  </li>
            <li> fantastic little shaver ideal to take on holiday</li>
            <li> Still, it is great to be able to shave on the run - saves me a few minutes anyway.</li>
            <li> However, if you need an inexpensive portable care free razor for a quick trip-</li>
            <li> how helpful found via this cleanly transportable SHAVEPRO appearance helper or assistant is.</li>
            <li> Start with a clean microforce and end with it clean</li>
            <li> I just bought one of these \\&quot;razors\\&quot; today in the hope that its \\&quot;9000 RPM\\&quot; head would shave my face &amp; head faster than my Norelco rotary, and be easier to clean to boot:</li>
            <li> I keep one in each car so that I can &#x27;clean up&#x27; when needed.  </li>
            <li> I purchased one of these little things because I needed an \\&quot;on the go\\&quot; shaver, figuring that the size and portability of the product was ideal.</li>
            <li> It says basically that the shave won&#x27;t be so good at first, but in two weeks time it will improve considerably.  </li>
            <li> This product is good for grass like hair only.     </li>
            <li> It charges quick and gives a razor clean shave.</li>
            <li> And finally, it claims to be \\&quot;WET/DRY\\&quot; -- good for boating.    </li>
            <li> The next day it took away bristle just as good as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> for\\&quot; is true.</li>
            <li> I shave in the morning with my regular Norelco razor but the Microforce is good for touch-ups.</li>
            <li> lightweight portability is crucial, just get a good disposable razor and use it.</li>
            <li> so I can get a quick clean up before meetings.</li>
            <li> He was well pleased to receive this and states it works very well.</li>
            <li> If you use it every day, the shave is not bad though.</li>
            <li> Still&#x27; for the pprice not bad for just a protective cover.</li>
            <li> Once and a while it will pull a hair or two but other than that it works great.</li>
            <li> Works well and holds charge for an adequate amount of time.</li>
            <li> The shave does actually get better through continued use and it also seems to work better if you don&#x27;t press it too close to your face but let it glide over your skin.</li>
            <li> No problem with packaging or shipping, product came quickly.</li>
            <li> but after your skin gets used to it, it will give you a super close shave and your face</li>
            <li> /&gt;It shaves very close, recharges well and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Also the battery power runs out quickly.</li>
            <li> I keep one in my car for when I just need a quick shave and one at home.</li>
            <li> AND you lose the original shipping and handling charges as well, which is almost the cost of the darn thing right there.    </li>
            <li> I Was Kind Of Sketchy About Buying This Product , Because Of All The Bad Reveiw&#x27;s People Kept Saying About It, But Honestly It Worked Great On Me</li>
            <li> infact ideal to take anywhere as its so small</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to get a good shaving on your face, but forget about shaving your neck with it, it just doesn&#x27;t work and it irritates a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sorry!</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t see how anyone could give this 5 stars unless they have never used a good shaver or their expectation was super low to start.</li>
            <li> This is really a great little shaver.</li>
            <li> The little bugger works great on my type of beard...</li>
            <li> These little shavers are great gifts for my girlfriends.</li>
            <li> Its a great little travel razor to throw in the briefcase...</li>
            <li> These little razors work great for me.</li>
            <li> I was a little discouraged when I read that it doesn&#x27;t for great for longer hair, but I bought it anyway.</li>
            <li> Hopefully this help you and have fun shaving</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t worth 99 cents.</li>
            <li> May not be even worth the one star.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver before and obviously liked it enough to purchase again.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave worth a damn.</li>
            <li> so hopefully, I can add some useful</li>
            <li> but its worth it.</li>
            <li> powerful.</li>
            <li> I prefer to use the standard version but use my own rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li> Would of liked a refund bur Amazon didn&#x27;t get back to me about it.</li>
            <li> I use it on my legs and other more sensitve areas and it gives me very smooth skin.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;This is a very handy little compact shaver.</li>
            <li> They are wild about them.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a quick send and easy to do business with you.</li>
            <li> Right to the point...</li>
            <li> my razor misses on the right side of my neck every time I shave</li>
            <li> I guess they&#x27;re right then...  </li>
            <li> It started right up.  </li>
            <li> Price was right, delivery was prompt with no hassles  </li>
            <li> or it won&#x27;t work, but if your hair is the right length it&#x27;ll shave like a pro...</li>
            <li> For it&#x27;s size, it&#x27;s pretty powerful.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver hoping it worked half as good as the ads.</li>
            <li> If you absolutely have to try it, then get it from a brick and mortar shop so you can return it quickly and inexpensively.    </li>
            <li> Other than the 2 points above, it is a VERY good razor that cuts as close as anything I have ever used and because of the size, it maneuvers well around the face.  </li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Reading the other reviews gave me nice and useful information on how to use it to</li>
            <li> Good little shaver, and</li>
            <li> That said it is a good little razor for the price.</li>
            <li> The unit is very powerful despite the size, but I had some skin reaction to the unit when I use it dry, but for the wet shaving is great......</li>
            <li> Moreover, the areas stayed smooth for days on end from such a clean, close trim.</li>
            <li> The grooming kit it comes with was quite a nice bonus (particularly for the LOW price I paid for everything).    </li>
            <li> Interestingly, they write this letter that is included with the product that claims \\&quot;it takes two weeks for your facial hair to adjust to the razor\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Hmmm, I&#x27;m not so sure that my facial hair has any awareness as to how its being cut...  </li>
            <li> Works better with water, but what&#x27;s the point of a touch-up shaver that needs water to work and makes your face look red and patchy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better to show up for an meeting or event undershaved than with red patchy shave and irritated skin.    </li>
            <li> After that, get on here and do the same thing to pay it forward so more people don&#x27;t get ripped off.    </li>
            <li> The first day I received it I charged it for 6 hours like it says and used it.</li>
            <li> On the first night I used Microforce, I couldn&#x27;t believe how close of a shave it gave me.</li>
            <li> I depend on the back of my hand more than on my reflection to determine how close of a shave I gave myself.</li>
            <li> My husband got this as a birthday gift from his sister and on the first day it would not shave at all.</li>
            <li> but the overall shave quality is ok.</li>
            <li> The first one was years ago when they first came out</li>
            <li> Then shave again using the old Microforce shaver that does give me a close, smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I bought the shaver in the first place to have something that could give me a real quick shave when I&#x27;m running short on time.  </li>
            <li> We tried many different ways over - and - over - and - over.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful and fast.  </li>
            <li> after about 5 mins of back and forth with the liar she said ok</li>
            <li> Shaves are okay, not equivalent to an actual razor for closeness but passable to keep you stubble-free.</li>
            <li> you can just stick it in your pocket,dont be fooled by the size though as i find it better than the big shavors</li>
            <li> first shave was a shocker.</li>
            <li> : In order for it to work properly, you must make sure that it has fully battery.</li>
            <li> My husband received the shaver and the first day the on/off switch stopped working.</li>
            <li> Useful to take on trips for touch up or fast shave.</li>
            <li> The first got lost.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my legs, but I read the reviews first.</li>
            <li> The gentle, tiny foil reached and trimmed the fine hairs much more effectively and painlessly than anything else I ever tried (big electric rotor razors, rotary personal groomers, etc).     </li>
            <li> the battery powered one and they&#x27;re just good shavers, better than bigger more expensive ones I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way more powerful than I expected</li>
            <li> This is good for regular shaves only.</li>
            <li> So, this will cut short, coarse, stubby hairs in a snap, works good.</li>
            <li> And sure enough it pulls the hairs so much that it is unusable.  </li>
            <li> A razor that is only good for about a year, but the closeness of the shave is of such quality that I bought another one.</li>
            <li> not like the commercial have a guy in a shower and able to shaved and cut a whole lot of a face show of a stuble of a beard.</li>
            <li> Far from the last razor one buys but handy in</li>
            <li> You might still get a minor irritation but much better then</li>
            <li> make sure its fully charged,and you wont have any problems with pulling on wiskers.it holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product at a CVS for around $10 since I was interested in a cordless close electric shave, which this product did provide very well.</li>
            <li> If you shave everyday or every other day, this should work perfectly.     </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it INSTEAD of my razor, but as long as it is used as I am sure it is intended....</li>
            <li> My current main electric shaver is a top of line Norelco.</li>
            <li> Yes, you will have to go over most areas of your face a few times to get a smooth shave, but personally I DO get a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> bought this back in March, still going strong.</li>
            <li> honestly, I really question the validity of positive reviews on this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also possible your skin will be fine with rotary shaver, but not a foil one or vice versa.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had purchased this item before and it worked fine until it was necessary to recharge it....</li>
            <li> This actually worked fine for me.</li>
            <li> COMPACT AND NICE LITTLE SHAVER, TIME WILL TELL ABOUT IT...</li>
            <li> First of all, it doesn&#x27;t shave long hairs, even fine line hairs.</li>
            <li> But I am a lady and for those little patches of softer facial hair as well as legs, this shaver works great.  </li>
            <li> And it would be a great little gizmo if the damned thing actually worked.</li>
            <li> This little guy worked so good that it completely replaced the Braun I was using.</li>
            <li> You do need to clean it as per the instructions and I put rubbing alcohol to lubricate and clean it once per week, but I did that with other shavers I have had.</li>
            <li> Well it didn&#x27;t seem to do much at all for stubble.      </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t so powerful as to injur delicate skin, but it has enough power to do the job great.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from it, but a friend of mine swears by his</li>
            <li> Reason at lower speed hairs tend to be not so gently pulled --</li>
            <li> I ran the back of my fingers over my cheeks and was amazed at how smooth my face felt.</li>
            <li> I really did expect the Shaver to sharper.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to anyone looking for a credit card size shaver that you could use wet/dry!  </li>
            <li> cuts skin very often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for and in this case, it ain&#x27;t much.    </li>
            <li> That means if you have any longer hairs, it won&#x27;t do much for you.</li>
            <li> This item really sucked it doesn&#x27;t work very well at all</li>
            <li> It also gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li> a try straight out of the box.  </li>
            <li> Does not shave very well.</li>
            <li> Also it would leave my neck VERY irritated.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> If you wants improve the performance must replace the springs below the blades.</li>
            <li> And, it really is water-proof.</li>
            <li> These are cheap enough to keep one in your car, office desk, or even in your pocket.</li>
            <li> It works very well</li>
            <li> And it was very inexpensive from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t need to shave</li>
            <li> And, as women age and hormone levels change, there&#x27;s sometimes a stray chin hair that pops up just when you&#x27;re getting ready to leave the house.</li>
            <li> he really like it...</li>
            <li> How do I no when it is fully charge , does the red indicator light change any at all</li>
            <li> It works very well,</li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> First thing first, I was surprised that the battery still held factory charge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I liked the wet/dry use for such a low price.  </li>
            <li> have only used it very rarely</li>
            <li> It is small, light, but easy to use.</li>
            <li> And the battery lasts a long  time and charges easily.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great when it works, but it doesn&#x27;t work for long - and works only on short stubble.</li>
            <li> It works best if you don&#x27;t press down hard.</li>
            <li> I tried shaving with this thing for 20 straight minutes and couldn&#x27;t get a decent shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this item and found that while it does shave you, it&#x27;s not as good as a blade, it leaves behind hairs and leaves my skin feeling sore and irritated, the battery life is not great either, but my biggest complaint is that while it comes with a pack of accessories most men would not use, it DOESNT come with one item I would have thought to be the best accessory to include, a car charger.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my special needs son, I didn&#x27;t want him to cut himself with a traditional razor.  </li>
            <li> not worth buying unless you can&#x27;t afford some thing better</li>
            <li> Yesterday, after a full charge, I unplugged it and left it on my counter.</li>
            <li> Here is what I have discovered with this shaver: It does not work well on more than a 36 hour growth of the average beard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for more than half a century.</li>
            <li> I apologize for this and would therefore raise my rating from one star to four stars if I could (but can&#x27;t seem to do this) mainly based on the razor&#x27;s portability and ease of use.</li>
            <li> So I thought, ok maybe it only cuts really short stubble.  </li>
            <li> Save your money and get a decent battery powered or electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this tiny shaver thinking I could do a quick job on the move</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a simple item to make so why not make it a better design.</li>
            <li> It worked decently well (again) for 7 months</li>
            <li> it works ok but is not good as the same model it replaced - do not like need for 7 more words</li>
            <li> high Quality</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried one I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> i love this little guy..</li>
            <li> Spent another $10.00 and bought a cheap electric at Walmart.</li>
            <li> Does a reasonable job however it takes a lot of patience to get a complete shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a neanderthal man type, but do have a normal beard.      </li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than the switch issue, this shaver is definitely useful for travel purposes (i.e. short term use).  </li>
            <li> /burst. !?!?! That doesn&#x27;t seem normal.</li>
            <li> Great little shaver to get in those tight spots when cleaning up the Taint and Balls.</li>
            <li> Shaves really close along the cheeks, sideburns, and most of the upper lip IF your facial hair is really really short.....    </li>
            <li> This is a nice small unit and mine came with a nice travel set of other items such as clippers and an extra foil etc.    </li>
            <li> This will allow your skin to adjust to the new shaver.</li>
            <li> I discovered this out of curiosity and found that it&#x27;s my new shaving</li>
            <li> It does a decent job for what it was designed but clearly its not something I would use every morning as is just too small.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this little thing!  </li>
            <li> It has a tough time handling a full day of growth so it would not be good as your only shaver unless you planned to shave multiple times per day.  </li>
            <li> One interesting thing about it: the tiny, rounded trimmers lent themselves to trying on the difficult, fine hair around (and just inside!)</li>
            <li> Be aware for future purchases.</li>
            <li> It is REALLY SMALL and cute.</li>
            <li> Significant Other&#x27;s Review:  </li>
            <li> Not only that, but an entire 24-hours later, it still felt smooth!</li>
            <li> but you may need another razor to get you short first.  </li>
            <li> at first for daily shaves.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: bought a second unit just to see if the first unit I received was just defective.</li>
            <li> I first found these in my local drugstore, but they don&#x27;t have them any longer.  </li>
            <li> When I received the 2 new ones I ordered, I used the new power cord to charge the old razor.  </li>
            <li> So I have two, one old and one new.....</li>
            <li> The rechargeable version, while still good, does not have a very long battery life and less power overall.  </li>
            <li> Well, they are true, but only last me about ~10 charge cycles</li>
            <li> Now the experience: First it shaves well, in my case, sensitive skin, moderate beard -- no skin irritation.</li>
            <li> For $10.00 it really is a good small devise for touch ups, and the occasional entire face shave.</li>
            <li> This one was simply a replacement since my previous one of many years needed a replacement charging cord.</li>
            <li> facial hair has to be a certain length</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;high speed\\&quot; motor is only high speed when you&#x27;re not shaving.</li>
            <li> May take a little practice, but you&#x27;ll wind up with a confortable shave and a face smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s when this little shaver really comes in handy to correct these little missed spots.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these at Walmart because my beloved Remington DA 307 finally gave up the ghost after several decades of hard use(RIP).</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find out that this tiny shaver gave me a closer shave than the razor I used to shave with that very morning.</li>
            <li> It will give you a \\&quot;close clean shave in half of the time\\&quot; and you can \\&quot;shave anywhere-anytime-even in the shower.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Let&#x27;s be clear about my 5-star rating.</li>
            <li> Absolute garbage - ripped my facial hair rather than shaved it.   </li>
            <li> a 24yrs old woman</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> So far the product has been satisfactory and has lived up to it&#x27;s name.</li>
            <li> I recommend this shaver to anyone with a light to heavy beard.</li>
            <li> I am glad I ignored the negative reviews and took a chance with this product.  </li>
            <li> This product should really have a zero out of five stars, but I suppose that isn&#x27;t an actual rating.  </li>
            <li> By applying virtually no pressure to my face, the micropuller managed to jam up every time I brought it to my chin, resulting in loud obscenities.      </li>
            <li> Now, as a college sophomore, I found the kit digging through my old stuff.</li>
            <li> It not only shaves, but it is a really close shave,</li>
            <li> I suppose the old addage, \\&quot;you get what you pay</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t recommend this shaver for soft, non-stubbly hairs like those of someone just beginning to shave.</li>
            <li> I received the Microforce Shaver in early February.</li>
            <li> Now I cant speak to durability, and if it craps out in short order i would lower my 5* rating, but it gives a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> The shaver holds up very well, I only wish there was a way to have it sharpened rather than replacing it.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, I would say give it a pass.</li>
            <li> this one was a joke  loud  kept&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use on medium stubble in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of a travel razor I could use if I was running late, but it just didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> It works better after a few initial shaves, like the instructions say.</li>
            <li> this is a fabulous little shaver--it works great-and so small and easy to carry-even in your shirt pocket-try that with your norelco-i have not had to recharge yet-tho</li>
            <li> It gives me a very close shave, may be a bit of skin irritation for the first few days, but you get that from every new shaver anyway.</li>
            <li> this little shaver is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> We have found it works only on a beard that is short stubble, and you have to go over it several times to get it clean shaven.</li>
            <li> It gives a very smooth shave as long as your beard is still short (less than a days growth).  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that the battery charge lasts a long time and that the size is very convenient.</li>
            <li> For the past year I would follow the shave up with the Microforce and it made my skin as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> I have used the battery-powered version of this product for a long time, and have had very satisfactory performance, except for having to change batteries.  </li>
            <li> I dont use electric shavers because they don&#x27;t normally shave closely enough for my taste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good little shaver, I use it off and on, I will use it when I&#x27;m away from home as it does not take hardly any space in my suit case.</li>
            <li> Although this does give a good, close shave (it may take several passes to get that shave), my skin is always a little raw for a couple days after using it.</li>
            <li> The new Miicroforce razor seems to be abig improvement over the one I bought several years ago.</li>
            <li> But if you use it daily and don&#x27;t let to grow past short, it works amazingly well and does get closer than my conventional straight blade razors.      </li>
            <li> this doesn&#x27;t cut hair... and without cutting hair, i don&#x27;t see how anything else is worth mentioning :)</li>
            <li> Crappy shaver that did not do a good job, was uncomfortable to use and after 6 uses the foil is starting to tear.</li>
            <li> A+ brand new, small and powerful shaver.</li>
            <li> However, it is not very good for shaving after more than 2 days growth (i.e. a long weekend without shaving).</li>
            <li> the price is right, and when the blades get dull after a year or so - I just buy a new one!</li>
            <li> I received this small in stature but large in worthlessness piece of junk for Christmas, which was convenient since I had lost a part to me REAL electric shaver during my travel home.  </li>
            <li> The second day it stopped working completely, so I saw it pointed me to throw it</li>
            <li> Exact same scenario only this time the busted open device left an oil stain on my carpet.</li>
            <li> this thing can barely cut peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve had several stop working and had to cannibalize old ones for parts) but the price is cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li> In fact, if you don&#x27;t shave everyday, this thing doesn&#x27;t even attempt to cut hair longer than a days worth of beard growing.</li>
            <li> razor shaves at least as good, if not better, than all of the $50.00-$100.00 electrics from Remington, Braun, and Norelco (trust me, I have had them all at one time or another).</li>
            <li> and it is dead right now.  </li>
            <li> I liked the size but the quality was very poor.</li>
            <li> To begin with, I don&#x27;t use it as my main shaver because it&#x27;s definitely rough on the skin...</li>
            <li> would ship this garbage back to to shipper, but it isn&#x27;t worth the trouble.  </li>
            <li> This little bugger will do exactly as the packagage describes.  </li>
            <li> your face may feel irritated the first few days you use it</li>
            <li> While it did shave some of my facial hair, it would leave many strays behind... especially on the neck area.  </li>
            <li> When I shave my neck/chest hair with this it is very difficult because it doesn&#x27;t get a good grip on softer hair.</li>
            <li> NiMH have 10% less voltage, and that means 20% less available power to the motor.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I had to give up and borrow my step father&#x27;s razor to finish the job, a gross, but unavoidable solution to the mess it left on my face.  </li>
            <li> I tried using it several times and it barely cut and left my skin irritable.</li>
            <li> Nice little shaver!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have a medium beard, and certainly you have to use this everyday for effectiveness</li>
            <li> and I have only used it dry but not wet.</li>
            <li> and I like it much better than larger ones, as this one is small enough to get to hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li> I usually shave while I am reading, so even if this takes longer to get a smooth shave, than using a blade, I haven&#x27;t wasted any time.</li>
            <li> My immediate thought after trying it was that this letter was an effort to either get people to keep it beyond the return policy time-frame of their local store or to get them to keep it long enough that they forget about it or do not care and chalk it up as a loss.  </li>
            <li> One thing to remember is to CLEAN OUT the blade assembly at least every other time</li>
            <li> Let me first say that I do not own the rechargable model shown here.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long they last per charge.</li>
            <li> Charge lasts long enough to do so though.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last a long time, but they work.  </li>
            <li> Normally, I have to trim it everyday.     </li>
            <li> Trying to cut a day old stubble is near impossible talk less of two days or more</li>
            <li> had it for less then 3 months and it stopped working completely.</li>
            <li> It actually came 4 days earlier than I had expected.  </li>
            <li> so pleased with this unit, I just gave away two rather expensive women&#x27;s electric razors that were much larger and less</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for just under 2 weeks, so, like others have posted, I am not sure if it will give me a decent lifecycle.</li>
            <li> You may have to clean it a few times during shaveing depending on how thick your beard is.  </li>
            <li> I have owned fancy Panasonic wet/dry, and a couple of high priced Brauns in the past.  </li>
            <li> My shave appears somewhat close, but I guess it should appear that way since rather than cutting my whiskers, it pulled most of them out by the root.  </li>
            <li> I bought this a few weeks ago, and tried using it to remove a 3 day old beard.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t even cut my eyebrows cause they are too long, uhh, it won&#x27;t cut finger hair, too long.</li>
            <li> So, if you&#x27;re going to use this don&#x27;t let your hairs grow too long.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even hold a charge that long.</li>
            <li> Seriously though, I bought this from a grocery store, mainly because it was only [...]</li>
            <li> After trying it twice a day for a solid week (both dry and wet), I realized that this wasn&#x27;t working.  </li>
            <li> I mean really close, in the shower, under water.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought mine for $20, and it came in a nice little case with a handy-dandy groming kit (also crap, btw), and after putting in brand new batteries, the steel shaving screen fell out of the shaver&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> The design of the cutting head is relatively ingenius, and it&#x27;s so cheap</li>
            <li> Works just as well underwater as it does on dry land, which means it&#x27;s crappy</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been using it dry, so he&#x27;s gonna try it while in the shower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We used it on dry hair which didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Put some hand lotion or pre-electric shave lotion on before you shave &amp; let it dry for a minute or two.</li>
            <li> First off, Let me start by saying that you shouldn&#x27;t buy this expecting it to mow down thick straw-mat beards into a baby-smooth face.</li>
            <li> A single charge lasts me about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> , it will not cut a single hair.</li>
            <li> This shaver is not good at getting hairs much longer than stubble.</li>
            <li> I have two of these, one the rechargeable type and the other the battery-operated one, which I prefer (despite the fact it eats batteries like crazy) and they both work fine; in fact they&#x27;re terrific</li>
            <li> B001E6KB4Y Micro-force Wet Dry Shaver</li>
            <li> Because this takes two AAA batteries I was at first worried I&#x27;d be spending a small fortune on them - making the value of the razor pointless..</li>
            <li> This product is NOT for people who can grow a half inch beard in one day, nor is it for anyone wishing to use it to groom a beard, or shave their head or back.</li>
            <li> I did not particularly like the Panasonic \\&quot;ultra-thin ES518N\\&quot; (it &#x27;bites&#x27;).     </li>
            <li> For the previous 5 months I had been shaving my upper lip, lower lip, and chin with a razor and a Braun electric shaver for the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> Third of all, its almost like a razor, because it irritates your skin slightly like a razor.</li>
            <li> Provided a close shave wet or dry for about a week, then stopped working.</li>
            <li> It also makes it easier the following morning because there is less to shave.  </li>
            <li> but those are only advantages over other products if it works as other products do...</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical, and fully expected to be returning it, as I have a tough beard, and the DA was the only electric that ever gave me a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had the same problems a lot of you had: Irritation, and little to no beard trimming.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, using the two takes a little extra time and patience but</li>
            <li> -The razors tear your face up  -Only a little cheaper than the Gillette Fusion (My razor)  </li>
            <li> waste your money (even though I paid only $9.99).  </li>
            <li> (try recharging in the distant outdoors or on a sailboat).</li>
            <li> And you can shave in the shower, where it is wet so that you can get an even closer shave.</li>
            <li> We opened it to look and see if it was clogged or not only to find out the springs were missing form it that allows it to contour and shave close.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am trying to follow the charging instructions carefully.</li>
            <li> I have tried shaving day after day so the shaver would have very short hair to cut, and I have also tried waiting a few days before shaving.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for 6 months and never really had any complaints.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> As a wet shaver it rivals my panasonic.</li>
            <li> i dont have a real heavy or black beard-im blonde and blue eyed</li>
            <li> Say what you will - it&#x27;s VERY useful for this difficult area!</li>
            <li> small thing definitely goes to college with me.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific small shaver.  </li>
            <li> In other words, it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Also, the instructions read do NOT expose to extreme temperatures, such as leaving in the car, which defeats the small size so it can be put in travel or gym bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it should be bbetter to have an intrenational voltage for foreign contries</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these shavers, one battery powered and the other electric chargeable.</li>
            <li> I like to shave with a regular razor and gel while in the shower but often miss a small spot or two</li>
            <li> Holds a charge longer than my other shavers do.and a lot cheapertoo.would recommend to any one without reservation.</li>
            <li> It cuts every bit as close as my DA 307 did, and it is small enough to get into tight places, like under my nose.</li>
            <li> Fabulous little shaver and much less expensive than advertised on TV!  </li>
            <li> So what I do is use my high-end Braun as my daily driver and the Microforce as a touch-up  or go-over device to reach those hard to get areas.</li>
            <li> It gets to those hard to reach places that big electric razors cannot get to.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> in fact it takes much longer, and does a lousy job.    </li>
            <li> I saw all the negative reviews and decided I would tell everyone how to use this thing properly.</li>
            <li> I would recommend that no one buy this product, it is not worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> One more worthless product made in China.  </li>
            <li> In early March (approximately 30 days after receiving the razor), the battery stopped holding a charge and it no longer works.</li>
            <li> When I pushed the lever all the way up to \\&quot;On\\&quot; to power the razor, it didn&#x27;t work, but if I move the level slightly down, it does work.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;9000 RPM Motor\\&quot; slows down immediately, the shaver  \\&quot;bites\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> As soon as you put it to your face, the motor slows down noticeably.</li>
            <li> even thought I cut it down to almost nothing</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use a lot of pressure by pressing the razor down on your face.  </li>
            <li> Cut my shaving time down to a quarter of what it was.  </li>
            <li> $20.00 down the drain.</li>
            <li> Not only does this thing do a bad job at shaving, but when I was done, my whole neck and face were irritated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, I was basing my review on the previous Microforce razor</li>
            <li> believe half of the internet-based commerce is based on garbage like this.  </li>
            <li> I bought this shaver because it advertised twice the power with half the size.  </li>
            <li> I bought this shaver because it looked like it could be useful as a portable little electric shaver, I was wrong!  </li>
            <li> Advice for people with overgrown hair... shave with a 99cent razor first or cut your hair with any cutting tool.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s to be expected from a small shaver.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the device inexplicably stopped functioning altogether without a clue as to why (cheap parts likely).</li>
            <li> I keep this at work to keep my stubble down, and get those few hairs</li>
            <li> Not to mention the battery compartment doesn&#x27;t look water tight</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t even clip tight and sometimes the foil head will pop off if I&#x27;m not pressing against my skin.</li>
            <li> In the end, the shaver failed to live up to the hype.  </li>
            <li> so I recharged it for a little over six hours (the instructions say charge it between five and seven hours).</li>
            <li> I ordered the Microforce Shaver just a little over a week before my husband&#x27;s birthday.</li>
            <li> I was a bit apprehensive after reading the reviews here, but the little shaver has proven itself now.</li>
            <li> Takes a little time to get used to</li>
            <li> It irritates a little on neck.  </li>
            <li> I like this little gadget.  </li>
            <li> My husband just loves this little shaver.  </li>
            <li> It tends to pull a little.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions for charging, and noticed that even after charging, the shaving action was very weak.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t good at cutting longer hairs and will once and a while yank on them, which is a painful experience.</li>
            <li> It is a gimmicky product that does not work.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money even if it&#x27;s sold for 99 cents</li>
            <li> The favorites still are the flip-case Braun 370 (unfortunately discontinued, somewhat loud) and the Philishave HQ40/ 33 (ultra-quiet).</li>
            <li> It is completely and utterly useless.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for a heavy beard</li>
            <li> This shaver is so small you would think it was not powerful</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> Imagine my surprise to take off the cover and find a part missing...</li>
            <li> I found the battery was dead after one leg was done.  </li>
            <li> I tried one for myself, but sadly the hair on my legs must be too soft...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this shaver.</li>
            <li> so I had to slow down and be careful and the plastic foil cover just keeps falling off!!!</li>
            <li> Lacks power, dull blade, wants to pull out beard instead of cutting.</li>
            <li> like it states, the job it does at actually shaving is quite bad actually.  </li>
            <li> On 3-4 day long facial hair it fails to cuts approximately 90% of the hair it passes over.  </li>
            <li> Cons:  Bad job at shaving, and makes your skin very irritable.        </li>
            <li> Not as close shave as one I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I know this is usually marketed as a guy&#x27;s shaver.  </li>
            <li> , I got a few as father&#x27;s day gifts!    </li>
            <li> If your facial hair is long you&#x27;ll just be pulling the hair of your face which is painful.  </li>
            <li> The shaver is small</li>
            <li> Small size</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small shaver</li>
            <li> but not sure  Thank You HERBERT JEMMOTT</li>
            <li> I usually shave with a blade, and I got this to keep at my girlfriend&#x27;s home just in case.</li>
            <li> small.</li>
            <li> inexpensive, small...</li>
            <li> Does its job as small as it is...</li>
            <li> The only reason I picked it up was because a local department store had it on clearance for $7.00... turns out for a bloody reason.    </li>
            <li> I seriously consider this product a waste of my money, and recommend you all to stay away from it and just stick to a razor.</li>
            <li> I am a sucker for anything small, for the far-away-from-civilization weekend:</li>
            <li> -less irritating  -water proof (but don&#x27;t use while plugged)  </li>
            <li> dull pair or scissors  2.  </li>
            <li> I got it for my husband, however he says it hardly shaves anything.</li>
            <li> hardly cuts anything at all...</li>
            <li> Hard to find that now.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> micro force for not being abel to shave any hair which sucks     </li>
            <li> This shaver has served me well in international travel and field work where access to power is inconvenient.</li>
            <li> Does not work - at least as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I had seen a video review online which gave this shaver a negative review.</li>
            <li> To Kinda Thick Hair , I Will Honeslty Buy Another One</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be forewarned this like other electric shavers does a lousy job under the neck ...</li>
            <li> Cons: Terrible shave along the chin and neck areas even if your facial hair is short.  </li>
            <li> Not a good idea.</li>
            <li> Advertised for men, not great with thick stubble.</li>
            <li> it was too late!</li>
            <li> Heck, if it didn&#x27;t work at all, I would have been only mildly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Product had slightly dented foil, cutting case was lost and no company address to write to for replacement parts.  </li>
            <li> The plastic lugs are so thin and weak that they incapable of keeping the head in place.</li>
            <li> but I could see if you had a tough beard, it might pull hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> for the build quality, this shaver is extremely poor.</li>
            <li> This thing can run for weeks on a dying battery but it will get worse and worse as it progresses.</li>
            <li> &amp; I Happen To Have Thin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply impossible to engineer a working razor down to this size, so don&#x27;t fool yourself into trying this ripoff.</li>
            <li> It seriously doesn&#x27;t do a thing!  </li>
            <li> This, however, is by far the WORST PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Overall I was very disappointed with this razor....</li>
            <li> :  I was mistaken: my claim of premature death was greatly exaggerated.</li>
            <li> If you calculate the cost/shave, it is awefully expensive.</li>
            <li> I will purchase another Microforce once the battery fails.</li>
            <li> maybe this one will.. screw it ill</li>
            <li> so I would be skeptical to use it in the shower.    </li>
            <li> So what if it fails in my life-time.</li>
            <li> I thought that maybe I was just using it wrong (somehow) or that my skin needed getting used to</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical when I bought this product.</li>
            <li> All-in-all, a useless product.</li>
            <li> This shaver is a Useless product.</li>
            <li> So got the rechargeable one to save on battery cost - even though I read the reviews that said using it pulled the hairs and was uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product did not work at all.  </li>
            <li> Terrible, I should of listened to the other reviews.    </li>
            <li> The cutting head and foil are identical.</li>
            <li> What a close shave, I mean, my shave was just close!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, it had a very weird smell to it, that stayed on my face even after I washed it.  </li>
            <li> The price ain&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who, despite some of the bad reviews, wanted to try it.  </li>
            <li> This product it is badly design and did not works as it advertise in the tv commercial,barely have the power of to shave after charge it like 12 hours and maybe can cut some whiskers off of your face,</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I realized this model had no charger, but I already had a package of rechargable NiMH batteries at home, and at 9.99 I figured couldn&#x27;t do that bad.</li>
            <li> My family was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> a mid-day touch up, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Totally worthless.</li>
            <li> This product is crap.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend anyone to buy this piece of crap.</li>
            <li> All I can say is don&#x27;t be tempted to buy this product or you will be disappointed!</li>
            <li> We have scams all over the place and this product has to be worst ever.  </li>
            <li> This electric razor was horrible.</li>
            <li> this thing is nothing but a piece of crap!....</li>
            <li> Terrible for anything else.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely awful idea</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought 3 already for gifts!!!</li>
            <li> Not as close shave as one I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and excellent for travel.  Compact and fits easily in travel kit.  Works well and holds charge for an adequate amount of time.</li>
            <li> I used this three times before it broke. Although it didn&#x27;t give a very good shave, I tried to be fair and give it time, as the instructions said it took a couple of weeks for your face to adjust to the blade.    After three days it stopped working. I thought it needed to be recharged so I recharged it for a little over six hours (the instructions say charge it between five and seven hours). But the charge didn&#x27;t help - it won&#x27;t work at all. Not through batteries, and not through the power supply. I guess I could try to get back my money or else a replacement, but why bother?     Follow-up on 6/12/09:  I was mistaken: my claim of premature death was greatly exaggerated. In fact, it does work. When I pushed the lever all the way up to \\&quot;On\\&quot; to power the razor, it didn&#x27;t work, but if I move the level slightly down, it does work. I apologize for this and would therefore raise my rating from one star to four stars if I could (but can&#x27;t seem to do this) mainly based on the razor&#x27;s portability and ease of use. The shave does actually get better through continued use and it also seems to work better if you don&#x27;t press it too close to your face but let it glide over your skin. However, I doubt it would work very well with a heavy stubble -it seems best for light shaves. Still, it is great to be able to shave on the run - saves me a few minutes anyway.</li>
            <li> Looked like a good idea, but was not. Lacks power, dull blade, wants to pull out beard instead of cutting. Spent another $10.00 and bought a cheap electric at Walmart. It is 10 times the shaver as this one was.</li>
            <li> honestly, I really question the validity of positive reviews on this product.  Let me give a list of items I would consider to be better to shave with.     1.  dull pair or scissors  2.  nail clippers  3.  cheese grater  4.  car keys  5.  ceiling fan  6.  brick wall  7.  duct tape    ok, you get the idea.  Seriously though, I bought this from a grocery store, mainly because it was only [...] bucks and my results were as follows.  On 3-4 day long facial hair it fails to cuts approximately 90% of the hair it passes over.  The 10% that it does cut feels as if its being pulled out by tweezers, it hurts.  So I thought, ok maybe it only cuts really short stubble.  Well it didn&#x27;t seem to do much at all for stubble.      Interestingly, they write this letter that is included with the product that claims \\&quot;it takes two weeks for your facial hair to adjust to the razor\\&quot;.  It says basically that the shave won&#x27;t be so good at first, but in two weeks time it will improve considerably.  Hmmm, I&#x27;m not so sure that my facial hair has any awareness as to how its being cut...  My immediate thought after trying it was that this letter was an effort to either get people to keep it beyond the return policy time-frame of their local store or to get them to keep it long enough that they forget about it or do not care and chalk it up as a loss.  I returned this product.  It is a gimmicky product that does not work.</li>
            <li> The shaver is cute, cheap, and a lot of people say it works great.  Well, they are true, but only last me about ~10 charge cycles and it is dead right now.  If you calculate the cost/shave, it is awefully expensive.</li>
            <li> excellent product. high Quality</li>
            <li> This product is not a lawn mower and not a shredder either. Do no expect to get a hair cut with $8. This product does it&#x27;s job when shaving with shower or without. This is good for regular shaves only. You might still get a minor irritation but much better then the 40 bucks shavers. It comes with manicure kit which is really useful and a very elegant leather case.    Overall  Pros   -mini  -less irritating  -water proof (but don&#x27;t use while plugged)  -manicure kit  -good battery life    Cons  -not for bears  -not in 99cent store  -built cheaply    Advice for people with overgrown hair... shave with a 99cent razor first or cut your hair with any cutting tool. This product is good for grass like hair only.     Hopefully this help you and have fun shaving</li>
            <li> Absolute garbage - ripped my facial hair rather than shaved it.   Works better with water, but what&#x27;s the point of a touch-up shaver that needs water to work and makes your face look red and patchy.  It&#x27;s better to show up for an meeting or event undershaved than with red patchy shave and irritated skin.    Garbage of a product. The only reason I picked it up was because a local department store had it on clearance for $7.00... turns out for a bloody reason.    I trashed it after using it for several times (every time on stubble in the evening, not to actually shave with it).    Don&#x27;t waste your money even if it&#x27;s sold for 99 cents - it&#x27;s worth its weight in plastic at best.</li>
            <li> It does not work. At all.  If you don&#x27;t believe me (because I&#x27;m doing this because I&#x27;m a competing micro-shaver company and not because I&#x27;m an upset customer) then send me your address and I&#x27;ll mail you mine. After that, get on here and do the same thing to pay it forward so more people don&#x27;t get ripped off.    What a piece of junk....</li>
            <li> Im a 24yrs old woman and i think this is a wonderful product. I use it on my legs and other more sensitve areas and it gives me very smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Unit would  not charge or operate. I discarded it after about ten attempts to get it to work. Totally worthless. Please do not purchase.</li>
            <li> micro force for not being abel to shave any hair which sucks     DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM</li>
            <li> Interesting differences of opinion about these here.     I just found one at an irresistible low price at a outlet chain store and tried it. As said elsewhere here, it is not for heavier beards - but it DOES shave OK if you&#x27;re already used to electric. It is also very portable and handy. The grooming kit it comes with was quite a nice bonus (particularly for the LOW price I paid for everything).    One interesting thing about it: the tiny, rounded trimmers lent themselves to trying on the difficult, fine hair around (and just inside!) my ears.     What a surprise! The gentle, tiny foil reached and trimmed the fine hairs much more effectively and painlessly than anything else I ever tried (big electric rotor razors, rotary personal groomers, etc).     Moreover, the areas stayed smooth for days on end from such a clean, close trim. Normally, I have to trim it everyday.     Say what you will - it&#x27;s VERY useful for this difficult area! If I were Microforce, I&#x27;d release a separate, similar product - just for middle-aged male ear fuzz!</li>
            <li> I ordered the Microforce Shaver just a little over a week before my husband&#x27;s birthday. It was estimated to arrive the day before his birthday.  It actually came 4 days earlier than I had expected.  I was pleasantly surprised.  So far the product has been satisfactory and has lived up to it&#x27;s name. Thanks.[[ASIN:B001E6KB4Y MICROFORCE SHAVER]]</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001E6KB4Y Micro-force Wet Dry Shaver As Seen On TV]]This is without a doubt one of the finest shavers I have ever had. This is better than a safety razor. It charges quick and gives a razor clean shave. I recommend this shaver to anyone with a light to heavy beard. Excellent shaver for the price.</li>
            <li> I have had my Microforce shaver for over 3 years and after 3 years the only thing I&#x27;ve had to do is replace the foil screen (spare comes with the shaver). You do need to clean it as per the instructions and I put rubbing alcohol to lubricate and clean it once per week, but I did that with other shavers I have had. People with sensitive skin will need to be careful as shaving aggressively can create razor burn. I have not had any issues with the battery holding a charge, but know I will eventually as all rechargeable devices lose capacity over time. I will purchase another Microforce once the battery fails. This shaver has served me well in international travel and field work where access to power is inconvenient.</li>
            <li> This product is crap. The first day I received it I charged it for 6 hours like it says and used it. When using it all the tin contraption did was massage the hair on my face. I then called them the same day I received them and asked about the return policy to find out it can&#x27;t be.</li>
            <li> Product had slightly dented foil, cutting case was lost and no company address to write to for replacement parts.  Seller was of no help providing address.</li>
            <li> I am glad I ignored the negative reviews and took a chance with this product.  I was a blade user and had no problem making the transition to electric shaver, it took perhaps two days to get the complet knack and feel for this product.  I use it each morning in the shower, I am going to buy an extra one for my travel kit.</li>
            <li> Garbage-that&#x27;s where mine ended up the day I bought it. It doesn&#x27;t do anything but make noise and vibrate. How this thing even made it to stores is beyond me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric razors before, so I know that when you switch to them, there&#x27;s a period of irritation on your face.  It even happened with a $300 Norelco that I bought.  However, with this MICROforce, my face ached for hours, like I had a 1st degree burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only that, but its an incomplete shave.  I still had plenty of stubble left after my shave, especially on the chin/neck area.  It just couldn&#x27;t get those parts no matter how many times I went over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, it had a very weird smell to it, that stayed on my face even after I washed it.  Must have some chemical on the metal.  If you&#x27;re going to use it, I suggest washing the blade under water and soap first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money (even though I paid only $9.99).  Wasn&#x27;t worth 99 cents.</li>
            <li> Fabulous little shaver and much less expensive than advertised on TV!  Does everything it says - brilliant!</li>
            <li> Right to the point... Crappy shaver that did not do a good job, was uncomfortable to use and after 6 uses the foil is starting to tear. I have been an electric shaver person for over 25 years. All I can say is don&#x27;t be tempted to buy this product or you will be disappointed! I really can&#x27;t see how anyone could give this 5 stars unless they have never used a good shaver or their expectation was super low to start.</li>
            <li> Good product but does not hold a charge for more than one good shave. It&#x27;s to be expected from a small shaver.</li>
            <li> Does not work - at least as advertised.  May not be even worth the one star.</li>
            <li> I know this is usually marketed as a guy&#x27;s shaver.  But I am a lady and for those little patches of softer facial hair as well as legs, this shaver works great.  It isn&#x27;t so powerful as to injur delicate skin, but it has enough power to do the job great.  It is the best shaver of any-lady&#x27;s or men&#x27;s-I have ever tried!</li>
            <li> MicroForce electric razor is incredible.  Best shave ever and better than blade shaver.  I have now bought many for Christmas gifts for the men.  If you haven&#x27;t tried one I highly recommend it.  Best product I have ever bought for the money. It is awesome.  LM</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver hoping it worked half as good as the ads. No such luck. I tried using it several times and it barely cut and left my skin irritable. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am amazed with its power, love the size and it cuts for a very clean shave. I find myself sitting in my recliner  watching TV and picking it up for a quick and easy shave. It holds a charge for more than a one time use.</li>
            <li> bought this back in March, still going strong. its durable lightweight and no batteries! its just the best for traveling and best all around I&#x27;ve used even with my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Excellent product very durable battery. Good packaging. I highly recommend it. Be aware for future purchases. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> This is really a great little shaver. I have been using mine for about a year now. It&#x27;s about time to change the blade. (It came with an extra.)</li>
            <li> Shave isn&#x27;t as close as I thought.</li>
            <li> save your money. I decided to humor myself and buy this on a \\&quot;well I&#x27;ve never seen one of these hoax products work... maybe this one will.. screw it ill try it out.\\&quot; I have fine sand colored hairs on my arms and the microforce basically did the equivalent of a lint roller.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver for my son, daughter and husband. We have found it works only on a beard that is short stubble, and you have to go over it several times to get it clean shaven. If I had to do over again, I would only have purchased one of them, not three.    No problem with packaging or shipping, product came quickly.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift from my Mother, I have no idea where she ordered it from but I thought I would post this here on Amazon.    The set looks nice. Comes with two nail clippers, a comb, file and a lint brush. The razor is just a joke. Before even using it I can tell how cheap it feels. It uses two triple A batteries even though the instructions say you charge it via A/C power. Not to mention the battery compartment doesn&#x27;t look water tight so I would be skeptical to use it in the shower.    So buyer beware!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver before and obviously liked it enough to purchase again. Some of the Microforce shavers shave closer than others.  The one I purchased this time doesn&#x27;t shave as close as I would like. Otherwise, it is a good shaver. A single charge lasts me about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Because this takes two AAA batteries I was at first worried I&#x27;d be spending a small fortune on them - making the value of the razor pointless.. however, the truth is the razor is actually working quite well. I dont use electric shavers because they don&#x27;t normally shave closely enough for my taste. Instead I use a safety razor I purchased from a German manufacturer which was almost $100.  That&#x27;s all well and good but I can&#x27;t always lather up and take the time to get a good shave.. enter the MicroForce.  This is a nice small unit and mine came with a nice travel set of other items such as clippers and an extra foil etc.    Its not a lot of money to try out this product, so if you can swing it then give it a try. I&#x27;m not sorry!</li>
            <li> First off, Let me start by saying that you shouldn&#x27;t buy this expecting it to mow down thick straw-mat beards into a baby-smooth face. This will NOT do that.    Also, this is NOT a trimmer, nor is it a body groomer, nor is it an eyebrow detailer.    This is a STUBBLE REMOVER, and it works GREAT!! I bought this a few weeks ago, and tried using it to remove a 3 day old beard. I had the same problems a lot of you had: Irritation, and little to no beard trimming. After about a week of trying, I tried something else: I shaved my face with a razor, then used the Microforce the next day to remove the stubble, and it worked great, but if I dabbed on a little Lectric Shave right before, it worked PERFECTLY!    The design of the cutting head is relatively ingenius, and it&#x27;s so cheap, I got a few as father&#x27;s day gifts!    This product is NOT for people who can grow a half inch beard in one day, nor is it for anyone wishing to use it to groom a beard, or shave their head or back. If you want a quick and easy day-to-day stubble remover, THIS IS THE PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from it, but a friend of mine swears by his so I bought one.  The little bugger works great on my type of beard...I&#x27;m not a neanderthal man type, but do have a normal beard.      Reading the other reviews gave me nice and useful information on how to use it to it&#x27;s best potential.   Yes, it does work best on light beards, so don&#x27;t let it grow or it will disappoint. But if you use it daily and don&#x27;t let to grow past short, it works amazingly well and does get closer than my conventional straight blade razors.      It will be my daily shave and is so inexpensive, will get another one as a backup to keep in my car or briefcase.</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews I&#x27;ve read here, there may be a quality control problem with this item, which wouldn&#x27;t be a surprise given the price and country of origin(China).  I have two of these, one the rechargeable type and the other the battery-operated one, which I prefer (despite the fact it eats batteries like crazy) and they both work fine; in fact they&#x27;re terrific provided you don&#x27;t expect miracles.  To begin with, I don&#x27;t use it as my main shaver because it&#x27;s definitely rough on the skin...but that&#x27;s because it shaves so close!! This thing shaves closer than anything I&#x27;ve tried, including top-of-the-line Brauns and Panasonics. So what I do is use my high-end Braun as my daily driver and the Microforce as a touch-up  or go-over device to reach those hard to get areas. The result is a shave that equals a blade, which I never thought was possible.  Admittedly, using the two takes a little extra time and patience but if you can handle that, or simply are a perfectionist, I would say the Microforce is a no-brainer given the price and it&#x27;s effectiveness. Just hope you don&#x27;t get a lemon!</li>
            <li> I am a sucker for anything small, for the far-away-from-civilization weekend: SW and Emergency Radios, hand-held GPS, wind-up Flashlights, you name them, I probably have them.     In the course of my lifetime I have owned many battery operated shavers. The favorites still are the flip-case Braun 370 (unfortunately discontinued, somewhat loud) and the Philishave HQ40/ 33 (ultra-quiet). I did not particularly like the Panasonic \\&quot;ultra-thin ES518N\\&quot; (it &#x27;bites&#x27;).     So why did I spend $10.- on the Microforce? It is REALLY SMALL and cute. It is INEXPENSIVE (the wife did not holler at my extravagance). It runs on AAA ALKALINES (try recharging in the distant outdoors or on a sailboat). And finally, it claims to be \\&quot;WET/DRY\\&quot; -- good for boating.    Now the experience: First it shaves well, in my case, sensitive skin, moderate beard -- no skin irritation. (Disregard the \\&quot;skin must adapt\\&quot; comments, those come from die-hard blade guys.) I tried it in the shower, with good results. However this requires that you close the battery case&#x27; \\&quot;wet\\&quot; seal correctly. Suggestion, practice this once or twice before you risk your $10.- investment.     Built-Quality? So what if it fails in my life-time. For $10.- it is an interesting conversation starter, at the gym, in the shared bathroom.    A word of advice: Being German and therefore a cheap-skate by upbringing, I tried NiMH batteries. Not a good idea. The \\&quot;9000 RPM Motor\\&quot; slows down immediately, the shaver  \\&quot;bites\\&quot;. Reason at lower speed hairs tend to be not so gently pulled -- NiMH have 10% less voltage, and that means 20% less available power to the motor.</li>
            <li> Significant Other&#x27;s Review:  I keep this at work to keep my stubble down, and get those few hairs my razor misses on the right side of my neck every time I shave, it&#x27;s cheap, seem to work well, the replacement blades on my rotary are more than $37, so this is great for my purpose, I have only used for 2 months so far so good.</li>
            <li> Pros: Shaves really close along the cheeks, sideburns, and most of the upper lip IF your facial hair is really really short.....    Cons: Terrible shave along the chin and neck areas even if your facial hair is short.  If your facial hair is long you&#x27;ll just be pulling the hair of your face which is painful.  Face becomes irritated after shaving with a MicroForce....    Overall I was very disappointed with this razor.... Works just as well underwater as it does on dry land, which means it&#x27;s crappy no matter where you shave....</li>
            <li> This product should really have a zero out of five stars, but I suppose that isn&#x27;t an actual rating.  I received this small in stature but large in worthlessness piece of junk for Christmas, which was convenient since I had lost a part to me REAL electric shaver during my travel home.  I have tried using this shaver twice, each time on 2-3 day beard growth.  The first time I used it I had to give up and borrow my step father&#x27;s razor to finish the job, a gross, but unavoidable solution to the mess it left on my face.  For the second occasion I was left with no alternative but use it until shaving was finished.  My face and neck are burning, red, and sore.  My shave appears somewhat close, but I guess it should appear that way since rather than cutting my whiskers, it pulled most of them out by the root.  By applying virtually no pressure to my face, the micropuller managed to jam up every time I brought it to my chin, resulting in loud obscenities.      I guess if there is one good thing about this product it&#x27;s that I will probably never have to shave again, since my whiskers will probably ne ver grow back.  I guess they&#x27;re right then...  It is the last shaver I&#x27;ll ever need!</li>
            <li> Liked the first one we bought, but it ran out of battery within two months.  The one we ordered from Amazon had no battery (tried charging it) when it came.  It&#x27;s great when it works, but it doesn&#x27;t work for long - and works only on short stubble.</li>
            <li> Let me first say that I do not own the rechargable model shown here. I own the model that runs on 2 AAA batteries sold in retail stores. I saw this product advertised in a local drug store flyer for 9.99, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try by stopping by at the nearest store and picking it up. I was disappointed when I realized this model had no charger, but I already had a package of rechargable NiMH batteries at home, and at 9.99 I figured couldn&#x27;t do that bad. For the previous 5 months I had been shaving my upper lip, lower lip, and chin with a razor and a Braun electric shaver for the rest of my face. I have no beard. I also carry an extra razor in my car for backup in case I noticed I missed a spot while driving to work. The Microforce Razor was meant to replace that backup razor. On the first night I used Microforce, I couldn&#x27;t believe how close of a shave it gave me. I depend on the back of my hand more than on my reflection to determine how close of a shave I gave myself. I ran the back of my fingers over my cheeks and was amazed at how smooth my face felt. Not only that, but an entire 24-hours later, it still felt smooth! This little guy worked so good that it completely replaced the Braun I was using. I&#x27;ve been using it for just under 2 weeks, so, like others have posted, I am not sure if it will give me a decent lifecycle. But as far as working out of the box, I can tell you that it does an excellent job.</li>
            <li> My husband says it pulls at the hairs and uses it as a paper weight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been jokingly bought this five or four years ago when I still was a kid. Now, as a college sophomore, I found the kit digging through my old stuff. First thing first, I was surprised that the battery still held factory charge. I&#x27;ve decided to give it a no-foam go and was impressed with ease it took away bristle. The next day it took away bristle just as good as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This small thing definitely goes to college with me.</li>
            <li> I really did expect the Shaver to sharper.</li>
            <li> The micro force razor does NOT remove wiskers or hair from your face.  All is does is vibrate.  One more worthless product made in China.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> Rec&#x27;d the shaver and was impressed.  On a scale 1 to 10, I would rate it a 11!  Highly recommend to anyone looking for a credit card size shaver that you could use wet/dry!  Buy this one!</li>
            <li> This Micro Force shaver, I will now give you the pros and the cons. And I will tell you overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it is incredible!!! It not only shaves, but it is a really close shave, I mean really close, in the shower, under water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, Pros: This is better than one of those even 200 dollar shavers. Here&#x27;s why, first of all it shaves extremely incredibly astonishingly close!!! What a close shave, I mean, my shave was just close!!! Better than my Braun 360. And you can shave in the shower, where it is wet so that you can get an even closer shave. Just amazing...!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Why does this product cost 20 dollars? So cheap, should I buy it? First of all, it doesn&#x27;t shave long hairs, even fine line hairs. In fact, if you don&#x27;t shave everyday, this thing doesn&#x27;t even attempt to cut hair longer than a days worth of beard growing. It won&#x27;t even cut my eyebrows cause they are too long, uhh, it won&#x27;t cut finger hair, too long. So, this will cut short, coarse, stubby hairs in a snap, works good. So, if you&#x27;re going to use this don&#x27;t let your hairs grow too long. Third of all, its almost like a razor, because it irritates your skin slightly like a razor. But it is just as close. It leaves smooth skin, but razor irritations. cuts skin very often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it&#x27;s worth the money. Just realize the cons.</li>
            <li> 1. Does not have a trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Beard must already be close for Microforce to work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Other than the 2 points above, it is a VERY good razor that cuts as close as anything I have ever used and because of the size, it maneuvers well around the face.  I highly recommend it but you may need another razor to get you short first.  After that, you can use it daily and be very pleased!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this item and payed for 2 day shipping at a cost about equal to the cost of the item. I wanted it for a trip, it didn&#x27;t come till I had left. I can&#x27;t review it because I never even opened it.</li>
            <li> This thing is nothing but garbage.  G A R B A G E  !!!!!!!!    Doesn&#x27;t shave worth a damn. Doesn&#x27;t even hold a charge that long. You get what you pay for and in this case, it ain&#x27;t much.    If you absolutely have to try it, then get it from a brick and mortar shop so you can return it quickly and inexpensively.    If you get it off the 1 800 number then you have to pay to ship it back AND you lose the original shipping and handling charges as well, which is almost the cost of the darn thing right there.    Do not be fooled.</li>
            <li> My husband got this as a birthday gift from his sister and on the first day it would not shave at all. We opened it to look and see if it was clogged or not only to find out the springs were missing form it that allows it to contour and shave close. Would not recommend anyone to buy this piece of crap.</li>
            <li> I have used this shaver for over a week now, recharged it and it is still working. I was a bit apprehensive after reading the reviews here, but the little shaver has proven itself now. It gives me a very close shave, may be a bit of skin irritation for the first few days, but you get that from every new shaver anyway. I am very happy with it, esp when I paid less that £10 including postage on Ebay.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver because it looked like it could be useful as a portable little electric shaver, I was wrong!  This shaver literallly doesn&#x27;t do ANYTHING!  It seriously doesn&#x27;t do a thing!  I thought that maybe I was just using it wrong (somehow) or that my skin needed getting used to but no.  After trying it twice a day for a solid week (both dry and wet), I realized that this wasn&#x27;t working.  I sent it back for the refund.  I buy a lot of \\&quot;As seen on TV\\&quot; products.  Some work, some don&#x27;t.  This, however, is by far the WORST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER USED!  I am begging you to please don&#x27;t even consider buying this product!  It is completely and utterly useless.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these little things because I needed an \\&quot;on the go\\&quot; shaver, figuring that the size and portability of the product was ideal. And it would be a great little gizmo if the damned thing actually worked. I suppose the old addage, \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; is true. I bought mine for $20, and it came in a nice little case with a handy-dandy groming kit (also crap, btw), and after putting in brand new batteries, the steel shaving screen fell out of the shaver&#x27;s head. It is a flimsy, cheap piece of junk, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying it for ANY reason. Save your money and get a decent battery powered or electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I Love It and the company was great on their service.</li>
            <li> My current main electric shaver is a top of line Norelco. I have also used Braun, Panasonic and Remington shavers so hopefully, I can add some useful comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this shaver as a gift. I would not have bought it simply because you can find excellent travel shavers from Braun, Panasonic etc. on Amazon with great reviews. That being said here is my experience with this shaver so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used it very rarely but the overall shave quality is ok. Like many travel shavers, there is no clipper, just the foil. That means if you have any longer hairs, it won&#x27;t do much for you. If you use it every day, the shave is not bad though. Some people have commented on irritation but keep in mind almost any electric shaver can do this. That&#x27;s why all the big manufacturers give you a 30 day money back trial period. This will allow your skin to adjust to the new shaver. It&#x27;s also possible your skin will be fine with rotary shaver, but not a foil one or vice versa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the build quality, this shaver is extremely poor. There are cheap plastic tabs on the side to hold the foil in place. They don&#x27;t even clip tight and sometimes the foil head will pop off if I&#x27;m not pressing against my skin. The \\&quot;high speed\\&quot; motor is only high speed when you&#x27;re not shaving. As soon as you put it to your face, the motor slows down noticeably. It still worked \\&quot;ok\\&quot; for me but I could see if you had a tough beard, it might pull hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably use this for short trips until it dies and then get one of the Braun battery powered travel shavers that are rated well. This is just one of those products that makes you think that \\&quot;As Seen On TV\\&quot; is a warning sign not to buy that product.</li>
            <li> I was, u dont have to be... it kind of worked on the first time I used it but results kept unsatisfying me more and more altough I did all maintanance procedures required. Stick to the basics, shave as all men do.</li>
            <li> The Microforce Shaver doesn&#x27;t work as a shaver.  Maybe you can give it to your kids as a toy, but if you want to shave with it then don&#x27;t buy it.  We have scams all over the place and this product has to be worst ever.  Not that you would want to, but if you tried to shave your eyebrows or eyelashes you can&#x27;t even do that.  The only reason I tried is because I wanted to see if could do it.  Please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> this little shaver is worth every penny! i have had it for a while now. make sure its fully charged,and you wont have any problems with pulling on wiskers.it holds a charge for a long time. it shaves great!i have a top of the line braun and this shaver keeps right up with it.trust me its worth it! if you dont like you can always send it back.</li>
            <li> It is very good and do a very good job I would recommend it to my friend</li>
            <li> I wanted a good cheap shaver that could be used in the shower. This shaver fulfilled both of those criteria. While the shaver is worth the money, it isn&#x27;t necessarily the best shaver. The shaver is small so it takes a good amount of time to shave a whole face. This shaver is not good at getting hairs much longer than stubble. If you are shaving everyday than this will be a good shaver for you (might I suggest some shaving cream?), but if you are a once a week shaver, this might not be the best. It isn&#x27;t good at cutting longer hairs and will once and a while yank on them, which is a painful experience. I also don&#x27;t recommend this shaver for soft, non-stubbly hairs like those of someone just beginning to shave. When I shave my neck/chest hair with this it is very difficult because it doesn&#x27;t get a good grip on softer hair.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific small shaver.  For it&#x27;s size, it&#x27;s pretty powerful.  I had used one for years but had lost the cord to recharge it.  When I received the 2 new ones I ordered, I used the new power cord to charge the old razor.  It started right up.  Now I have 2 to give away as gifts.</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical when I bought this product. I had seen a video review online which gave this shaver a negative review. But I bought it nevertheless and gave it a try. And, oh yes, it works! I just finished shaving with it and my face is extremely smooth. I shave in the morning with my regular Norelco razor but the Microforce is good for touch-ups. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for a heavy beard but it&#x27;s just the thing when you need a quick and easy shave (like before a date or a business meeting!) I don&#x27;t know how durable this razor is. I will keep it in my locker at work and use my regular shaver in the morning. I would recommend this shaver for the above stated purposes.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product at a CVS for around $10 since I was interested in a cordless close electric shave, which this product did provide very well. Unfortunately the device inexplicably stopped functioning altogether without a clue as to why (cheap parts likely).</li>
            <li> Price was right, delivery was prompt with no hassles  Would purchase again with no hesitation</li>
            <li> I received the Microforce Shaver in early February. It worked marginally okay at first for daily shaves. However, it is not very good for shaving after more than 2 days growth (i.e. a long weekend without shaving). In early March (approximately 30 days after receiving the razor), the battery stopped holding a charge and it no longer works. Attempts to get a replacement or refund from the seller were unsuccessful.</li>
            <li> Provided a close shave wet or dry for about a week, then stopped working. It was nice while it lasted.</li>
            <li> I thought that I could use this as a shaver if I don&#x27;t want to use my razor. But that doesn&#x27;t work since your hair has to be trimmed already, but don&#x27;t worry they have a product for that too! So, two days after shaving with my razor, I decide to give this thing a try. Not only does this thing do a bad job at shaving, but when I was done, my whole neck and face were irritated. It does get close to the shave of a razor and it&#x27;s more convenient than one, but at the cost of your face screaming out in pain after you&#x27;re done. The reason this is, is because under the microfoil, are two rows of circular razors buzzing around... No thank you!    And don&#x27;t buy it here, you can pick one up in CVS or Rite Aid for ten dollars and zero shipping.    So her are the pros:  -Convenient  -Travel sized  -Almost razor close shave  -Water resistant    Cons:  -Batteries not included (2x AAA needed)  -Need to already have trimmed hair  -The razors tear your face up  -Only a little cheaper than the Gillette Fusion (My razor)  -Trimmer not included    All-in-all, a useless product. But I&#x27;m gonna put another ten dollars on the line, and try their trimmer. Maybe that&#x27;ll make up for this.</li>
            <li> Excellent portable shaver. Granted, it is not a Ferrari but was never meant to be. However, if you need an inexpensive portable care free razor for a quick trip- this is it. Does better than disposable blades.....  It is good for reducing stubble around mustache, goatee and beard. It gets to those hard to reach places that big electric razors cannot get to. Therefore, 5 stars for me given its obvious limitations.</li>
            <li> I bought this tiny shaver thinking I could do a quick job on the move but I found that it needed recharging after only 2 shaves, the foil had a habit of pulling at my   facial hairs at the foil edges so I had to slow down and be careful and the plastic foil cover just keeps falling off!!! It&#x27;s more trouble than it&#x27;s worth. It&#x27;s such a simple item to make so why not make it a better design. Go back to the drawing board !</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to get a good shaving on your face, but forget about shaving your neck with it, it just doesn&#x27;t work and it irritates a lot. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I got it for my husband, however he says it hardly shaves anything. In other words, it doesn&#x27;t work.  He went back to using regular blades.  He&#x27;s been using it dry, so he&#x27;s gonna try it while in the shower.</li>
            <li> This is the second Microforce I have had. The first one was years ago when they first came out and I finally wore it out. I like the fact that the battery charge lasts a long time and that the size is very convenient. It is especially nice when traveling on vacation.</li>
            <li> This item really sucked it doesn&#x27;t work very well at all goes over hair doesn&#x27;t shave it at all would not buy or recommend to anyone I have bought lots and lots off amazon and loved everything I had bought but this item</li>
            <li> This electric razor was horrible. It didn&#x27;t break or anything it just couldn&#x27;t cut. It wouldn&#x27;t cut my facial hair even thought I cut it down to almost nothing and I still had to use my disposable razor. DON&#x27;T GET THIS!!! It&#x27;s such a waste of money. Your better off using a straight razor!</li>
            <li> Great little shaver to get in those tight spots when cleaning up the Taint and Balls.</li>
            <li> The new Miicroforce razor seems to be abig improvement over the one I bought several years ago. I am trying to follow the charging instructions carefully. I get seven shaves from a five hour charge. It also gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li> The unit is very powerful despite the size, but I had some skin reaction to the unit when I use it dry, but for the wet shaving is great......</li>
            <li> I had shaved in the morning and purchased this razor in the evening.  I had a light shadow of stubble and decided to give the Microforce shaver a try straight out of the box.  I was surprised to find out that this tiny shaver gave me a closer shave than the razor I used to shave with that very morning. If you shave everyday or every other day, this should work perfectly.     This little bugger will do exactly as the packagage describes.  It will give you a \\&quot;close clean shave in half of the time\\&quot; and you can \\&quot;shave anywhere-anytime-even in the shower.\\&quot;  It&#x27;s way more powerful than I expected and I like that it&#x27;s lightweight and easy to clean.  And I love the inexpensive price.       A couple of tips:     Don&#x27;t use a lot of pressure by pressing the razor down on your face.  Just let it glide lightly against your skin and it will work much better.  Also, if you&#x27;re not used to using an electric razor your face may feel irritated the first few days you use it but after your skin gets used to it, it will give you a super close shave and your face won&#x27;t feel irritated.</li>
            <li> A+ brand new, small and powerful shaver. I cant wait to shave! This thing is really great I love that it is cordless.</li>
            <li> This product can be bought, and from day began to have problems, I contacted the seller and informed me that no performing returns. The second day it stopped working completely, so I saw it pointed me to throw it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend you purchase this product.</li>
            <li> hardly cuts anything at all...</li>
            <li> This shaver is a Useless product.Trying to cut a day old stubble is near impossible talk less of two days or more</li>
            <li> Cut my shaving time down to a quarter of what it was.  Takes a little time to get used to but its worth it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a low cost electric shaver for travel.  Found this at Walgreens fo $20.  I liked the wet/dry use for such a low price.  I have owned fancy Panasonic wet/dry, and a couple of high priced Brauns in the past.  I have used the Microforce 3 times in the shower.  Honestly, this thing gives me a closer shave than any electric I have ever used.  It irritates a little on neck.  I think I will use this as my regular razor it is that good.  Now I cant speak to durability, and if it craps out in short order i would lower my 5* rating, but it gives a very close shave.  I have a medium beard, and certainly you have to use this everyday for effectiveness, I dont think it could handle multiple days growth.  Excellent performance for the money.</li>
            <li> The advertisement says it comes with a handy shaving kit.  However this item is just the shaver.  My family was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Terrible, I should of listened to the other reviews.    It doesn&#x27;t cut anything, it broke in 20 minutes    uselsss</li>
            <li> It is small, light, but easy to use. It is rechargeable and it is really good for traveling. . .</li>
            <li> Wish or best to &#x27;share&#x27; a shave plus how helpful found via this cleanly transportable SHAVEPRO appearance helper or assistant is.</li>
            <li> not worth buying unless you can&#x27;t afford some thing better</li>
            <li> Does not shave very well.</li>
            <li> I had owned one before but broke it so I ordered this one and the battery powered one and they&#x27;re just good shavers, better than bigger more expensive ones I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time for me to give it as a gift to our son-in-law .  He likes it because it&#x27;s portable but still shaves  thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I also have the non rechargeable, battery Microforce and love it.  But goes thru batteries every week or so.  So got the rechargeable one to save on battery cost - even though I read the reviews that said using it pulled the hairs and was uncomfortable.  I got it anyway.  And sure enough it pulls the hairs so much that it is unusable.  So I&#x27;ve reached a compromise.  I start out using my cheapie Norelco rechargeable that only does a so-so job.  Does not get a close shave.  Then shave again using the old Microforce shaver that does give me a close, smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know why one shaver works great but is unusable, and the other works great.  The cutting head and foil are identical.</li>
            <li> Good little shaver, and I&#x27;ve been shaving for more than half a century. If you want a comfortable, close shave, put a light coat of shaving foam (The cheaper varieties work just fine)on your face and neck, stretch the skin and let the razor glide around as necessary until you hear it stop mowing the whiskers. Rinse the razor head occasionally. May take a little practice, but you&#x27;ll wind up with a confortable shave and a face smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> Pros:  Yes, it does work in the shower and underwater.    Cons:  Bad job at shaving, and makes your skin very irritable.        Overall Thoughts:  I bought the shaver in the first place to have something that could give me a real quick shave when I&#x27;m running short on time.  While this does work in the shower and under water like it states, the job it does at actually shaving is quite bad actually.  I have tried shaving day after day so the shaver would have very short hair to cut, and I have also tried waiting a few days before shaving.  In the end, the shaver failed to live up to the hype.  While it did shave some of my facial hair, it would leave many strays behind... especially on the neck area.  Also it would leave my neck VERY irritated.  Every time I used this, I would have to finish the job with an actual razor and shaving cream.  I seriously consider this product a waste of my money, and recommend you all to stay away from it and just stick to a razor.</li>
            <li> This shaver is so small you would think it was not powerful but it is. I bought the rechargeable one and it is great.&lt;br /&gt;It shaves very close, recharges well and is easy to clean. I recommend it highly. The price ain&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> I like it. however I thought it was the battery model.&lt;br /&gt;I have 2 of the battery models already&lt;br /&gt;I have one in my car and one at work.</li>
            <li> These little shavers are great gifts for my girlfriends. They are wild about them.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a quick send and easy to do business with you.</li>
            <li> This review is for the Microforce shaver in our experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We used it on dry hair which didn&#x27;t work.  It didn&#x27;t for any hair, even on the arm.  We tried many different ways over - and - over - and - over.  Also, the instructions read do NOT expose to extreme temperatures, such as leaving in the car, which defeats the small size so it can be put in travel or gym bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON:  Doesn&#x27;t cut hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO: Small size</li>
            <li> This shaver works great for fast close shave. I use it when traveling. Cover the shaving area with talc powder and shave feeling for the places you missed and re shave. Takes about 3 minuets and your done! Love it!</li>
            <li> closest shave ever, better then any shaver ever ,almost close as a blade, try it .!!!!!! and cheep too!!!!,OUT STANDING!!</li>
            <li> My friend had me order these for him. He bought two of them. He likes them because he can charge them. And does not have to buy batteries. He is CHEAP and squekes when he walks. HA HA.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the non-rechargeable for years. It works well, but has a big appetite for batteries.  The rechargeable one gets around that. But the motor seems weaker, even when you use it plugged in. It&#x27;s a small shaver so if you have a big face, shaving will take longer. It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean and the price certainly is right.</li>
            <li> I really like it. For me who is often travel it is nice but it should be bbetter to have an intrenational voltage for foreign contries</li>
            <li> A razor that is only good for about a year, but the closeness of the shave is of such quality that I bought another one. All in all, it provides a closer and more comfortable shave at a price that equals buying razor blades. The shaver holds up very well, I only wish there was a way to have it sharpened rather than replacing it.</li>
            <li> For best results try applying some pre lectric shave on your face then shave with microforce.  You may have to clean it a few times during shaveing depending on how thick your beard is.  Start with a clean microforce and end with it clean and you geat great results.  Dont forget to charge it.</li>
            <li> Shaver works great, but they wear out fast. Bought this in JUNE and it just stopped holding a charge in September</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who, despite some of the bad reviews, wanted to try it.  He loves it!  He agrees that if you have really long hairs, it doesn&#x27;t do a great job.  But if you shave in the morning, this does a fantastic job of cleaning up and keeping you neat in the afternoon and/or evening when things start to grow again. It also makes it easier the following morning because there is less to shave.  Fantastic product for the price.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my dad. He loves it</li>
            <li> Its a great little travel razor to throw in the briefcase...It does a decent job for what it was designed but clearly its not something I would use every morning as is just too small.&lt;br /&gt;If you have a meeting after a redeye flight or just carry-on luggage this beats the Bic blade...</li>
            <li> I wanted a battery operated only MicroForce.  Hard to find that now.&lt;br /&gt;I will give the rechargeable to my adolesent godson.</li>
            <li> waste of money. It does not cut at all ...tried so many ways and just does not work..its seems to be a toy</li>
            <li> Size and shaving good but does not hold the charge for very long,not sure I would recommend this shaver. Had better.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this item before and it worked fine until it was necessary to recharge it....never worked after....This time it looked beautiful and after charging it initially..looked forward to using it..(it is a great size to carry in a purse)  Imagine my surprise to take off the cover and find a part missing...the \\&quot;foil\\&quot;   this left the cutter exposed and rendered the machine unusable....</li>
            <li> Perfect size and it&#x27;s rechargeable...has worked great and is used all the time...</li>
            <li> I had one but it did not work at all  would order a nother one. but not sure  Thank You HERBERT JEMMOTT</li>
            <li> Whilst it cuts well and seems powerfull,thats no use if as soon as you put it to face the foil head drops off.The plastic lugs are so thin and weak that they incapable of keeping the head in place. Pay a bit more and buy a Philips one.</li>
            <li> I like this little gadget.  It&#x27;s powerful and fast.  This is the second one I have purchased.  The price is quite amazing and I like it much better than larger ones, as this one is small enough to get to hard to reach places.  Works nicely in the shower as well.  I am happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I was basing my review on the previous Microforce razor I got that uses batteries.  Charging this one takes 5 to 6 hours and the charge lasts a short time.  For men this might be okay.  Women have a larger area to cover.  I found the battery was dead after one leg was done.  Then another wait--4 to 6 hours for the battery to charge up again,  I recommend getting rechargeable batteries and the original razor.</li>
            <li> I just bought one of these \\&quot;razors\\&quot; today in the hope that its \\&quot;9000 RPM\\&quot; head would shave my face &amp; head faster than my Norelco rotary, and be easier to clean to boot: no such luck - in fact it takes much longer, and does a lousy job.    Save your 10 bucks, gentlemen.</li>
            <li> I tried shaving with this thing for 20 straight minutes and couldn&#x27;t get a decent shave. Also the battery power runs out quickly. I suspect that the people who gave a good review to this shaver just can&#x27;t  admit to themselves that they got ripped-off.</li>
            <li> this thing is nothing but a piece of crap!....I ordered it at midnight online with the deluxe kit by the time i realized there were 2 shavers ordered instead of an upgrade to the original it was too late!, there was no way to cancel the order.When I checked my bank the next morning the money was taken from my debit account, I called the number for MF and a lady kept insisting no money was taken and that all I had to do was return the item when it arrived....I kept telling her I am looking at my acct online as i am speaking to you and the money was taken! after about 5 mins of back and forth with the liar she said ok well maybe it was taken....It took a month to arrive and no way to cancel the order, from $10 it went to $51.98 I opened one of them yesterday when it arrived and it cannot even shave the very fine hair on my hand....nothing! I am reporting them to the AG and Dept of Consumer Affairs!....no stars for them and that is still too much!!!!</li>
            <li> I have the AAA battery version which is compact and travel friendly.  However, my Braun AA battery shaver broke recently and I switched to the Microforce for daily use.  I found that the switch did not stay on and I had to manipulate it to keep in on while shaving which I found to be a bit irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the switch issue, this shaver is definitely useful for travel purposes (i.e. short term use).  Shaves are okay, not equivalent to an actual razor for closeness but passable to keep you stubble-free.</li>
            <li> Had one like this before and really liked it.</li>
            <li> fantastic little shaver ideal to take on holiday infact ideal to take anywhere as its so small you can just stick it in your pocket,dont be fooled by the size though as i find it better than the big shavors</li>
            <li> It works just as great as they say it dose. I love using it. Once and a while it will pull a hair or two but other than that it works great. A nice smooth shaved surface on your skin.</li>
            <li> This actually worked fine for me. I&#x27;ve had it for 6 months and never really had any complaints. It was incredible compact, decently powerful, and lasted about 5 days per full charge. I always charged it between 5-7 hours per the instructions. Yesterday, after a full charge, I unplugged it and left it on my counter. In the morning I woke up to see that something inside had exploded/burst. !?!?! That doesn&#x27;t seem normal. Or safe.  UPDATE: bought a second unit just to see if the first unit I received was just defective. It worked decently well (again) for 7 months and then lo and behold, it blew up again. Exact same scenario only this time the busted open device left an oil stain on my carpet.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product did not work at all.  I gave it away to use as a set prop.</li>
            <li> Although this does give a good, close shave (it may take several passes to get that shave), my skin is always a little raw for a couple days after using it. If you never have problems with sensitive skin, might be a good fit. If you have sensitive skin, I would say give it a pass.</li>
            <li> Bought on a whim from the \\&quot;as seen on TV\\&quot; section at Walgreens. I must say that I am very satisfied. I cant imagine using this as my only shaver, but I keep it in my car and use it for touch-up during the day. Have been shaving face AND head for over 20 years. I find that if I use this thing during the day, I come out smooth as a cue ball. Haven&#x27;t used it INSTEAD of my razor, but as long as it is used as I am sure it is intended....a mid-day touch up, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Trash. Made in China and is nothing more than a cheaply made toy. It&#x27;s simply impossible to engineer a working razor down to this size, so don&#x27;t fool yourself into trying this ripoff. It&#x27;s only function is to separate the gullible from their money.&lt;br /&gt;If lightweight portability is crucial, just get a good disposable razor and use it. Shaving is not rocket science.</li>
            <li> It is great for a quick touch up. For example, your five o&#x27;clock shadow. Terrible for anything else.  At its current price ($20), this product is overpriced. An ideal price for this product would be $10.</li>
            <li> a good and useful product</li>
            <li> I bought this for my special needs son, I didn&#x27;t want him to cut himself with a traditional razor.  It works fine. Just a side note it will not go through the hair on top of your head (yes he tried) thank goodness.</li>
            <li> Photo of product seems to show case standing more effectively than it does.  Still&#x27; for the pprice not bad for just a protective cover.</li>
            <li> this thing can barely cut peach fuzz. cheapest product i think ive ever bought.</li>
            <li> Its a good machine, you can&#x27;t demand more for the money paid. If you wants improve the performance must replace the springs below the blades. the product was delivered according to the agreed conditions and at the time indicated</li>
            <li> had it for less then 3 months and it stopped working completely. I liked the size but the quality was very poor.</li>
            <li> Great  cut and rechargeable too nice will  get another for my car</li>
            <li> I bought one of these at Walmart because my beloved Remington DA 307 finally gave up the ghost after several decades of hard use(RIP). The 9000 RPMs claim on the package got me. I was very skeptical, and fully expected to be returning it, as I have a tough beard, and the DA was the only electric that ever gave me a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first shave was a shocker. It cuts every bit as close as my DA 307 did, and it is small enough to get into tight places, like under my nose. It did as good as my 6 blade Gillette disposable razors. Mine is not the rechargeable version, but I am using rechargeable AAA batteries. I don&#x27;t know how long they last per charge. I am already looking for the rechargeable version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor shaves at least as good, if not better, than all of the $50.00-$100.00 electrics from Remington, Braun, and Norelco (trust me, I have had them all at one time or another). And, it really is water-proof. It is smaller than a credit card, meaning it takes up no room in my Gym Bag. I can keep one in my bag, and have a nice shave after some time in the Steam Sauna. These are cheap enough to keep one in your car, office desk, or even in your pocket. You can afford to have several.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This could be the best $10.00 I have ever spent.</li>
            <li> I currently use a Phillips electric razor to shave my entire face. For the past year I would follow the shave up with the Microforce and it made my skin as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. Try to use the Microforce before shaving? Absolutely awful idea, it will not cut a single hair. Use it as an after shave stubble touch up and you will be extremely satisfied! I discovered this out of curiosity and found that it&#x27;s my new shaving secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Microforce popped open one day and I lost one of the interior blade springs so I need to order another one online. I saw all the negative reviews and decided I would tell everyone how to use this thing properly. (Even though it is advertised as a razor and not a stubble remover).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: In order for it to work properly, you must make sure that it has fully battery. This thing can run for weeks on a dying battery but it will get worse and worse as it progresses. Change the battery once every two weeks or as desired.</li>
            <li> Works great, but you will need to have a razor blade shave first, after that you can easily maintain a close shave.</li>
            <li> This is the second one of these razors I have purchased. It works very well and I have only used it dry but not wet.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these shavers, one battery powered and the other electric chargeable. I like to shave with a regular razor and gel while in the shower but often miss a small spot or two and that&#x27;s when this little shaver really comes in handy to correct these little missed spots. I also have the battery powered one with me for my trips as I fly for a living and it also works equally as well. One thing to remember is to CLEAN OUT the blade assembly at least every other time or you can have irritated skin but thankfully I have not. For $10.00 it really is a good small devise for touch ups, and the occasional entire face shave.</li>
            <li> For the price this is a good on the go shaver. I keep one at work  so I can get a quick clean up before meetings.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY. WHAT A RIP OFF!!!!!  IT DOES NOT SHAVE.....SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DO NOT....I REPEAT DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
            <li> this is a fabulous little shaver--it works great-and so small and easy to carry-even in your shirt pocket-try that with your norelco-i have not had to recharge yet-tho ive only hat it 2 weeks--still runs strong-i dont like to look scruffy so i always shave daily-and maybe again in the evening before a dinner date or meeting.also i dont have a real heavy or black beard-im blonde and blue eyed so my beard is lite.i am quite hansome and like to stay that way so i shave.i tried it on a peach and it shaved it smoothe as a necterine---also i tried to shave the cat but it didnt work so well-the cat didnt go for that eather.</li>
            <li> I have had many electric shavers in my life, none of them more than 4 on a scale of 1-10, 10 being a shower shave with a motorized blade razor.      I carry the Microforce Electri Razor in my car and can go several days without a blade shave and still look well shaved.    And the battery lasts a long  time and charges easily.    And it was very inexpensive from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product it is badly design and did not works as it advertise in the tv commercial,barely have the power of to shave after charge it like 12 hours and maybe can cut some whiskers off of your face,not like the commercial have a guy in a shower and able to shaved and cut a whole lot of a face show of a stuble of a beard.</li>
            <li> it works ok but is not good as the same model it replaced - do not like need for 7 more words</li>
            <li> I usually shave with a blade, and I got this to keep at my girlfriend&#x27;s home just in case. Well, it kinda works if your beard is very short, but if you don&#x27;t shave every day it&#x27;s not gonna do the job. I like the review where the guy says \\&quot;after\\&quot; he shaves the razor is good for removing leftover stubble, but I think if you buy this as your main razor you are going to be very dissapointed, and if you buy it for travel you are probably not going to make a good impression wherever you go.</li>
            <li> This is my second one and I like it immensely. As a wet shaver it rivals my panasonic. I don&#x27;t want to ever be without 1 in my grooming arsenal.</li>
            <li> As mentioned in another review, this shaver is not a beard trimmer. It will not remove more than stubble from your face. Please this regard the reviews where it gets one star for not being a good beard trimmer or shaver. It works great as a stubble remover. That&#x27;s its great purpose! I have used this compact shaver for a number of years now and have never had a problem with them. This one was simply a replacement since my previous one of many years needed a replacement charging cord.</li>
            <li> My husband received the shaver and the first day the on/off switch stopped working. $20.00 down the drain.You can tell it&#x27;s not made in AMERICA!</li>
            <li> I would recommend that no one buy this product, it is not worth purchasing. It must have been used on someone without any hair to shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good little shaver, I use it off and on, I will use it when I&#x27;m away from home as it does not take hardly any space in my suit case.</li>
            <li> I Was Kind Of Sketchy About Buying This Product , Because Of All The Bad Reveiw&#x27;s People Kept Saying About It, But Honestly It Worked Great On Me &amp; I Happen To Have Thin To Kinda Thick Hair , I Will Honeslty Buy Another One When This One Break&#x27;s :)</li>
            <li> did not turn on after charging for 7 hours as directed</li>
            <li> Works very well and a really good value</li>
            <li> nice. small. powerful.</li>
            <li> Far from the last razor one buys but handy in case you forget yours while in a trip.</li>
            <li> The best thing ever. I had the same shaver but it used batteries then one day it stop working. Don&#x27;t know why. Batteries didn&#x27;t make it work. I&#x27;m glad I got this.</li>
            <li> I own another Shavepro Microforce shaver and it has been fine. This one has a defective switch. If not for that I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> just what I wanted , no problems.</li>
            <li> The description implies this shaver is cordless and rechargeable. It is not rechargeable. It requires two AAA batteries which are not included. That said it is a good little razor for the price.</li>
            <li> My sister had one and I went nuts when I tried it and had to have one!  It is the best and Dr Oz said &#x27; I would rather see wemon shave than tweez facial hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband. He was well pleased to receive this and states it works very well.</li>
            <li> I iust bought the same product from a guy on the street . Well , it&#x27;s a mini shaver so if u have a regular machien u can get this one for emergency .. Like you can keep it at your work place u cannot depend on it for good</li>
            <li> Device does not work properly.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;This is a very handy little compact shaver. I would suggest this item to everyone who shaves on a weekly or daily basis. Perfect for people who travel a lot.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I bought this item and found that while it does shave you, it&#x27;s not as good as a blade, it leaves behind hairs and leaves my skin feeling sore and irritated, the battery life is not great either, but my biggest complaint is that while it comes with a pack of accessories most men would not use, it DOESNT come with one item I would have thought to be the best accessory to include, a car charger. If anyone knows if they even make a car charger for this I would love to know, basically it&#x27;s ok for an emergency to get rid of stubble, but if you have time you&#x27;re better off using the blade.</li>
            <li> It works just as well as the $$$.$$ electric shavers. If you don&#x27;t shave for a couple of days this will NOT shave..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your facial hair has to be a certain length or it won&#x27;t work, but if your hair is the right length it&#x27;ll shave like a pro... baby smooth.... especially around the mouth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be forewarned this like other electric shavers does a lousy job under the neck ...</li>
            <li> I have bought three of these razors  do not sale replacements  this one was a joke  loud  kept&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;falling apart  have bought from amazon in the past  first dissapointment</li>
            <li> I chose this shaver because I had one that ran on AA batteries. So I figured a rechargeable one would be great. Nothing could be further from the truth. This &amp;#34;rechargeable&amp;#34; shaver is good for ONE shave and then you have to recharge it. When I contacted the seller they said the 6 months on the warranty has expired. They offered me a 20% discount on any of their merchandise. RUN, DON&#x27;T WALK AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!!</li>
            <li> DOES NOT WORK AT ALL!!!  You are honestly better off shaving with a butter knife, but thats what you get for 10 bucks.</li>
            <li> This razor died on me two months after I bought it. I liked the idea of a travel razor I could use if I was running late, but it just didn&#x27;t last. I guess you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> gift for husband he loved it</li>
            <li> I bought the Microforce cordless razor because I&#x27;m hyper-meticulous about personal grooming. I really don&#x27;t need to shave but I like the ritual of keeping myself \\&quot;honeymoon ready\\&quot; at all times. And, as women age and hormone levels change, there&#x27;s sometimes a stray chin hair that pops up just when you&#x27;re getting ready to leave the house. I love this razor. It&#x27;s the size of a credit card and it&#x27;s inexpensive. I recharge it (for around 5 hours) but I bought a second one that takes batteries so I&#x27;d have a backup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so pleased with this unit, I just gave away two rather expensive women&#x27;s electric razors that were much larger and less efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s be clear about my 5-star rating. I am essentially hair-free and use this simply as a touch up. If I had substantial body/facial hair or coarse hair, I have no idea whether the razor would do the job.</li>
            <li> Does a reasonable job however it takes a lot of patience to get a complete shave. Charge lasts long enough to do so though.</li>
            <li> I absolutelyLove it!!!!!  i would recommend this shaver to everyone.  Its amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> My husband just loves this little shaver.  The price is great, the product is amazing and he will definately order another one.</li>
            <li> compact and it does a great job. Holds a charge longer than my other shavers do.and a lot cheapertoo.would recommend to any one without reservation.</li>
            <li> I first found these in my local drugstore, but they don&#x27;t have them any longer.  Both my husband and also his buddy use these when traveling.  They don&#x27;t last a long time, but they work.  I tried one for myself, but sadly the hair on my legs must be too soft...</li>
            <li> inexpensive, small... but those are only advantages over other products if it works as other products do... this doesn&#x27;t cut hair... and without cutting hair, i don&#x27;t see how anything else is worth mentioning :)</li>
            <li> I have read a bunch of these reviews criticizing this shaver. I am always amazed that when consumers buy something for ten bucks (that&#x27;s what mine cost) they expect it to work like a $150 plug-in electric. For $10 I got a shaver that works up to and exceeds my expectations for that amount. Heck, if it didn&#x27;t work at all, I would have been only mildly disappointed. This shaver does a fine job for me &amp; has for many months. I have been a blade shaver my entire life (well, ages 16 to 66). Now I use this most of the time. Here is what I have discovered with this shaver: It does not work well on more than a 36 hour growth of the average beard. It tends to pull a little. So try to use it every 24 hours. It works better after a few initial shaves, like the instructions say. Maybe it is because YOU get used to IT. I don&#x27;t know. It works best if you don&#x27;t press down hard. Just let it glide over your face. Yes, you will have to go over most areas of your face a few times to get a smooth shave, but personally I DO get a smooth shave. Put some hand lotion or pre-electric shave lotion on before you shave &amp; let it dry for a minute or two. This will help the glide of the shaver. I usually shave while I am reading, so even if this takes longer to get a smooth shave, than using a blade, I haven&#x27;t wasted any time. I am very happy with my little shaver and have even considered buying another as a backup or travel kit razor.</li>
            <li> Use on medium stubble in sensitive areas. Bikini line, armpits. I thought it did not work, but my friend recommended it. Advertised for men, not great with thick stubble.</li>
            <li> I have a battery operated Microforce.  I have had it for years.  I can&#x27;t get this one to charge. I have tried several different out lets.  They are all on.  I follow the instructions in the panplet you sent with it.  But it won&#x27;t take charge.  I would like to return it and get another one that does.  Please let me know what  can be done.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Norma Anderson&lt;br /&gt;212 8th Ave W Apt 107&lt;br /&gt;West Fargo. ND 58078</li>
            <li> brilliant brilliant  the best electric shaver I have ever had. my skin is so smooth after wards.well done for this product.thank you.c spencer.</li>
            <li> Useful to take on trips for touch up or fast shave.</li>
            <li> Nice little shaver!!!!!</li>
            <li> Husband is using the razor as I&#x27;m typing this review. It&#x27;s his 2nd razor, the head wore out on the 1st one. Will a 3rd if needed.</li>
            <li> Rubbish. Don&#x27;t waste your money. It will leave your skin irritated and ironically still hairy at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, use a piece of sandpaper rather than this. Cheaper too.</li>
            <li> Great produce for the price i love this little guy..&lt;br /&gt;i been using it this for 3 years already..and it&#x27;s still going strong&lt;br /&gt;i purchase one for my dad he really like it... would buy again&lt;br /&gt;5 stars!!!!</li>
            <li> Does its job as small as it is...</li>
            <li> COMPACT AND NICE LITTLE SHAVER, TIME WILL TELL ABOUT IT...</li>
            <li> I have used the battery-powered version of this product for a long time, and have had very satisfactory performance, except for having to change batteries.  This is why I got the rechargeable version.  I followed the directions for charging, and noticed that even after charging, the shaving action was very weak.  I recharged the battery after it pooped out (about 2 days after initial charge), and the result was the same.&lt;br /&gt;I would ship this garbage back to to shipper, but it isn&#x27;t worth the trouble.  I will save the head to use when my battery-powered unit wears out.&lt;br /&gt;I believe half of the internet-based commerce is based on garbage like this.  I won&#x27;t do this again.  I learned my lesson.</li>
            <li> How do I no when it is fully charge , does the red indicator light change any at all</li>
            <li> This is the third one I have had, they are great.  The first got lost. I replaced the second because I thought it was burned out....It wasn&#x27;t, the charging transformer no longer charged.......So I have two, one old and one new..... they work just fine........I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> Love this cheapo brand! It works very well, the price is right, and when the blades get dull after a year or so - I just buy a new one!</li>
            <li> This is a great second shaver.  I keep one in each car so that I can &#x27;clean up&#x27; when needed.  It gives a very smooth shave as long as your beard is still short (less than a days growth).  It has a tough time handling a full day of growth so it would not be good as your only shaver unless you planned to shave multiple times per day.  Quality is just OK (I&#x27;ve had several stop working and had to cannibalize old ones for parts) but the price is cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I have both the standard battery version and the rechargeable version.  The rechargeable version, while still good, does not have a very long battery life and less power overall.  I prefer to use the standard version but use my own rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li> These little razors work great for me. I&#x27;ve got two of them. I keep one in my car for when I just need a quick shave and one at home. There easy to recharge and the charge lasts for about a week. Great product.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this to anybody it pulls the hair on my face and will not shave good at all</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do as advertised. Abrasive to the face. A waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver because it advertised twice the power with half the size.  It doesn&#x27;t take the hair off. Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> I love this little thing!  This is my 2nd one in 4 years.  I promise it works as well as my $100 Braun.</li>
            <li> work good for every day shave</li>
            <li> All Good ... Recommended ...</li>
            <li> Does not shave close. Would of liked a refund bur Amazon didn&#x27;t get back to me about it. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this shaver.</li>
            <li> love this thing relly works well</li>
            <li> I bought this for my legs, but I read the reviews first. I was a little discouraged when I read that it doesn&#x27;t for great for longer hair, but I bought it anyway. I use this for the days between shaving my legs, and it works great!</li>
            <li> It will do for travel</li>
