            <li>but it&#x27;s good stuff</li>

            <li>Good product just smells like cigarette ashes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I purchased my own and was very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>what it will do for your hair, the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>but it worked nice with my hair.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best oil for my Type 4 hair.  </li>
            <li>This is a really good product but a lot of times people don&#x27;t understand that your ends of your hair is just as important as your scalp.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, oily hair.</li>
            <li>Great for your hair ,bought it for a friend and she loves it, no weird smell</li>
            <li>Makes a great hot oil treatment for the hair.</li>
            <li>My beautician recommended this product and it works fine!</li>
            <li>this castor/ coconut oil mix was just ok to me.</li>
            <li>i think coconut oil lovers may appreciate it more.  </li>
            <li>but i like the castor oil without coconut oil better.  </li>
            <li>Love this oil.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT...</li>
            <li>i had heard of the many benefits of cocnut oil, but my hair doesnt seem to like coconut oil on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li>was the itching, which after doing more research i found out</li>
            <li>I was able to cut off all of my damaged hair in a cute bob.</li>
            <li>This is one of my most top favorite oils, it is number 1.</li>
            <li>but I will save my money and mix my own coconut oil with my original JBCO.</li>
            <li>This oil is absolutely wonderful for dry skin and hair.</li>
            <li>this is the real deal,  its so good for your hair</li>
            <li>Sweet lord!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite castor oil, it smells great without having to add essential oils to it.</li>
            <li>I broke my bottle, so I wasn&#x27;t able to use the oil in its entirety,  however when I used it my hair growth increased quickly.</li>
            <li>I LIKE THE LIGHT SMELL...</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair smooth and locked with moisture.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re willing to deal with that then you will be satisfied with the product and</li>
            <li>original JBCO</li>
            <li>I probably would have rated this product higher in better circumstances.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty safe to say I will NEVER order from them again</li>
            <li>This product does not moisture my ends like the original castor oil.  </li>
            <li>this product is so great for the hair, it make your hair soft and dry and it also make your hair grow I love this product</li>
            <li>Nevertheless I&#x27;m satisfied and will surely re-order in the future</li>
            <li>Overall though, this oil is great, I can&#x27;t express enough how lovely it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>and it smelled EXACTLY like the original JBCO.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair and it really makes her hair smooth.  </li>
            <li>Visit my Natural Beauties page on Facebook for more reviews.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it&#x27;s NATURAL</li>
            <li>after doing a lot of research i found a lot of people had success with jbco.</li>
            <li>One good thing about this product is that it is not at all as thick as the original JBCO</li>
            <li>Does exactly what the label said it would do.  </li>
            <li>Depends on what you are willing to tolerate.</li>
            <li>but I guess it is worth the price if it really works...</li>
            <li>The consistency is perfect, nowhere near as thick as straight castor oil, and it feels heavenly on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have so many different oils.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to be.</li>
            <li>The first bottle expired a month after I received it and</li>
            <li>I would most definitely it buy again.</li>
            <li>Shipping was extremely fast!</li>
            <li>I will continue to use to determine if it positively impacts the health of my hair.</li>
            <li>This Jamaican Coconut Black Castor Oil is amazing.</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>however, because of job internship i wasnt really paing attention to the condition of my hair.</li>
            <li>I continued using jbco on my scalp and my hair grew so much.</li>
            <li>, I just wish it was available in larger quantities!!</li>
            <li>I really would not buy this particular product again</li>
            <li>am satisfied that it arrived quickly, in new condition, and it is recommended by other ladies that use it.</li>
            <li>I even went on to buy some for my older sister and niece.</li>
            <li>... MAKES MY NEW GROWTH SOFT...</li>
            <li>but I had hoped the coconut would be stronger to mask the original scent of the black castor oil.</li>
            <li>Transitioning out of relaxer, this kept my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Use sometimes during Pre-pooing for my natural hair.  </li>
            <li>It brings shine to my hair and makes it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>and it was old or something.</li>
            <li>though i am natural i dont like to jump on every bandwagon that rolls about.</li>
            <li>my hair was soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I also love how thick it is</li>
            <li>I live in New York currently, and the dryness in the air made my hair very brittle, especially after living in Atlanta for 7 years.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected for my natural hair!</li>
            <li>It can be a bit messy, but, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t particularly care for the smell, but it seems to disappear shortly.</li>
            <li>The smell can be overwhelming if you mistakenly use too much but other than that, its hardly noticeable after while.</li>
            <li>and It keeps my hair thick &amp; strong.</li>
            <li>For the next I DON&#x27;T KNOW HOW LONG I will be resigned to pony tails and buns in order not to show a few prominent bald spots, from using this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m disappointed because I&#x27;ve used the regular castor oil before and liked it, so I was excited to try the coconut</li>
            <li>This castor oil has brought life back to my hair which normally would be dry and frizzy by the 2nd or 3rd day after I washed and styled my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I think the smell is hardly noticeable and it definitely fades quickly.  </li>
            <li>Very fast shipping the smell is hard to get use to at first but keeps my hair hydrated and Iv noticed less shedding</li>

            <li> Very fast shipping the smell is hard to get use to at first but keeps my hair hydrated and Iv noticed less shedding</li>
            <li> , I like the slight barely noticeable scent.  </li>
            <li> , it should be noted that, while the description box for this product only lists two ingredients - organic JBCO and organic coconut oil, the bottle itself suggests that there are other ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Made my scalp itch, but it could be that I mixed it with other products.  </li>
            <li> but my ends just seem to stay dry.  </li>
            <li> I have an extremely dry scalp and this product is a dry scalp fixer!!!</li>
            <li> was because the oil tries to excrete toxins from the skin, i cant tell you whether thats the truth or not.</li>
            <li> This is a greasy product, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> And a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Other then thats the product works miracles.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine who had lost her edges due to sew ins recommended this product to me.</li>
            <li> My hair line moved back at least an inch and a half due to the hair loss.</li>
            <li> I can also always get behind natural products.</li>
            <li> I love the product, Just the one thing I hate is the smell.</li>
            <li> but it fell and look water down.</li>
            <li> the name of the product is Jamaican COCONUT black castor oil</li>
            <li> I use this along with the Black Castor Oil Hair food.  </li>
            <li> so though a lot of people were talking about jamaican black castor oil i never wanted to try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now, after reading the reviews and seeing the vids on youtube and haircare forums about the wonders of JBCO</li>
            <li> It does have a few things for one to get used to like the thickness of the oil, the smell, and it can make your scalp itch...</li>
            <li> I went back to plain Castor Oil from Tropic Isle Living Jamaican!!!</li>
            <li> i thought it was going to be thick and dark like the castor oil</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what this includes.</li>
            <li> The bottle is relatively small though given the price of $8.</li>
            <li> scent.wont be getting this no more.</li>
            <li> No strong smell, oil is thick as well.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, extremely thick, so my hair can take heat and oil.</li>
            <li> Seriously who would mail an expired bottle of oil?  </li>
            <li> no good</li>
            <li> Coconut by itself is worthless on my hair because it&#x27;s so thin but mixed</li>
            <li> however, after a couple of bad weave experience which left my edges weak, thin, brittle with holes in them i grew desperate.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the cap which seals the product arrived thoroughly cracked</li>
            <li> I am extremely unhappy with this product.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m disappointed with this product for two reasons.</li>
            <li> I was highly disappointed when I opened it</li>
            <li> the itching isnt horrible which is why despite it i still continue to use this.</li>
            <li> i dont think the smell is horrible, i kinda lie it and besides it disappears after a while.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this is the real deal,  its so good for your hair</li>
            <li> this product is so great for the hair, it make your hair soft and dry and it also make your hair grow I love this product</li>
            <li> Great product!!  Does exactly what the label said it would do.  My beautician recommended this product and it works fine!</li>
            <li> I like this product and will continue to use regularly. Transitioning out of relaxer, this kept my hair soft and manageable. The smell can be overwhelming if you mistakenly use too much but other than that, its hardly noticeable after while. Using this (and keeping my hair cornrowed), I did experience growth in length and thickness.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have been hearing how great it works for hair growth. I have a problem with the front of my hair line, I&#x27;ve been using this product for one month now and I have noticed some hair growth in that area...I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good and seems quite nourishing but I had hoped the coconut would be stronger to mask the original scent of the black castor oil. Nevertheless I&#x27;m satisfied and will surely re-order in the future</li>
            <li> Helps with thickness, makes my scalp itch though. Guess thats the downside, have to wash my hair weekly. Depends on what you are willing to tolerate. No strong smell, oil is thick as well.</li>
            <li> this castor/ coconut oil mix was just ok to me. i think coconut oil lovers may appreciate it more.  i know that its a great oil but i like the castor oil without coconut oil better.  thanks.</li>
            <li> this stuff started my hair growing like nuthin else i stand by it 100% i will keep this in my regular hair regimen</li>
            <li> My hair loved this, but try to keep off your scalp/  My scalp reacted to this and itched like crazy--very soothing and softening to hair ends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now, after reading the reviews and seeing the vids on youtube and haircare forums about the wonders of JBCO I purchased my own and was very pleased with the product. It does have a few things for one to get used to like the thickness of the oil, the smell, and it can make your scalp itch... alot. but if you&#x27;re willing to deal with that then you will be satisfied with the product and what it will do for your hair, the results are amazing. However, I&#x27;m disappointed with this product for two reasons. #1 the name of the product is Jamaican COCONUT black castor oil so you would think it smelled like coconut but it does not. That was my purpose for buying this one because I thought I would escape the JBCO smell. I was highly disappointed when I opened it and it smelled EXACTLY like the original JBCO.  #2 it&#x27;s only 4oz. for the price of the 8oz. original JBCO so thats a jip, I guess they figured they&#x27;re giving you two oils (coconut and castor oil) in one so they are entitled to give you only 4oz. instead of 8oz. Lol. One good thing about this product is that it is not at all as thick as the original JBCO so thats a plus however I will not buy this version of it again.  The product is no doubt a good product from my experience it has helped my hair alot and I will not do without it but I will save my money and mix my own coconut oil with my original JBCO.</li>
            <li> I gained a lot of length with this application, I may not buy because of the Price but it worked nice with my hair. Coconut + Castor oil equals results!!</li>
            <li> Great product.  I use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair and it really makes her hair smooth.  I use it as part of het conditioning regime.</li>
            <li> I received my order today and the bottle is so tiny... so tiny that it looks like a toy... but I guess it is worth the price if it really works...</li>
            <li> ORDERED 2 BOTTLES... STILL USING IT... MAKES MY NEW GROWTH SOFT... I LIKE THE LIGHT SMELL... IT&#x27;S GREAT! I WISH IT WAS A BIGGER BOTTLE... BUT IT DOESN&#x27;T MATTER BECAUSE I DON&#x27;T HAVE A PROBLEM BUYIN 2 OR 3 BOTTLES...</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my mother; therefore, I have not had any personal experience with using it(she has not used it yet).&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfied that it arrived quickly, in new condition, and it is recommended by other ladies that use it.</li>
            <li> smells wonderful and works great!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected for my natural hair!</li>
            <li> This oil is absolutely wonderful for dry skin and hair. I didn&#x27;t particularly care for the smell, but it seems to disappear shortly. Mixing it with an essential oil seems to cut back on the smell. Love this oil. Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I probably would have rated this product higher in better circumstances.  I ordered this product on August 22, 2013.  I received it today, and the label says that it expires August 2013.  August will be over in 5 days, and there is no way I will use up this bottle in 5 days.  I&#x27;m disappointed because I&#x27;ve used the regular castor oil before and liked it, so I was excited to try the coconut version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it should be noted that, while the description box for this product only lists two ingredients - organic JBCO and organic coconut oil, the bottle itself suggests that there are other ingredients.  Specifically, my bottle notes that it contains \\&quot;a proprietary blend\\&quot; of coconut oil. I&#x27;m not sure what this includes.</li>
            <li> My hair and skin feel great when I add this to my beauty regimen! It can be a bit messy, but, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> i finally purchased this product after seeing Blakizbeautyful on youtube continuously rave about it.  I think the smell is hardly noticeable and it definitely fades quickly.  The consistency is perfect, nowhere near as thick as straight castor oil, and it feels heavenly on my hair.  I have so many different oils.  Coconut by itself is worthless on my hair because it&#x27;s so thin but mixed w. the JBCO it&#x27;s great.  It is a bit pricey but I like it so I think I&#x27;ll continue to buy it especially since you don&#x27;t need to use lots of it anyhow.  Good product.  Oh and I didn&#x27;t experience any itching.</li>
            <li> Good Product. Use sometimes during Pre-pooing for my natural hair.  Read reviews and recommendations and decide to give it a try. Couldn&#x27;t find locally, so I came to Amazon.com. Would recommend!!</li>
            <li> I use this along with the Black Castor Oil Hair food.  I put this only once a month and the hair food daily.  Works great.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It brings shine to my hair and makes it soft and manageable. It ends the dryness that i was experiencing.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell and it was old or something. ..no good</li>
            <li> Great for your hair ,bought it for a friend and she loves it, no weird smell</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  Made my scalp itch, but it could be that I mixed it with other products.  I really would not buy this particular product again</li>
            <li> What can you say? It&#x27;s JBCO.  The packaging and shipping time was without concern. It&#x27;s exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to be.</li>
            <li> This is the second bottle I bought within 3 mths. The first bottle expired a month after I received it and the one I just received (purchased in Sept 2013) on the bottle it said use by August 2013. Seriously who would mail an expired bottle of oil?  I will never order this again from Amazon. I will buy from Vitacost or in a local health food store which will have a longer expiration date.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best oil for my Type 4 hair.  It&#x27;s the only one I use now.  It provides sheen, softness, and moisture.  Visit my Natural Beauties page on Facebook for more reviews.</li>
            <li> If I could give no stars at all it still would not be sufficient. This company sent me an EXPIRED product and I have yet to hear back from them concerning a refund or exchange. It&#x27;s pretty safe to say I will NEVER order from them again</li>
            <li> This stuff is supposed to help make hair grow. I have not used it enough to see that yet.</li>
            <li> I am extremely unhappy with this product.  After I saw all of the review claiming this to be some sort of &#x27;wonder hair growth product&#x27; I was happy to fork over the cash.  I can also always get behind natural products. NO! Not this time.  I let the oil sit on my scalp for about 2 hours after massaging it in.  In the shower, akin to &#x27;The Craft,&#x27; clumps of hair started to FALL off of my head! Sweet lord!  For the next I DON&#x27;T KNOW HOW LONG I will be resigned to pony tails and buns in order not to show a few prominent bald spots, from using this product. DO NOT USE IF YOU DO NOT WANT YOUR HAIR TO FALL OUT!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now beginning my hair care journey with the use of castor oil. I am using this product to seal my hair after washing. I have African-American hair. Unfortunately, the cap which seals the product arrived thoroughly cracked and so I can&#x27;t SEAL the product after using. I am trying my best to do so with tape. This is a greasy product, so a little goes a long way. I will continue to use to determine if it positively impacts the health of my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it&#x27;s NATURAL and It keeps my hair thick &amp; strong. Plus I Iike the smell!</li>
            <li> Ordered this product as a recommendation from a hair blog I read and GREAT product! This castor oil has brought life back to my hair which normally would be dry and frizzy by the 2nd or 3rd day after I washed and styled my natural hair. A product I will continue to use. Good investment! And a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT... IT CONDITIONS MY HAIR SO GOOD... MY HAIR IS GETTING STRONGER AND LONGER WITH THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> OMG, this product is supper great!!! I have an extremely dry scalp and this product is a dry scalp fixer!!! I love it!!!</li>
            <li> excellent product, love it, will buy again</li>
            <li> This Jamaican Coconut Black Castor Oil is amazing. Leaves your hair smooth and locked with moisture. I broke my bottle, so I wasn&#x27;t able to use the oil in its entirety,  however when I used it my hair growth increased quickly. I even went on to buy some for my older sister and niece. I live in New York currently, and the dryness in the air made my hair very brittle, especially after living in Atlanta for 7 years.  I have thick hair, extremely thick, so my hair can take heat and oil. The bottle is relatively small though given the price of $8. I would recommend buying the Castor Oil and mixing it with coconut oil yourself if you are on a budget. Overall though, this oil is great, I can&#x27;t express enough how lovely it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> though i am natural i dont like to jump on every bandwagon that rolls about. so though a lot of people were talking about jamaican black castor oil i never wanted to try. however, after a couple of bad weave experience which left my edges weak, thin, brittle with holes in them i grew desperate. my edges had been suffering for months. after doing a lot of research i found a lot of people had success with jbco. so i decided it wouldnt hurt to try. i bought this one because of the coconut oil. i had heard of the many benefits of cocnut oil, but my hair doesnt seem to like coconut oil on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i applied it deligently every night for about 2months. however, because of job internship i wasnt really paing attention to the condition of my hair. i had my hair weaved up (but avoided the egdes) to make easier for me to get up and go in the mornings. after the job ended and i started paying attention to my hair again, imagine my shock and surprise when i noticed i couldnt see my scalp at my edges anymore. i was amazed. i begun using this to seal my hair after moisturizing every night and i must say i loved it. my hair was soft and manageable. now i know why people praise this oil so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only thing i wasnt so fond of was the itching, which after doing more research i found out was because the oil tries to excrete toxins from the skin, i cant tell you whether thats the truth or not. the itching isnt horrible which is why despite it i still continue to use this. and i noticed people dont like the smell. i dont think the smell is horrible, i kinda lie it and besides it disappears after a while.</li>
            <li> I love the product, Just the one thing I hate is the smell. Other then thats the product works miracles.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, oily hair. Last year I decided to put a sew in, which broke out all of my edges. My hair line moved back at least an inch and a half due to the hair loss. A friend of mine who had lost her edges due to sew ins recommended this product to me. After purchasing jbco for about 2 months along with a medicated hair thickening grease I saw that my edges were fully covered. I continued using jbco on my scalp and my hair grew so much. I was able to cut off all of my damaged hair in a cute bob. I&#x27;m currently using the oil to grow my hair back.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping the smell is hard to get use to at first but keeps my hair hydrated and Iv noticed less shedding</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell all that great but it&#x27;s good stuff</li>
            <li> This is one of my most top favorite oils, it is number 1. I have no problems with this oil, I like the slight barely noticeable scent.  I also love how thick it is, I just wish it was available in larger quantities!! Great oil, helps stimulate growth, thickness, dryness, and itchiness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite castor oil, it smells great without having to add essential oils to it. Took away a star because I wish they had an 8oz jar.</li>
            <li> Wonderful light coconut smell. Makes a great hot oil treatment for the hair. I would most definitely it buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a really good product but a lot of times people don&#x27;t understand that your ends of your hair is just as important as your scalp.  This product does not moisture my ends like the original castor oil.  It was awesome on my scalp and the hair part but my ends just seem to stay dry.  Overall I would say give it a try because it may work for you.  Me? I went back to plain Castor Oil from Tropic Isle Living Jamaican!!!</li>
            <li> i thought it  was going to smell like coconut and it didn&#x27;t smell like coconut was in it i thought it was going to be thick and dark like the castor oil but it fell and look water down. i &#x27;m just going to just stick to 100% castor oil and go and buy oil scent.wont be getting this no more.</li>
            <li> Great! Shipping was extremely fast! I received this oil way ahead of the estimated delivery time. The oil is great and has worked wonders for my hair and skin. Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Good product just smells like cigarette ashes but once you put it in your hair the smell tends to fade out.  It makes my hair thicker and helped with the itchness too.</li>
