    <ol>
            <li> The pigment bar is most effective when you start with a series of peels to jump start the process. The bar may burn the first few uses. It is long lasting and has kept my hyperpigmentation at bay. I also use the PCA phaze 13 pigment gel to keep the cell turnover going. I recommend this product as well as the PCA SPF 45 Sunscreen for optimal skin protection.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worst product I subjected my skin to!  My skin began to itch and I had break outs.  That was a first for me!  I&#x27;ll stick to Eminence Organics.  It&#x27;s gentle and it works for me.</li>
            <li> Been using this bar for several years and can always tell a difference when I switch to something else; my melasma is more prominent. Love it.</li>

            <li> I have bad eczema and it really helps when I have flare ups.  I jump in the shower and leave it in and I can feel the tingly.  My eczema always stops flaring up when I use this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a remarkable difference in my skin complexion since i started using it. It doesn&#x27;t happen right away, but over time the noticed will be visible. It also lasts a long time, ~6 months or more for me.</li>
