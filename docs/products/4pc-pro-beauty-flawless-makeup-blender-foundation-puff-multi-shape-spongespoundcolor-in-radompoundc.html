            <li>They are that great!</li>
            <li>Perfect for contouring</li>
            <li>But it is good if you want to try and see what a beauty blender will do before purchasing it!</li>
            <li>Great for the money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s great for applying mousse and cream based foundations.</li>
            <li>I was really happy with then thank you.</li>
            <li>Great product, I did not notice a difference between these and the $20 ones from Sephora.</li>
            <li>and they are a great price.</li>
            <li>But still a great tool</li>
            <li>Great Product, My Wife loves to use them every day.</li>
            <li>Loved these and the colors were great.</li>
            <li>good for applying makeup - took awhile for delivery though</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, awesome colors just as described</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with these</li>
            <li>but they still are very cute.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a nice product.</li>
            <li>I dont liked, and it doesnt work for me.</li>
            <li>Good  product  for a cheap price</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>and I Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>You need to make sure to pick the option of more.</li>
            <li>but for the price i guess it is ok</li>
            <li>There ok for their price</li>
            <li>Ok</li>
            <li>Regular sponge nothing impressive</li>
            <li>These beauty sponges are very nice colors and work very well with my makeup application.</li>
            <li>The blenders are very soft and help make foundation or contouring look great.</li>
            <li>They blended beautifully and I have gotten multiple comments on how well my makeup looks when I use these!</li>
            <li>personally think they&#x27;re great quality.</li>
            <li>They were certainly cheap, but in this case, I feel I did not even get what I paid for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it if a friend if they were looking for a cheap beauty blender</li>
            <li>I do recommend cleaning them first before your 1st use and misting them with water before your liquid foundation application, this helps limit the amount of product absorbed by the sponge and allows for more product and a more consistent application on your face.</li>
            <li>to be honest, it doesnt feel as soft as the original beauty blender...</li>
            <li>While the colors aren&#x27;t really important, they do come in fun colors.</li>
            <li>I love it and it works amazing for much less price.</li>
            <li>These are inexpensive and great for everyday makeup application.</li>
            <li>So there is supposed to be four right?</li>
            <li>And honestly I feel like these dry out my skin</li>
            <li>Very soft i will enjoy applying my highlight with them.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean with a little olive oil and dish washing detergent makeup comes right off it.</li>
            <li>but it does seem like it would hold a stain pretty well.</li>
            <li>Colors were dull not bright, but I&#x27;m sure they work awesome..</li>
            <li>Blends makeup really well and spread evenly.</li>
            <li>but otherwise they are reusable and very well designed.</li>
            <li>The product arrived and it was much more spongy than I expected.</li>
            <li>About a quarter of the size of a normal beauty blender!</li>
            <li>The color is indeed a bit lighter, the ones i got are baby blue and light pink</li>
            <li>I ran it under water and none of the old foundation seemed to come</li>
            <li>Cleaning them is easy as well, just don&#x27;t scrub to hard closer to the point because it will cause some of the sponge to peel off</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and I expected it to be dirty according to the older reviews, but it came fairly clean.</li>
            <li>The are small but not to small just right to where they fit in your makeup bag.</li>
            <li>if you put 4 of them together it will create one big Beauty Blender I feel like some kind of wasted my money on this because they&#x27;re so small</li>
            <li>This was my first time purchasing and using one of these little spongey guys.</li>

            <li> This was my first time purchasing and using one of these little spongey guys.</li>
            <li> Others have said that the more expensive version swells and expands when you get it wet.</li>
            <li> They are very small I tried wetting them hoping they get bigger real bummer.</li>
            <li> I have not tried the more expensive alternative so my view on this product is a little</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very minor-</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t take as long as expected!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little bit bigger than what I received in a four pack Boca Raton</li>
            <li> they could be a little larger.</li>
            <li> When wet they do not expand.</li>
            <li> I havent opened the other.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint -</li>
            <li> I got them WAY sooner than I was told (took less than a week).</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 sponges, and not only are they smaller than expected but they are a boring buff color -- not the pretty colors pictured.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t sometimes accepted and I thought they were going to be a little fingers with a really small usually people I want to I need to have bigger</li>
            <li> small</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really small</li>
            <li> These are reeeeally small and 2 came in the mail.</li>
            <li> Not very good for blending because of how hard they feel to your face.</li>
            <li> It was not smooth and it is very hard to wash the makeup out of it.</li>
            <li> The sponge material it was hard.</li>
            <li> They were very small.</li>
            <li> i was disappointed they took almost a month to arrive  later</li>
            <li> This makeup sponge does what it is supposed to do, however I feel it has false advertising.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just sad</li>
            <li> but it stinks.</li>
            <li> And they are very hard and smell horrible.</li>
            <li> I use one for my base color, one for highlighting and one for contouring.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I dont use this product.  It doesnt blend well at all and even has a foul smell.  I havent opened the other.  Would not recommend thos product.</li>
            <li> So there is supposed to be four right? Because I only received two</li>
            <li> The blenders are very soft and help make foundation or contouring look great. I got them WAY sooner than I was told (took less than a week). The only downside is that they are WAYYYY smaller than you would expect. About a quarter of the size of a normal beauty blender! But it is good if you want to try and see what a beauty blender will do before purchasing it!</li>
            <li> Great for the money. Didn&#x27;t take as long as expected!</li>

Others have said that the more expensive version swells and expands when you get it wet. This one does not expand at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried giving it a thorough washing yet but it does seem like it would hold a stain pretty well. I ran it under water and none of the old foundation seemed to come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for applying mousse and cream based foundations. For the price, I&#x27;d definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I received my sponges I was really happy with then thank you.</li>
            <li> I love these. I shared them with a friend and my mom. They are that great! I just reordered for myself.</li>
            <li> These are not like the beauty blender. When wet they do not expand. And honestly I feel like these dry out my skin</li>
            <li> Took forever to get here and they were tiny</li>

            <li> Absolutely love it. Blends so well. I&#x27;m just sad I didn&#x27;t notice I would get only 2. You need to make sure to pick the option of more. Would recommend to anyone. Very easy to clean with a little olive oil and dish washing detergent makeup comes right off it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really small but it&#x27;s a nice product.</li>

            <li> There ok for their price</li>

            <li> Ordered 2 sets, only received one, so have yet 4 months later to either receive a response or my items. And they are very hard and smell horrible. Not very good for blending because of how hard they feel to your face.</li>
            <li> They were very small.</li>
            <li> Colors were dull not bright, but I&#x27;m sure they work awesome..</li>
