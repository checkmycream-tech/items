            <li>, that is why I thought it would be a great gift.</li>

            <li>The Light it puts out is excellent, very bright and natural.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice weight to it.  </li>
            <li>I have to keep a folded up tissue between the mirror and the frame to keep it from swirling around on its own.  </li>
            <li>These products are the absolute best.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with this unit as a whole.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat the bright light</li>
            <li>It is lovely to look at.  </li>
            <li>I love this mirror.</li>
            <li>It has 5X magnification which is more desirable than 10X.</li>
            <li>I wanted to like this mirror more because I LOVE Ott Lights.  </li>
            <li>able to find until I searched Amazon.  </li>
            <li>otherwise it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>I actually love the color though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with the lighting on this mirror.</li>
            <li>I love, love , love it.</li>
            <li>The light portion of this mirror is great; however, the mirror itself just wants to spin on its axis.</li>
            <li>I was able to pluck more accurately.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is only on con, when I turn the light on, which the light seems nice, T can&#x27;t see my image very good.  </li>
            <li>I do own one and like it very much</li>
            <li>but this one works just fine.  </li>
            <li>large enough to do great makeup but also fits nicely into a suit case to take on a trip.</li>
            <li>and I still have fabulous mirrors.  </li>
            <li>Light weight and have non cons.</li>
            <li>i need to use another light and a more powerful magnification.</li>
            <li>The magnified side of the mirror isn&#x27;t very powerful.  </li>
            <li>The light on the mirror is a nice natural light.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the light it emits is very nice.</li>
            <li>This is a very sturdy and easy to use make-up mirror.  </li>
            <li>My first one was bought at a yard sale!</li>
            <li>I need to find someone that can help me figure out why I can&#x27;t see into the mirror very well when the light is on.</li>
            <li>It is important to me to see my hair-color and make-up in natural light.  </li>
            <li>Looks great on my vanity, but the lights are not real bright.  </li>
            <li>and I think it is closest to natural light</li>
            <li>But I have the same issue many others do: the mirror won&#x27;t stay in place.  </li>
            <li>But I am glad I only paid $26 for it at Tuesday Morning.</li>
            <li>This mirror is exactly what I have been looking for but haven&#x27;t</li>
            <li>My last make-up mirror lasted so many years</li>
            <li>I was going to buy from target online, but they went out of stock, so Amazon was the next cheapest place. :)</li>
            <li>I had been putting my makeup on under a fluorescent light for so many years, &amp; every time I walked outside, my makeup looked completely different.</li>
            <li>It really does what it says.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this mirror!</li>
            <li>The mirror itself is extremely very well made and sturdy.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be getting much when I ordered this.</li>
            <li>It illuminates my area very well while applying makeup.</li>
            <li>It only has one light setting, but it seems just right for me---not too harsh, yet bright enough for close-up work.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend, it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li>I love the dark pink&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I can sit down at my kitchen table and put on my makeup much more accurately than trying to do it in the bathroom where the lights are just never adequate.</li>
            <li>Now I can put on my make-up, do my hair in the light other&#x27;s see me in or turn off the lightening</li>
            <li>My previous mirror was too light and top heavy.  </li>
            <li>It is a little too easy and sometimes slips out of position.  </li>
            <li>If there is a Target near your location.</li>
            <li>Natural lightening.</li>
            <li>I can finally put on my makeup &amp; know that when I step outside, it&#x27;s going to look exactly like it did in the mirror.</li>
            <li>This make-up mirror was more that I intended to pay, but after some careful thought and reading reviews about this and other mirrors as well, I decided to spend the extra money.</li>
            <li>I was using a mirror I had bought at Dollar General...</li>
            <li>I think it was Dollar General.</li>
            <li>Also, the lower two inches below each of the bulbs are not lit because that is apparently where the sockets are.</li>
            <li>The light is white and clean without the awful yellow cast many lights give you.</li>
            <li>It is a deep pink with white details, very much like the photo.  </li>
            <li>If you are not sure if it is worth the extra money, it is, just go for it!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> This mirror is beautiful.  It is lovely to look at.  It has a nice weight to it.  I love the dark pink&lt;br /&gt;There is only on con, when I turn the light on, which the light seems nice, T can&#x27;t see my image very good.  This is the second mirror that I have had trouble with this.  I must be doing something wrong because I have read many reviews on these lighted mirrors and no one else has ever mentioned this.  I need to find someone that can help me figure out why I can&#x27;t see into the mirror very well when the light is on.</li>
            <li> Looks great on my vanity, but the lights are not real bright.  The magnified side of the mirror isn&#x27;t very powerful.  i need to use another light and a more powerful magnification.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for a Birthday gift.  I do own one and like it very much, that is why I thought it would be a great gift.</li>
            <li> I love these! My first one was bought at a yard sale! You can&#x27;t beat the bright light and I think it is closest to natural light so takes the guesswork out of makeup application!</li>
            <li> I love this mirror. It has 5X magnification which is more desirable than 10X. And my makeup looks perfect!</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this mirror more because I LOVE Ott Lights.  But I have the same issue many others do: the mirror won&#x27;t stay in place.  I have to keep a folded up tissue between the mirror and the frame to keep it from swirling around on its own.  Also, the lower two inches below each of the bulbs are not lit because that is apparently where the sockets are. Seems to me the sockets should have been embedded lower. Other than that, the light it emits is very nice. But I am glad I only paid $26 for it at Tuesday Morning.</li>
            <li> This mirror is exactly what I have been looking for but haven&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;been able to find until I searched Amazon.  The lighting is&lt;br /&gt;perfect and the magnification is great to put on makeup.</li>
            <li> large enough to do great makeup but also fits nicely into a suit case to take on a trip. The Light it puts out is excellent, very bright and natural.  Would definitely recommend, it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> The light portion of this mirror is great; however, the mirror itself just wants to spin on its axis. Needs tightening, and there is no way to do this. Therefore, I have had to wedge a cotton ball between the bottom edge of the mirror itself, and the bottom edge of its cradle to hold mirror still. Design flaw that needs to be corrected.</li>
            <li> The mirror does not stay in place when rotating it from one side to the other. otherwise it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> I had been putting my makeup on under a fluorescent light for so many years, &amp; every time I walked outside, my makeup looked completely different. So I tried a few different makeup mirrors with lights, &amp; didn&#x27;t see much of a difference. I ordered this one based on the great reviews of the \\&quot;ott-lite,\\&quot; &amp; I&#x27;m so glad I did! It really does what it says. I can finally put on my makeup &amp; know that when I step outside, it&#x27;s going to look exactly like it did in the mirror. And the magnified side is great for applying eyeliner &amp; mascara. I highly recommend this mirror!</li>
            <li> This make-up mirror was more that I intended to pay, but after some careful thought and reading reviews about this and other mirrors as well, I decided to spend the extra money. I am glad I did. This was the least expensive of the OTT-LITE items available so I bought it regardless of color.  I actually love the color though. It is a deep pink with white details, very much like the photo.  Lighting is everything when you are applying make-up. If it is not right you can leave the house, unknowingly, looking overly made up. You do not have to worry about that with this mirror.  The light is white and clean without the awful yellow cast many lights give you. The mirror itself is extremely very well made and sturdy. It is moveable and the mirror flips around to the 5x power close up mirror. I thought I needed  10x but this one works just fine.  My last make-up mirror lasted so many years and hopefully this one will too.  If you are not sure if it is worth the extra money, it is, just go for it! I Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this lighted mirror on 1/29/2012.  It&#x27;s now 5/30/2012.  I use this every day &amp; it&#x27;s still working great.  In four months, I&#x27;ve had no problems whatsoever.  It only has one light setting, but it seems just right for me---not too harsh, yet bright enough for close-up work. I use the magnification side of the mirror for applying eye makeup &amp; eyebrow plucking.&lt;br /&gt;I like the pink base w/white swirly design. It makes me feel like a girly girl!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be getting much when I ordered this. I was using a mirror I had bought at Dollar General... I think it was Dollar General. Anyways, when this came, you can immediately see the difference. I will try to take the best care to this mirror that I can. It is stronger than it looks in the picture... However, if you want to save a few bucks, I&#x27;d buy at Target. If there is a Target near your location. There isn&#x27;t for us, which is why I bought from Amazon. I was going to buy from target online, but they went out of stock, so Amazon was the next cheapest place. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with the lighting on this mirror. I turn off all my room lights, and just use those... it&#x27;s like when your at a make-up party and you can see all your blemishes... I was able to pluck more accurately.</li>
            <li> This is a very sturdy and easy to use make-up mirror.  My previous mirror was too light and top heavy.  No problems with this one.  My only complaint is the rotation of the mirror.  It is a little too easy and sometimes slips out of position.  I can&#x27;t find a way to tighten it up.  Still is the best mirror I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely upset.  The mirror is great if it would stay in place but it just spins.  It is defective and it is not returnable.  I wanted to exchange it but they will not let me.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup mirror! It illuminates my area very well while applying makeup. I can sit down at my kitchen table and put on my makeup much more accurately than trying to do it in the bathroom where the lights are just never adequate. The mirror is very good quality and I&#x27;ve had no problems with it.</li>
            <li> I love, love , love it. Natural lightening. Awesome quality!  These products are the absolute best.  I also had the floor lamp for cross-stitching, quilter&#x27;s, anyone.  Now I can put on my make-up, do my hair in the light other&#x27;s see me in or turn off the lightening and I still have fabulous mirrors.  It is important to me to see my hair-color and make-up in natural light.  Highly recommend this product. Light weight and have non cons.</li>
            <li> Our granddaughter (age 15 1/2) was thrilled with it - it looks great in her room.&lt;br /&gt;We have two Ott-lite lamps and know the value of good lighting.</li>
            <li> I bought the pink one. I like the color. The light on the mirror is a nice natural light. I am very happy with this unit as a whole. I am ordering another one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Ott Lites are the best lights on the market!  That is why I ordered this makeup mirror.  However, I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because there is an annoying issue regarding the mirror not staying in place.  There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a way to tighten it up.  What I did to remedy this was just place a couple of cardboard pieces on either side to hold it in place.  That does the trick for me, but the manufacturer should definitely address this.  Other than that, It is still a great makeup mirror.</li>
