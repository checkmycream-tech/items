            <li>The colors are nice but darker and not as pigmented as I hope .</li>

            <li>Very versatile and excellent quality.  </li>
            <li>Liked the quality of the liner but all the shades weren&#x27;t to my liking.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice look.</li>
            <li>I liked the colors</li>
            <li>But it would have been nice if they were inside a box or NYX package.</li>
            <li>Maybe Rose Brown.</li>
            <li>Loving these lip liners.</li>
            <li>am loving it</li>
            <li>The colors are true and are a beautiful compliment on my chocolate skin.</li>

            <li>They are just as good and the colors are very pretty on.</li>

            <li>i love these</li>
            <li>though NYX was top notch?</li>
            <li>I was looking for Mac pencils and ended up getting these instead, so glad I did.</li>
            <li>For me and my lips these were more of nude colors.</li>
            <li>I love these pencils and would buy them again.</li>

            <li>And I love the fact that there are so many shades to go with the many shades of lipstick I use.</li>
            <li>I am really pleased with the selection</li>
            <li>I love NYX products.</li>
            <li>Great deal, good basic colors, these pencils wear as well as most others I have purchased.</li>

            <li>Love it.</li>

            <li>Love the texture of the lip liners and the colors are great, but they are very alike</li>
            <li>and I was expecting for more variety</li>
            <li>Will Be Buying More, Just Reserved</li>

            <li>do sharpen easy aswell.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone who wants more fuller-looking lips and a more prominent color</li>
            <li>I also use them as eyeliner and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>The pencils are smooth and creamy, easy to put on.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love every color, however I&#x27;m new at the whole lip liner thing and these were great for practicing.  </li>
            <li>They blend pretty well and are very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Too light.</li>
            <li>Smooth consistency though.</li>
            <li>Great basic colors that can be used with just about any color of lip shade  </li>
            <li>since everyone raves over Nyx the color choices were too close and light for my tinted lips</li>

            <li>glides on smoothly, and the colours are supererb</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t like the colors as they were too light</li>

            <li>They also stay on well and go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Every color matches my coloring and goes on smoothly and stays on well.</li>
            <li>They glide on smooth and are a matte finish.</li>
            <li>Surprised and delighted with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>I love them so much I wish there was more product.</li>

            <li>The package came right away</li>
            <li>Love the colors, is smooth when you are putting on your lips, but I will prefer different colors too much brown.</li>
            <li>When sharpened, the point holds well, and have a nice consistency, not too dry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>I like the popular natural lip look but like a little more color with mine.</li>
            <li>and I will definitely by from this seller again&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this stuff!!</li>
            <li>I love all the different colors.</li>
            <li>These pencils are exactly what I needed and have hoped to get.</li>
            <li>NYX lip liners are my favorite brand; buying this a set saves about $5 versus buying them individually.</li>
            <li>they really are a steal!</li>
            <li>Im a big fan of NYX cosmetics, and I love thise lip liner pencils.  </li>
            <li>I am sure the others will look the same</li>
            <li>This is the second purchase of these exact lip liners and I am pleased with how they work, look and apply.  </li>
            <li>Product as described and fast shipment!</li>
            <li>They are very pigmented, long lasting and great shades for me.  </li>
            <li>Other then that they work well as a lip color all on their own.</li>
            <li>Color is light and can barely tell it is on.</li>
            <li>Not exactly that&#x27;s last longing but very nice colors</li>
            <li>They are very dry though so I always add a light gloss or rose bud salve and it lasts very long.</li>
            <li>I suggest putting on the pencil and then adding a balm on top of it before you put on your color, otherwise, it&#x27;ll dry out very soon.</li>
            <li>They are like MAC liners but soooo much cheaper</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They glide on smoothly, have lasting power, and keep your gloss or lipstick in place.</li>
            <li>Creamy and very pigmented.</li>
            <li>Really like them though.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on one lip liner, so I purchased this package of 6 and the price was extremely reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I really do like these, the color, the texture, and it tends to keep everything in place.  </li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I really like the range and shades to choose from.</li>
            <li>I really like the formula because it&#x27;s not too drying or &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>They are also reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Bought already another set, arrived fast</li>
            <li>Really like the pencils.</li>
            <li>Definitely could not wear alone this a clear gloss on top.</li>
            <li>The only one that I am able to wear is Soft Brown.</li>
            <li>I was happy to see the colors listed as I am pale and blonde.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are cheap but worth the price if you are a Nyx fan, I&#x27;ll stick to my other brands</li>
            <li>I would buy more of these in other colors anytime.</li>
            <li>I was given Soft Brown, Rose Brown, Brown Cafe, Brown, Dark Brown, and Nutmeg.</li>
            <li>The texture is good too, not too hard where it pulls on your lip and not too soft where it smears all over.</li>
            <li>but they are rather dry and sometimes do not go on smooth.</li>
            <li>Will definitely purchase more products in the future.</li>
            <li>I bought this set mainly</li>
            <li>Wish they were just a little more softer when you put them on your lips.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like most of the colors, doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li>i never can find the right colors in regular stores.</li>
            <li>They go on smooth and are comparable to more expensive liners.  </li>
            <li>They are very natural.</li>
            <li>After waiting exactly a week after they were said to be delivered, I recieved only 1 of the 6 colors listed.</li>
            <li>Its my first time trying nyx cosmetics, so far, not a big fan..</li>
            <li>Mega Shine Natural also works well with these lip liners.</li>
            <li>B002QXK4KK NYX Mega Shine Lip Gloss, Natural, 0.37 Ounce]]</li>
            <li>I received this in a short amount of time and was surprised by the low price when I first purchased.</li>
            <li>I am a woman of color, and at first I wasn&#x27;t sure about the lighter colors, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li>A very decent product is not super long lasting but last enough and more</li>
            <li>It is very pigmented and lasts very long.</li>
            <li>Also, they stay on for a long time and really help make my lips look more defined in a natural way due to the subtle colors.</li>
            <li>Overall, I like the quality and effect of the pencils I do have, but would&#x27;ve really preferred the other colors I wasn&#x27;t sent rather than the two Natural pencils--</li>
            <li>So unless you have money to burn or a bunch of judgemental friends that look down their noses on you if your not spending ridiculous amounts of money on brand name products, I would highly recommend getting better friends and switching to NYX.</li>
            <li>I was disappointed because in the picture, the liners look so different color wise, but when I got them, they all looked exactly the same.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t go as far as saying they are long lasting.</li>
            <li>These pencils are not long lasting at all.</li>
            <li>(if you have darker lips like me, you might have to apply a decent amount for it show properly), and quality is average.</li>
            <li>50% colors are good 50% are bad.</li>

            <li> The colors are nice but darker and not as pigmented as I hope .</li>
            <li> (Lip pencils should be a bit on the drier side to line, define and stay put, but this one has a nice texture.)</li>
            <li> Very versatile and excellent quality.  </li>
            <li> Liked the quality of the liner but all the shades weren&#x27;t to my liking.  </li>
            <li> It is a nice look.</li>
            <li> I liked the colors</li>
            <li> But it would have been nice if they were inside a box or NYX package.</li>

            <li> Nice colors and apply easily.</li>
            <li> They are just as good and the colors are very pretty on.</li>

            <li> though NYX was top notch?</li>

            <li> I love NYX products.</li>
            <li> Great deal, good basic colors, these pencils wear as well as most others I have purchased.</li>

            <li> The package came right away</li>
            <li> Love the colors, is smooth when you are putting on your lips, but I will prefer different colors too much brown.</li>
            <li> When sharpened, the point holds well, and have a nice consistency, not too dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you very much.</li>

            <li> These pencils are exactly what I needed and have hoped to get.</li>

            <li> They are very pigmented, long lasting and great shades for me.  </li>
            <li> Other then that they work well as a lip color all on their own.</li>
            <li> Color is light and can barely tell it is on.</li>
            <li> Not exactly that&#x27;s last longing but very nice colors</li>
            <li> They are very dry though so I always add a light gloss or rose bud salve and it lasts very long.</li>
            <li> I suggest putting on the pencil and then adding a balm on top of it before you put on your color, otherwise, it&#x27;ll dry out very soon.</li>
            <li> They are like MAC liners but soooo much cheaper</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They glide on smoothly, have lasting power, and keep your gloss or lipstick in place.</li>
            <li> Creamy and very pigmented.</li>
            <li> Really like them though.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on one lip liner, so I purchased this package of 6 and the price was extremely reasonable.  </li>
            <li> I really do like these, the color, the texture, and it tends to keep everything in place.  </li>
            <li> Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I really like the range and shades to choose from.</li>
            <li> I really like the formula because it&#x27;s not too drying or &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> They are also reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Bought already another set, arrived fast</li>
            <li> Really like the pencils.</li>
            <li> Definitely could not wear alone this a clear gloss on top.</li>
            <li> The only one that I am able to wear is Soft Brown.</li>
            <li> I was happy to see the colors listed as I am pale and blonde.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are cheap but worth the price if you are a Nyx fan, I&#x27;ll stick to my other brands</li>
            <li> I would buy more of these in other colors anytime.</li>
            <li> I was given Soft Brown, Rose Brown, Brown Cafe, Brown, Dark Brown, and Nutmeg.</li>
            <li> The texture is good too, not too hard where it pulls on your lip and not too soft where it smears all over.</li>
            <li> but they are rather dry and sometimes do not go on smooth.</li>
            <li> Will definitely purchase more products in the future.</li>
            <li> I bought this set mainly</li>
            <li> Wish they were just a little more softer when you put them on your lips.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like most of the colors, doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> i never can find the right colors in regular stores.</li>
            <li> They go on smooth and are comparable to more expensive liners.  </li>
            <li> They are very natural.</li>
            <li> After waiting exactly a week after they were said to be delivered, I recieved only 1 of the 6 colors listed.</li>
            <li> Its my first time trying nyx cosmetics, so far, not a big fan..</li>
            <li> Mega Shine Natural also works well with these lip liners.</li>
            <li> B002QXK4KK NYX Mega Shine Lip Gloss, Natural, 0.37 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> I received this in a short amount of time and was surprised by the low price when I first purchased.</li>
            <li> I am a woman of color, and at first I wasn&#x27;t sure about the lighter colors, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> A very decent product is not super long lasting but last enough and more</li>
            <li> It is very pigmented and lasts very long.</li>
            <li> Also, they stay on for a long time and really help make my lips look more defined in a natural way due to the subtle colors.</li>
            <li> Overall, I like the quality and effect of the pencils I do have, but would&#x27;ve really preferred the other colors I wasn&#x27;t sent rather than the two Natural pencils--</li>
            <li> So unless you have money to burn or a bunch of judgemental friends that look down their noses on you if your not spending ridiculous amounts of money on brand name products, I would highly recommend getting better friends and switching to NYX.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because in the picture, the liners look so different color wise, but when I got them, they all looked exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t go as far as saying they are long lasting.</li>
            <li> These pencils are not long lasting at all.</li>
            <li> (if you have darker lips like me, you might have to apply a decent amount for it show properly), and quality is average.</li>
            <li> 50% colors are good 50% are bad.</li>
            <li> I recently bought a bunch of sets of these NYX Long Lasting Slim Lip Liners.</li>
            <li> Really had a varity of colors but thought they were a little dry to line with.  </li>
            <li> The one I prob will use less is the pale pink because it&#x27;s a lil light for my skintone.</li>
            <li> They last a long time as well!</li>
            <li> They last like any other liners I&#x27;ve tried and do come off within the same amount of time as the others.</li>
            <li> These last longer than any other pencil I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> The texture is not all smoothe and feels dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too dry and not too creamy</li>
            <li> Instead of the set advertised here-- which includes six pencils: Coffee, Mahogany, Ever, Soft Brown, Pale Pink and Nude Beige--</li>
            <li> I received four of those colors (Coffee, Mahogany, Soft Brown, Pale Pink)</li>
            <li> Listed are Coffee, Mahogany, Ever, Soft Brown, Pale Pink, and Nude Beige.</li>
            <li> The only down side is</li>
            <li> My only problem is that it seems to dry out the lips a little bit but nothing balm or lip gloss can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> Thank you RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race for introducing me to the Nyx line of cosmetics.  </li>
            <li> I expected deeper browns.</li>
            <li> I have the brighter pink set as well.</li>
            <li> Arrived faster than expected.</li>
            <li> shipment came faster than expected and was well packaged.</li>
            <li> I had really never used a liner so I was not certain how they were to be.  </li>
            <li> Only the lightest among all of the colors that I don&#x27;t like because it looked pale on me.</li>
            <li> I recently read a review of NYX and found out that they don&#x27;t test on animals so that is a major bonus to me and to those poor animals.</li>
            <li> I use them with estee lauder lip stick and have absolutely no complaints!.</li>
            <li> I have used MAC and other department store makeups and frankly I don&#x27;t notice a difference except in price.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to get the other ones I got.</li>
            <li> but they are a little dry</li>
            <li> They are all too brown and dark for me.</li>
            <li> I knew they were browns when purchasing but seems a little dark for my complexion.</li>
            <li> Some are a little to on the brown side for my taste</li>
            <li> They are very dry and hard to go on.</li>
            <li> but they always leave my lips so dried out.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected but came a few days late</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve pale lips</li>
            <li> I am very pale, so I&#x27;ve had a hard time over the years finding shades that are terribly dark for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> I was a little wary about these liners because the price was so low</li>
            <li> they are a little hard to work with.</li>
            <li> pictures are a little hard to tell what you are going to be getting since everyone&#x27;s color on their phones, computers, ect..</li>
            <li> I find that to be a little wonky, as I would&#x27;ve preferred a notification of some sort that the order would not be fulfilled per the listing on Amazon.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> Some came broken and very hard to open.  </li>
            <li> And of course the price is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> but I am not happy with them.</li>
            <li> Got two mahogany unfortunately.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t receive the listed colors, very disappointed all of them are brownish colors not even one pink.</li>
            <li> These were very disappointing and I will not be buying anymore of them.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with these</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i love these I use them all the time! the colors are neutral ansd go with everything!</li>
            <li> I did not receive the colors listed in the product description or on the invoice.</li>
            <li> I want these liners in ever color possible ! They are like MAC liners but soooo much cheaper I def recommend ....I line my lips then shade them using lip liner only the finish is matte looks like I&#x27;m wearing lipstick and stay all day !</li>
            <li> For the price these are great lip liners!  I have more expensive ones but these work just as good and stay for hours!</li>
            <li> they are a little hard to work with. Wish they were just a little more softer when you put them on your lips.</li>
            <li> I received this in a short amount of time and was surprised by the low price when I first purchased. The colors are nice but darker and not as pigmented as I hope . I though NYX was top notch? Still, I will use them. Satisfied-ish. 😏</li>
            <li> Nice colors... Goes on easy but needs to be reapplied after eating and drinking like most liners and lipsticks... Pretty good bang for your buck too.</li>
            <li> I was looking for Mac pencils and ended up getting these instead, so glad I did. They are just as good and the colors are very pretty on. I have get lots of compliments on these. All the colors I wear, depending on my mood. Very nice colors, I put the pencils on and then just put my Covergirl lip gloss over it. The package came right away and I will definitely by from this seller again&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Some came broken and very hard to open.  These were very disappointing and I will not be buying anymore of them.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t go as far as saying they are long lasting. They last like any other liners I&#x27;ve tried and do come off within the same amount of time as the others. The colors you get are true to what is in the picture depending on who you order yours from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pictures are a little hard to tell what you are going to be getting since everyone&#x27;s color on their phones, computers, ect.. are going to vary. For me and my lips these were more of nude colors. They matched well with my Carmel skin and complemented my lip color very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are cheap but worth the price if you are a Nyx fan, I&#x27;ll stick to my other brands and I don&#x27;t think I will purchase these again.</li>
            <li> I like all of the lip liners they are very good lip liners and all the colors are nice I&#x27;m satisfied with my products</li>
            <li> These pencils go on smooth and the colors are so pretty! Also, they stay on for a long time and really help make my lips look more defined in a natural way due to the subtle colors. I love these pencils and would buy them again.</li>
            <li> I love these lip liners all of the colors are really nice!! a great deal</li>
            <li> Instead of the set advertised here-- which includes six pencils: Coffee, Mahogany, Ever, Soft Brown, Pale Pink and Nude Beige-- I received four of those colors (Coffee, Mahogany, Soft Brown, Pale Pink) and then two \\&quot;natural\\&quot; pencils in lieu of \\&quot;Ever\\&quot; and \\&quot;Nude Beige.\\&quot; I find that to be a little wonky, as I would&#x27;ve preferred a notification of some sort that the order would not be fulfilled per the listing on Amazon. Overall, I like the quality and effect of the pencils I do have, but would&#x27;ve really preferred the other colors I wasn&#x27;t sent rather than the two Natural pencils-- I already had that color. Now I have three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***This review refers specifically to the product as fulfilled by the seller BlueScandal***</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and lips are these are perfect.  I don&#x27;t love every color, however I&#x27;m new at the whole lip liner thing and these were great for practicing.  I use them with estee lauder lip stick and have absolutely no complaints!.</li>
            <li> I really love these Nyx products!  This is like the third or fourth time I have reviewed Nxy products this morning.  I am hooked!  Thank you RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race for introducing me to the Nyx line of cosmetics.  And thank you Amazon for selling it!  This is the third set of six liners I have bought and I am just thrilled with the quality of the products  So many colors to choose from...  They glide on smoothly, have lasting power, and keep your gloss or lipstick in place. Highly recommend this stuff!!</li>
            <li> NYX is an awesome brand, and these pencils are smooth &amp; true to color. Perfect neutral set.They last a long time as well!</li>
            <li> For the price of these lip liners, and the NYX quality. You can&#x27;t beat this deal. Love it, and use it a lot for my makeup kit!</li>
            <li> Love the colors, is smooth when you are putting on your lips, but I will prefer different colors too much brown.</li>
            <li> Super quick shipping than the estimated time, love these lip liners and I love using them as a primer for my lipsticks and glosses!</li>
            <li> Too light. I expected deeper browns. The texture is not all smoothe and feels dry. Definitely could not wear alone this a clear gloss on top.</li>
            <li> I did not receive the colors I was suppose to</li>
            <li> The set comes with colors I think anyone can wear.  They feel very nice on also, goes on smoothly ...</li>
            <li> And I love the fact that there are so many shades to go with the many shades of lipstick I use. Easy to sharpen and to apply. Looks great on. Very sexy if applied correctly. I do recommend this product if you are looking for something to enhance your lips.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like most of the colors, doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> I wanted a variety of lip liner colors and decided to purchase this one. I knew the brand, but hadn&#x27;t used it before. I am really pleased with the selection and I like the product.</li>
            <li> good price, good quality, beautiful colors, and nyx has one of the best liners, even better than high end ones</li>
            <li> I love NYX products. You cannot beat their prices. I have used MAC and other department store makeups and frankly I don&#x27;t notice a difference except in price. I recently read a review of NYX and found out that they don&#x27;t test on animals so that is a major bonus to me and to those poor animals. I find the quality of NYX products to be equal to department store makeup. So unless you have money to burn or a bunch of judgemental friends that look down their noses on you if your not spending ridiculous amounts of money on brand name products, I would highly recommend getting better friends and switching to NYX.</li>
            <li> These colors work with every lipgloss or lipstick. They even work good by themselves. Creamy and very pigmented. A good buy.</li>
            <li> Great deal, good basic colors, these pencils wear as well as most others I have purchased. When sharpened, the point holds well, and have a nice consistency, not too dry. (Lip pencils should be a bit on the drier side to line, define and stay put, but this one has a nice texture.)</li>
            <li> These are the best lip liners for women of color. They blend pretty well and are very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I purchased several sets of NYX cosmetics Slim Lip Liner Pencils for my grandaughters and daughter for Christmas. I included a set for myself too and I am very happy with the quality, packaging, and delivery of the product. I will want to keep up with this seller and buy more products!!!</li>
            <li> I knew they were browns when purchasing but seems a little dark for my complexion. Really like them though. Love NYX products, wish they sold them in my area. I have the brighter pink set as well. Really love those too.</li>
            <li> I dig them. Got two mahogany unfortunately. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for the chocolate skinned goddesses out there though. I&#x27;ve pale lips and they *just* show on mine. Smooth consistency though.</li>
            <li> I use them all , I love them great price not cheap lip liner , I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase .</li>
            <li> great pencils.  Arrived faster than expected. Very versatile and excellent quality.  I recommend all Nyx products for purchase. I plan to purchase the red set of pencils as well.  I think they give Mac some competition.</li>
            <li> I had never used a lip liner before but I&#x27;m reaching the age where my lipstick tends to bleed.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on one lip liner, so I purchased this package of 6 and the price was extremely reasonable.  I really do like these, the color, the texture, and it tends to keep everything in place.  Great basic colors that can be used with just about any color of lip shade  I am so happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I Ordered this months ago and I have enjoyed them so far. Some are a little to on the brown side for my taste but It doesnt take away the quality of the liners. Perfect for anyone with a more &amp;#34;Tan&amp;#34; complexion and loves to go neutral :-)</li>
            <li> Great quality cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I love all the different colors. I like to mix and match them with my lipsticks to create different shades. They go on really easily and last through most of the day. Also, a great deal for 6 pencils! I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Nice colors, not dry or chalky. Reasonably priced. These pencils are exactly what I needed and have hoped to get.</li>
            <li> This is a great liner. I love all the colors and you can&#x27;t beat the price. I say go for it.</li>
            <li> Liked the quality of the liner but all the shades weren&#x27;t to my liking.  I would buy this product individually next time, but the price of the pencils couldn&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t receive the listed colors, very disappointed all of them are brownish colors not even one pink.</li>
            <li> Okay, let&#x27;s get to it!&lt;br /&gt;I am not a make-up guru, Youtube Girl, or artist.&lt;br /&gt;I am just a girl in love with Make up.&lt;br /&gt;These colors are perfect, you can sharpen these pencils, meaning they last long...&lt;br /&gt;The lender was perfect, I had no trouble.&lt;br /&gt;These pencils came before the estimated date.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
            <li> These NYX Lip Liner are okay, color seems a bit lacking but are okay. This has no reflection on the seller(s). Maybe and maybe this batch may not be of the best quality.</li>
            <li> ♡I Ordered Nyx lip liners In a 6pack I just want to say I love Nyx and I really love the lip liners and I really have to say there shipping was supper fast!!!♡</li>
            <li> I love the liners and the colors.  Excellent value for the price.  I would recommend this product to anyone who uses these colors of lip sticks</li>
            <li> glad to be able to order color stock . i never can find the right colors in regular stores. this lipliner is great, long lasting and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> These are just as great as the high priced department store brands.</li>
            <li> My favorite. I use them all over my lips not just liners and they stay on forever and I get compliments on them always.</li>
            <li> This is a great collection of neutrals.  I really like the range and shades to choose from. Great value  for the price.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected but came a few days late but I think it&#x27;s cause it was around the holidays.</li>
            <li> I was a little wary about these liners because the price was so low but the quality is awesome! Love them</li>
            <li> Great set. Has awesome colors. Definitely a good buy. I would recommend it especially for the price and value of this product.</li>
            <li> These are great colors and I love these pencils. These last longer than any other pencil I&#x27;ve used and it&#x27;s easy to match the colors.</li>
            <li> but they are a little dry</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with these since everyone raves over Nyx the color choices were too close and light for my tinted lips</li>
            <li> Great product and variety for the price! And the shipping was super fast too!</li>
            <li> I love the look of lip stains but they always leave my lips so dried out. I recently bought a bunch of sets of these NYX Long Lasting Slim Lip Liners. These are my favorite shades. Ever is my very favorite. I love to line and fill my lips with Ever and then top it off with NYX Mega Shine Miami Babe. It is a nice look. I like the popular natural lip look but like a little more color with mine. These are now one of the best parts of my daily makeup routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have quit using lipstick and always use these liners with NYX lip gloss. [[ASIN:B005PKLS42 NYX Mega Shine Lip Gloss, Miami Babe, 0.37 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mega Shine Natural also works well with these lip liners. [[ASIN:B002QXK4KK NYX Mega Shine Lip Gloss, Natural, 0.37 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> I do like most NYX products and this one is awesome too. I really like the formula because it&#x27;s not too drying or &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34;. They are very pigmented, long lasting and great shades for me.  I am very pale, so I&#x27;ve had a hard time over the years finding shades that are terribly dark for everyday use.  And of course the price is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> A very decent product is not super long lasting but last enough and more&lt;br /&gt;that a normal lip liner , very nice colors , soft and easy to use I completely&lt;br /&gt;recommend this product and for sure come back for more</li>
            <li> Great color palette. NYX lip liners are my favorite brand; buying this a set saves about $5 versus buying them individually.</li>
            <li> easy on no pulling nice colors best lipliner I have had in a long time would buy again matches alot of my lipstick</li>
            <li> Saw the opportunity to purchase several NYX lip liners in sets of 6 and I took it.  They are great for lining the lips, using as a matte lipstick unless you mix colors and place lip gloss over or do an ombre look.  Also great for mixing with other lipsticks to create gorgeous colors.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;m bothering with a review with all the great ones already, except I was just so wowed by how great these pencils are, I had to ! The colors are ALL GREAT. And the QUALITY is great, too. I&#x27;m REALLY happy with them. Great value!</li>
            <li> Great products and even better value, I use these lip liners all the time. You get a great variety to wear during day and night. Plus NYX products are great with pigmentation so this set is definitely a steal. Will definitely purchase more products in the future.</li>
            <li> The pencils are good quality but they are rather dry and sometimes do not go on smooth. I suggest putting on the pencil and then adding a balm on top of it before you put on your color, otherwise, it&#x27;ll dry out very soon.</li>
            <li> I really like it and buy it again :)</li>
            <li> Great colors, they wear well and make my lipstick last much longer. Great price for a great product...they really are a steal! Love the neutrals and they go with any lipstick.</li>
            <li> I liked the colors but I am not happy with them. They are very dry and hard to go on. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Loved all these shades! this is a great and inexpensive brand. Colors are perfect for fall. or to pair with a smokey eyes</li>
            <li> If you are a lipstick lover like me then you will love this set. I love every shade of these lipliners. The one I prob will use less is the pale pink because it&#x27;s a lil light for my skintone. I&#x27;m sure i&#x27;ll find some use for it. All of these are great to put under lipsticks or glosses or worn alone!!</li>
            <li> All the colors are great and glide on smoothly. My only problem is that it seems to dry out the lips a little bit but nothing balm or lip gloss can&#x27;t fix. And of course, you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> glides on smoothly, and the colours are supererb</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like the colors as they were too light</li>
            <li> I love the colors. I also use them as eyeliner and it works just fine. I definitely would recommend to anybody.</li>
            <li> Not exactly that&#x27;s last longing but very nice colors</li>
            <li> Girls everyone love to over-line their lips, and this is the perfect lip pencil for that job! As long as you put a lot of layers you&#x27;re good to go for the day. It&#x27;s not too dry and not too creamy so it&#x27;s a perfect mix. Their color range is excellent for that Kylie Jenner lip color as well!</li>
            <li> They go on smooth and look great.  They are a good selection of colors that suit me and my needs.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> These are great for deeper skin tones who are looking for more natural/ neutral colors. They are very dry though so I always add a light gloss or rose bud salve and it lasts very long.</li>
            <li> Im a big fan of NYX cosmetics, and I love thise lip liner pencils.  They go on smooth and are comparable to more expensive liners.  I have about 20 of their pencils in all different shades.. these did no disappoint!</li>
            <li> I love these lip liners!! There are a perfect amount of shades to match all of my lipsticks and glosses. I recommend this product to anyone who wants more fuller-looking lips and a more prominent color</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors, very easy to apply. I would recommend this product to everyone. I would definatley purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I got it within 2 days... Fast and great service... And the lip liners are so smooth and creamy they go on great and last all day</li>
            <li> Excellent product worth the experience</li>
            <li> i love this product and its cheaper to buy here than to pay $3.50 for each pencil on the nyx website</li>
            <li> So happy everything came on time, not opened, packaged neatly and I WILL be buying more products !!!!!!!! !!!!!! !!!!!!</li>
            <li> Surprised and delighted with this purchase.  Pencils are really nice and of excellent quality.  Would order again.  Price excellent too!</li>
            <li> The colors are great.  The pencils are smooth and creamy, easy to put on. They work wonderfully with all the different color lipsticks I have.  They are also reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> very cheap. I guess you do get what you pay for. Color is light and can barely tell it is on. It wears off.</li>
            <li> Really had a varity of colors but thought they were a little dry to line with.  I had really never used a liner so I was not certain how they were to be.  As a starter iner they would be good.</li>
            <li> These pencils are not long lasting at all. However, I still like the quality and the colors. They are very natural.</li>
            <li> This is a great price for the number of products. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> shipment came faster than expected and was well packaged. Great colors for those neutral days. Can&#x27;t wait to use them!</li>
            <li> The colors in this listing, the colors listed on the invoice and the actual products I received were all different.</li>
            <li> These are great colours and I really have a colour for most occassions. They also stay on well and go on smoothly. would order again.</li>
            <li> thanks so much!!!! I love these lip liners! they do not bleed at all. very nice texture, i would recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> I loved all the colors u can use them without lipstic .it,s look like matte</li>
            <li> I did not receive the colors listed in the product description</li>
            <li> this set was made of nice, practical colors and the pencils are good quality. especially good value considering the affordable price.</li>
            <li> 50% colors are good 50% are bad. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Very Nice colors. Am very Satisfied!</li>
            <li> These lipliners are FAB!!  These colors are neutral but give just the perfect color of liner to my lips! I actually filled in my lip with the nude and just put gloss over and looked GREAT!  I am sure the others will look the same can&#x27;t wait to use each one!  And GREAT price!!!  A must have</li>
            <li> This is the second purchase of these exact lip liners and I am pleased with how they work, look and apply.  Also good value for the price.</li>
            <li> pencils seem to go on o.k and drawing is easier, thank you. all colours seem o.k.&lt;br /&gt;They do sharpen easy aswell.</li>
            <li> very smooth, very creamy and doesn&#x27;t bleed. I would buy more of these in other colors anytime. Very good product</li>
            <li> Excellent Lip Liners. soft and smooth, glides easily on my lips and the colors are awesome!!!! Bought already another set, arrived fast</li>
            <li> I am a woman of color, and at first I wasn&#x27;t sure about the lighter colors, but I was wrong. These incredible pencils allow my lipstick to stay in place and last all day without smudging.</li>
            <li> These are THE BEST lip liners, and I have tried some pretty pricey ones, but these beat all the rest hands down!!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome liners love them</li>
            <li> :) They are really nice colors and they stay on. I can&#x27;t wait to get the other ones I got. I hope to get them soon.</li>
            <li> I like these and you can&#x27;t be the price. Nice colors and apply easily. I just wished they lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I got these to play around with colors and they are wonderful!</li>
            <li> Love it. Beautiful smooth colours.</li>
            <li> I was on a budget and in a rush for some makeup, so ordered these as it was a good bargin. The colors are okay (if you have darker lips like me, you might have to apply a decent amount for it show properly), and quality is average. Its my first time trying nyx cosmetics, so far, not a big fan.. all in all nothing special..</li>
            <li> I bought this set mainly so I could get 2 of the 6 colors but when it arrived I found I loved all of them. The texture is good too, not too hard where it pulls on your lip and not too soft where it smears all over. Coffee is my favorite.</li>
            <li> These lip liners are amazing. They go on smooth and are true to color. The only down side is I love them so much I wish there was more product. Other then that they work well as a lip color all on their own. Buy them!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because in the picture, the liners look so different color wise, but when I got them, they all looked exactly the same. The picture is misleading, and if I had known they were all basically the same color, and not how they looked in the picture, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have purchased them. :/</li>
            <li> I just like ALL the colors. They are all what you need! and most colors used for every day and night. Neutral. But it would have been nice if they were inside a box or NYX package. I received them in a plastic ziplock bag.</li>
            <li> After waiting exactly a week after they were said to be delivered, I recieved only 1 of the 6 colors listed. Listed are Coffee, Mahogany, Ever, Soft Brown, Pale Pink, and Nude Beige. I was given Soft Brown, Rose Brown, Brown Cafe, Brown, Dark Brown, and Nutmeg. I was happy to see the colors listed as I am pale and blonde. The only one that I am able to wear is Soft Brown. Maybe Rose Brown. They are all too brown and dark for me. I ordered because of the colors listed. Had I known these were the colors I would not have purchased.</li>
            <li> Love the texture of the lip liners and the colors are great, but they are very alike and I was expecting for more variety</li>
            <li> Loving these lip liners. Great variety of color. They go on very nicely and stay on. Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> Really like the pencils.</li>
            <li> Great deal all the liners are great very neutral colors go on great.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful and pigmented. Only the lightest among all of the colors that I don&#x27;t like because it looked pale on me.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors&lt;br /&gt;I am loving it</li>
            <li> Product as described and fast shipment!</li>
            <li> I think I have used all but one of these.  Every color matches my coloring and goes on smoothly and stays on well.</li>
            <li> Will Be Buying More, Just Reserved This Product It Came Early GREAT BUY.&lt;br /&gt;  I RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> These liners are a  must have for any ladies collection. The colors are true and are a beautiful compliment on my chocolate skin. They glide on smooth and are a matte finish. I use them as a liner and for full lip coverage.Did I mention paying nine dollars was a steal?! Grab them while you can!!</li>
            <li> The price you pay for 6 of these is wonderful. I love the colors in this set. All very wearable neutrals that look great alone or paired with lipstick or lip gloss. For a slime pencil they&#x27;re pretty smooth and easy to apply. Lovely purchase.</li>
            <li> I love the colors. It is very pigmented and lasts very long. I have a habit of pealing my lips with my teeth and it still lasts afterwards. Even after eating the color is still there. I use the entire pencil as a lipstick and line my lips on the outside with the tan pencil to highlight and keep it from feathering. I think the brand is revlon for the other pencil which is also amazing!</li>
            <li> I love NYX make up. It&#x27;s inexpensive and made in Europe. These pencil liners can also replaced lipsticks but make sure to apply some lip conditioner before applying. They are matte.</li>
            <li> good lip liner. I would purchased again on those colors. and price is good too. and made in German products</li>
