            <li>I love coconut oil and this is a good one.  </li>
            <li>I could really go on with all the great things to use coconut oil for!</li>
            <li>I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>All thoughts are my own and have not been influenced.</li>
            <li>I was asked to review this product, all reviews are my own.</li>
            <li>While in the shower, I melt the coconut oil by running the jar under the warm water.</li>
            <li>It has a light pleasant odor of coconuts.  </li>
            <li>Some coconut oils have a very strong coconut flavor - which I like, but not in everything.</li>
            <li>Best coconut oil I have used so far!</li>
            <li>By far, this is one of best products I had ever try.</li>
            <li>Amazing how many things you can use this for.</li>
            <li>This jar is really quite incredible and versatile.  </li>
            <li>This one, though- is by far, the VERY BEST!  </li>
            <li>I love the coconut smell when we use it as a beauty aid and honestly, I cannot taste the coconut when I cook with it</li>
            <li>I bought this coconut oil with a promotional discount but would have gladly paid full price because it has been great for my family.</li>
            <li>This conconut oil is great, container is just the right size</li>
            <li>The jar is really awesome too because it&#x27;s the perfect size to reuse for a homemade lotion or hair gel or seasoning or smoothie mix or probably a million other things I can&#x27;t think of right now.  </li>
            <li>That is the best and only kind to use in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It helps with itchy bug bites, it can lighten age spots, makes an amazing massage oil, and you can dilute essential oils in it as a wonderful carrier oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a lovely fresh coconut aroma and has been really great in a pan for cooking.</li>
            <li>it melts beautifully and ready to apply.</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell good, but it truly does taste good too!</li>
            <li>It melted quickly!!</li>
            <li>Very smooth in texture without any grainy presence.</li>
            <li>The coconut taste is very light.</li>

            <li>the All Natural Wonder oil is easily the best we&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>This coconut oil is very high quality and a great value.</li>
            <li>I love coconut oil for all</li>
            <li>The core is still solid but the outer edge and top are crisco-like, perfect!  </li>

            <li>I think it would help make my cookies even more amazing.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I will tell you one of my favorite uses.</li>
            <li>My favorite use for coconut oil is to use the oil as a hair mask.</li>
            <li>It adds a pleasant taste as it has a smooth sweet flavor.</li>
            <li>Luckily I was able to snag this stuff when it was on sale to that made the deal even better!</li>
            <li>That will be the most exciting thing in the world if it does!!</li>
            <li>No worries about what chemicals I am putting on myself or my kids because this is the good pure stuff!</li>
            <li>This particular brand is great.  </li>
            <li>quickly blend in my magic bullet - and voila!  </li>
            <li>but I wanted to offer some solid feedback, the oil itself was not messy, the jar sealed perfectly and the oil was great, Id recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have used lots of coconut oils and I have never had one I loved as much as this one!</li>
            <li>but i know and have seen first hand from friends and loved ones that it does work.</li>
            <li>This #1 Best Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil by All Natural Wonder is very nice.  </li>
            <li>It is also wonderful for dry skin.</li>
            <li>The jar comes with a screw top lip that makes for easy opening and closing for storage.</li>
            <li>and I love how easily it rubs in.</li>
            <li>The smell right away is delicious and smells so pure and clean.  </li>
            <li>This is a all natural, great smell, with so many functional uses.</li>
            <li>My skin is glowing and clean!</li>
            <li>LOVE this huge jar of coconut oil.  </li>
            <li>and I love the light coconut smell he has</li>
            <li>When I received my oil, I was so surprised and happy with the size jar I received.</li>
            <li>I figure as I use it I will warm up the rest to get the right consistency, but I don&#x27;t want to over melt the outer edges.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth, is great for personal use, cooking, etc.  </li>
            <li>I even noticed my hand nails making it look strong without any nail application.</li>
            <li>, I came home and most of it was the right consistency!  </li>
            <li>At first the texture kind of freaked me out</li>
            <li>I love coconut oil and use it for A LOT of things:  for my hair, before shampooing as a pre-conditioner; and after for shine, for cooking, as a health supplement, and as a moisturizer, alone, or in a home made body butter recipe I make that my friends &amp; family love so much that they beg me for more.  </li>
            <li>Hands down this is the best coconut oil I have ever used!!</li>
            <li>Very happy that this is an all natural product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Once you have it around the house, you&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s great for pretty much everything.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it while pregnant with my son to prevent stretch marks, and when my son was a baby as a diaper cream that was safe with cloth diapers.</li>
            <li>This oil is far more mellow, which gives it a lot more options!</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li>I have read that adding a teaspoon of salt will reduce the strong coconut flavor if you don&#x27;t want a strong sweet taste to your food.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I have to say that I am super excited about this one!</li>
            <li>Which means I was super excited to receive a discount code for this!</li>
            <li>and this coconut oil has been a huge help with the cracking.</li>
            <li>I have used the cheap coconut oil that you buy at Wal-Mart, but NOTHING compares to this stuff.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and gentle, not fragrant or overpowering like some I have smelled before.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gluten free, non gmo, and vegan.</li>
            <li>I have heard that coconut oil is fantastic</li>
            <li>In addition to keeping her skin smooth and moist it appears to help her psoriasis lesions too.</li>
            <li>Happy with every aspect of the product including texture, scent plus its multiple uses.</li>
            <li>I received this with a promotional coupon and in my humble opinion is one of the best coconut oils out there.</li>
            <li>After application, my skin feels silky and smooth - without being greasy.</li>
            <li>That is important to our family.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money for this product for sure</li>
            <li>Being that it is unrefined, this coconut oil does have the light scent/taste of coconut.  </li>
            <li>We have tried the coconut oil in a couple of recipes now and the results have been fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Its light to cook with</li>
            <li>(they looked better the next day and she loved the novelty of using this instead of chapstick) and to remove Jamberry nails.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is organic and has just the right amount of coconut flavor/scent without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>Has a very slight and wonderful smell.</li>
            <li>My original plan was for moisturizing, but when I saw the cooking uses, I tried it with frying eggs, I was so surprised how good it was.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly and even though it is oil, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be &#x27;greasy&#x27; which I like that very much.</li>
            <li>We use coconut oil for so many things, so when I received a coupon code for this, I was excited to order it right away.</li>
            <li>a clean smooth feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for stir frying and instead of butter and sugar on rice...</li>
            <li>the chance came to order this large container at such a great discounted price, I couldn’t pass up the opportunity and I am so glad that I ordered it.  </li>

            <li>I like to use my oil as a butter substitute with cooking, and it works great as a moisturizer for dry cracked skin from the winter weather.</li>
            <li>AND it is great on dry heels.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for oral health, either as a pre-brush plaque loosener (swish around about a teaspoon for at least 5 minutes, spit then brush) or as an ingredient in your own homemade toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>The source for the oil is wonderful and pure and I now prefer this brand over my other one I have been using.</li>
            <li>it is a great value, I&#x27;ve used it in my daughter&#x27;s dry hair (go away tangles!)</li>
            <li>So far a little warm coconut oil has been the best and will be my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; method in the future for sure!</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve used it in chocolate chip cookies (seriously AMAZING), as lip balm for my kindergartner</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of product to get a good covering so this container will last a while.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product when looking for a good quality coconut oil.</li>
            <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels really soothing on chapped lips, and I love mixing coconut oil with avocado, and banana for an intensive hair conditioner.</li>
            <li>But mostly, I really like to use this healthy oil in cooking.  </li>
            <li>It answers all your questions and they show you the full label.</li>
            <li>Like I said, I use it for everything, so when I was able to purchase it at a promotional price I was tempted to buy out the whole store&#x27;s supply.  </li>
            <li>It adds such a nice light flavor, and I don&#x27;t have to feel any guilt at all about using oil.</li>
            <li>It melts quickly and evenly.</li>
            <li>I filled  bowl with hot tap water and put the jar in it and went out for the day, not expecting it to work.  </li>
            <li>he has chaffed skin or sore cracked lips, I love knowing that it is all natural and perfectly safe and actually very beneficial for him.  </li>
            <li>It is such a great product and beneficial to overall health in so many ways.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this as it was highly recommended by a friend of mine, so I bought myself a jar</li>

            <li>I also used this coconut oil on a rash on my baby daughter&#x27;s neck and it cleared it right up.</li>
            <li>and I started using it right away.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite ways to use this All Natural Wonder Organic Extra Virgin Unrefined coconut oil is to spread it on toast and top with some honey.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice subtle flavor that can be neutralized by stronger flavors (when you need to add a good healthy fat) or accentuated with other flavors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this and was so excited to purchase at a promotional price.</li>

            <li>This is a great organic raw coconut oil!</li>
            <li>I was about to contact the seller when my friend suggested soaking it in hot water.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see how many different uses</li>
            <li>I also use it in place of vegetable oil for my cooking, not only does it make things taste better</li>
            <li>First I opened it and smelled it.</li>
            <li>The first thing that I noticed is that it is more solid than an oil.</li>
            <li>I have jumped into the many uses of coconut oil recently, so when I saw that I could get this with a coupon, I grabbed it.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the tip internet!</li>
            <li>At first, I did not like how the product look once it made it to my home, and I contacted customer service.</li>
            <li>I will order more in the future...</li>
            <li>Later that evening her hands looked fabulous!  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a quality product I highly recommend this one!!</li>
            <li>We have been using coconut oil for a while now for so many different things.</li>
            <li>Coconut oil in general is pretty much a miracle product with so many uses and</li>
            <li>bathroom jar definitely get replaced more often though.  </li>
            <li>You can never have too much coconut oil in your life!</li>

            <li>I have no affiliation with the company at all, and I am not required to leave a positive review.</li>
            <li>As you might gather, I have tried many brands of unrefined cold pressed organic extra virgin coconut oil, so for me to say I am very impressed with this brand</li>
            <li>Has great health benefits without the chemicals used in all the other products in the stores for the same function.</li>
            <li>It really keeps your mouth feeling clean longer, and naturally whitens my teeth.</li>

            <li>A lot of other coconut oils I&#x27;ve used claim to be organic, but didn&#x27;t have the USDA certified stamp which is pretty important to me!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of using coconut oil &amp; I&#x27;ve used lots of different kinds.  </li>
            <li>It has made my hair look amazing too even during the harsh winter months.</li>
            <li>I have used it lightly in my hair as a deep conditioner...</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so much healthier.</li>
            <li>The consistency had a lot more coconut than expected, which I turned out to love!&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I really like it now that I&#x27;ve gotten used to it.</li>
            <li>This is really versatile stuff.  </li>
            <li>This is the real deal!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am very picky about my coconut oil</li>
            <li>I recently had to go dairy free, so I use it in cooking instead of butter.</li>
            <li>You can also use it straight.</li>
            <li>I also really like how well it worked to condition my leather couches.</li>

            <li>And my teeth really do feel cleaner after.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always careful to make sure it&#x27;s organic and</li>
            <li>I use coconut oil for EEEEEEVERYTHING, and when you use so much you</li>
            <li>This brand is far and above our favorite.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much safer and works just as good if not better!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that it works really well on my dry skin, but it&#x27;s easy to dress up into a scented sugar scrub version as well.  </li>
            <li>He has super dry skin and applying this right after a bath really seems to help.</li>
            <li>Compared to other &amp;#34;bulk store product brands&amp;#34;, this is so much better.</li>
            <li>the best for my body recipes due to the creamy texture and subtle smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes, you will find coconut oil cheaper on your grocery or big box shelf but be sure to pay attention to the quality because there are clear differences that set this one apart and make it worth the extra couple dollars!</li>
            <li>I have tried some coconut oil in the past for cooking and this one is amazing.</li>
            <li>I have tried it to fry sweet potatoes, make popcorn, mixed with sugar for a scrub and</li>
            <li>and it really makes seafood taste great its not at all like other cooking oil which is heavy and can taste greasy.</li>
            <li>I love this product my hair is less frizzy shiny and healthier.</li>
            <li>Love this, but got another premium organic virgin coconut oil for a lot less money, and cannot tell the difference.</li>
            <li>We have tried many different brands with different results.  </li>
            <li>Tomorrow I plan on whipping up coconut oil body wash using mild baby soap and essential oils.  </li>
            <li>One of the main things we use it for is cooking.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it for my son&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to get their coupon during a promotion</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying THIS brand of coconut oil.</li>
            <li>I use it in cooking as a flavorful oil with a high smoke point.</li>
            <li>High quality organic is a MUST.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this</li>
            <li>Using this one, All Natural Wonder Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, to battle my continously dry skin on myi knees has been amazing.</li>
            <li>, I would even pay a little more for it over its competitors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this coconut oil as a mouthwash for nearly 2 weeks straight and have noticed that my mouth feels &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; and</li>
            <li>I try to use at least a tablespoon a day, for overall health, plus it really keeps my skin in good shape.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using coconut oil around the house for a few months now but was out so decided to order online (free, two day shipping, yay!)</li>
            <li>I normally apply it once I get out of the shower</li>
            <li>I found this coconut oil to be very smooth, much smoother than the other brands I&#x27;ve used on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>There is pretty much no end to the things you can do with coconut oil, and I love being able to offer it to my kids for various skin issues and know I&#x27;m not slathering them in artificial ingredients.</li>
            <li>I do use a new disposable spoon each time I remove some from the jar though, so as not to contaminate the product.</li>
            <li>My new fave organic coconut oil.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good quality oil, my complaint is I found several pieces of cellophane throughout it.</li>
            <li>was running low on the coconut oil I had on hand, and I happened to find a promotional code for this one (which was exactly the type of coconut oil I wanted), so I decided to try this new to me brand.  </li>
            <li>The fact that this one actually carries the USDA organic seal, gives me the piece of mind that this product is exactly what it claims to be.</li>
            <li>I took the oil, and rubbed it on my leg and arms just like I would with lotion, twice the first day and then twice the second day.</li>
            <li>All Natural Wonder delivers for all my needs!  </li>
            <li>No harsh chemicals going into/onto your body!</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and smells divine!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how that&#x27;s possible since you would think coconut oil is pretty much going to be the same, but for whatever reason I find that it&#x27;s absorbed into my skin better and left me with nicer smelling</li>
            <li>I have been an unrefined cold pressed organic extra virgin coconut oil user for almost 3 years now, and I was VERY excited to be asked to review this All Natural Wonder coconut oil, please note all opinions I express here are my own.  </li>
            <li>I first heard about the benefits of coconut oil sometime early last year</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t ever use any other kind of oil other than butter.</li>
            <li>product may cost a tiny bit more than other similar products and size but the couple of extra dollars is worth it, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>This is my preference as it means it is as pure as possible.  </li>
            <li>, I personally don&#x27;t mind a little coconut flavor, I love it.</li>
            <li>Also, I definitely appreciate this coconut oil&#x27;s texture directly out of the container, because I am known to grab a spoonful and eat it straight up.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so soft after using this coconut oil.</li>
            <li>I use the oil in my coffee every day to create a natural frothy deliciousness.  </li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so soft now.  </li>
            <li>The hair soaks the oil up completely and does not feel greasy at all.</li>
            <li>So far I used it as a face moisturizer and does not leave face greasy and does not break out the skin</li>
            <li>, my ends of my hair are so soft and my scalp is not itchy any longer.  </li>
            <li>My hair came out  soft  and conditioned.  </li>
            <li>I have tried lotions that just didn&#x27;t work anywhere near as well</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve used this in cooking, coffee, on toast, and on my skin.</li>
            <li>This one was much smoother and &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling than the one we currently use.  </li>
            <li>and it goes far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this on my 4 month old daughter&#x27;s dry scalp and it has really helped!</li>
            <li>I have been doing Whole30 for the past few months- and a big part of it is making sure to eat enough healthy fat.  </li>
            <li>I actually like the All Natural Wonder brand better than the last two that I bought because I feel like the smell stays a little longer.  </li>
            <li>Just last night I used it instead of my normal EVOO and my family</li>
            <li>I have course, naturally curly, thick hair and it helps for a really good conditioner a few times a week.  </li>
            <li>Also, I enjoy applying it to my chapped lips and other dry spots on my body.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that my skin is much softer and I have not had problems this winter with dry scaly skin, I also do not feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it straight for bath oil, to soften my cuticles, around my nails to prevent hangnails, as lip balm to soften and moisturize my winter-dry lips, and on my heels and elbows to soften and moisturize dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I use it very frequently in my home for lots of different things.</li>
            <li>I use coconut oil for so many things, but sometimes finding a good high quality organic raw option can be difficult in a small town.</li>
            <li>I did major research on coconut oil</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s huge and will last a LONG time as you really need very little for your face.</li>
            <li>while oil pulling, it doesn&#x27;t really have a distinct flavor or bad taste, it is really easy to use.</li>
            <li>Again, it had a delicate texture and light flavorful taste.</li>
            <li>I am currently using it on my baby&#x27;s skin in hopes it will help clear up her eczema.</li>
            <li>Organic, unrefined, extra virgin is always a must when I am purchasing coconut oil and All Natural Wonder fits all of these.  </li>
            <li>I purchased a jar of organic extra virgin coconut oil from \\&quot;All Natural Wonder\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>The naturally organic oils seem to last longer on my knees and heels.  </li>
            <li>, you only need a little, it melt quickly in your hand.  </li>
            <li>My 6 year old won&#x27;t usually eat coconut oil right off the spoon, but she had no issue with this one.</li>
            <li>I whipped a half cup of it until it was soft and fluffy, then added lime essential oil to make my own coconut and lime hand lotion that I usually have to spend a fortune to buy, and I mixed it in equal parts with organic honey to use for a deep oil treatment for my hair which is soft and so very shiny today!  </li>
            <li>After just one application it has really smoothed out those rough spots on my elbows!</li>
            <li>and you can use it on the skin as a lotion, a homemade deodorant, a gentle makeup remover, and a treatment for acne due to its anti-fungal properties.</li>
            <li>I put it in my hair and left it in for 2 hours and my hair feels like it had a professional deep condition treatment</li>
            <li>I’ve also been taking a tablespoon daily as well for general health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the list is endless and every time I do an Internet search for coconut oil, I find something new to try it on!  </li>
            <li>When it came, it was a solid, but when I put a small bit on my finger, it immediately melted and had a fresh smell of coconut.  </li>
            <li>I use coconut oil in pretty much every room of my house, so I need a pure, cold pressed oil.  </li>
            <li>I wash my hands frequently during the winter, (I am a healthcare provider) and my knuckles are very dry.</li>

            <li> I love coconut oil and this is a good one.  </li>
            <li> I could really go on with all the great things to use coconut oil for!</li>
            <li> I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> All thoughts are my own and have not been influenced.</li>
            <li> I was asked to review this product, all reviews are my own.</li>
            <li> While in the shower, I melt the coconut oil by running the jar under the warm water.</li>
            <li> It has a light pleasant odor of coconuts.  </li>
            <li> Some coconut oils have a very strong coconut flavor - which I like, but not in everything.</li>
            <li> Best coconut oil I have used so far!</li>
            <li> By far, this is one of best products I had ever try.</li>
            <li> Amazing how many things you can use this for.</li>
            <li> This jar is really quite incredible and versatile.  </li>
            <li> This one, though- is by far, the VERY BEST!  </li>
            <li> I love the coconut smell when we use it as a beauty aid and honestly, I cannot taste the coconut when I cook with it</li>
            <li> I bought this coconut oil with a promotional discount but would have gladly paid full price because it has been great for my family.</li>
            <li> This conconut oil is great, container is just the right size</li>
            <li> The jar is really awesome too because it&#x27;s the perfect size to reuse for a homemade lotion or hair gel or seasoning or smoothie mix or probably a million other things I can&#x27;t think of right now.  </li>
            <li> That is the best and only kind to use in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It helps with itchy bug bites, it can lighten age spots, makes an amazing massage oil, and you can dilute essential oils in it as a wonderful carrier oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a lovely fresh coconut aroma and has been really great in a pan for cooking.</li>
            <li> it melts beautifully and ready to apply.</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell good, but it truly does taste good too!</li>
            <li> It melted quickly!!</li>
            <li> Very smooth in texture without any grainy presence.</li>
            <li> The coconut taste is very light.</li>
            <li> received All Natural Wonder CO during a promotional period and I am thrilled with it!!  </li>
            <li> the All Natural Wonder oil is easily the best we&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> This coconut oil is very high quality and a great value.</li>
            <li> I love coconut oil for all</li>
            <li> The core is still solid but the outer edge and top are crisco-like, perfect!  </li>
            <li> I have used many brands, this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I use it to cook mostly, I love the way it smells, and tastes in my food.</li>
            <li> I was able to purchase this during a promotional period, so I jumped on it.</li>
            <li> On top of that, my niece, who is attending beauty school, was over for Christmas and saw it on the counter and put some in her hair.  </li>
            <li> I have been buying more organic</li>
            <li> Thanks to a great deal on this oil I was able to try it out.</li>
            <li> My family uses coconut oil for many things.  </li>
            <li> This is probably my most favorite purchase aside from kindle off of Amazon.</li>
            <li> There are really SO many uses for coconut oil.  </li>
            <li> It is so beneficial in so many ways.  </li>
            <li> so I know I am getting the best benefits that I can possibly get from coconut oil.  </li>
            <li> and I am so glad that I tried this brand.  </li>
            <li> and I love all of the benefits it provides.  </li>
            <li> I love using it on my child anytime</li>
            <li> :) I also have been using this to cook.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this product all around.</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I could tell the difference immediately over most conditioners I would use typically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> That will be the most exciting thing in the world if it does!!</li>
            <li> No worries about what chemicals I am putting on myself or my kids because this is the good pure stuff!</li>
            <li> This particular brand is great.  </li>
            <li> quickly blend in my magic bullet - and voila!  </li>
            <li> but I wanted to offer some solid feedback, the oil itself was not messy, the jar sealed perfectly and the oil was great, Id recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used lots of coconut oils and I have never had one I loved as much as this one!</li>
            <li> but i know and have seen first hand from friends and loved ones that it does work.</li>
            <li> This #1 Best Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil by All Natural Wonder is very nice.  </li>
            <li> It is also wonderful for dry skin.</li>
            <li> The jar comes with a screw top lip that makes for easy opening and closing for storage.</li>
            <li> and I love how easily it rubs in.</li>
            <li> The smell right away is delicious and smells so pure and clean.  </li>
            <li> This is a all natural, great smell, with so many functional uses.</li>
            <li> My skin is glowing and clean!</li>
            <li> LOVE this huge jar of coconut oil.  </li>
            <li> and I love the light coconut smell he has</li>
            <li> When I received my oil, I was so surprised and happy with the size jar I received.</li>
            <li> I figure as I use it I will warm up the rest to get the right consistency, but I don&#x27;t want to over melt the outer edges.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very smooth, is great for personal use, cooking, etc.  </li>
            <li> I even noticed my hand nails making it look strong without any nail application.</li>
            <li> , I came home and most of it was the right consistency!  </li>
            <li> At first the texture kind of freaked me out</li>
            <li> I love coconut oil and use it for A LOT of things:  for my hair, before shampooing as a pre-conditioner; and after for shine, for cooking, as a health supplement, and as a moisturizer, alone, or in a home made body butter recipe I make that my friends &amp; family love so much that they beg me for more.  </li>
            <li> Hands down this is the best coconut oil I have ever used!!</li>
            <li> Very happy that this is an all natural product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Once you have it around the house, you&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s great for pretty much everything.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it while pregnant with my son to prevent stretch marks, and when my son was a baby as a diaper cream that was safe with cloth diapers.</li>
            <li> This oil is far more mellow, which gives it a lot more options!</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> I have read that adding a teaspoon of salt will reduce the strong coconut flavor if you don&#x27;t want a strong sweet taste to your food.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I have to say that I am super excited about this one!</li>
            <li> Which means I was super excited to receive a discount code for this!</li>
            <li> and this coconut oil has been a huge help with the cracking.</li>
            <li> I have used the cheap coconut oil that you buy at Wal-Mart, but NOTHING compares to this stuff.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice and gentle, not fragrant or overpowering like some I have smelled before.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gluten free, non gmo, and vegan.</li>
            <li> I have heard that coconut oil is fantastic</li>
            <li> In addition to keeping her skin smooth and moist it appears to help her psoriasis lesions too.</li>
            <li> Happy with every aspect of the product including texture, scent plus its multiple uses.</li>
            <li> I received this with a promotional coupon and in my humble opinion is one of the best coconut oils out there.</li>
            <li> After application, my skin feels silky and smooth - without being greasy.</li>
            <li> That is important to our family.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money for this product for sure</li>
            <li> Being that it is unrefined, this coconut oil does have the light scent/taste of coconut.  </li>
            <li> We have tried the coconut oil in a couple of recipes now and the results have been fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Its light to cook with</li>
            <li> (they looked better the next day and she loved the novelty of using this instead of chapstick) and to remove Jamberry nails.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is organic and has just the right amount of coconut flavor/scent without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> Has a very slight and wonderful smell.</li>
            <li> My original plan was for moisturizing, but when I saw the cooking uses, I tried it with frying eggs, I was so surprised how good it was.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly and even though it is oil, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be &#x27;greasy&#x27; which I like that very much.</li>
            <li> We use coconut oil for so many things, so when I received a coupon code for this, I was excited to order it right away.</li>
            <li> a clean smooth feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for stir frying and instead of butter and sugar on rice...</li>
            <li> the chance came to order this large container at such a great discounted price, I couldn’t pass up the opportunity and I am so glad that I ordered it.  </li>

            <li> I like to use my oil as a butter substitute with cooking, and it works great as a moisturizer for dry cracked skin from the winter weather.</li>
            <li> AND it is great on dry heels.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for oral health, either as a pre-brush plaque loosener (swish around about a teaspoon for at least 5 minutes, spit then brush) or as an ingredient in your own homemade toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> The source for the oil is wonderful and pure and I now prefer this brand over my other one I have been using.</li>

            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels really soothing on chapped lips, and I love mixing coconut oil with avocado, and banana for an intensive hair conditioner.</li>
            <li> But mostly, I really like to use this healthy oil in cooking.  </li>
            <li> It answers all your questions and they show you the full label.</li>
            <li> Like I said, I use it for everything, so when I was able to purchase it at a promotional price I was tempted to buy out the whole store&#x27;s supply.  </li>
            <li> It adds such a nice light flavor, and I don&#x27;t have to feel any guilt at all about using oil.</li>
            <li> It melts quickly and evenly.</li>

            <li> Has great health benefits without the chemicals used in all the other products in the stores for the same function.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of using coconut oil &amp; I&#x27;ve used lots of different kinds.  </li>
            <li> It has made my hair look amazing too even during the harsh winter months.</li>
            <li> I have used it lightly in my hair as a deep conditioner...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so much healthier.</li>
            <li> The consistency had a lot more coconut than expected, which I turned out to love!&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I really like it now that I&#x27;ve gotten used to it.</li>
            <li> This is really versatile stuff.  </li>
            <li> This is the real deal!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am very picky about my coconut oil</li>
            <li> I recently had to go dairy free, so I use it in cooking instead of butter.</li>
            <li> You can also use it straight.</li>
            <li> I also really like how well it worked to condition my leather couches.</li>

            <li> I use coconut oil for EEEEEEVERYTHING, and when you use so much you</li>
            <li> This brand is far and above our favorite.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much safer and works just as good if not better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that it works really well on my dry skin, but it&#x27;s easy to dress up into a scented sugar scrub version as well.  </li>
            <li> He has super dry skin and applying this right after a bath really seems to help.</li>
            <li> Compared to other &amp;#34;bulk store product brands&amp;#34;, this is so much better.</li>
            <li> the best for my body recipes due to the creamy texture and subtle smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, you will find coconut oil cheaper on your grocery or big box shelf but be sure to pay attention to the quality because there are clear differences that set this one apart and make it worth the extra couple dollars!</li>
            <li> I have tried some coconut oil in the past for cooking and this one is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have tried it to fry sweet potatoes, make popcorn, mixed with sugar for a scrub and</li>
            <li> and it really makes seafood taste great its not at all like other cooking oil which is heavy and can taste greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this product my hair is less frizzy shiny and healthier.</li>
            <li> Love this, but got another premium organic virgin coconut oil for a lot less money, and cannot tell the difference.</li>
            <li> We have tried many different brands with different results.  </li>
            <li> Tomorrow I plan on whipping up coconut oil body wash using mild baby soap and essential oils.  </li>
            <li> One of the main things we use it for is cooking.</li>
            <li> I mainly use it for my son&#x27;s eczema.</li>

            <li> Using this one, All Natural Wonder Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, to battle my continously dry skin on myi knees has been amazing.</li>
            <li> , I would even pay a little more for it over its competitors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this coconut oil as a mouthwash for nearly 2 weeks straight and have noticed that my mouth feels &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; and</li>
            <li> I try to use at least a tablespoon a day, for overall health, plus it really keeps my skin in good shape.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using coconut oil around the house for a few months now but was out so decided to order online (free, two day shipping, yay!)</li>
            <li> I normally apply it once I get out of the shower</li>
            <li> I found this coconut oil to be very smooth, much smoother than the other brands I&#x27;ve used on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> There is pretty much no end to the things you can do with coconut oil, and I love being able to offer it to my kids for various skin issues and know I&#x27;m not slathering them in artificial ingredients.</li>
            <li> I do use a new disposable spoon each time I remove some from the jar though, so as not to contaminate the product.</li>
            <li> My new fave organic coconut oil.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good quality oil, my complaint is I found several pieces of cellophane throughout it.</li>
            <li> was running low on the coconut oil I had on hand, and I happened to find a promotional code for this one (which was exactly the type of coconut oil I wanted), so I decided to try this new to me brand.  </li>
            <li> The fact that this one actually carries the USDA organic seal, gives me the piece of mind that this product is exactly what it claims to be.</li>
            <li> I took the oil, and rubbed it on my leg and arms just like I would with lotion, twice the first day and then twice the second day.</li>
            <li> All Natural Wonder delivers for all my needs!  </li>
            <li> No harsh chemicals going into/onto your body!</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and smells divine!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how that&#x27;s possible since you would think coconut oil is pretty much going to be the same, but for whatever reason I find that it&#x27;s absorbed into my skin better and left me with nicer smelling</li>
            <li> I have been an unrefined cold pressed organic extra virgin coconut oil user for almost 3 years now, and I was VERY excited to be asked to review this All Natural Wonder coconut oil, please note all opinions I express here are my own.  </li>
            <li> I first heard about the benefits of coconut oil sometime early last year</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t ever use any other kind of oil other than butter.</li>
            <li> product may cost a tiny bit more than other similar products and size but the couple of extra dollars is worth it, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> This is my preference as it means it is as pure as possible.  </li>
            <li> , I personally don&#x27;t mind a little coconut flavor, I love it.</li>
            <li> Also, I definitely appreciate this coconut oil&#x27;s texture directly out of the container, because I am known to grab a spoonful and eat it straight up.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so soft after using this coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I use the oil in my coffee every day to create a natural frothy deliciousness.  </li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so soft now.  </li>
            <li> The hair soaks the oil up completely and does not feel greasy at all.</li>
            <li> So far I used it as a face moisturizer and does not leave face greasy and does not break out the skin</li>
            <li> , my ends of my hair are so soft and my scalp is not itchy any longer.  </li>
            <li> My hair came out  soft  and conditioned.  </li>
            <li> I have tried lotions that just didn&#x27;t work anywhere near as well</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used this in cooking, coffee, on toast, and on my skin.</li>
            <li> This one was much smoother and &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling than the one we currently use.  </li>
            <li> and it goes far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my 4 month old daughter&#x27;s dry scalp and it has really helped!</li>
            <li> I have been doing Whole30 for the past few months- and a big part of it is making sure to eat enough healthy fat.  </li>
            <li> I actually like the All Natural Wonder brand better than the last two that I bought because I feel like the smell stays a little longer.  </li>
            <li> Just last night I used it instead of my normal EVOO and my family</li>
            <li> I have course, naturally curly, thick hair and it helps for a really good conditioner a few times a week.  </li>
            <li> Also, I enjoy applying it to my chapped lips and other dry spots on my body.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my skin is much softer and I have not had problems this winter with dry scaly skin, I also do not feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it straight for bath oil, to soften my cuticles, around my nails to prevent hangnails, as lip balm to soften and moisturize my winter-dry lips, and on my heels and elbows to soften and moisturize dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I use it very frequently in my home for lots of different things.</li>
            <li> I use coconut oil for so many things, but sometimes finding a good high quality organic raw option can be difficult in a small town.</li>
            <li> I did major research on coconut oil</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s huge and will last a LONG time as you really need very little for your face.</li>
            <li> while oil pulling, it doesn&#x27;t really have a distinct flavor or bad taste, it is really easy to use.</li>
            <li> Again, it had a delicate texture and light flavorful taste.</li>
            <li> I am currently using it on my baby&#x27;s skin in hopes it will help clear up her eczema.</li>
            <li> Organic, unrefined, extra virgin is always a must when I am purchasing coconut oil and All Natural Wonder fits all of these.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a jar of organic extra virgin coconut oil from \\&quot;All Natural Wonder\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The naturally organic oils seem to last longer on my knees and heels.  </li>
            <li> , you only need a little, it melt quickly in your hand.  </li>
            <li> My 6 year old won&#x27;t usually eat coconut oil right off the spoon, but she had no issue with this one.</li>
            <li> I whipped a half cup of it until it was soft and fluffy, then added lime essential oil to make my own coconut and lime hand lotion that I usually have to spend a fortune to buy, and I mixed it in equal parts with organic honey to use for a deep oil treatment for my hair which is soft and so very shiny today!  </li>
            <li> After just one application it has really smoothed out those rough spots on my elbows!</li>
            <li> and you can use it on the skin as a lotion, a homemade deodorant, a gentle makeup remover, and a treatment for acne due to its anti-fungal properties.</li>
            <li> I put it in my hair and left it in for 2 hours and my hair feels like it had a professional deep condition treatment</li>
            <li> I’ve also been taking a tablespoon daily as well for general health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the list is endless and every time I do an Internet search for coconut oil, I find something new to try it on!  </li>
            <li> When it came, it was a solid, but when I put a small bit on my finger, it immediately melted and had a fresh smell of coconut.  </li>
            <li> I use coconut oil in pretty much every room of my house, so I need a pure, cold pressed oil.  </li>
            <li> I wash my hands frequently during the winter, (I am a healthcare provider) and my knuckles are very dry.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve pretty much totally replaced both lotion and chapstick with this, and a little bit goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used about 4 other organic extra virgin coconut oil brands and so far I like this one</li>
            <li> In cooking or baking smoothness of a coconut oil does not matter as much (because when warmed the coconut oil goes to liquid), but since I use coconut oil for many personal uses as well as cooking (i.e., for skin moisturizer, for oil pulling, in homemade toothpaste, as a base in homemade essential oil salves, etc.)</li>
            <li> and while I am not usually a huge fan of coconut, the flavor is very subtle and I can barely notice it and in fact, food seems to taste so much better using it to sautee in etc.</li>
            <li> *need* good quality, organic, unrefined, cold pressed oil!  </li>
            <li> I mean, really!</li>
            <li> My friends and family have been recommending coconut oil to me for years, but I&#x27;ve never tried it until I found a coupon code for this brand which is 100% extra virgin, cold pressed, organic, unrefined AND top premium grade</li>
            <li> I love that this brand is organic, unrefined and cold pressed.</li>
            <li> Not much content left to use.</li>
            <li> So this week I went even further and started mixing it with other ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to try this out!</li>
            <li> I have extremely frizzy coarse hair.</li>
            <li> The other half of the oil I used instead of diaper rash cream for my 19 month old.</li>
            <li> A must have if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I apply every morning after my shower and the dry scales do not appear throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Within hours the dry skin/rash was gone!  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I have tried many brands here on Amazon, usually basing me decision on cost and reviews.</li>
            <li> Also, the smell that the coconut oil gives off when it is cooking and the slight taste it adds to any dish are definitely a bonus.</li>
            <li> I separated about half out into a different container</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin in the winter</li>
            <li> My elbows, heels, cuticles  get very dry and just a dime size amount of this coconut oil does the trick.</li>
            <li> I get very dry skin</li>
            <li> I have made these dishes before but this time it had a little different flavor and it was a hit!!</li>
            <li> I have purchased a few different brands of Coconut Oil over the last year and always have a hard time with it not actually smelling like coconut.  </li>
            <li> I use this everyday multiple times a day.</li>
            <li> So I have tried quite a few different kinds.  </li>
            <li> Then, after shampooing, I apply a generous amount of the oil onto the wet strands and twist my hair into a bun.</li>
            <li> It was kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> Crazy but fun!  </li>
            <li> My nose has been raw from being sick and this coconut oil has been amazing.</li>
            <li> Note that a little bit goes a LONG way.  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said I do recommend buying two.</li>
            <li> Coconut oil is extremely versatile and I would be lost without it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy any other.  </li>
            <li> Looking forward to trying other things.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands</li>
            <li> The possibilities are endless.  </li>
            <li> I did not try any of the other benefits of the oil other than cooking.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> The options are endless for this coconut oil from using it as a supplement, moisturizer or just to cook and bake with.</li>
            <li> We fried up some potatoes and sausage the other day with this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other brands at the grocery store and none can come close in comparison.</li>
            <li> I have used other coconut oils and always thought &amp;#34;one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a massage therapist, so I encounter a lot of oils in my work including other brands of coconut oil.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my baby, my hair, my feet and my other two kids get rubbed down with it also.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and is not the slightest bit greasy, unless you overdo it, which may not be a bad thing if you have severely dry skin like myself.</li>
            <li> After years of trying with other products I wish I would&#x27;ve spent less money and gone this route instead!</li>
            <li> Personally, I use coconut oil for moisturizing my skin, as lip balm, cleaning my teeth (oil pulling-swish a small amount in your mouth for 10-30 minutes in the morning), conditioning my hair, cooking (subtle flavor that can be masked with stronger flavors), baking (adds just a bit of sweetness), and polishing the wood furniture (mixed with lemon) in my house!  </li>
            <li> It is pretty chilly where we live, so the oil is solid, and having to try to pry some out of a container with a narrow opening is very frustrating.</li>
            <li> The flavor is neutral and not super overpowering.  </li>
            <li> the slight flavor of coconut makes it seems easier to do.  </li>
            <li> I used it on a rash, on my heels and for every little itch and irritation my kids have.  </li>
            <li> A little bit on my arms after my shower</li>
            <li> i just take a little and rub it between my hands to soften/melt it, then massage it into my hair and cover with a plastic shower cap while it does its job.</li>
            <li> Other things we use coconut oil for is cleaning the house, cooking and for tooth paste just to name  a few!</li>
            <li> I have had a thyroid issue for many years and the two worst things about the issue is dry skin and scalp.  </li>
            <li> I wasted my money on this</li>
            <li> I usually have both refined and unrefined coconut oil around (refined doesn&#x27;t have the coconut scent or slight flavor that the unrefined has).  </li>
            <li> I can even eat this plain and by itself without any problem.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a strong odor, so it won&#x27;t leave you smelling like you&#x27;ve lathered yourself up in tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li> NOT true!</li>
            <li> I use it everyday after my shower for my skin (including my face) and I place a small amount in my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still learning to cook with it, but when I do, it has a subtle flavor to it and does not overpower other flavors.</li>
            <li> No more.</li>
            <li> (I usually just put mine in with my popcorn)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> What I can tell you is that within a day I usually have a rash on my face</li>
            <li> I love coconut oil because there are an insane amount of uses for this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Usually I use coconut oil for 4 days or so and then have to do a day of Desitin.</li>
            <li> I could probably write a small book on all the ways you can use coconut oil, but I&#x27;ll let you look up all the uses online.</li>
            <li> When you use it so much, and know it&#x27;s health benefits, you look for organic, unrefined, cold pressed oil!  </li>
            <li> After waiting so long to try it, I&#x27;ve gone a little bit crazy.  </li>
            <li> Organic, unrefined, raw!</li>
            <li> and it was STILL hard as a rock.  </li>
            <li> and you can hardly see it anymore.</li>
            <li> Add a little sugar and it&#x27;s like a cappuccino at home!!</li>
            <li> This unrefined cold pressed organic extra virgin coconut oil is going to be a staple in our home.</li>
            <li> I then let it sit for at least fifteen minutes before rinsing.</li>
            <li> I mean come on, you can eat it, cook with it, use it for a moisturizer, use it in your hair, and the list continues.</li>
            <li> The coconut flavor is subtle which can be helpful when used for cooking.</li>
            <li> and on my crazy dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It seriously has 101 uses and then some.  </li>
            <li> Seriously...</li>
            <li> also use it for skincare and given we are dealing with very dry and cold temperatures this winter in Texas</li>
            <li> This stuff arrived hard as a rock!  </li>
            <li> instead of hunting down organic, unrefined cold pressed oil.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has approximately 1000 uses - from coffee, to sauteeing, spreading on your toast, hand cream, softening your cracked heels, oil pulling, lip balm, hair conditioner, make up remover, and more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a very subtle coconut flavor.</li>
            <li> The hubby didn&#x27;t even complain about the very subtle lemony coconut smell.  </li>
            <li> my 7 year old daughter had terrible dry skin on her hand from the frigid weather.  </li>
            <li> Chicago winters are very harsh on our skin, often causing painful cracks around the finger tips.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been skeptical to try it.</li>
            <li> I figured maybe it was cold where it came from</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it dangerous in any way, just disconcerting.</li>
            <li> I promise you will not be disappointed using this Organic Coconut oil!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Has a very slight and wonderful smell. I love coconut oil for all it&#x27;s therapeutic values and I use it in my face and body as well as for cooking. I got this one specifically for my face and body. It&#x27;s huge and will last a LONG time as you really need very little for your face. It is solid and melts at around 76 degrees so I just scrape a bit off and as soon as i start warming it up with my hands/fingers it melts beautifully and ready to apply. Love it!</li>
            <li> Best coconut oil I have used so far!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!!! F&lt;br /&gt;Super fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> This coconut oil product is very good. The coconut flavor is subtle which can be helpful when used for cooking. It is also wonderful for dry skin. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the review you need to read before buying.  This stuff arrived hard as a rock!  I figured maybe it was cold where it came from (it wasn&#x27;t here!)  so I let it sit on my nightstand for 5 days and it was STILL hard as a rock.  I was about to contact the seller when my friend suggested soaking it in hot water.  I filled  bowl with hot tap water and put the jar in it and went out for the day, not expecting it to work.  Well surprise surprise, I came home and most of it was the right consistency!  The core is still solid but the outer edge and top are crisco-like, perfect!  I figure as I use it I will warm up the rest to get the right consistency, but I don&#x27;t want to over melt the outer edges.  So get it- it is a great value, I&#x27;ve used it in my daughter&#x27;s dry hair (go away tangles!) and on my crazy dry skin.  I used it on a rash, on my heels and for every little itch and irritation my kids have.  No worries about what chemicals I am putting on myself or my kids because this is the good pure stuff!</li>
            <li> I use coconut oil for so many things! I have used many brands, this is one of my favorites. I use it to cook mostly, I love the way it smells, and tastes in my food. I try to use at least a tablespoon a day, for overall health, plus it really keeps my skin in good shape. I use it topically as a moisturizer, especially on the elbows, and heels. I was able to purchase this during a promotional period, so I jumped on it. I have used it lightly in my hair as a deep conditioner...LOVED IT!! It added a lot of shine too. I also use it as a kind of mouthwash. It really keeps your mouth feeling clean longer, and naturally whitens my teeth. By far though, I love to cook with it. It adds such a nice light flavor, and I don&#x27;t have to feel any guilt at all about using oil. It has such a low melting point.....its not an artery clogger! Two thumbs up!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible!  I have used the cheap coconut oil that you buy at Wal-Mart, but NOTHING compares to this stuff. It is a wonderful product. I have very dry skin in the winter and so this stuff is like a miracle in a jar. My skin is so soft after using this coconut oil. I was very excited to try this as it was highly recommended by a friend of mine, so I bought myself a jar and I am so thrilled that I did. The smell is nice and gentle, not fragrant or overpowering like some I have smelled before. The consistency is silky, not clumpy. It goes on very smoothly and even though it is oil, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be &#x27;greasy&#x27; which I like that very much. And the amount of uses for this stuff is nothing short of amazing. I mean come on, you can eat it, cook with it, use it for a moisturizer, use it in your hair, and the list continues. I absolutely love and appreciate the fact that it is completely organic. It&#x27;s gluten free, non gmo, and vegan. And it&#x27;s backed with a money back guarantee!!! I will be recommending this to all of my friends. This is a must have. This is worth its weight in gold and the price is astonishing for this product!!! I am super happy with this superior coconut oil. I can&#x27;t wait to see how many different uses I can get out of this awesome stuff!!!</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT product in so many ways!  I decided to buy some coconut oil after seeing my brother cook with it.  He said it was one of the ways he controlled his cholesterol.  Since I love the flavor (and the smell), I also decided to season my new cast iron skillet with it.  On top of that, my niece, who is attending beauty school, was over for Christmas and saw it on the counter and put some in her hair.  She said this oil smelled incredible, so I&#x27;ll be getting her a jar of her own!</li>
            <li> I have heard that coconut oil is fantastic but I&#x27;ve been skeptical to try it. I have been buying more organic so this was my next step. Thanks to a great deal on this oil I was able to try it out. I use it as a lotion for my daughter and me. I rub it on our eczema spots and by the next morning they&#x27;re almost gone. I also use it as cream in my coffee. 1 tsp in brewed coffee then I blend it in my bullet and it gives a great foam at the top. Add a little sugar and it&#x27;s like a cappuccino at home!! So delicious and very good for you!! I also use it in place of vegetable oil for my cooking, not only does it make things taste better but it&#x27;s so much healthier. I will be buying this from now on!!</li>
            <li> My family uses coconut oil for many things.  We cook with it, use it for moisturizer, put it in coffee and smoothies.  We have tried many different brands with different results.  This brand is far and above our favorite.  The smell right away is delicious and smells so pure and clean.  It holds up to heat well and melts like a dream.  The flavor is neutral and not super overpowering.  This will become a staple in our house.</li>
            <li> This is probably my most favorite purchase aside from kindle off of Amazon. This is my go to stuff for just about anything. My face was literally scaling off. I would have skin flakes everywhere. No more. I use this everyday multiple times a day. I use it on my baby, my hair, my feet and my other two kids get rubbed down with it also. I do oil pulling with this and I&#x27;m not a crunchy mom either. I cook with it, I wiped the edges of my windshield wipers with it. I have used it on my leather seats. This stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li> I ordered this coconut oil as part of a promotion for my opinion. My coconut oil arrived safety sealed and well packaged. I purchased the oil during a promotion period. period. I like to use my oil as a butter substitute with cooking, and it works great as a moisturizer for dry cracked skin from the winter weather. It smells great and tastes delicious! This coconut oil is great quality - smooth and creamy :) I recommend to anyone that is looking for a great organic superfood!</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in LOVE with this stuff! I have been hearing about coconut oil for a while now and thinking about trying it out.  I&#x27;ve been told that organic and unrefined is the way to go, so when I came across this product I was eager to purchase.  So far I&#x27;ve used it in chocolate chip cookies (seriously AMAZING), as lip balm for my kindergartner (they looked better the next day and she loved the novelty of using this instead of chapstick) and to remove Jamberry nails.  I sell Jamberry so I&#x27;m always looking for the best way to remove them without damaging your nails.  So far a little warm coconut oil has been the best and will be my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; method in the future for sure! This brand is great and the label is gorgeous too... great product design.  I&#x27;m a customer for life!</li>
            <li> This coconut oil is wonderful!! There are really SO many uses for coconut oil.  It is so beneficial in so many ways.  This particular brand is great.  It is a a great quality and great tasting coconut oil.  I love that it is all natural and organic so I know I am getting the best benefits that I can possibly get from coconut oil.  I have used it for oil pulling, moisturizer, and to cook with all with amazing results.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this coconut oil!!!!  I received this with a coupon and I am so glad that I tried this brand.  I have been using coconut oil for about six months now and I love all of the benefits it provides.  Organic, unrefined, extra virgin is always a must when I am purchasing coconut oil and All Natural Wonder fits all of these.  I use it everyday after my shower for my skin (including my face) and I place a small amount in my hair. I have noticed that my skin is much softer and I have not had problems this winter with dry scaly skin, I also do not feel greasy.  My hair is much more manageable and is not dry and brittle.  I use the oil in my coffee every day to create a natural frothy deliciousness.  I have replaced butter in my kitchen and I use coconut oil to cook all of my items in my skillet that require oil, I also use it as a substitute for oil products when baking.  I love using it on my child anytime he has chaffed skin or sore cracked lips, I love knowing that it is all natural and perfectly safe and actually very beneficial for him.  All in all this coconut oil has exceeded my expectations I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how amazing this product is. I first heard about the benefits of coconut oil sometime early last year and when I got the chance to get this product as a promotion, I jumped on it. I have used it in my hair, on my eczema, on my daughter&#x27;s diaper rash, I have even used it to cook instead of butter or vegetable oil. It arrived on time and in a much larger jar than I anticipated. The jar comes with a screw top lip that makes for easy opening and closing for storage. I highly recommend trying THIS brand of coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Hands down this is the best coconut oil I have ever used!! I use this for everything. I wash my face with this coconut oil every night then reapply as a moisturizer. My skin is glowing and clean! My son has eczema and after his bath a slather him up. He loves that his skin feels so moisturizer and I love the light coconut smell he has :) I also have been using this to cook. Just last night I used it instead of my normal EVOO and my family loved the slight fruity taste it added. I have used lots of coconut oils and I have never had one I loved as much as this one! I got this on promotion and have become a lifetime buyer!</li>
            <li> This is the best coconut oil ever! The consistency had a lot more coconut than expected, which I turned out to love!&lt;br /&gt;My mother also loves it. She takes spoonfuls every day to get her daily nutrition. (I usually just put mine in with my popcorn)&lt;br /&gt;I have not yet tried to use this product in my hair, but i fully intend to!&lt;br /&gt;Great buy!!!</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this product all around. I bought this coconut oil with a promotional discount but would have gladly paid full price because it has been great for my family. I use it every day for oil pulling. At first the texture kind of freaked me out but I really like it now that I&#x27;ve gotten used to it. I like that while oil pulling, it doesn&#x27;t really have a distinct flavor or bad taste, it is really easy to use. I also used this coconut oil on a rash on my baby daughter&#x27;s neck and it cleared it right up. My oldest son has some eczema so I decided to try this coconut oil instead of his prescription cream and it worked wonderfully. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a great quality coconut oil!</li>
            <li> Wow.  This is really versatile stuff.  My friends and family have been recommending coconut oil to me for years, but I&#x27;ve never tried it until I found a coupon code for this brand which is 100% extra virgin, cold pressed, organic, unrefined AND top premium grade, I decided it was finally time!  I have to admit I haven&#x27;t tried it for cooking yet, but I&#x27;ve been having a lot of fun testing it out on everything else.  In the beginning, I had to get used to the feel/texture of it.  When it came, it was a solid, but when I put a small bit on my finger, it immediately melted and had a fresh smell of coconut.  Crazy but fun!  After waiting so long to try it, I&#x27;ve gone a little bit crazy.  I&#x27;ve used it straight for bath oil, to soften my cuticles, around my nails to prevent hangnails, as lip balm to soften and moisturize my winter-dry lips, and on my heels and elbows to soften and moisturize dry skin.  All of these worked great.  So this week I went even further and started mixing it with other ingredients.  I whipped a half cup of it until it was soft and fluffy, then added lime essential oil to make my own coconut and lime hand lotion that I usually have to spend a fortune to buy, and I mixed it in equal parts with organic honey to use for a deep oil treatment for my hair which is soft and so very shiny today!  I even had a couple of strangers comment on my hair today!  Tomorrow I plan on whipping up coconut oil body wash using mild baby soap and essential oils.  I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to try this out!</li>
            <li> I got a promotional discount to try this coconut oil and I was thrilled! I use coconut oil daily whether it&#x27;s cooking or my beauty routine. It&#x27;s the best moisturizer for your face, skin and hair! It it great for cooking, sautéing, baking etc as well. I love that this brand is organic, unrefined and cold pressed. That is the best and only kind to use in my opinion. This coconut oil will not disappoint. This is quite a big jar that will last me awhile. As other reviewers have said I do recommend buying two. I keep one in my bathroom for my skin and another in my kitchen for strictly cooking use.</li>
            <li> This coconut oil is perfect. The consistency is solid but malleable enough to melt with the just the touch of your fingertips. It absorbs quickly and is not the slightest bit greasy, unless you overdo it, which may not be a bad thing if you have severely dry skin like myself. My elbows, heels, cuticles  get very dry and just a dime size amount of this coconut oil does the trick. Excellent ingredient for home made scrubs. This coconut is so smoothing to the touch and smells wonderful. My skin has never looked better. I was so excited to receive this with a promotional coupon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of using coconut oil &amp; I&#x27;ve used lots of different kinds.  I was delighted to get this on a deal &amp; give it a try!  I have to say this is a great product.  It&#x27;s very smooth, is great for personal use, cooking, etc.  it tastes great &amp; works great!  This is definitely a brand I will buy again!  Awesome oil!</li>
            <li> Not much content left to use. Contents liquified. Jar Lid - Cracked; spilled inside box!</li>
            <li> I &amp;#60;3 coconut oil and use it every day.  When you use it so much, and know it&#x27;s health benefits, you look for organic, unrefined, cold pressed oil!  This is the real deal!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put one tsp in my coffee every morning - along with a dash of cinnamon, some stevia, and a touch of honey - quickly blend in my magic bullet - and voila!  Creamy, frothy, deliciousness!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has approximately 1000 uses - from coffee, to sauteeing, spreading on your toast, hand cream, softening your cracked heels, oil pulling, lip balm, hair conditioner, make up remover, and more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was running low on the coconut oil I had on hand, and I happened to find a promotional code for this one (which was exactly the type of coconut oil I wanted), so I decided to try this new to me brand.  I LOVE it!  I&#x27;m going to order another for the bathroom and will continue to order when I run out!  :)</li>
            <li> LOVE this huge jar of coconut oil.  I just started using it and am beyond impressed.  My friends have been trying to get me on board for a while and now I am hooked.  This is great quality, organic and LOVE using it in my hair.  I have course, naturally curly, thick hair and it helps for a really good conditioner a few times a week.  I could tell the difference immediately over most conditioners I would use typically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it for skincare and given we are dealing with very dry and cold temperatures this winter in Texas, it has been great to have.  My skin is so soft now.  I also rubbed some on my son who deals with eczema and it has made a difference for him as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have put it to use in the kitchen and it is great to cook with and while I am not usually a huge fan of coconut, the flavor is very subtle and I can barely notice it and in fact, food seems to taste so much better using it to sautee in etc. I’ve also been taking a tablespoon daily as well for general health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the chance came to order this large container at such a great discounted price, I couldn’t pass up the opportunity and I am so glad that I ordered it.  It will definitely become a staple in our house from now on and used for a variety of purposes.</li>
            <li> I use coconut oil for so many things in my house from oil pulling to making homemade deodorant. It is such a great product and beneficial to overall health in so many ways. Needless to say I have tried many brands here on Amazon, usually basing me decision on cost and reviews. I can say this coconut oil was so great, I would even pay a little more for it over its competitors. I love that it is organic and has just the right amount of coconut flavor/scent without being overpowering. There is no added ingredients or chemicals, which is imperative. The fact that this one actually carries the USDA organic seal, gives me the piece of mind that this product is exactly what it claims to be.</li>
            <li> This coconut oil takes delightful!  I am very picky about my coconut oil and this one is definitely a top choice.</li>
            <li> I love coconut oil for it&#x27;s many uses, and this is a great size container for the price. I&#x27;ve used it in cooking and for my skin. After just one application it has really smoothed out those rough spots on my elbows!</li>
            <li> I love this product my hair is less frizzy shiny and healthier. The hair soaks the oil up completely and does not feel greasy at all.</li>
            <li> It came super fast.  It smells and taste good and leaves my skin looking healthy.  I really love this product.</li>
            <li> A gift for someone else</li>
            <li> Great taste.  Often use in cooking and great in oatmeal. Will be buying more. Also great on my skin, love it.</li>
            <li> This #1 Best Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil by All Natural Wonder is very nice.  I received it last week, it has a very nice scent, smells like coconut cream pie without the sugar and a pleasant taste.  So far I used it as a face moisturizer and does not leave face greasy and does not break out the skin, you only need a little, it melt quickly in your hand.  I am going to have to try more of the many uses for it, it is a nice quality of Coconut oil!</li>
            <li> We use coconut oil for everything in my house. One of the main things we use it for is cooking. This oil is PERFECT for a fat in my cooking. I eat paleo and have used it in everything from frying eggs to making Bulletproof coffee. It provides the creamy texture you want and has a very light coconut flavor, which is great in my coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it for a moisturizer and my fiance uses it as a beard oil. Coconut oil is extremely versatile and I would be lost without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received it in perfect condition and have absolutely nothing negative to report about the seller. If you are in the market for coconut oil, this is a great option.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using coconut oil around the house for a few months now but was out so decided to order online (free, two day shipping, yay!) instead of hunting down organic, unrefined cold pressed oil.  I have to say that I am extremely happy with the product.  First, the container makes it easy to dip a spoon into with getting oil all over your hands because the container has a nice wide neck.  The oil smelled so delicious as soon as I pulled back the plastic covering and I started using it right away.  I&#x27;ve heard so many great things about oil-pulling that I decided to try it for myself.  I&#x27;ve been using this coconut oil as a mouthwash for nearly 2 weeks straight and have noticed that my mouth feels &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; and fresher breath and I&#x27;m hoping with continued regular use I will get the whitening results I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> I CAN NOT express how much I love this stuff. I mean, really! The smell, the texture, the flavor! In just a week of use in my hair it is more manageable, softer, shinier and smells amazing!! I have scars on my foot from surgery- this has been so good for my scar! I wear nitrile gloves all day at work and this has been so good for my dry skin on my hands AND it is great on dry heels. Plus- it tastes AMAZING!!!!!! I am so glad that I received a coupon for this item!! So great!! You will not regret this purchase!</li>
            <li> Great product! My skin feels very smooth and natural. I even noticed my hand nails making it look strong without any nail application. It truly leaves my skin looking wonderful and radiant, love it! By far, this is one of best products I had ever try. It does everything it says it will do.</li>
            <li> Love this, but got another premium organic virgin coconut oil for a lot less money, and cannot tell the difference.</li>
            <li> not a fan of this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have used it on my skin and hair. I also use it on my Yorkshire Terrier&#x27;s fur. It is great for combing out tangles. If you get it on any fabric or clothing items, you can not see it once it drys. It has a very subtle coconut flavor. I keep mine on my night stand, by the bed and it has retained its freshness well. I do use a new disposable spoon each time I remove some from the jar though, so as not to contaminate the product. I would give the item five stars if it were packaged in a glass jar.</li>
            <li> very good product. nice transaction</li>
            <li> Wife is using this as a daily body cream. In addition to keeping her skin smooth and moist it appears to help her psoriasis lesions too.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift for my wife. She is thrilled with it. Happy with every aspect of the product including texture, scent plus its multiple uses.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy any other.  Looked and looked for this refined product.  I just love it all over my body from my toes to my hair!</li>
            <li> When I received my oil, I was so surprised and happy with the size jar I received. Amazing how many things you can use this for. My original plan was for moisturizing, but when I saw the cooking uses, I tried it with frying eggs, I was so surprised how good it was. Looking forward to trying other things.</li>
            <li> This was my first time to get coconut oil! I used it to cook some vegetables, and it was great! It melted quickly!! I will also be using it on my skin! There are so many uses for this, and I&#x27;m looking forward to the benefits of using this in my home!</li>
            <li> I have had a thyroid issue for many years and the two worst things about the issue is dry skin and scalp.  I have done alot of research about the benefit of coconut oil, and decided it was worth taking a look at.  I purchased a jar of organic extra virgin coconut oil from \\&quot;All Natural Wonder\\&quot;.  I took the oil, and rubbed it on my leg and arms just like I would with lotion, twice the first day and then twice the second day. I cannot believe the difference that I see with my skin already!  I put it in my hair and left it in for 2 hours and my hair feels like it had a professional deep condition treatment, my ends of my hair are so soft and my scalp is not itchy any longer.  I have also read about the benefits to cooking and baking with coconut oil, so I will continue to use instead of lotion and conditioner.  And reap the benefits of eating this healthy oil as well.  Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> It was a very exciting day when  my order of All Natural Wonder #1 Best Organic Coconut Oil Extra Virgin arrived.  I was out of coconut oil and I use it a lot.  First I opened it and smelled it. It has a light pleasant odor of coconuts.  Then I tasted a bit on a spoon.  Again, it had a delicate texture and light flavorful taste. I enjoyed it in tea. Then I put some in my hair and washed it  My hair came out  soft  and conditioned.  Coconut makes a great massage oil. The oil was very nice.  I gave it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Received a promotional code and I couldn&#x27;t wait to redeem it.  I&#x27;ve read so many things about the great qualities of coconut that I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.  This jar is really quite incredible and versatile.  I can use for cooking as well as a moisturizer for my skin.  Thank you for the code!</li>
            <li> Love this coconut oil. I have been using it on my elbows and hands. I get very dry skin and this coconut oil has been a huge help with the cracking. A must have if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Very good quality and I was so happy with this product and that it arrived in a very timely manner</li>
            <li> I have been an unrefined cold pressed organic extra virgin coconut oil user for almost 3 years now, and I was VERY excited to be asked to review this All Natural Wonder coconut oil, please note all opinions I express here are my own.  As you might gather, I have tried many brands of unrefined cold pressed organic extra virgin coconut oil, so for me to say I am very impressed with this brand means a lot.  I found this coconut oil to be very smooth, much smoother than the other brands I&#x27;ve used on a regular basis.  In cooking or baking smoothness of a coconut oil does not matter as much (because when warmed the coconut oil goes to liquid), but since I use coconut oil for many personal uses as well as cooking (i.e., for skin moisturizer, for oil pulling, in homemade toothpaste, as a base in homemade essential oil salves, etc.) smoothness makes all the difference in the world.  Also, I definitely appreciate this coconut oil&#x27;s texture directly out of the container, because I am known to grab a spoonful and eat it straight up.  This unrefined cold pressed organic extra virgin coconut oil is going to be a staple in our home.</li>
            <li> I purchased this coconut oil during a promotional period. I have been wanting to try it to see what all of the fuss is about. The first thing that I noticed is that it is more solid than an oil. It has a great scent. I have put it in my morning smoothies in order to get the nutritional value. It adds a pleasant taste as it has a smooth sweet flavor. Depending what all that I put in my smoothie, you can&#x27;t taste it. (For those who don&#x27;t like the taste of coconut but want the nutritional value). I have used it to saute and stir fry vegetables and can&#x27;t wait to try it with popcorn. It holds up well with heat. I have read that adding a teaspoon of salt will reduce the strong coconut flavor if you don&#x27;t want a strong sweet taste to your food.&lt;br /&gt; I bought another jar to use in my bathroom as a hair conditioner. I wash my hands frequently during the winter, (I am a healthcare provider) and my knuckles are very dry. Before I leave my house in the morning, I apply to my knuckles and it forms a barrier for a short while. My hands look so much better and are no longer dry. I love that it is organic also.</li>
            <li> My first impression, was YUMMY!  Not only does it smell good, but it truly does taste good too! I have used it in my morning smoothie, on my face, and eaten with a spoon!  The benefits of Coconut Oil are many, you can find information regarding it everywhere you look! Organic, Non- GMO and USDA certified are pluses in my book. I have tried other brands but I have to say that I am super excited about this one! This product has the best smell, and the best taste of all the brands I have used. I will definitely be purchasing as our regular staple. (Purchased with a coupon)</li>
            <li> Great product!! I&#x27;m really loving my coconut oil!</li>
            <li> LOVE the quality of this oil. I use coconut oil for just about everything, with cooking and moisturizing being my favorite. But not all are made alike. I love that this one has the USDA certified seal on it. No extra additives or preservatives. I did find that it worked wonders on my daughters tangles.  I bought this oil with a coupon to try out and in turn found my new favorite coconut oil.</li>
            <li> This coconut oil is amazing.  I love cooking with it and using it for skincare.  The quality seems so much better than what I had been using before.  I also love that it is organic.  I have tried it to fry sweet potatoes, make popcorn, mixed with sugar for a scrub and next I will try it to make homemade deodorant.  The possibilities are endless.  I jumped at the chance to get this at a promotional price and wish I had stocked up!  I will definitely be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> All I have to say is yum.... The flavor and creaminess of this oil I received as a promotional product is so good in quality and taste. Compared to other &amp;#34;bulk store product brands&amp;#34;, this is so much better. I use it in cooking, hair and skin</li>
            <li> I really liked this coconut oil.  It tasted great, I personally don&#x27;t mind a little coconut flavor, I love it. It&#x27;s great for everything, sautéing, frying, anything you&#x27;d use oil in really!&lt;br /&gt;It works wonders on keratosis pilaris!! A little bit on my arms after my shower and you can hardly see it anymore. People no longer constantly ask why my arms are so red! I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars for that alone. After years of trying with other products I wish I would&#x27;ve spent less money and gone this route instead! Luckily I was able to snag this stuff when it was on sale to that made the deal even better! Happy with my purchase and would recommend this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have wanting to try coconut oil for a while now so I thought it would be a perfect time during a recent promotional period.  The benefits are amazing!  I have had really dry skin this winter and this oil was amazing.  It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of product to get a good covering so this container will last a while.  It has made my hair look amazing too even during the harsh winter months.</li>
            <li> This a great coconut oil! I have jumped into the many uses of coconut oil recently, so when I saw that I could get this with a coupon, I grabbed it. I&#x27;m still learning to cook with it, but when I do, it has a subtle flavor to it and does not overpower other flavors. I recently had to go dairy free, so I use it in cooking instead of butter. I mainly use it for my son&#x27;s eczema. He has super dry skin and applying this right after a bath really seems to help. Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> I received this with a promotional coupon and in my humble opinion is one of the best coconut oils out there. I am just learning to cook with it, but have been using it as a hair moisturizer with very happy results.  i just take a little and rub it between my hands to soften/melt it, then massage it into my hair and cover with a plastic shower cap while it does its job. Very happy that this is an all natural product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> All Natural Wonder Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is a great product. There are so many uses for this product! You can bake with it, use it as a beauty product, and even make your own lip balm.  I am currently using it on my baby&#x27;s skin in hopes it will help clear up her eczema. I plan to make homemade lip balm for gifts next Christmas with it. There are two reasons I rated it 4 stars and not 5. One being that my package came with a sticker over the part that lists ways you can use the product.  It was kind of annoying. The second is that I feel it would have been beneficial for the product to come with a pamphlet or something giving more ideas of how you can use the product, with maybe even some recipes. I had to get online to find how to use it for what I wanted. I definitely recommend this product when looking for a good quality coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Coconut oil is soo beneficial for so many things! I use it very frequently in my home for lots of different things. I was running out of my oil, and received a coupon for this brand, and I love it! I will definitely keep purchasing this brand! The source for the oil is wonderful and pure and I now prefer this brand over my other one I have been using. I have found that I don&#x27;t feel my best ingesting it, something about the oil making me feel sluggish, but that still doesn&#x27;t stop me from using this miracle oil topically! I do use it for oil pulling, which feels great and I see the benefits in my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use coconut oil almost daily. I use it in cooking as a flavorful oil with a high smoke point. It is also great for baking or as a dairy free replacement to butter. It feels good and smells better and you can use it on the skin as a lotion, a homemade deodorant, a gentle makeup remover, and a treatment for acne due to its anti-fungal properties. It helps with itchy bug bites, it can lighten age spots, makes an amazing massage oil, and you can dilute essential oils in it as a wonderful carrier oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it while pregnant with my son to prevent stretch marks, and when my son was a baby as a diaper cream that was safe with cloth diapers. It does wonders on cradle cap as well! You can use it for an amazing body scrub too! I just mix equal parts sugar or coarse salt and coconut oil. You can scent it with essential oil as well, but I prefer the coconut scent. It makes an awesome gift too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels really soothing on chapped lips, and I love mixing coconut oil with avocado, and banana for an intensive hair conditioner. You can also use it straight. Just rub in, put a shower cap on, and leave it on for a while. I like it as a defrizzer too.. A bit of it rubbed on your hands then through your hair is all it takes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know you will be happy with this purchase! I hope you find it as wonderful as I have!</li>
            <li> This coconut oil is awesome. Once you have it around the house, you&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s great for pretty much everything.  Beauty, health, cooking, household--you name it and it seems like coconut oil can be used for it. I&#x27;ve found that it works really well on my dry skin, but it&#x27;s easy to dress up into a scented sugar scrub version as well.  I also really like how well it worked to condition my leather couches. Thanks for the tip internet! But mostly, I really like to use this healthy oil in cooking.  The flavor is light and refreshing and works well for frying type applications or any other fat substitute, like in baking. My favorite is popping popcorn with it on the stove. I highly recommend this and was so excited to purchase at a promotional price. This conconut oil is great, container is just the right size and I love that it&#x27;s organic.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I have tried some coconut oil in the past for cooking and this one is amazing. The oil has a higher burn point so it lets you cook things a little quicker than olive oil and the health benefits are amazing. Also, the smell that the coconut oil gives off when it is cooking and the slight taste it adds to any dish are definitely a bonus. I saw this and was able to pick it up during a promotion but I wanted to offer some solid feedback, the oil itself was not messy, the jar sealed perfectly and the oil was great, Id recommend it. I did not try any of the other benefits of the oil other than cooking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good quality oil, my complaint is I found several pieces of cellophane throughout it. I don&#x27;t think it dangerous in any way, just disconcerting. Probably would not buy again.</li>
            <li> At first, I did not like how the product look once it made it to my home, and I contacted customer service. I tried it and yes this is really nice. I will order more in the future...</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!  Must try, you will never use another!</li>
            <li> First off, this smells amazing!  It has a delicious, authentic coconut scent.  Chicago winters are very harsh on our skin, often causing painful cracks around the finger tips.  This coconut oil both soothes the immediate pain and keeps your skin moisturized to hasten healing.  After application, my skin feels silky and smooth - without being greasy.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy</li>
            <li> I love coconut oil and use it for A LOT of things:  for my hair, before shampooing as a pre-conditioner; and after for shine, for cooking, as a health supplement, and as a moisturizer, alone, or in a home made body butter recipe I make that my friends &amp; family love so much that they beg me for more.  High quality organic is a MUST.  All Natural Wonder delivers for all my needs!  My new fave organic coconut oil.  Very light pleasant smell, velvety texture, melts even and silky, and tastes good too.  I&#x27;ve used about 4 other organic extra virgin coconut oil brands and so far I like this one the best for my body recipes due to the creamy texture and subtle smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am trying to expand my uses and went around cleaning the wood windowsills with lemon and this coconut oil.  The hubby didn&#x27;t even complain about the very subtle lemony coconut smell.  He liked it and the wood looks beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furniture Polish&lt;br /&gt;Some coconut oil and lemon juice is all it takes to bring a beautiful shine to your wood furniture. (Just be sure to test it out on an inconspicuous spot first.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;Combine coconut oil with baking soda to make your pearly whites gleam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product may cost a tiny bit more than other similar products and size but the couple of extra dollars is worth it, in my opinion.  It&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my 4 month old daughter&#x27;s dry scalp and it has really helped! A little bit goes a long way! Also, I enjoy applying it to my chapped lips and other dry spots on my body. Not greasy and very pleasant smelling!</li>
            <li> This coconut oil is very high quality and a great value. The options are endless for this coconut oil from using it as a supplement, moisturizer or just to cook and bake with. I am very happy with this.</li>
            <li> Coconut oil is such an amazing thing!  It can be used for so much, from cooking to a moisturizer.  This is a great quality coconut oil.  I love that it is organic and non-gmo.  That is important to our family.  We fried up some potatoes and sausage the other day with this and it turned out amazing!!  The potatoes fried up so nicely.  They didn&#x27;t turn mushy and had a nice even frying to them.  It was probably the best fried poetess I&#x27;ve made.  Coconut oil is like magic, it can be used for almost anything.</li>
            <li> I have been having trouble finding a coconut oil that I can mix with my son oils to apply to his neck, this is the magic one!! It takes the oil wonderfully!!! It also have a very pleasant smell! I highly recommend this coconut oil! Other things we use coconut oil for is cleaning the house, cooking and for tooth paste just to name  a few! I promise you will not be disappointed using this Organic Coconut oil!!</li>
            <li> I wasted my money on this and i didn&#x27;t get one.</li>
            <li> Great for my scalp and hydration for my skin. I normally apply it once I get out of the shower</li>
            <li> Oh coconut oil how I love thee!  I am a coconut oil nut! I use it for anything and everything. Which means I was super excited to receive a discount code for this! I use it to cook, as a facewash, for massaging the baby and diaper cream.  I use it for oil pulling and as a carrier oil for my essential oils.  My favorite use is as a balm for my exposed face while I am out running in the Maine winter.  I put a good layer on to protect me against the wind and being chapped.  I love what it does as a protectant and a moisturizer.  Great product, delivered and used quickly!</li>
            <li> You have to purchase this product. The creamy consistency of this coconut oil goes unmatched. I&#x27;ve bought other brands at the grocery store and none can come close in comparison. I use this product for everything from bulletproof coffee to making coconut milk coffee creamer. I love the container and I especially love the quality of this organic product. It goes perfectly with my paleo diet and I don&#x27;t ever use any other kind of oil other than butter. Perfect coconut oil!!</li>
            <li> I have been doing Whole30 for the past few months- and a big part of it is making sure to eat enough healthy fat.  Because of that, I have been adding coconut oil to my daily diet.  So I have tried quite a few different kinds.  This one, though- is by far, the VERY BEST!  I can even eat this plain and by itself without any problem.  The taste is perfect- so smooth, so perfectly textured and delicious. This coconut oil is all that the manufacturer promises and more.  I am definitely a believer in this product!  Very, very happy.  It also is the perfect Coconut Oil to use when making Bulletproof Coffee!!  Can&#x27;t say enough.  Absolutely delicious.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard all great things about Coconut oil but haven&#x27;t taken the time to try it until now because I bought this product with a coupon.  I haven&#x27;t had the time to try it for all the uses it has to offer yet but i know and have seen first hand from friends and loved ones that it does work. I do use this to cook with, in fact I just had a big party at my home over the weekend and I used it to cook some of the dishes and I received raving reviews. I have made these dishes before but this time it had a little different flavor and it was a hit!! In the bathroom, I have started using this on my face as I have a dermatitis skin condition on my face that requires steroids and I just started using this product on my face. What I can tell you is that within a day I usually have a rash on my face and I don&#x27;t so I think this may work for me. That will be the most exciting thing in the world if it does!! Worth the money for this product for sure</li>
            <li> Coconut oil is all the rage, so I was excited to purchase this with a coupon.  It seriously has 101 uses and then some.  I use it regularly to make bullet proof coffee, soften cracked heels, diaper rash cream, moisturize my hair (I have curly hair), and of course cooking.  I usually have both refined and unrefined coconut oil around (refined doesn&#x27;t have the coconut scent or slight flavor that the unrefined has).  One of my favorite ways to use this All Natural Wonder Organic Extra Virgin Unrefined coconut oil is to spread it on toast and top with some honey.  It is my nighttime dessert.  Seriously delicious.  I also do oil pulling (not regularly, but a couple of times a week) and I really like this unrefined oil for it - the slight flavor of coconut makes it seems easier to do.  And my teeth really do feel cleaner after.  This is a wonderful product, I&#x27;m really happy with the quality and I would definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a few different brands of Coconut Oil over the last year and always have a hard time with it not actually smelling like coconut.  When I saw a promotion for this brand of Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil I decided to give coconut oil another try.  The day is came my 7 year old daughter had terrible dry skin on her hand from the frigid weather.  I opened it up and instantly smelled coconut!  I was already impressed!  I gave her a tiny amount and had her rub it in her hands.  Later that evening her hands looked fabulous!  Within hours the dry skin/rash was gone!  We use this coconut oil for shaving and moisturizer mostly.  It is amazing to rub into your skin and then get dressed, but not feel the &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; on your skin.  I have yet to use it for cooking, but I will!  I need to purchase a second jar for my kitchen.  If you have skin troubles this is what you need!  No harsh chemicals going into/onto your body!</li>
            <li> I love coconut oil and this is a good one.  Cook in it or add to smoothies.  Use with baking soda to make toothpaste, as someone else mentioned.  Best personal lubricant.  Good for the skin, good for the hair.  Love it.  And this is a good one - organic and odiferous!  Love it.  Extra extra stars -</li>
            <li> This is a great organic raw coconut oil! I use coconut oil for so many things, but sometimes finding a good high quality organic raw option can be difficult in a small town. I was excited to receive a promo code to try this one and I&#x27;m so glad that I did! I&#x27;ve used it to moisturize my hands, dilute essential oils and saute mushrooms! It has a lovely fresh coconut aroma and has been really great in a pan for cooking. I&#x27;ve used it for a chest rub (similar to vicks vapor rub) that I make with essential oils and I love how easily it rubs in. I could really go on with all the great things to use coconut oil for!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for soooo many uses. I keep a jar in my kitchen for cooking, as well as in my bathroom. Great uses are for hair, skin and nails, as well as bruises, abrasions and so much more. This is a all natural, great smell, with so many functional uses. Has great health benefits without the chemicals used in all the other products in the stores for the same function. Super fast shipping! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Coconut oil is a cure all in our house!  We use it for cooking and baking.  We use it for chapped lips, lotion, diaper cream, leave in conditioner, with essential oils...the list goes on FOREVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received All Natural Wonder CO during a promotional period and I am thrilled with it!!  Being that it is unrefined, this coconut oil does have the light scent/taste of coconut.  This is my preference as it means it is as pure as possible.  I love the coconut smell when we use it as a beauty aid and honestly, I cannot taste the coconut when I cook with it but some people love the coconut hint when baking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you use so much coconut oil in every facet of life, it is definitely worth it to buy the BEST that you can find and this one is great!! Organic, unrefined, raw! Yes, you will find coconut oil cheaper on your grocery or big box shelf but be sure to pay attention to the quality because there are clear differences that set this one apart and make it worth the extra couple dollars!</li>
            <li> I received this and started using it that night.  It leaves my skin soft and smells divine!  I have tried lotions that just didn&#x27;t work anywhere near as well is this coconut oil does.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I love coconut oil because there are an insane amount of uses for this stuff.  I use it for tons of things from cooking/baking to hair conditioner and of course skin moisturizer for me and toddler and newborn (I use it in the shower for myself).  I&#x27;ve also recently read that coconut oil is one of the foods that you can take daily to increase milk supply.  Seriously...the list is endless and every time I do an Internet search for coconut oil, I find something new to try it on!  If you haven&#x27;t used coconut oil before, you should definitely try it.  It&#x27;s like the duct tape of health and beauty :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I am always using a TON of coconut oil, I was so excited to receive this item as part of a promotion.  Now I have a jar of coconut oil in the kitchen and one in my shower.  I actually like the All Natural Wonder brand better than the last two that I bought because I feel like the smell stays a little longer.  It&#x27;s not a strong odor, so it won&#x27;t leave you smelling like you&#x27;ve lathered yourself up in tanning lotion.  It just has a very nice, light, natural coconut smell and the smell doesn&#x27;t seem to evaporate from my skin as fast as with others that I have used.  Also, I don&#x27;t find that my skin feels as oily as with some others.  I&#x27;m not sure how that&#x27;s possible since you would think coconut oil is pretty much going to be the same, but for whatever reason I find that it&#x27;s absorbed into my skin better and left me with nicer smelling skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend not only coconut oil, but this brand to anyone who hasn&#x27;t tried it before.  Once I run out, I will be purchasing again to refill either my bathroom or kitchen supply!</li>
            <li> I have used other coconut oils and always thought &amp;#34;one coconut oils must be the same as another&amp;#34;.  NOT true! Using this one, All Natural Wonder Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, to battle my continously dry skin on myi knees has been amazing. Since I thought they were all the same and I coul;d get this one at a promotional price I thought &amp;#34;Why Not&amp;#34;.  The naturally organic oils seem to last longer on my knees and heels.  I apply every morning after my shower and the dry scales do not appear throughout the day. I like it as a mouth sweetner before going to bed, I just swish it around for several minutes.  It gives my teeth a clean smooth feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for stir frying and instead of butter and sugar on rice...yum yum!</li>
            <li> This coconut oil has such amazing sutble flavor! I was blown away. Some coconut oils have a very strong coconut flavor - which I like, but not in everything. This oil is far more mellow, which gives it a lot more options! I enjoyed the mouth-feel, too. Very smooth in texture without any grainy presence. It melts quickly and evenly. So far I&#x27;ve used this in cooking, coffee, on toast, and on my skin. As a mosturizer it&#x27;s great. It seems to asorb quickly and leaves my skin so soft! I highly recommend this and I will be buying it again! I was lucky enough to get my first jar on a coupon!</li>
            <li> Getting this product at a promotional price was the best thing ever!  I use coconut oil in pretty much every room of my house, so I need a pure, cold pressed oil.  Personally, I use coconut oil for moisturizing my skin, as lip balm, cleaning my teeth (oil pulling-swish a small amount in your mouth for 10-30 minutes in the morning), conditioning my hair, cooking (subtle flavor that can be masked with stronger flavors), baking (adds just a bit of sweetness), and polishing the wood furniture (mixed with lemon) in my house!  Note that a little bit goes a LONG way.  I&#x27;m a massage therapist, so I encounter a lot of oils in my work including other brands of coconut oil.  This one was much smoother and &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling than the one we currently use.  A lot of other coconut oils I&#x27;ve used claim to be organic, but didn&#x27;t have the USDA certified stamp which is pretty important to me!  If you&#x27;re looking for a quality product I highly recommend this one!!</li>
            <li> My wife and I had heard about both the health and taste benefits of using coconut oil in cooking from some friends of ours.  We have tried the coconut oil in a couple of recipes now and the results have been fantastic.  Replacing butter with this coconut oil adds a complexity to the flavor that is quite remarkable.  We have shared this product with the friends that told us about coconut oil in the first place and they were very impressed by the quality and consistency of this product, and will be buying this product instead of what they had been using.</li>
            <li> This coconut oil is great. Its light to cook with and it really makes seafood taste great its not at all like other cooking oil which is heavy and can taste greasy. The coconut taste is very light. Does not smother the taste of food. I also tried it on my skin and hair. Its really nice and smooth and you only need a very tiny amount and it goes far. I did major research on coconut oil and I feel this is the best brand on Amazon. It answers all your questions and they show you the full label.</li>
            <li> We have been using coconut oil for a while now for so many different things. I&#x27;m always careful to make sure it&#x27;s organic and the price of this oil was the best I found recently that is certified organic so I decided to give it a try. I separated about half out into a different container so I could take it as a supplement and use it for cooking. It tastes great, melts easily in the microwave so I can add it to my smoothies, and works perfectly as a butter replacement for cooking. My 6 year old won&#x27;t usually eat coconut oil right off the spoon, but she had no issue with this one. The other half of the oil I used instead of diaper rash cream for my 19 month old. It&#x27;s so much safer and works just as good if not better! I&#x27;ve been using this brand for about 2 weeks and we haven&#x27;t had even the tiniest amount of rash. Usually I use coconut oil for 4 days or so and then have to do a day of Desitin. We have been able to use just this! I will be ordering more containers so we have one going at all times for diaper rashes, 1 for daily supplementation, 1 for cooking, and 1 in the bathroom for skin and hair conditioning. Coconut oil in general is pretty much a miracle product with so many uses and the All Natural Wonder oil is easily the best we&#x27;ve used.  Disclosure: I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I have not been compensated in any way, nor promised any future promotions. I have no affiliation with the company at all, and I am not required to leave a positive review. All thoughts are my own and have not been influenced.</li>
            <li> I use coconut oil for EEEEEEVERYTHING, and when you use so much you *need* good quality, organic, unrefined, cold pressed oil!  This stuff has a ton of benefits for your body inside and out.  I recommend buying two jars: one for your kitchen and one for your bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the kitchen I use it for baking and saut&amp;eacute;ing, and sometimes in my tea.  It has a nice subtle flavor that can be neutralized by stronger flavors (when you need to add a good healthy fat) or accentuated with other flavors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bathroom jar definitely get replaced more often though.  I use it in my hair occasionally for a deep condition that works as well and for a fraction of the price of something you&#x27;ll buy at a salon.  It&#x27;s great for oral health, either as a pre-brush plaque loosener (swish around about a teaspoon for at least 5 minutes, spit then brush) or as an ingredient in your own homemade toothpaste.  In fact, if you&#x27;re into homemade health and beauty agents, this coconut oil is a staple in just about any toothpaste/lotion/skin balm/lip balm/diaper cream/anything recipe... or it&#x27;s great to rub all over just by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH!  AND!  The jar is really awesome too because it&#x27;s the perfect size to reuse for a homemade lotion or hair gel or seasoning or smoothie mix or probably a million other things I can&#x27;t think of right now.  Like I said, I use it for everything, so when I was able to purchase it at a promotional price I was tempted to buy out the whole store&#x27;s supply.  You can never have too much coconut oil in your life!</li>
            <li> I love coconut oil! There are so many uses for it. One use is under your nose before a hot shower. My nose has been raw from being sick and this coconut oil has been amazing. I have also used it on my son&#x27;s head for his cradle cap. Just rub it in, let it soak just a bit and then wash out with shampoo. His head is SO soft!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I am going to try this in a batch of coconut macaroons. I think it would help make my cookies even more amazing.&lt;br /&gt;This coconut oil does smell like coconut, which can bother some people. I was asked to review this product, all reviews are my own.</li>
            <li> We use coconut oil for so many things, so when I received a coupon code for this, I was excited to order it right away. I love the wide-mouth container, it makes it so much easier to get to the oil than a standard jar. It is pretty chilly where we live, so the oil is solid, and having to try to pry some out of a container with a narrow opening is very frustrating. We&#x27;ve used this for chapped lips and noses, a diaper rash, the dogs get a bit in their food bowls...There is pretty much no end to the things you can do with coconut oil, and I love being able to offer it to my kids for various skin issues and know I&#x27;m not slathering them in artificial ingredients. We&#x27;ve pretty much totally replaced both lotion and chapstick with this, and a little bit goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> What can I say? There are so many reasons why coconut oil should be a regular in your household. The key is having an all natural organic one that is actually good for you. I like trying different brands to see which ones work for me and this one looked like it would work. I was lucky enough to get their coupon during a promotion so I jumped at the chance to buy it. I also have one jar for the kitchen to enhance all my cooking and one jar in the bathroom for all my beauty needs. I could probably write a small book on all the ways you can use coconut oil, but I&#x27;ll let you look up all the uses online. I will tell you one of my favorite uses. I have extremely frizzy coarse hair. My favorite use for coconut oil is to use the oil as a hair mask. While in the shower, I melt the coconut oil by running the jar under the warm water. Then, after shampooing, I apply a generous amount of the oil onto the wet strands and twist my hair into a bun. I then let it sit for at least fifteen minutes before rinsing. It totally adds moisture and shine back into my hair. Oh my goodness! My hair is so healthy and shiny now!! Love it! Get this coconut oil now. In fact, get 2 or 3 or 4! You will need it!</li>
