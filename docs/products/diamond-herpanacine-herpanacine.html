            <li>they work good too.</li>
            <li>However I know it&#x27;s packs with good herbs</li>
            <li>I read really good reviews on it.</li>
            <li>A good food supplement.</li>
            <li>I have been taken this supplement for over 9 years and find it&#x27;s the best for Rosasea, there is nothing better and safe on the market that I know of.  </li>
            <li>She swears it keeps her skin happy, healthy, and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>It should be advertised more!</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt like this before, it is truly amazing.</li>

            <li>WOW Wonderful!</li>
            <li>Excellent for acne, made my skin clear up and glow</li>
            <li>I have been using it for almost three months now and honestly my skin didn&#x27;t get any better.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent and natural way to tackle acne.</li>
            <li>I have found that taking 1 in the morning, one at lunch, and two before bed has been the most effective.</li>
            <li>Over time once your acne troubles are over, you can decrease it to the maintenance level which is just 2 easy pills a day!</li>
            <li>I honestly wish it did, because the pills are relatively easy to take, and I don&#x27;t have any problems with after-taste or anything like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, the colon detox, I&#x27;m sure, helped.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>I started drinking water with juice of 1/2 lime in each glassful and eating more alkaline foods.</li>
            <li>It looks better now than before I had the rosacea.</li>
            <li>Combined w/ better skin care, my skin is getting better.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Just truthful.</li>
            <li>#34;cleaned-up&amp;#34; a bit and looks better.</li>
            <li>Also, it did help me to start eating healthier (lots more vegetables than I had been used to eating, and staying away from a lot of coffee at work).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend these capsules for sure.</li>
            <li>Great product...Works really well.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad that she did.</li>
            <li>It has helped to minimize my cystic acne, which was mostly around my mouth and chin, and I have also noticed that my hair is softer and nails are stronger.</li>
            <li>Love this pills.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so happy that they&#x27;re natural..</li>
            <li>If you are looking for more energy and smooth skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that in a couple more months, I can come back with a great update.</li>
            <li>My pores looked so clean and healthy</li>
            <li>easy to just pop the vitamins and forget about skin care.  </li>
            <li>I like how this product consists of important vitamins and minerals most of us should be familiar with (Vitamin A, E, Zinc, etc.)</li>
            <li>It is important to note that you still have to drink plenty of water, stay away from your breakout trigger foods (which differ from person to person), and have a very sound skin regimen to help this product to work, but I feel it is totally worth it for the results.  </li>
            <li>from the company before purchasing to confirm it was gluten free.</li>
            <li>This product, in conjunction with vitamin C and Valtrex, has made me outbreak free.  </li>
            <li>This seems to be a great supplement for overall health.</li>
            <li>her skin did not look so smooth.</li>
            <li>Herpanacine takes care of ruddiness of the face and also smooth texture.  </li>
            <li>so, so far it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>I loved going to the tanning bed and realized that if I went my skin was clear, if I stopped tanning breakouts would start to appear.</li>
            <li>The skin on my face is looking fantastic as well as the skin all over my body, such an amazing product!</li>
            <li>This product is definitely worth the cost!  </li>
            <li>well worth it!  </li>
            <li>We are so excited.  </li>
            <li>so that part is pretty safe.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it successfully before, the key thing is to use it consistently and to start at the appropriate dose for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 31 and have had mild-moderate adult acne for a while, and like most, I have tried many products (nothing dr. prescribed though).  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say that the acne for me is about 70% clear,</li>
            <li>During that time, I started eating a more alkaline diet after reading rosacea is caused by too much acid in the body.</li>
            <li>I started taking herpanacine with full blown acne.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I really like this product for more than its skin benefits.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product off and on for about six years now, and I can leave a genuine comment with full confidence stating that this product really works!  </li>
            <li>It was super discouraging....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please give this product time as it seems to be a true cleansing process, but in the end is totally worth it.  </li>
            <li>For me it has zero side-affects without any of the supplement buzz that many products create as I am very sensitive to drugs and supplements.</li>
            <li>Let me first say this: Don&#x27;t take this product if you are expecting immediate results!</li>
            <li>On time , exactly what I wanted !</li>
            <li>And still I go back for more!</li>
            <li>So I decided on a more natural approach and came across herpanicine.  </li>
            <li>This product is worth every inexpensive penny for the results.</li>
            <li>I figured this was worth a shot given the rave reviews.  </li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s to hoping for truly clear and healthy</li>
            <li>If your acne is severe, start with 6 pills a day (fun I know).</li>
            <li>My face broke right out.</li>
            <li>I take this product right after dinner</li>
            <li>this product works and i first found it at the health food store; the healing properties of the product gets rid of bacteria in your body; my skin cleared up immediately after I started taking it; it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>This product does a great job keeping various skin issues at bay, such as rosacia.</li>
            <li>I will say that my acne has been pretty good to me for a 20 year old with extra testosterone in his body...</li>
            <li>So, I got the PanAcid first, then</li>
            <li>were the primary supplements to clear up the acne to this point.</li>
            <li>no ill effects noticed.  </li>
            <li>My face is looking almost pretty again.</li>
            <li>But once herpanicine started working it really worked!  </li>
            <li>My skin was pretty damaged to begin with, but with the length of time it took for herpanacine to kick in</li>
            <li>The acne at first multiplied (as my friend said it would).</li>
            <li>breakouts started occurring more often (sometime multiple times a day) and took weeks to heal.  </li>
            <li>the wait and the pain of the first four-five</li>
            <li>and I thought that&#x27;s what my body was doing the first month I took this, but now almost 4 months in I know it is not working for me.</li>
            <li>We have tried so many different products - and without insurance to go to a Dermatologist, we have searched and researched quite a bit.</li>
            <li>I was first recommended to this product at a GNC where it was way overpriced.</li>
            <li>I was recommended the product when I told The GNC owner I was starting a Testosterone Booster to put on more size in the gym.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after the first day of taking it--the redness was pretty much gone.</li>
            <li>With the positive reviews I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>3 years later my skin is still smooth, soft and acne free.  </li>
            <li>love that it addresses the root causes of acne and doesn&#x27;t just \\&quot;dry up pimples.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin was clear for the most part of my high school days until I guess around 14yrs old.</li>
            <li>New breakouts were like mutant blemished that I had never had before (most likely border-lining on cystic).  </li>
            <li>Around the 6 month period, I was completely acne free and am now off the supplement completely!</li>
            <li>My teenager has been taking this daily, and his acne has improved tremendously!  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone that I know!</li>
            <li>As a product, it seems promising.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>This product has helped me so much.</li>
            <li>The really have helped me to have a clearer skin.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t seem to help much.  </li>
            <li>This product works very well in any type of skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The first difference I noticed in my skin was the texture; it was smoother than it had ever been and was very soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li>I do not usually write reviews, but I feel like I should because of how much Herpanacine has helped my skin!</li>
            <li>I am 43 yrs old and have been concerned about caring for my skin and the fine lines and wrinkles that are starting to appear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll do that for about 2 more months and then work my way down to (1) a day.</li>
            <li>After taking six capsules a day (a lot, but worth it) for five weeks, I can say there&#x27;s not a single pimple on my face.  </li>
            <li>I love not worrying about gross topical creams and dr visits..</li>
            <li>Being older that is not a concern with me</li>
            <li>So far, not much change, but I&#x27;m pleased that a)</li>
            <li>If you are struggling with acne, I also HIGHLY recommend checking out acne.org and daniel kern&#x27;s regimen.</li>
            <li>I used this product when I was in high school (5 yrs ago).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had baby soft, clear skin until last June when it started to breakout very mildly.  </li>
            <li>WOW!!  </li>
            <li>its been really making my skin clear up and also allowing for my skin to look brighter and healthier.</li>
            <li>then what they would normally be.</li>
            <li>the normal herpanacine pills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My daughter cannot live without this herpanacine.  </li>
            <li>I read about its affects in Amazon particularly with teenagers using it to clear up their acne.</li>
            <li>my face was clear!</li>
            <li>I have tried many other products including all of the different prescriptions from the doctor&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Many other products seem like regular multivitamins.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was the overall texture of my skin...</li>
            <li>WOW, it feels like silk!</li>
            <li>It is worth it however, since you would end up paying just as much for a bottle that is half the size at the Vitamin Shoppe.</li>
            <li>I took Herpanacine for 3 months in hopes that it would help clear up severe cystic acne.</li>
            <li>I started taking 6 capsules a day but now that my skin is totally clear, I am using 2 capsules a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>While doing some research online about natural alternatives for acne</li>
            <li>The herpanacine definitely contributed to much of the improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>In hindsight I wish I had hauled ass to the derm one last time for fast relief that may have saved my skin from collagen loss and all these indents.</li>
            <li>This product was recommended by a health care provider for my daughter who has developed adolescense acne.</li>
            <li>It seems to help but has not made it go away completely</li>
            <li>After doing hours of research on the internet looking into what vitamins reduce genital herpes outbreaks, I found this product at a local Whole Foods (at twice the price - Amazon is the way to go).  </li>
            <li>I continue to use the 6 pills/day regimen, but overall, my skin hasn&#x27;t improved much, if at all.</li>
            <li>So far this product has not worked for me.</li>
            <li>I totally understand the whole flushing out period</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s natural it does take a while to see results.</li>
            <li>The thing is that Im still a young man who already has acne to begin with</li>
            <li>so my results may be different from yours, but I really think this product helped me.</li>
            <li>The PanAcid seemed to help almost immediately, then I started this and optizinc along with it and things slowly got better.</li>
            <li>Not a huge change but enough that I have better looking skin.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been taking it long enough to see a complete improvement in my mild, yet bothersome acne issues</li>
            <li>He actually bought this initially after a shingles outbreak about 5 years ago and it cleared it right up.</li>
            <li>The acne was mostly on chin/lower face area, at one point, I counted more than 25 pimples - small to very large cystic types - and it was painful and very itchy.</li>
            <li>Eventually, you are able to wean yourself off of this product, but if your breakouts begin to reoccur (like they usually do, ugh), all you have to do is start this product at the severe or moderate dosage again (between four-six capsules a day), and you should see a marked improvement in two-three months.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that my acne has totally cleared up, but it is definitely better than a few months ago!</li>
            <li>however I can say that when taking daily for the past month, my skin tone looks much better</li>
            <li>I got a prescription from my doctor for an antibiotic to use for 3 months that wouldn&#x27;t clear up the acne I had, but may clear up future breakouts, well I didn&#x27;t want to be on antibiotics for 3 months</li>
            <li>It was so embarrassing that my face was worse off than most of the middle and high schoolers in our homeschooling community.</li>
            <li>product really was a life-changer for me, as the boost it has given my skin has directly affected my confidence in all other aspects of my life.  </li>
            <li>almost 41) year old homeschooling mom who all of a sudden 4 months ago started breaking out like never before.</li>
            <li>/&gt;apparently, they have different supplement facts and looked different from the normal ones as well.</li>
            <li>(again though it is definitely worth it compared to where I was a few months ago).  </li>
            <li>It really effected my skin negatively and nothing i tried (minocycline, topical gels) helped very much.</li>
            <li>did, and still do, use this with a topical treatment regimen with helps to keep everything under control, though I hope to curb that regimen down a little bit as keeping on top of all these steps is a bit of a nuisance</li>
            <li>I decided to go back on birth control but that only made me gain 20lbs and didn&#x27;t clear anything up.</li>
            <li>I am uncertain if the cystic acne clear-up was due to this or discintinuing a new cleaner, so time will tell.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I like how this product consists of important vitamins and minerals most of us should be familiar with (Vitamin A, E, Zinc, etc.)</li>
            <li> It is important to note that you still have to drink plenty of water, stay away from your breakout trigger foods (which differ from person to person), and have a very sound skin regimen to help this product to work, but I feel it is totally worth it for the results.  </li>
            <li> from the company before purchasing to confirm it was gluten free.</li>
            <li> This product, in conjunction with vitamin C and Valtrex, has made me outbreak free.  </li>
            <li> This seems to be a great supplement for overall health.</li>
            <li> her skin did not look so smooth.</li>
            <li> Herpanacine takes care of ruddiness of the face and also smooth texture.  </li>
            <li> so, so far it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I loved going to the tanning bed and realized that if I went my skin was clear, if I stopped tanning breakouts would start to appear.</li>
            <li> The skin on my face is looking fantastic as well as the skin all over my body, such an amazing product!</li>
            <li> This product is definitely worth the cost!  </li>
            <li> well worth it!  </li>
            <li> We are so excited.  </li>
            <li> so that part is pretty safe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it successfully before, the key thing is to use it consistently and to start at the appropriate dose for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31 and have had mild-moderate adult acne for a while, and like most, I have tried many products (nothing dr. prescribed though).  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say that the acne for me is about 70% clear,</li>
            <li> During that time, I started eating a more alkaline diet after reading rosacea is caused by too much acid in the body.</li>
            <li> I started taking herpanacine with full blown acne.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I really like this product for more than its skin benefits.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product off and on for about six years now, and I can leave a genuine comment with full confidence stating that this product really works!  </li>
            <li> It was super discouraging....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please give this product time as it seems to be a true cleansing process, but in the end is totally worth it.  </li>
            <li> For me it has zero side-affects without any of the supplement buzz that many products create as I am very sensitive to drugs and supplements.</li>
            <li> Let me first say this: Don&#x27;t take this product if you are expecting immediate results!</li>
            <li> On time , exactly what I wanted !</li>
            <li> And still I go back for more!</li>
            <li> So I decided on a more natural approach and came across herpanicine.  </li>
            <li> This product is worth every inexpensive penny for the results.</li>
            <li> I figured this was worth a shot given the rave reviews.  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s to hoping for truly clear and healthy</li>
            <li> If your acne is severe, start with 6 pills a day (fun I know).</li>
            <li> My face broke right out.</li>
            <li> I take this product right after dinner</li>
            <li> this product works and i first found it at the health food store; the healing properties of the product gets rid of bacteria in your body; my skin cleared up immediately after I started taking it; it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> This product does a great job keeping various skin issues at bay, such as rosacia.</li>
            <li> I will say that my acne has been pretty good to me for a 20 year old with extra testosterone in his body...</li>
            <li> So, I got the PanAcid first, then</li>
            <li> were the primary supplements to clear up the acne to this point.</li>
            <li> no ill effects noticed.  </li>
            <li> My face is looking almost pretty again.</li>
            <li> But once herpanicine started working it really worked!  </li>
            <li> My skin was pretty damaged to begin with, but with the length of time it took for herpanacine to kick in</li>
            <li> The acne at first multiplied (as my friend said it would).</li>
            <li> breakouts started occurring more often (sometime multiple times a day) and took weeks to heal.  </li>
            <li> the wait and the pain of the first four-five</li>
            <li> and I thought that&#x27;s what my body was doing the first month I took this, but now almost 4 months in I know it is not working for me.</li>
            <li> We have tried so many different products - and without insurance to go to a Dermatologist, we have searched and researched quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I was first recommended to this product at a GNC where it was way overpriced.</li>
            <li> I was recommended the product when I told The GNC owner I was starting a Testosterone Booster to put on more size in the gym.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after the first day of taking it--the redness was pretty much gone.</li>
            <li> With the positive reviews I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> 3 years later my skin is still smooth, soft and acne free.  </li>
            <li> love that it addresses the root causes of acne and doesn&#x27;t just \\&quot;dry up pimples.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin was clear for the most part of my high school days until I guess around 14yrs old.</li>
            <li> New breakouts were like mutant blemished that I had never had before (most likely border-lining on cystic).  </li>
            <li> Around the 6 month period, I was completely acne free and am now off the supplement completely!</li>
            <li> My teenager has been taking this daily, and his acne has improved tremendously!  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone that I know!</li>
            <li> As a product, it seems promising.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> This product has helped me so much.</li>
            <li> The really have helped me to have a clearer skin.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t seem to help much.  </li>
            <li> This product works very well in any type of skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> The first difference I noticed in my skin was the texture; it was smoother than it had ever been and was very soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li> I do not usually write reviews, but I feel like I should because of how much Herpanacine has helped my skin!</li>
            <li> I am 43 yrs old and have been concerned about caring for my skin and the fine lines and wrinkles that are starting to appear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll do that for about 2 more months and then work my way down to (1) a day.</li>
            <li> After taking six capsules a day (a lot, but worth it) for five weeks, I can say there&#x27;s not a single pimple on my face.  </li>
            <li> I love not worrying about gross topical creams and dr visits..</li>
            <li> Being older that is not a concern with me</li>
            <li> So far, not much change, but I&#x27;m pleased that a)</li>
            <li> If you are struggling with acne, I also HIGHLY recommend checking out acne.org and daniel kern&#x27;s regimen.</li>
            <li> I used this product when I was in high school (5 yrs ago).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had baby soft, clear skin until last June when it started to breakout very mildly.  </li>
            <li> WOW!!  </li>
            <li> its been really making my skin clear up and also allowing for my skin to look brighter and healthier.</li>
            <li> then what they would normally be.</li>
            <li> the normal herpanacine pills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter cannot live without this herpanacine.  </li>
            <li> I read about its affects in Amazon particularly with teenagers using it to clear up their acne.</li>
            <li> my face was clear!</li>
            <li> I have tried many other products including all of the different prescriptions from the doctor&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Many other products seem like regular multivitamins.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the overall texture of my skin...</li>
            <li> WOW, it feels like silk!</li>
            <li> It is worth it however, since you would end up paying just as much for a bottle that is half the size at the Vitamin Shoppe.</li>
            <li> I took Herpanacine for 3 months in hopes that it would help clear up severe cystic acne.</li>
            <li> I started taking 6 capsules a day but now that my skin is totally clear, I am using 2 capsules a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> While doing some research online about natural alternatives for acne</li>
            <li> The herpanacine definitely contributed to much of the improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> In hindsight I wish I had hauled ass to the derm one last time for fast relief that may have saved my skin from collagen loss and all these indents.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by a health care provider for my daughter who has developed adolescense acne.</li>
            <li> It seems to help but has not made it go away completely</li>
            <li> After doing hours of research on the internet looking into what vitamins reduce genital herpes outbreaks, I found this product at a local Whole Foods (at twice the price - Amazon is the way to go).  </li>
            <li> I continue to use the 6 pills/day regimen, but overall, my skin hasn&#x27;t improved much, if at all.</li>
            <li> So far this product has not worked for me.</li>
            <li> I totally understand the whole flushing out period</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s natural it does take a while to see results.</li>
            <li> The thing is that Im still a young man who already has acne to begin with</li>
            <li> so my results may be different from yours, but I really think this product helped me.</li>
            <li> The PanAcid seemed to help almost immediately, then I started this and optizinc along with it and things slowly got better.</li>
            <li> Not a huge change but enough that I have better looking skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been taking it long enough to see a complete improvement in my mild, yet bothersome acne issues</li>
            <li> He actually bought this initially after a shingles outbreak about 5 years ago and it cleared it right up.</li>
            <li> The acne was mostly on chin/lower face area, at one point, I counted more than 25 pimples - small to very large cystic types - and it was painful and very itchy.</li>
            <li> Eventually, you are able to wean yourself off of this product, but if your breakouts begin to reoccur (like they usually do, ugh), all you have to do is start this product at the severe or moderate dosage again (between four-six capsules a day), and you should see a marked improvement in two-three months.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that my acne has totally cleared up, but it is definitely better than a few months ago!</li>
            <li> however I can say that when taking daily for the past month, my skin tone looks much better</li>
            <li> I got a prescription from my doctor for an antibiotic to use for 3 months that wouldn&#x27;t clear up the acne I had, but may clear up future breakouts, well I didn&#x27;t want to be on antibiotics for 3 months</li>
            <li> It was so embarrassing that my face was worse off than most of the middle and high schoolers in our homeschooling community.</li>
            <li> product really was a life-changer for me, as the boost it has given my skin has directly affected my confidence in all other aspects of my life.  </li>
            <li> almost 41) year old homeschooling mom who all of a sudden 4 months ago started breaking out like never before.</li>
            <li> /&gt;apparently, they have different supplement facts and looked different from the normal ones as well.</li>
            <li> (again though it is definitely worth it compared to where I was a few months ago).  </li>
            <li> It really effected my skin negatively and nothing i tried (minocycline, topical gels) helped very much.</li>
            <li> did, and still do, use this with a topical treatment regimen with helps to keep everything under control, though I hope to curb that regimen down a little bit as keeping on top of all these steps is a bit of a nuisance</li>
            <li> I decided to go back on birth control but that only made me gain 20lbs and didn&#x27;t clear anything up.</li>
            <li> I am uncertain if the cystic acne clear-up was due to this or discintinuing a new cleaner, so time will tell.  </li>
            <li> I need to clear up a few spots left from scratching the postules</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for me that I could observe or feel, negative or positive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and know that it does help with my skin (mainly acne).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never gone so long without breaking out</li>
            <li> And even though the first four-five months taking the supplements were arguably the worst I have had in regards to my acne (must have been a cleaning process), the results, and where I am now (almost no new breakouts, and when I do get them they are very manageable) is so worth</li>
            <li> At first I needed 3 caps 3 times a day and then less and less for a few months.</li>
            <li> You will definitely notice when the product has truly started to turn around your acne (blemished take less time to reduce swelling and heal) and from there it is all downhill.  </li>
            <li> My acne has not completely disappeared, but it has drastically decreased and has helped my self confidence so much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend the 200 tablet bottle as that will last you a month, anything less than that</li>
            <li> Once I started my second bottle the breakouts lessened and have been little to none.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a little research on the web, I called a local health food store and asked about any oral treatments they offered for acne.</li>
            <li> (I have a dark complexion and my dark pores used to be visible), but after beginning this product my pores seemed smaller, healthier, and not visible at all!!  </li>
            <li> so the shipping is minimal, and I started my journey.</li>
            <li> Found some empty capsules in the bottle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-existing pimples are definitely not as large or painful&lt;</li>
            <li> Finally I started to notice that my breakouts were not as severe until eventually I got them less and less until I wasn&#x27;t getting them at all.  </li>
            <li> This product truly did work to clear up my (male, mid-20&#x27;s) Acne, which prior to starting was as bad as it had ever been...</li>
            <li> The other difference I noticed were my pores.  </li>
            <li> I have not found any other product that works like this.  </li>
            <li> I am taking it again since I&#x27;ve have been breaking out due to hormonal issues.  </li>
            <li> Since Rosasea has been under control I only use 1 cap a day and no more redness in the face.</li>
            <li> I had read other reviews that said this takes time</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t have extreme acne to begin with</li>
            <li> but it looks like it&#x27;s very minimal.</li>
            <li> 3 years ago I was suffering from serious acne but didn&#x27;t want to go back to the dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> : Still had some cystic issues, prob around hormones, but less pervasive than before (1 rather than 3).</li>
            <li> less stressed&lt;br /&gt;-redness/hyper-pigmentation decreased&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took a very long time for the vitamin to calm my face down(close to 7 months of slowly reduced breakouts), but when I started taking the product I literally had acne growing out of my acne and forming large awful interconnected bumps</li>
            <li> nothing has gotten worse, and b) the cystic acne that had recently become an issue for me seems to have abated (which was why I was so desperate to find something that worked in the first place!).</li>
            <li> but I see little results.</li>
            <li> and I have been using it for a little over 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> Rx and supplements (oral/topical) have helped alleviate symptoms in the short term, but they never deal with the root of the problem and often, I found, they usually create other unnecessary and undesirable issues.</li>
            <li> For the past 20 years or so, I&#x27;d have occasional breakouts, but nothing so severe it would give me serious anxiety... until about Feb/Mar this year.</li>
            <li> Really eliminates cold sore breakouts etc...</li>
            <li> Admittedly it did take a few months for this product to work for me</li>
            <li> The health store sold me this product and with in a few weeks maybe 4....</li>
            <li> all of a sudden my skin got WORSE.</li>
            <li> I tried it for at least two months (six pills per day) and saw basically no positive changes in my skin.</li>
            <li> I even seem to get less razor burn after shaving!    </li>
            <li> My face was a mess!</li>
            <li> My husband has eczema that flares upon pretty badly on his head and face.</li>
            <li> I bought this product with very high hopes and bad acne.</li>
            <li> but from past usage - I know that it does work.</li>
            <li> Usually it works</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s been using it for a few years now and won&#x27;t go without it!</li>
            <li> It has helped me over the past couple of months with my skin.</li>
            <li> Having been on and off antibiotics and high-chemical topical treatments for over 12 years I was sick of the expense and nervous about the potential health effects (and annoyed with the bleach spots all over my clothing).  </li>
            <li> It progressively got worse until December, where it seemed the lower half of my face was covered in pimples.</li>
            <li> This product had hardly any effect on my skin--and what effect it did have might have been a placebo.</li>
            <li> A &amp; E and L-lysine, all commonly known to promote skin health.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry to be so negative.  </li>
            <li> Seems to help me avoid cold sores when I take it regularly!  </li>
            <li> After your skin clears up, keep at your dose for at least 2 months after that you can gradually decrease it, so if you&#x27;ve been taking 6 a day, take 4, if you&#x27;ve been taking 4, take 2.</li>
            <li> The seller does ship slowly via ground shipping, so order your refill ahead of time.  </li>
            <li> and I kept getting the same extremely painful cystic acne around my chin and lips.</li>
            <li> We ran out for 2 weeks and his acne got worse.</li>
            <li> In fact my acne is at its worse ever.</li>
            <li> so once I started the T-boost I knew it would get worse.</li>
            <li> Also and again I would recommend a topical treatment to go along side of this, at least in the beginning when things are going to be the worst</li>
            <li> This is an expensive vitamin how can it be happen with poor QC issue.</li>
            <li> In my late 20s I started breaking out really bad.</li>
            <li> Questionable product.</li>
            <li> I was desperate to do anything aside from going to the dermatologist and giving into drugs.</li>
            <li> I take a maintenance dose of 1 pill a day, and then I&#x27;ll take 3-6 per day if I feel the dreaded tingling that presages a cold sore.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t get a cold sore.</li>
            <li> I have bad and permanent indents all over myself</li>
            <li> Well...my face has been looking kid of bad.</li>
            <li> Frustrated with what the dermatologists offered, I went online and googled alternative medicine and rosacea and found a blog on herpanacine.</li>
            <li> Continuing to go to the tanning bed would be counterproductive but the breakouts made me crazy!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It was awful.</li>
            <li> The worst experience on Amazon ever.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The best supplements for acne ever made - period.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 40 (almost 41) year old homeschooling mom who all of a sudden 4 months ago started breaking out like never before. I struggled with acne as a teen, then it gradually went away. For the past 20 years or so, I&#x27;d have occasional breakouts, but nothing so severe it would give me serious anxiety... until about Feb/Mar this year. The acne was full-blown and hit me like a semi! It was awful. I was desperate to do anything aside from going to the dermatologist and giving into drugs. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of topical cleansers/treatments. It was so embarrassing that my face was worse off than most of the middle and high schoolers in our homeschooling community. I did a lot of research and found that this and Pantothenic Acid (which I&#x27;ve done an extensive review on here at Amazon) and Optizinc were supplements that could help. So, I got the PanAcid first, then this and Optizinc. The PanAcid seemed to help almost immediately, then I started this and optizinc along with it and things slowly got better. The acne was mostly on chin/lower face area, at one point, I counted more than 25 pimples - small to very large cystic types - and it was painful and very itchy. I just finished a colon detox and will start a candida cleanse soon. I can&#x27;t say that my acne has totally cleared up, but it is definitely better than a few months ago! I&#x27;m hoping that in a couple more months, I can come back with a great update. But I do believe that this, the PanAcid, and also Optizinc (I didn&#x27;t take this one religiously like the PanAcid and Herpanacine, but I do think it contributed to clearing the acne) were the primary supplements to clear up the acne to this point. Also, the colon detox, I&#x27;m sure, helped.&lt;br /&gt;Just looked at my notes and saw that I started taking this April 23rd, about 2 1/2 months ago... so the journey continues. From what I&#x27;ve read, it can take up 7-8 months for total clearing. I can honestly say that the acne for me is about 70% clear, so, so far it&#x27;s good. Will update in amonth or two.</li>
            <li> works well &amp; we&#x27;ve been using it for over a year now.  no ill effects noticed.  appears to heal skin injuries faster &amp; minimizes any scarring or discoloration.  will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product off and on for about six years now, and I can leave a genuine comment with full confidence stating that this product really works!  Unfortunately, I have suffered from cystic acne for most of my life (essentially since puberty), and like thousands of acne sufferers I made repeat visits to my dermatologist and tried every prescription and topical treatment under the sun.  While doing some research online about natural alternatives for acne I came across the Diamond Formula website and I took a chance and ordered this product.  Admittedly it did take a few months for this product to work for me (I was taking six capsules a day to begin with), but when it started to work for me...WOW!!  The first difference I noticed in my skin was the texture; it was smoother than it had ever been and was very soft to the touch.  The other difference I noticed were my pores.  My pores looked so clean and healthy (I have a dark complexion and my dark pores used to be visible), but after beginning this product my pores seemed smaller, healthier, and not visible at all!!  Finally I started to notice that my breakouts were not as severe until eventually I got them less and less until I wasn&#x27;t getting them at all.  Eventually, you are able to wean yourself off of this product, but if your breakouts begin to reoccur (like they usually do, ugh), all you have to do is start this product at the severe or moderate dosage again (between four-six capsules a day), and you should see a marked improvement in two-three months.  It is important to note that you still have to drink plenty of water, stay away from your breakout trigger foods (which differ from person to person), and have a very sound skin regimen to help this product to work, but I feel it is totally worth it for the results.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone that I know!</li>
            <li> I have not found any other product that works like this.  I have tried many other products including all of the different prescriptions from the doctor&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This has done wonders for my son&#x27;s psorasis.</li>
            <li> I was desparate to find something to control my rosacea with postules. My face was a mess! Frustrated with what the dermatologists offered, I went online and googled alternative medicine and rosacea and found a blog on herpanacine. With the positive reviews I decided to give it a try. I noticed a difference after the first day of taking it--the redness was pretty much gone. My coworker who was also suffering from rosacea gave me a sample tube of finacea she received from her dermatologist and that cleared up the rest of the red pimples within 5 days. During that time, I started eating a more alkaline diet after reading rosacea is caused by too much acid in the body. I started drinking water with juice of 1/2 lime in each glassful and eating more alkaline foods. I also started taking a supplement of magnesium with calcium and vitamin D. My face is looking almost pretty again. I need to clear up a few spots left from scratching the postules but I am not embarrassed about my face now. It looks better now than before I had the rosacea. The herpanacine definitely contributed to much of the improvement in my skin. I will continue to take it.</li>
            <li> As a product, it seems promising. I&#x27;ve been taking it for 2 mos. now. I did a bit of research on skin care vitamins. I especially liked that it had Vits. A &amp; E and L-lysine, all commonly known to promote skin health. Many other products seem like regular multivitamins. I also spoke w/ a rep. from the company before purchasing to confirm it was gluten free. She said it&#x27;d take between 2 &amp; 5 mos. to see results and sent me skin health material by mail. Combined w/ better skin care, my skin is getting better.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely worth the cost!  I&#x27;ve made it a routine to take two capsules in the morning and two in the evening.  If I remember, I sometimes take two in the middle of the day as well.  It has made a noticeable difference.  I even seem to get less razor burn after shaving!    The seller does ship slowly via ground shipping, so order your refill ahead of time.  It is worth it however, since you would end up paying just as much for a bottle that is half the size at the Vitamin Shoppe.</li>
            <li> 3 years ago I was suffering from serious acne but didn&#x27;t want to go back to the dermatologist.  Having been on and off antibiotics and high-chemical topical treatments for over 12 years I was sick of the expense and nervous about the potential health effects (and annoyed with the bleach spots all over my clothing).  So I decided on a more natural approach and came across herpanicine.  It took a very long time for the vitamin to calm my face down(close to 7 months of slowly reduced breakouts), but when I started taking the product I literally had acne growing out of my acne and forming large awful interconnected bumps so I had a lot of problems to heal.  But once herpanicine started working it really worked!  3 years later my skin is still smooth, soft and acne free.  I&#x27;ve never gone so long without breaking out and I&#x27;m so happy.  I love not worrying about gross topical creams and dr visits..easy to just pop the vitamins and forget about skin care.  I don&#x27;t even wear makeup anymore. :)  Beautiful results and I&#x27;m so happy that they&#x27;re natural..love that it addresses the root causes of acne and doesn&#x27;t just \\&quot;dry up pimples.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One recommendation though.  I started taking herpanacine with full blown acne.  My skin was pretty damaged to begin with, but with the length of time it took for herpanacine to kick in I have bad and permanent indents all over myself (ice picks I think they&#x27;re called?).  In hindsight I wish I had hauled ass to the derm one last time for fast relief that may have saved my skin from collagen loss and all these indents.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by a health care provider for my daughter who has developed adolescense acne. Already there are signs that the product is begining to be effective. Hopefully this trend will continue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and know that it does help with my skin (mainly acne).  I am taking it again since I&#x27;ve have been breaking out due to hormonal issues.  It hasn&#x27;t fully &#x27;kicked in&#x27; yet - but from past usage - I know that it does work.</li>
            <li> Let me first say this: Don&#x27;t take this product if you are expecting immediate results! I took this product for about 3 months before I saw results. Around the 6 month period, I was completely acne free and am now off the supplement completely! If you are struggling with acne, I also HIGHLY recommend checking out acne.org and daniel kern&#x27;s regimen. Herpancine + the regimen was the best decision I ever made!!</li>
            <li> and the vendor didn&#x27;t have enough information to track the item. The worst experience on Amazon ever. I will never buy again from this vendor.</li>
            <li> I took Herpanacine for 3 months in hopes that it would help clear up severe cystic acne. It didn&#x27;t do anything for me that I could observe or feel, negative or positive.  Rx and supplements (oral/topical) have helped alleviate symptoms in the short term, but they never deal with the root of the problem and often, I found, they usually create other unnecessary and undesirable issues. My experience with any health issue is to improve eating/nutrition and sleep habits to effect real lasting and noticeable change.</li>
            <li> On time , exactly what I wanted !</li>
            <li> I like the product and keep taking it, though I&#x27;m not seeing immense skin improvements. It may be that I need to increase the dose (I&#x27;m taking the minimum recommended), or my skin&#x27;s issues simply lie somewhere else.</li>
            <li> I used this product when I was in high school (5 yrs ago). It cleared up my skin completly! My skin was clear for the most part of my high school days until I guess around 14yrs old. My face broke right out. The health store sold me this product and with in a few weeks maybe 4....my face was clear! Years have gone by and you know when you stop using a good product you forget about it? Well...my face has been looking kid of bad. I went to the Derm. and they&#x27;ve given me pills, creams, peels. I&#x27;ve tried face washes (you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it or considered it). Anyway I was back in the health store and I saw Herpanacine and I brought it. Well I&#x27;ve been using it for about 1 week and my period pimples are smaller then what they would normally be. I take (3)morning and afternoon. I&#x27;ll do that for about 2 more months and then work my way down to (1) a day. I also started using Biore (blemish fighting ice cleanser and toner) they work good too. I hope this helps someone out there!</li>
            <li> I have been taken this supplement for over 9 years and find it&#x27;s the best for Rosasea, there is nothing better and safe on the market that I know of.  At first I needed 3 caps 3 times a day and then less and less for a few months. Since Rosasea has been under control I only use 1 cap a day and no more redness in the face. WOW Wonderful!</li>
            <li> I was encouraged by a friend to take Herpanacine for hormonal acne that I have been experiencing. I loved going to the tanning bed and realized that if I went my skin was clear, if I stopped tanning breakouts would start to appear. I am 43 yrs old and have been concerned about caring for my skin and the fine lines and wrinkles that are starting to appear. Continuing to go to the tanning bed would be counterproductive but the breakouts made me crazy! I purchased Herpanacine, I have Prime w/ Amazon so the shipping is minimal, and I started my journey. I am now on my second bottle, I take 4 a day in the evening. The acne at first multiplied (as my friend said it would). Prepare to go through a cleansing process! The first thing I noticed was the overall texture of my skin...WOW, it feels like silk! My skin has never felt like this before, it is truly amazing. Once I started my second bottle the breakouts lessened and have been little to none. This product is worth every inexpensive penny for the results. The skin on my face is looking fantastic as well as the skin all over my body, such an amazing product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month now and basically have not seen any improvement.  It doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel any different than before I started using it.  I honestly wish it did, because the pills are relatively easy to take, and I don&#x27;t have any problems with after-taste or anything like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, maybe I would have to use it for a longer period of time, but I am not planning on purchasing it again, so I will never know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry to be so negative.  Just truthful.</li>
            <li> Only thing that keeps cysts and acne away</li>
            <li> Herpanacine is working for my rosacia and for my sons acne. We ran out for 2 weeks and his acne got worse.</li>
            <li> Seems to help me avoid cold sores when I take it regularly!  I take a maintenance dose of 1 pill a day, and then I&#x27;ll take 3-6 per day if I feel the dreaded tingling that presages a cold sore.  Usually it works and I don&#x27;t get a cold sore.</li>
            <li> My husband has eczema that flares upon pretty badly on his head and face. He actually bought this initially after a shingles outbreak about 5 years ago and it cleared it right up. Now he takes it preventively for his eczema. It seems to help but has not made it go away completely and that&#x27;s why I only give it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> this product is great. its been really making my skin clear up and also allowing for my skin to look brighter and healthier.</li>
            <li> In my late 20s I started breaking out really bad. I tried numerous acne products and went to a dermatologist for a couple of years....nothing worked.....until I tried Herpanacine. I noticed results after a couple of days. I have used it for over 15 years with great results. Initial dosage I used was six capsules a day. Maintenance dosage I use is 4 capsules a day.</li>
            <li> Excellent for acne, made my skin clear up and glow</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this product. I read about its affects in Amazon particularly with teenagers using it to clear up their acne. Being older that is not a concern with me however I can say that when taking daily for the past month, my skin tone looks much better and my face has &amp;#34;cleaned-up&amp;#34; a bit and looks better. Not a huge change but enough that I have better looking skin. For me it has zero side-affects without any of the supplement buzz that many products create as I am very sensitive to drugs and supplements. I take this product right after dinner so I let it work in me while I sleep.</li>
            <li> This product does a great job keeping various skin issues at bay, such as rosacia. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product truly did work to clear up my (male, mid-20&#x27;s) Acne, which prior to starting was as bad as it had ever been...then it got worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My breakouts started occurring more often (sometime multiple times a day) and took weeks to heal.  New breakouts were like mutant blemished that I had never had before (most likely border-lining on cystic).  I had read other reviews that said this takes time so I continued with my daily regimen of taking three pills in the morning and three pills in the afternoon.  And even though the first four-five months taking the supplements were arguably the worst I have had in regards to my acne (must have been a cleaning process), the results, and where I am now (almost no new breakouts, and when I do get them they are very manageable) is so worth the wait and the pain of the first four-five months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did, and still do, use this with a topical treatment regimen with helps to keep everything under control, though I hope to curb that regimen down a little bit as keeping on top of all these steps is a bit of a nuisance (again though it is definitely worth it compared to where I was a few months ago).  Also, it did help me to start eating healthier (lots more vegetables than I had been used to eating, and staying away from a lot of coffee at work).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please give this product time as it seems to be a true cleansing process, but in the end is totally worth it.  You will definitely notice when the product has truly started to turn around your acne (blemished take less time to reduce swelling and heal) and from there it is all downhill.  Also and again I would recommend a topical treatment to go along side of this, at least in the beginning when things are going to be the worst (the regimen at acne.org worked great for me and there is a lot of good info at there website).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product really was a life-changer for me, as the boost it has given my skin has directly affected my confidence in all other aspects of my life.  Wish I could give it 6 stars and would have started it four years ago!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck!pects of my life.  Wish I could give it 6 stars and would have started it four years ago!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck!</li>
            <li> After doing hours of research on the internet looking into what vitamins reduce genital herpes outbreaks, I found this product at a local Whole Foods (at twice the price - Amazon is the way to go).  All of the ingredients that work to suppress outbreaks were in this pill.  This product, in conjunction with vitamin C and Valtrex, has made me outbreak free.  I take 2 pills, 2x per day. . . . it is a miracle!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31 and have had mild-moderate adult acne for a while, and like most, I have tried many products (nothing dr. prescribed though).  I figured this was worth a shot given the rave reviews.  So far, not much change, but I&#x27;m pleased that a) nothing has gotten worse, and b) the cystic acne that had recently become an issue for me seems to have abated (which was why I was so desperate to find something that worked in the first place!). I am uncertain if the cystic acne clear-up was due to this or discintinuing a new cleaner, so time will tell.  I plan to continue multiple months and will edit this review with updates!  (I&#x27;m doing well with remembering my 6 pills/day) yes the pills are big, yes you take a lot, but if it works...well worth it!  Here&#x27;s to hoping for truly clear and healthy skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 1/21/13: Still had some cystic issues, prob around hormones, but less pervasive than before (1 rather than 3). I also just realized I won&#x27;t be at one month until the end of this week, so patience is still a big part of the game!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 4/7/13: I hadn&#x27;t had any cystic acne issues for a while (yay!), but one just popped up today. I continue to use the 6 pills/day regimen, but overall, my skin hasn&#x27;t improved much, if at all. I will keep at it through 6 months (I&#x27;m still looking for a miracle!), but I&#x27;m starting to lose hope :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 6/8/13: We&#x27;re approaching the 6 month mark, and my skin&#x27;s about the same as it was on my last update. I continue to use the 6 pills/day regimen. And still I go back for more!</li>
            <li> All household members have benefited Greatly</li>
            <li> She swears it keeps her skin happy, healthy, and hydrated.  She&#x27;s been using it for a few years now and won&#x27;t go without it!</li>
            <li> Found some empty capsules in the bottle. This is an expensive vitamin how can it be happen with poor QC issue. I called up customer service and she told me to send it back and reorder. They can not replace another bottle for me. This is not my fault so why shall I pay for the postage to send this bottle back???</li>
            <li> I bought this product with very high hopes and bad acne. It&#x27;s been over 3 months since I have taken this product and I am on my 3rd bottle. So far this product has not worked for me. In fact my acne is at its worse ever. I totally understand the whole flushing out period and I thought that&#x27;s what my body was doing the first month I took this, but now almost 4 months in I know it is not working for me. I am very disappointed. I guess it worked for some but not for me.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for more energy and smooth skin this is great!  I would recommend these capsules for sure.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how effective this is in helping my acne.  When I stop taking it though my skin does flair up again.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. My husband &amp; friends have taken it for years. Really eliminates cold sore breakouts etc...great stuff</li>
            <li> Great product...Works really well. It has helped me over the past couple of months with my skin. Low-cost was a plus.</li>
            <li> This product had hardly any effect on my skin--and what effect it did have might have been a placebo. Conveniently for the marketers, it takes several months to work. I tried it for at least two months (six pills per day) and saw basically no positive changes in my skin. Questionable product.</li>
            <li> This product has helped me so much. I do not usually write reviews, but I feel like I should because of how much Herpanacine has helped my skin! I have struggled with cystic acne since I was put on the pill about 3 years ago. It really effected my skin negatively and nothing i tried (minocycline, topical gels) helped very much. I stopped taking the pill in July and got an IUD (Mirena) and all of a sudden my skin got WORSE. It was super discouraging....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a little research on the web, I called a local health food store and asked about any oral treatments they offered for acne. The woman on the phone recommended Herpanacine and I&#x27;m so glad that she did. It has helped to minimize my cystic acne, which was mostly around my mouth and chin, and I have also noticed that my hair is softer and nails are stronger. If I forget to take the pills, it does show in my face, but simply taking them regularly gets my skin back on track. My acne has not completely disappeared, but it has drastically decreased and has helped my self confidence so much.</li>
            <li> the image shows the normal herpanacine pills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but i was delivered the vegetarian capsules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;apparently, they have different supplement facts and looked different from the normal ones as well.</li>
            <li> My teenager has been taking this daily, and his acne has improved tremendously!  We are so excited.  We have tried so many different products - and without insurance to go to a Dermatologist, we have searched and researched quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Love this pills. The really have helped me to have a clearer skin. If I start to get some pimples, I just try three pills for couple of days and that is it!. My routine are only two pills a day. A must for people with acne prone skin. It should be advertised more!</li>
            <li> this product works and i first found it at the health food store; the healing properties of the product gets rid of bacteria in your body; my skin cleared up immediately after I started taking it; it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> I got it as recommended for my recent acne issues. And I shell not regret. I started seeing improvement after months of using it, though.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t seem to help much.  Maybe I haven&#x27;t given it time but I see little results. Don&#x27;t think I will reorder.</li>
            <li> This product works very well in any type of skin. I am seing results in just 30 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had baby soft, clear skin until last June when it started to breakout very mildly.  It progressively got worse until December, where it seemed the lower half of my face was covered in pimples. I researched everything and ended up finding Herpanacine.  After taking six capsules a day (a lot, but worth it) for five weeks, I can say there&#x27;s not a single pimple on my face.  I will continue ordering.</li>
            <li> I like how this product consists of important vitamins and minerals most of us should be familiar with (Vitamin A, E, Zinc, etc.) so that part is pretty safe. Of course there are herbs in here but it looks like it&#x27;s very minimal. I haven&#x27;t been taking it long enough to see a complete improvement in my mild, yet bothersome acne issues but here is what I have noticed so far:&lt;br /&gt;1) Skin:&lt;br /&gt;-looks less stressed&lt;br /&gt;-redness/hyper-pigmentation decreased&lt;br /&gt;-existing pimples are definitely not as large or painful&lt;br /&gt;2) Other:&lt;br /&gt;-Better sleep at night&lt;br /&gt;-More focused during the day&lt;br /&gt;Both of the above mentioned here I think has something to do with the fact that there is L-tyrosine in this supplement which helps improve dopamine levels.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this product for more than its skin benefits. This seems to be a great supplement for overall health.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for almost three months now and honestly my skin didn&#x27;t get any better. I still have acne as I had. I take 3 in the morning and 3 lunch time. However I know it&#x27;s packs with good herbs so I&#x27;ll continue using it anyway. I read really good reviews on it. So maybe it just takes time.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent and natural way to tackle acne. I&#x27;ve used it successfully before, the key thing is to use it consistently and to start at the appropriate dose for you. If your acne is severe, start with 6 pills a day (fun I know). If it&#x27;s moderate start with for pills a day. Since it&#x27;s natural it does take a while to see results. It ranges from 2-8 months for people. After your skin clears up, keep at your dose for at least 2 months after that you can gradually decrease it, so if you&#x27;ve been taking 6 a day, take 4, if you&#x27;ve been taking 4, take 2. Over time once your acne troubles are over, you can decrease it to the maintenance level which is just 2 easy pills a day! If you do have severe acne I&#x27;d recommend the 200 tablet bottle as that will last you a month, anything less than that will only last you 2 weeks. Great product!</li>
            <li> This product arrives when promised . A good food supplement. I have have not had any problems with this prove der.</li>
            <li> I was first recommended to this product at a GNC where it was way overpriced. I was recommended the product when I told The GNC owner I was starting a Testosterone Booster to put on more size in the gym. The thing is that Im still a young man who already has acne to begin with so once I started the T-boost I knew it would get worse. I will say that my acne has been pretty good to me for a 20 year old with extra testosterone in his body... My acne isn&#x27;t the only thing benefiting, overall skin health is visibly and physically healthier. I would recommend this product because its been helping me a great deal. I just wish I knew about it back in middle school! I have found that taking 1 in the morning, one at lunch, and two before bed has been the most effective. Cheers!</li>
            <li> My daughter cannot live without this herpanacine.  I have seen her run out of it and boy her skin did not look so smooth. Herpanacine takes care of ruddiness of the face and also smooth texture.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I never had acne before until I hit 29 and I kept getting the same extremely painful cystic acne around my chin and lips. I decided to go back on birth control but that only made me gain 20lbs and didn&#x27;t clear anything up. I got a prescription from my doctor for an antibiotic to use for 3 months that wouldn&#x27;t clear up the acne I had, but may clear up future breakouts, well I didn&#x27;t want to be on antibiotics for 3 months so I researched herpanacine and I have been using it for a little over 6 weeks. I didn&#x27;t have acne anywhere except my chin and as of today, I have NO BREAKOUTS. I started taking 6 capsules a day but now that my skin is totally clear, I am using 2 capsules a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have extreme acne to begin with so my results may be different from yours, but I really think this product helped me.</li>
