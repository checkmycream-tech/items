            <li>I got this for a gift &amp; the recipient said that this is the best constructed, sturdy&lt;br /&gt;rolling case.</li>

            <li>she is so happy with the quality of this makeup case.  </li>
            <li>Someone doesn&#x27;t buy a case like this because they own two lipsticks and some mascara; it&#x27;s for people who own a ton of makeup and need a convenient and portable way to store it!  </li>
            <li>This product would be great for any makeup artist looking to get more organized.</li>
            <li>It is handsome and practically priced!</li>
            <li>The product has a good choice of colors to select from and is very light weight.</li>
            <li>Quality deluxe.  </li>
            <li>I will have to invest more</li>
            <li>Is it ok?</li>
            <li>fits everything she has and still room for more</li>
            <li>I had the two cases buckled together and lifted it from the top handle.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve begun to have more issues with the quality of the construction.  </li>
            <li>,however, it seemed to be an easy fix.  </li>
            <li>With this case, all of my products fit into one case that is easily protable and keeps everything well organized and easy to find.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty pleased with it.</li>
            <li>ORIGINAL TITLE:</li>
            <li>I got it on time , good conditions it is really usefull to put all my make up and do my job its really complete !!</li>
            <li>Good for on the go as she travel to different photo shoots.</li>
            <li>far as the case itself and its usefulness is concerned, I&#x27;m thrilled.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic for this purpose, very organized with easy visualization of contents.  </li>
            <li>I also appreciate how quick and helpful customer service answered any questions I had about the product.</li>
            <li>this thing is freaking awesome its got lots of room I can fit all my tattooing equipment into it and still have room left for my flshart and all my other paperwork for tattooing</li>
            <li>I love my new makeup case.  </li>
            <li>I kind of agree with other reviewers that it isn&#x27;t really strong and sturdy but, it&#x27;s not Samsonite.</li>
            <li>The internal construction had some cosmetic flaws, but I am crafty and understand that this size case can sell for 350.00 if more were put into it.</li>
            <li>Enough compartments to keep everything nice and neatly.</li>
            <li>Duty and High Quality are not words to be used lightly, I would recommend to find another buyer if you are planning to acquire this.</li>
            <li>You can use only the top one by itself because the bottom one does not have a cover on it.</li>
            <li>The felt in the top box began to bend within a week and the SECOND week</li>
            <li>The design is perfect for holding all of my items, but the construction quality is sadly lacking.  </li>
            <li>I bought a similar one from another provider but it broke after 6 months, which was good enough</li>
            <li>I tried having one smaller travel kit for shows, but I like to be spontaneous and try new things as I&#x27;m getting ready and that became very prohibitive.  </li>
            <li>While the top compartment its mainly lighter supplies I do keep my airbrush compressor, 5 pounds of modeling clay, and a big bottle of liquid latex in the bottom</li>
            <li>The metal piece on the top case that the buckle from bottom piece attaches to started to pull loose from the case.  </li>
            <li>I paid WAY TO MUCH for this piece of junk.</li>
            <li>Very unprofessional.</li>
            <li>I was able to push it back into place and secure it with duct tape, but many might not be willing to put up with shoddy construction for the sake of extra storage and frankly, they shouldn&#x27;t have to.  </li>
            <li>I love that the bottom part of the container is a larger open space to hold all of those items that never seem to fit into smaller cases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really BIG, right from the gate!</li>
            <li>so it does carry a decent weight.</li>
            <li>The only draw back was that the bottom of the top case was not in place when I recieved it</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t had to roll it around much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a small inconvenience, and I still really do love this</li>
            <li>I realize that I have a lot of product and that it can get heavy, but that&#x27;s exactly the reason I ordered a large case like this!  </li>
            <li>While you must not act crazy with this, it is lightweight and very good for starting</li>
            <li>Within minutes of attempting to use it..it is clear that the latches dont work.</li>
            <li>It is definitely NOT HEAVY DUTY, in any sense of the term.</li>
            <li>I am looking into ways to get it fixed, but for now when I travel I have to load the two pieces separately and then reattach them when I get where I&#x27;m going.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my girlfriend (professional make up artist and stylist), it immediatly fell apart at the latches before even being used.</li>
            <li>did have a small hardware issue with this case: once it was filled</li>
            <li>I can fit all my nails equipment into it and still have room left for my tweezers, scissors, paint brushes,  and all my other stuff!!</li>
            <li>I was on a week long trip to Texas when the wheel fell off on the FIRST DAY so for the rest of the trip I had to pick up and carry the entire thing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lovely to look at, but so poorly built that I cannot use it.</li>

            <li> It has ample room and extremely sturdy.</li>
            <li> and I expected this to last at least 4-5 months.</li>
            <li> I like that you can break it down into two separate compartments.</li>
            <li> is the reply I got from them as I contacted them after less than 2 months after I bought this.</li>
            <li> that I&#x27;ve been using this case for a little while longer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed because even though you can separate them you can only use one of them individually.</li>
            <li> Had A Small Hardware Issue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks for the worthless product.</li>
            <li> There is even a small matching easel mirror!</li>
            <li> This is such a worthless piece of junk.</li>
            <li> and it continues to get worse.</li>
            <li> To expensive for the quality of it...</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Thanks for your picture and sorry for all the troubles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One comment about the shipping packaging was that it was very broken &amp;&lt;br /&gt;poorly taped &amp; sealed.</li>
            <li> Very poor build and material quality.</li>
            <li> But for now I like it and would recommend it if you don&#x27;t want to shell out a crazy amount of money but still get something that does the job even if not perfectly.</li>
            <li> You think you get what you pay for :(</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this case.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great size holds almost all of my makeup . I like that you can break it down into two separate compartments. So happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I received this product today and once I removed it from the box I noticed that the silver bracket is bent and the bottom of the box is warped.  Just contacted company to see if it can be replaced.</li>
            <li> Its not as durable as I expected ... It works for the purpose but I can see my self replacing it soon ....  To expensive for the quality of it... You think you get what you pay for :( I will have to invest more it seems like ...</li>
            <li> While you must not act crazy with this, it is lightweight and very good for starting up- really BIG, right from the gate! The internal construction had some cosmetic flaws, but I am crafty and understand that this size case can sell for 350.00 if more were put into it. It is handsome and practically priced! There is even a small matching easel mirror!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Thanks for your picture and sorry for all the troubles. How about we refund you $6 and you fix it yourself? Is it ok? Please advise.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;That is the reply I got from them as I contacted them after less than 2 months after I bought this. I bought a similar one from another provider but it broke after 6 months, which was good enough and I expected this to last at least 4-5 months. I feel greatly offended and insulted by the reply I got from them after all I did was ask them if there was any way to solve it, either send it back and get a replacement or a refund.&lt;br /&gt;Heavy Duty and High Quality are not words to be used lightly, I would recommend to find another buyer if you are planning to acquire this.</li>
            <li> This product would be great for any makeup artist looking to get more organized. The product has a good choice of colors to select from and is very light weight. I also appreciate how quick and helpful customer service answered any questions I had about the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed because even though you can separate them you can only use one of them individually. You can use only the top one by itself because the bottom one does not have a cover on it. I know it does not show in the picture. Therefore it is my mistake to assume that it was going to bring the middle cover. That is why I am writing this review to make other buyers notice.</li>
            <li> she is so happy with the quality of this makeup case.  fits everything she has and still room for more</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this case. It&#x27;s lovely to look at, but so poorly built that I cannot use it. It is definitely NOT HEAVY DUTY, in any sense of the term.</li>
            <li> perfect for keeping my equipment neatly organized!!!</li>
            <li> This is such a worthless piece of junk. Within minutes of attempting to use it..it is clear that the latches dont work. The felt in the top box began to bend within a week and the SECOND week I had it one of the wheels fell off and it continues to get worse. Now only the side clamps work which hold both parts together. I paid WAY TO MUCH for this piece of junk. I hope there is a way to fix this situation. I NEEDED this for my job as a model and makeup artist and all it had done is been a problem. I was on a week long trip to Texas when the wheel fell off on the FIRST DAY so for the rest of the trip I had to pick up and carry the entire thing. Very unprofessional. I will be posting this on the reviews. Thanks for the worthless product.</li>
            <li> Purchase for my wife and she loves it. Enough compartments to keep everything nice and neatly. Good for on the go as she travel to different photo shoots.</li>
            <li> I got this for a gift &amp; the recipient said that this is the best constructed, sturdy&lt;br /&gt;rolling case. Quality deluxe.  Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One comment about the shipping packaging was that it was very broken &amp;&lt;br /&gt;poorly taped &amp; sealed. The packaging was open before accepted to check&lt;br /&gt;the product.  The product had no damage to it at all.  Thank goodness.</li>
            <li> I got this to store and carry around my makeup supplies and I&#x27;m pretty pleased with it. I kind of agree with other reviewers that it isn&#x27;t really strong and sturdy but, it&#x27;s not Samsonite. I got what I paid for and what I expected. While the top compartment its mainly lighter supplies I do keep my airbrush compressor, 5 pounds of modeling clay, and a big bottle of liquid latex in the bottom so it does carry a decent weight. My only issue so far is the handle, its a little flimsy and it won&#x27;t retract all the way without me pushing in the peg on the side bar. So far I haven&#x27;t had to roll it around much so I can&#x27;t say if the handle will hold up well in my case just yet. But for now I like it and would recommend it if you don&#x27;t want to shell out a crazy amount of money but still get something that does the job even if not perfectly.</li>
            <li> I am using this as a case to carry my supplies for home birth.  It&#x27;s fantastic for this purpose, very organized with easy visualization of contents.  Not sure how it will hold up though, it seems to be marginally rugged, but if it holds up for a reasonable time, it will be a bargain.</li>
            <li> ORIGINAL TITLE: An Excellent Case, But Had A Small Hardware Issue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the case itself and its usefulness is concerned, I&#x27;m thrilled.  When I travel for shows, I used to have to lug around 4 different cosmetics cases.  I tried having one smaller travel kit for shows, but I like to be spontaneous and try new things as I&#x27;m getting ready and that became very prohibitive.  With this case, all of my products fit into one case that is easily protable and keeps everything well organized and easy to find.  I love that the bottom part of the container is a larger open space to hold all of those items that never seem to fit into smaller cases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have a small hardware issue with this case: once it was filled I had the two cases buckled together and lifted it from the top handle.  The metal piece on the top case that the buckle from bottom piece attaches to started to pull loose from the case.  I realize that I have a lot of product and that it can get heavy, but that&#x27;s exactly the reason I ordered a large case like this!  I am looking into ways to get it fixed, but for now when I travel I have to load the two pieces separately and then reattach them when I get where I&#x27;m going.  It&#x27;s a small inconvenience, and I still really do love this case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update 2/26/2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve been using this case for a little while longer, I&#x27;ve begun to have more issues with the quality of the construction.  I lifted up the smaller detachable case and the bottom fell off!  I was able to push it back into place and secure it with duct tape, but many might not be willing to put up with shoddy construction for the sake of extra storage and frankly, they shouldn&#x27;t have to.  Someone doesn&#x27;t buy a case like this because they own two lipsticks and some mascara; it&#x27;s for people who own a ton of makeup and need a convenient and portable way to store it!  The design is perfect for holding all of my items, but the construction quality is sadly lacking.  Unless you are like me and willing to sigh and fix what goes wrong for the sake of using this case, you might want to look elsewhere for your storage needs.Unless you are like me and willing to sigh and fix what goes wrong for the sake of using this case, you might want to look elsewhere for your storage needs.</li>
            <li> I got it on time , good conditions it is really usefull to put all my make up and do my job its really complete !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a case for quite sometime.  I saw one at the mall for the same price but it didn&#x27;t seem as sturdy as this one is.  The kit was literally here 2 days after I ordered it. It has ample room and extremely sturdy.I love my new makeup case.  The only draw back was that the bottom of the top case was not in place when I recieved it,however, it seemed to be an easy fix.  I would definitely recommend!!!</li>
            <li> This case broke within a week of buying it. Poor construction and cheap materials.</li>
