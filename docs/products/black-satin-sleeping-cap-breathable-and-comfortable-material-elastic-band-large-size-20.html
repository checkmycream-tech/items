            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t come off when I sleep, a very nice size and shape.</li>
            <li>Does not fall off during sleep and a good way of preserving hair styles.  </li>
            <li>It is a good buy.</li>
            <li>Good price for an item like this.</li>
            <li>Is this a good nite cap for someone who uses an apnea machine.  </li>
            <li>I use these all the time and they do keep your hair do in good shape.</li>
            <li>This one is especially nice and light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good and it gets the job done</li>

            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>More &amp;#34;good hair days&amp;#34; for me!</li>
            <li>Nice cap, good value :)</li>
            <li>It is effective in keeping the rollers in place.  </li>
            <li>This inexpensive yet effective item does the trick.</li>
            <li>It really is breathable and is perfect for your hair because it&#x27;s silky.</li>
            <li>They are very strong.</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable and you do not&lt;</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>very comfortable sleeping cap</li>
            <li>I love this cap, it&#x27;s very comfortable</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m prone to headaches if anything puts pressure on my head, and I&#x27;m pleased to report no headaches with this cap.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d rather have a goofy looking sleeping cap than a line on my forehead all day.</li>
            <li>I love the protection it gives my hair from breakage and keeping my style in tact.  </li>
            <li>I love this and it fits over my flexy rods and it don&#x27;t fall off while sleeping</li>
            <li>I am ordering some more.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>If you have a big head or a lot of hair(I have both)this is perfect</li>
            <li>but I put this over my wrap just to make sure that my hair is protected.</li>
            <li>Your better off buying it from Walmart</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so comfortable when I go to sleep!</li>
            <li>Love this sleeping cap, stays on all night.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, the size is great and the fit just right.</li>
            <li>I love how light weight the cap is,allowing my hair to breath.</li>
            <li>Because of the decorative frill it is not as easy to grab and go as it&#x27;s not reversible.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s smooth inside and out and doesn&#x27;t cause friction with my hair or my pillowcase.</li>
            <li>so far, so good...</li>
            <li>My pillow cases stay clean.  </li>
            <li>after using these caps for a few months I am more than happy.</li>
            <li>Although the description is of a &amp;#34;satin sleep cap,&amp;#34; the fabric is more aptly described as a nylon tricot or similar synthetic knitted tissue.  </li>
            <li>I gave the product a four star rating because it is a really nice product and very soft</li>
            <li>It keeps my curls in place, which I love and its much nicer than wearing a head scarf.  </li>
            <li>This is very helpful to sleep with, I love it.</li>
            <li>it kept on that&#x27;s good and its comfy enough</li>
            <li>We both wear are hair at this time natural and these are so nice to sleep in instead of using scarves.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t stay in place very well but is ok</li>
            <li>all fits into this cap pretty easily.</li>
            <li>so it was nice to see that wraps the hair nicely without being too lose or tight.</li>
            <li>Again a super buy.</li>
            <li>Seemed really great but after about a week of sleeping with it, it wants to slide off in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li>A lot of the time I wear my hair wrapped up in ethnic scarves, which are very hot and can make my locks sweat.</li>
            <li>I have long keratin treated hair &amp; this is good for the sleep &amp; yes breathable</li>
            <li>It stayed on all night and was very lightweight and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I use this every night for the past 4 months and it&#x27;s worked perfectly, the only problem I have is that it lost it&#x27;s tightness really easily</li>
            <li>I thought it was just go right through this fabric</li>
            <li>Wearing it right now as I type.</li>
            <li>The satin on this one is not as smooth, which causes more drag, and combined with ... 2.</li>
            <li>Good&#x27;s sleep with this black sleeping cap.</li>
            <li>This cab fits great and accommodates my larger than normal head and naturally styled hairstyles.  </li>
            <li>It is very comfortable, and I use it when I have hair rollers in my hair, or if I want to sleep with a french braid.</li>
            <li>except it dont fit all the way and it slides up in back and sometimes its half off when i wake but its great</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t get too hot with this on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly as it was described in the details.</li>
            <li>Pretty much all you need in a sleeping cap!</li>
            <li>I throw them into the washer and drying without any special treatment and they come out looking like new.</li>
            <li>It fits nicely but is not too tight, and allows your head to breathe</li>
            <li>I really like this caps, they keep your hair moisturized and don&#x27;t strip it of its oils.  </li>
            <li>Thanks a bunch.</li>
            <li>The fabric did not feel like real satin but something like it.</li>
            <li>but I miss the feel of real satin to protect hairdo.</li>
            <li>THANK YOU FOR A VERY INEXPENSIVE ITEM.</li>
            <li>Very durable</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really stay on my head the whole night...</li>
            <li>The cap came in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>The only thing is it might not be reasonable to most people who can just go to their local Wal Mart or whatever, I however cannot so it was worth it for me.</li>
            <li>This cap works for its purpose, but it&#x27;s not the very nicest fabric I&#x27;ve ever seen.  </li>
            <li>The elastic band loosens easily and doesn&#x27;t maintain its form for long so</li>
            <li>I can put this on after a shower with completely damp/wet hair, and wake up with dry, mostly non-flat curls.</li>
            <li>It stays on while I sleep, is nice and soft, and not too tight.</li>
            <li>I consider this a good little investment and would definitely Purchased them again.&lt;br /&gt;Update....</li>
            <li>I have really thick crochet braids in and this cap is still able to hold everything!</li>
            <li>is that the cap is abit to loose fit.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>cap is comfortable and price is what I expected to pay</li>
            <li>if you buy one, chances are you will need to buy a few more.</li>
            <li>(Granted, I live in the desert</li>
            <li>I purchased three of these caps since where I live</li>
            <li>They never slip off of my hair during my wild sleeping!</li>
            <li>This sleeping cap fits just fine without being tight or being too lose to go off at night.</li>
            <li>Finally I can make an all positive feedback.</li>
            <li>This product has taken my naturally curly hair to another level.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to people who are going natural</li>
            <li>(I lean forward so my head is upside down, plop my hair into the cap, tuck in stray pieces, then come right side up.)</li>
            <li>I have a pretty average head</li>
            <li>it keeps hair moist and not dry</li>
            <li>The material is quite smooth but not a good quality satin.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair and having it rub on a cotton pillow case leaves my hair dry and breakage happens.</li>
            <li>The price altogether was worth it for me, because I live in an isolated tourist community where it would be very hard to find something like this, and more expensive.</li>

            <li> The price altogether was worth it for me, because I live in an isolated tourist community where it would be very hard to find something like this, and more expensive.</li>
            <li> Not many options for AA products where I live.  </li>
            <li> For the following reasons I prefer the other, and have reordered that one and will not repurchase this one.</li>
            <li> so things dry</li>
            <li> My hair is natural and sometimes due to being a bit heavy handed with oils and butters</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty thin fabric</li>
            <li> This cap last a few months before coming apart at the seams.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really a fan of this product.</li>
            <li> The one I received had little tabs that I could tie, which keep the cap from being too loose.</li>
            <li> the only problem or complaint</li>
            <li> the elastic is weak and loose... makes it likely to fall off in the night.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to find a basic satin black cap.</li>
            <li> band is too tight around heas</li>
            <li> Breathable and snuggles really tight around the hair lines.  </li>
            <li> It stays on all night, the elastic is not too tight that it cuts into your head.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping this cap wasn&#x27;t gonna be to tight</li>
            <li> Tight on my head,  gave it to my daughter</li>
            <li> However, the synthetic means that the cap is slick and slippery</li>
            <li> When I first received it I was a bit skeptical since it was very thin</li>
            <li> The workmanship is quite poor and not worth the price.</li>

            <li> I bought this cap to sleep in while my hair sets for my braid out. My hair is VERY thick so I knew I needed a big cap and this one did the trick! It stayed on all night and was very lightweight and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Nice cap, good value :)</li>
            <li> I love these! They never slip off of my hair during my wild sleeping! I have three of these!</li>
            <li> The material is quite smooth but not a good quality satin. The workmanship is quite poor and not worth the price. it manages to stay on at night since it is not satin.</li>
            <li> band is too tight around heas</li>
            <li> Breathable and snuggles really tight around the hair lines.  Does not fall off during sleep and a good way of preserving hair styles.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  It stays on all night, the elastic is not too tight that it cuts into your head.  It is very comfortable and you do not&lt;br /&gt;even know that you have it on.</li>
            <li> It was too big, I didn&#x27;t read the size. After using it for a while, it wouldn&#x27;t stay on my head throughout the night.</li>
            <li> I really like this caps, they keep your hair moisturized and don&#x27;t strip it of its oils.  It is a good buy.</li>
            <li> When I put rollers in overnight, I use this cap to keep them from moving around while I sleep.  It is effective in keeping the rollers in place.  It fits nicely but is not too tight, and allows your head to breathe so you don&#x27;t get too hot with this on.</li>
            <li> It keeps my curls in place, which I love and its much nicer than wearing a head scarf.  I have a short hair cut so I just need to brush the sides and run my fingers through my curls...so far, so good...its a keeper and an item that I would recommend others purchase.</li>
            <li> Seems to slip off my hair during the night</li>
            <li> I was hoping this cap wasn&#x27;t gonna be to tight that was gonna give me a headache,  so it was nice to see that wraps the hair nicely without being too lose or tight.</li>
            <li> When I wake up it&#x27;s always somewhere else but my head.</li>
            <li> This product has taken my naturally curly hair to another level.  More &amp;#34;good hair days&amp;#34; for me! Thanks a bunch.</li>
            <li> This is very helpful to sleep with, I love it. I would recommend this to people who are going natural</li>
            <li> The fabric did not feel like real satin but something like it. but I miss the feel of real satin to protect hairdo.</li>
            <li> Tight on my head,  gave it to my daughter</li>
            <li> This sleeping cap fits just fine without being tight or being too lose to go off at night. Used it for a month and it hasnt lost elasticity.</li>
            <li> Good price for an item like this. It&#x27;s a pretty thin fabric but it&#x27;s smooth inside and out and doesn&#x27;t cause friction with my hair or my pillowcase. It doesn&#x27;t catch on anything and isn&#x27;t prone to ripping, even at the seams with the elastic. The elastic is thin and stretchy. It stays on all night without being uncomfortable. I&#x27;m prone to headaches if anything puts pressure on my head, and I&#x27;m pleased to report no headaches with this cap. My bra strap length medium-curly hair all fits into this cap pretty easily. (I lean forward so my head is upside down, plop my hair into the cap, tuck in stray pieces, then come right side up.) I can put this on after a shower with completely damp/wet hair, and wake up with dry, mostly non-flat curls. (Granted, I live in the desert so things dry well here.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the thinness of the elastic, this cap makes a noticeable and persistent line across the forehead if left in one position all night. I avoid this by wearing the cap inside out, with the elastic on the outside so that the fabric cushions my forehead. The elastic is white so you can see it like that, but I&#x27;d rather have a goofy looking sleeping cap than a line on my forehead all day.</li>
            <li> Product as described.</li>
            <li> Is this a good nite cap for someone who uses an apnea machine.  My hair and curls get messed up when I get my hair done.</li>
            <li> This inexpensive yet effective item does the trick. I have to put hyaluronic conditioner on my fragile hair every  night. This cap prevents conditioner from getting onto my pillow.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THIS PRODUCT.  I WRAP MY WEAVED STYLE EVERY NIGHT WITH IT.  THANK YOU FOR A VERY INEXPENSIVE ITEM.</li>
            <li> it kept on that&#x27;s good and its comfy enough</li>
            <li> this was purchased for my mom. It keeps her hair in style and she doesn&#x27;t have to worry about getting up and tackling her hair. it keeps hair moist and not dry</li>
            <li> This is the best cap I have ever had. I have natural hair and having it rub on a cotton pillow case leaves my hair dry and breakage happens. This not only keeps my hair soft the next day, but if my hair is wet with product or water it does not seep through the cap. Very durable</li>
            <li> I purchased three of these caps since where I live it&#x27;s hard to find a basic satin black cap. When I first received it I was a bit skeptical since it was very thin and there was no lining. My hair is natural and sometimes due to being a bit heavy handed with oils and butters I thought it was just go right through this fabric but to my surprise that didn&#x27;t happen. My pillow cases stay clean.  I love how light weight the cap is,allowing my hair to breath. My head is medium sized and the cap stays on all night. It is very comfortable. I love the protection it gives my hair from breakage and keeping my style in tact.  I consider this a good little investment and would definitely Purchased them again.&lt;br /&gt;Update....after using these caps for a few months I am more than happy. Not one time have they slipped off during sleeping. I throw them into the washer and drying without any special treatment and they come out looking like new. They are very strong. Again a super buy.</li>
            <li> This cap last a few months before coming apart at the seams.</li>
            <li> Great cap but it doesn&#x27;t really stay on my head the whole night...</li>
            <li> Seemed really great but after about a week of sleeping with it, it wants to slide off in the middle of the night. I have a pretty average head so I was disappointed by how much is stretched.</li>
            <li> I wore this cap several times when I went to sleep. Oil seeps out of the cap and onto my pillows. Not good.</li>
            <li> Finally I can make an all positive feedback. I was happy when I saw this product online and even happier when I shopped for and got it.</li>
            <li> I love this and it fits over my flexy rods and it don&#x27;t fall off while sleeping</li>
            <li> Not many options for AA products where I live.  cap is comfortable and price is what I expected to pay</li>
            <li> I have a big head.  What can I say?  This cab fits great and accommodates my larger than normal head and naturally styled hairstyles.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased 2 of these caps for myself and daughter. We both wear are hair at this time natural and these are so nice to sleep in instead of using scarves.</li>
            <li> I did not care for it.</li>
            <li> I just got this and it is great. I use these all the time and they do keep your hair do in good shape. I use mine with or without a silk pillow case. Great item for any one. I am ordering some more. This one is especially nice and light.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful sleeping cap but it doesn&#x27;t stay on your head.... all over the place. The elastic band loosens easily and doesn&#x27;t maintain its form for long so if you buy one, chances are you will need to buy a few more.</li>
            <li> Wearing it right now as I type. I have really thick crochet braids in and this cap is still able to hold everything! I love it.</li>
            <li> I gave the product a four star rating because it is a really nice product and very soft the only problem or complaint i have is that the cap is abit to loose fit.</li>
            <li> This is a great cap. It&#x27;s exactly as it was described in the details. Breathable, and holds everything together.</li>
            <li> except it dont fit all the way and it slides up in back and sometimes its half off when i wake but its great otherwise it protected my hair from damage and was great as a conditiong cap perfectly duo</li>
            <li> It really is breathable and is perfect for your hair because it&#x27;s silky. I use this every night for the past 4 months and it&#x27;s worked perfectly, the only problem I have is that it lost it&#x27;s tightness really easily and I have to use a elastic head band around the rim to keep it in place all night. If you have a big head or a lot of hair(I have both)this is perfect</li>
            <li> Product didn&#x27;t cover all my hair and fell apart after two months of use</li>
            <li> I bought this and &#x27;Stay On Satin&#x27; comparable sleeping cap at the same time, so I could compare.  For the following reasons I prefer the other, and have reordered that one and will not repurchase this one. 1. The satin on this one is not as smooth, which causes more drag, and combined with ... 2. the elastic is weak and loose... makes it likely to fall off in the night. Also, 3. Because of the decorative frill it is not as easy to grab and go as it&#x27;s not reversible.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length locks and this satin cap is wonderful. A lot of the time I wear my hair wrapped up in ethnic scarves, which are very hot and can make my locks sweat. This satin cap is ideal for locks or any hairstyle that one would like to maintain; the fabric is breathable and comfortable too.</li>
            <li> The cap came in a very timely manner. It was about a dollar when I purchased it, plus about five for shipping. The price altogether was worth it for me, because I live in an isolated tourist community where it would be very hard to find something like this, and more expensive. It is very comfortable, and I use it when I have hair rollers in my hair, or if I want to sleep with a french braid. It stays on while I sleep, is nice and soft, and not too tight. Pretty much all you need in a sleeping cap! The only thing is it might not be reasonable to most people who can just go to their local Wal Mart or whatever, I however cannot so it was worth it for me.</li>
            <li> I love this cap, it&#x27;s very comfortable, it doesn&#x27;t come off when I sleep, a very nice size and shape.</li>
            <li> Purchase this bonnet if you want something to protect your hair while you sleep. I also use a satin pillowcase but I put this over my wrap just to make sure that my hair is protected.</li>
            <li> This cap works for its purpose, but it&#x27;s not the very nicest fabric I&#x27;ve ever seen.  Although the description is of a &amp;#34;satin sleep cap,&amp;#34; the fabric is more aptly described as a nylon tricot or similar synthetic knitted tissue.  However, the synthetic means that the cap is slick and slippery so it does reduce the friction between the pillowcase and the head of hair.</li>
            <li> The fabric is not satin it&#x27;s something else,cheap fabric&lt;br /&gt;that&#x27;s what this is. Your better off buying it from Walmart&lt;br /&gt;Or somewhere else.</li>
            <li> Great sleeping cap. I didn&#x27;t experience the bleeding problem some others had. It stays on all night and holds all my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so comfortable when I go to sleep! Good&#x27;s sleep with this black sleeping cap. Recommend you to order it here.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t stay in place very well but is ok</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really a fan of this product. The elastic is extremely tight making the cap uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> very comfortable sleeping cap</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good and it gets the job done</li>
            <li> Love this sleeping cap, stays on all night.  The one I received had little tabs that I could tie, which keep the cap from being too loose.</li>
            <li> I have long keratin treated hair &amp; this is good for the sleep &amp; yes breathable</li>
            <li> Needs to be washed before use because it has a dye like smell and it stains.  Otherwise, the size is great and the fit just right.</li>
            <li> This sleeping cap flaked all over. When I woke up in the morning I thought I had bugs all over my pillow!!! I was freaking out until I realized it was this cap. Maybe you should wash it before you wear it. What was I thinking?</li>
