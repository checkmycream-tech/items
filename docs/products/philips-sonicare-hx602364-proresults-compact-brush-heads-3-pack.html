            <li>Love my Philips Sonicare and these compact head brushes!</li>
            <li>As it turns out they fit perfectly and stay on fine.</li>
            <li>This thing is amazing.</li>
            <li>Been using these kind of brush heads for years</li>
            <li>It cleans effectively and efficiently.  </li>
            <li>These are nice</li>
            <li>but it was nice to just be able to grab envelope and be on my way&lt;br</li>
            <li>They wear well and clean exceptionally well.</li>
            <li>It fits my mouth better.  </li>
            <li>What more needs to be said.</li>
            <li>so these work much better.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is wonderful, only wish is that the replacements had 4 heads instead of 3, it would make it easier for my family size.  </li>
            <li>and I did not have any problems with them fitting on my Phillips Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I love the compact brush heads,  </li>
            <li>Overall works great and the compact size makes it good for travel.</li>
            <li>I received product as scheduled and really pleased discreet package.  </li>
            <li>but I think I can get a better brush from using my toothbrush over this.</li>
            <li>Still my favorite.</li>
            <li>I would buy it again and again :)</li>
            <li>This is the 3rd Sonicare I&#x27;ve had and feel it is the best.</li>
            <li>I have been using this type of replacement brush for a year and recommend it, will buy more, and did, and I hope this helps someone.</li>
            <li>fits my Sonicare perfect and will be back again</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>, THEY ARE EVEN MORE OVER PRICED</li>
            <li>I use them myself and have been pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Philips purchased Sonicare many years ago, and since then both the electric toothbrushes and the replacement heads have taken a discernible fall in quality and longevity.  </li>
            <li>Price from Amazon is a good bit higher than Sam&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>THE BRUSHES ARE GOOD, WOULD HAVE RATED THEM HIGHER, BUT THEY ARE SO OVER PRICED</li>
            <li>My first Sonicare toothbrush died after 12 years, and the replacement brushes lasted a good three months.  </li>
            <li>They easily snap on and off of your Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>If you dislike going to the dentist, then you will LOVE the Phillips Sonicare Easy Clean Rechargeable Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I can easily brush my molars with the compact brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I tried the Philips Sonicare HX6013 ProResults Brush Head Standard and I am happy to report that these fit the HX6511/50 :)</li>
            <li>Very pleased and will stick with this whole setup as we have been getting rave reviews from out dentist.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, these compact toothbrush heads are fine.  </li>
            <li>it was fine.  </li>
            <li>Just what I wanted, fit my Sonicare just fine.  </li>
            <li>They work great for smaller mouths like mine</li>
            <li>This is a great product for adults with smaller mouth.</li>
            <li>The item I received is a genuine Philips product.</li>
            <li>I ordered these to fit my sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li>Great smaller toothbrush heads for your sonicare</li>
            <li>Great for tiny mouths.</li>
            <li>I have owned my sonicare for a year and one of the brushes didn&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li>They fit my electric toothbrush and my dentist tells me to use it.</li>
            <li>Almost like getting 1 for free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try out the diamond clean compact brushes and see how they do.</li>
            <li>Compact means more focused brushing, and I would never use a large toothbrush.</li>
            <li>replacements are a perfect fit for the appropriate Sonicare devices, and, at about $8 apiece, may seem somewhat expensive.</li>
            <li>This purchase was exactly  what I wanted and received very quickly.</li>
            <li>I have a crowded mouth &amp; the compact brushes are very small, perfect for me.</li>
            <li>so i was pleased to get new ones!</li>
            <li>There are the newer ones and they work much better than the older ones.  </li>
            <li>I love the compact head better than the standard head.  </li>
            <li>They arrived quickly and at a competitive price.</li>
            <li>Love these smaller heads because they get around the tooth better.</li>
            <li>The compact Sonicare tooth brushes work best for brushing the back of the upper and bottom teeth.</li>
            <li>The brush wore out quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a loyal Sonicare user.</li>
            <li>The brush head is ideal for people with a small mouth cavity.</li>
            <li>The are more maneuverable than the normal brush heads.</li>
            <li>Brushes were the right fit at the right price.  </li>
            <li>Original brush heads for sonicare at very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>These are great for getting into those tight spaces.  </li>
            <li>I love the product, it&#x27;s effective where you&#x27;re need the most, hard to reach areas ,did a great job for small brushes.</li>
            <li>These little heads work great.</li>
            <li>These fit the Diamond Clean SoniCare model (recommended highly, worth the cost, the only brush to use (do not use Oral-B spin brushes) great value at Costco) and are compact (small size, not available at Costco, best bought on Amazon).</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and have good results with these heads and the Sensitive setting on my brush.</li>
            <li>They still attach to my Sonicare toothbrush just fine, but my Sonicare toothbrush came with a UV sanitizer accessory that has nubs for the toothbrush heads to sit on, and the toothbrush heads don&#x27;t quite attach to those nubs like the older toothbrush heads did.</li>
            <li>The product came as described, and right on time.</li>
            <li>, they do a fantastic job cleaning my teeth, the brush is about the size of a kids tooth brush, highly recommend</li>
            <li>Philips seems to bide by the adage of keeping the cost of their electric toothbrushes within reason but then leveling a high cost for their replacement brushes -- a method used by many corporations to keep a steady stream of substantial profit coming to them.  </li>
            <li>It allows me to clean more easily without missing any teeth.  </li>
            <li>I have a small mouth and this fits perfectly and gets into all the little nooks and crannies in your mouth for a better cleaning experience.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get in the back very good and the plastic vibrates like a jackhammer against my other teeth</li>
            <li>New brush heads are easier to clean and swap out.</li>
            <li>Item exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered.  </li>
            <li>The larger heads are OK, but once you try the compact heads</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be purchasing more of these in the future.</li>
            <li>Way better than the generic or non-sonicare branded heads too.</li>
            <li>The Phillips Sonicare Proresults Compact Brush Heads are exactly what I needed for my Sonicare Flexcare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>As I stated this is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what we needed.  </li>
            <li>but probably better to get into those smaller spaces.</li>
            <li>first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li>Or if I pick up the toothbrush by the stem of the brush head it will slip right off the toothbrush (the brush head that came with the toothbrush was snug enough that it would not come off that easily).</li>
            <li>The blue strip is the indicator to let you know when the brush needs changing and will noticeably turn light blue the more you use it.  </li>
            <li>I like these small Sonicare toothbrush heads much more than the larger ones; I feel that they&#x27;re easier to use to clean my teeth (including my hard-to-reach wisdom teeth) more thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>I like the compact brush better than the regular size as it gets each tooth squeaky clean and fits better in small mouths.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a brush that was easy to use for the back of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>It is difficult to find the compact size in the stores, so I love being able to purchase them through Amazon!</li>
            <li>it does not fit my easy clean tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>They fit in your mouth easier to get around your back teeth.</li>
            <li>Plus, i feel that I need to replace them very often.</li>
            <li>They work reasonably well, fit the base perfectly.</li>
            <li>These work very well in my Phillips sonic care pro</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>I really like it because it much easier to get to my wisdom teeth.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The size of the compact brush heads make it much easier to use.  </li>
            <li>The price of the compact brush heads on Amazon is much lower than at a retail location.  </li>
            <li>As for the cleaning power its the same as the standard, it leaves your teeth very clean and fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>the pro-results does not remove as much surface stains than the diamond clean (I use crest 3D white toothpastes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush heads are smaller than my original Sonicare Toothbrush head.  </li>
            <li>The original Sonicare managed to produce quality products at the same prices that Philips is charging now.  </li>
            <li>I actually feel it gives my mouth a deeper clean.  </li>
            <li>Works as expected, but doesn&#x27;t fit exactly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty old sonicare</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product; my teeth feels super clean, especially with the smaller brush head.</li>
            <li>So hard to find these in store and such a great price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You should take great concern if your brushes are fake.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately Philips is profiting greatly from their replacement brushes from the consumers who are captured by the purchase of their electric toothbrushes, which are products that dentists insist are necessities for our oral health.  </li>
            <li>, they don&#x27;t make us gag like normal toothbrush heads do.</li>
            <li>Still enjoying the Sonicare after after a few years .</li>
            <li>The small head makes it easy to reach and clean the back teeth - no problem.</li>
            <li>It may fit other models, but not ours, although the description states it should.</li>
            <li>The first of the three I used started spinning on the toothbrush spindle in about a month; am trying the second one now.</li>
            <li>This is the first batch of brush heads that the blue never faded even though the toothbrush is out of shape (after 2 months).</li>
            <li>action!</li>
            <li>It is quite small, but I&#x27;m still glad we purchased it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the diamond clean standard, and I&#x27;ve tried the Pro-results standard size.</li>
            <li>I use the standard size, also available here on Amazon, and find that both sizes last about six months is normal service, with proper usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These brushes, like the larger standard-size brushes, work very well.</li>
            <li>People with smaller mouths may prefer this smaller size, and so might people who just like the feel and sense of precise control of this smaller size.</li>
            <li>tooth brush makes loud noises with this brush head.</li>
            <li>the way these brushes since they&#x27;re compacted, they work VERY well reaching to the back of the mouth.</li>
            <li>My dentist gives me the small children&#x27;s brushes but the bristles are too soft to clean adult teeth.</li>
            <li>This is the third time we have ordered new brush heads in about 18 months.</li>
            <li>When the blue fads, it&#x27;s time to put on a new one.</li>
            <li>My husband and I both use these as our daily toothbrush heads because they can really help with our back molars.</li>
            <li>I have a small mouth, so on the advice of my dentist, I purchased these smaller head brushes in order to better cover the back of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I suggested to another reviewer who felt these brush heads wear out very quickly, it&#x27;s important not to press too hard with these brushes.  </li>
            <li>I have used a Sonicare toothbrush for nearly four years now, and I&#x27;ve finally convinced my wife to start using one.</li>
            <li>I am able to get behind my wisdom teeth.</li>
            <li>The design of the tiny colorful circle at the end of brush head is also a completely different design from the previous ones I bought from off-line</li>
            <li>New compact heads allow me to reach every single spot.</li>
            <li>I just bought my 4th Philips Sonicare Flexcare electric toothbrush (love the toothbrush but not the fact you can&#x27;t buy a replacement battery), and in addition to the standard brush head, I also use the compact size to get behind my front teeth and the very back molars.</li>
            <li>I ordered these refills for my son who complained when using the full side head for his Sonicare.</li>

            <li> Philips purchased Sonicare many years ago, and since then both the electric toothbrushes and the replacement heads have taken a discernible fall in quality and longevity.  </li>
            <li> Price from Amazon is a good bit higher than Sam&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> THE BRUSHES ARE GOOD, WOULD HAVE RATED THEM HIGHER, BUT THEY ARE SO OVER PRICED</li>
            <li> My first Sonicare toothbrush died after 12 years, and the replacement brushes lasted a good three months.  </li>
            <li> They easily snap on and off of your Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> If you dislike going to the dentist, then you will LOVE the Phillips Sonicare Easy Clean Rechargeable Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I can easily brush my molars with the compact brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I tried the Philips Sonicare HX6013 ProResults Brush Head Standard and I am happy to report that these fit the HX6511/50 :)</li>
            <li> Very pleased and will stick with this whole setup as we have been getting rave reviews from out dentist.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, these compact toothbrush heads are fine.  </li>
            <li> it was fine.  </li>
            <li> Just what I wanted, fit my Sonicare just fine.  </li>
            <li> They work great for smaller mouths like mine</li>
            <li> This is a great product for adults with smaller mouth.</li>
            <li> The item I received is a genuine Philips product.</li>
            <li> I ordered these to fit my sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li> Great smaller toothbrush heads for your sonicare</li>
            <li> Great for tiny mouths.</li>
            <li> I have owned my sonicare for a year and one of the brushes didn&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li> They fit my electric toothbrush and my dentist tells me to use it.</li>
            <li> Almost like getting 1 for free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try out the diamond clean compact brushes and see how they do.</li>
            <li> Compact means more focused brushing, and I would never use a large toothbrush.</li>
            <li> replacements are a perfect fit for the appropriate Sonicare devices, and, at about $8 apiece, may seem somewhat expensive.</li>
            <li> This purchase was exactly  what I wanted and received very quickly.</li>
            <li> I have a crowded mouth &amp; the compact brushes are very small, perfect for me.</li>
            <li> so i was pleased to get new ones!</li>
            <li> There are the newer ones and they work much better than the older ones.  </li>
            <li> I love the compact head better than the standard head.  </li>
            <li> They arrived quickly and at a competitive price.</li>
            <li> Love these smaller heads because they get around the tooth better.</li>
            <li> The compact Sonicare tooth brushes work best for brushing the back of the upper and bottom teeth.</li>
            <li> The brush wore out quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a loyal Sonicare user.</li>
            <li> The brush head is ideal for people with a small mouth cavity.</li>
            <li> The are more maneuverable than the normal brush heads.</li>
            <li> Brushes were the right fit at the right price.  </li>
            <li> Original brush heads for sonicare at very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> These are great for getting into those tight spaces.  </li>
            <li> I love the product, it&#x27;s effective where you&#x27;re need the most, hard to reach areas ,did a great job for small brushes.</li>
            <li> These little heads work great.</li>
            <li> These fit the Diamond Clean SoniCare model (recommended highly, worth the cost, the only brush to use (do not use Oral-B spin brushes) great value at Costco) and are compact (small size, not available at Costco, best bought on Amazon).</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and have good results with these heads and the Sensitive setting on my brush.</li>
            <li> They still attach to my Sonicare toothbrush just fine, but my Sonicare toothbrush came with a UV sanitizer accessory that has nubs for the toothbrush heads to sit on, and the toothbrush heads don&#x27;t quite attach to those nubs like the older toothbrush heads did.</li>
            <li> The product came as described, and right on time.</li>
            <li> , they do a fantastic job cleaning my teeth, the brush is about the size of a kids tooth brush, highly recommend</li>
            <li> Philips seems to bide by the adage of keeping the cost of their electric toothbrushes within reason but then leveling a high cost for their replacement brushes -- a method used by many corporations to keep a steady stream of substantial profit coming to them.  </li>
            <li> It allows me to clean more easily without missing any teeth.  </li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and this fits perfectly and gets into all the little nooks and crannies in your mouth for a better cleaning experience.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get in the back very good and the plastic vibrates like a jackhammer against my other teeth</li>
            <li> New brush heads are easier to clean and swap out.</li>
            <li> Item exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered.  </li>
            <li> The larger heads are OK, but once you try the compact heads</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be purchasing more of these in the future.</li>
            <li> Way better than the generic or non-sonicare branded heads too.</li>
            <li> The Phillips Sonicare Proresults Compact Brush Heads are exactly what I needed for my Sonicare Flexcare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> As I stated this is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what we needed.  </li>
            <li> but probably better to get into those smaller spaces.</li>
            <li> first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> Or if I pick up the toothbrush by the stem of the brush head it will slip right off the toothbrush (the brush head that came with the toothbrush was snug enough that it would not come off that easily).</li>
            <li> The blue strip is the indicator to let you know when the brush needs changing and will noticeably turn light blue the more you use it.  </li>
            <li> I like these small Sonicare toothbrush heads much more than the larger ones; I feel that they&#x27;re easier to use to clean my teeth (including my hard-to-reach wisdom teeth) more thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> I like the compact brush better than the regular size as it gets each tooth squeaky clean and fits better in small mouths.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a brush that was easy to use for the back of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to find the compact size in the stores, so I love being able to purchase them through Amazon!</li>
            <li> it does not fit my easy clean tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> They fit in your mouth easier to get around your back teeth.</li>
            <li> Plus, i feel that I need to replace them very often.</li>
            <li> They work reasonably well, fit the base perfectly.</li>
            <li> These work very well in my Phillips sonic care pro</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> I really like it because it much easier to get to my wisdom teeth.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> The size of the compact brush heads make it much easier to use.  </li>
            <li> The price of the compact brush heads on Amazon is much lower than at a retail location.  </li>
            <li> As for the cleaning power its the same as the standard, it leaves your teeth very clean and fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> the pro-results does not remove as much surface stains than the diamond clean (I use crest 3D white toothpastes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush heads are smaller than my original Sonicare Toothbrush head.  </li>
            <li> The original Sonicare managed to produce quality products at the same prices that Philips is charging now.  </li>
            <li> I actually feel it gives my mouth a deeper clean.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected, but doesn&#x27;t fit exactly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty old sonicare</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product; my teeth feels super clean, especially with the smaller brush head.</li>
            <li> So hard to find these in store and such a great price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You should take great concern if your brushes are fake.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately Philips is profiting greatly from their replacement brushes from the consumers who are captured by the purchase of their electric toothbrushes, which are products that dentists insist are necessities for our oral health.  </li>
            <li> , they don&#x27;t make us gag like normal toothbrush heads do.</li>
            <li> Still enjoying the Sonicare after after a few years .</li>
            <li> The small head makes it easy to reach and clean the back teeth - no problem.</li>
            <li> It may fit other models, but not ours, although the description states it should.</li>
            <li> The first of the three I used started spinning on the toothbrush spindle in about a month; am trying the second one now.</li>
            <li> This is the first batch of brush heads that the blue never faded even though the toothbrush is out of shape (after 2 months).</li>
            <li> action!</li>
            <li> It is quite small, but I&#x27;m still glad we purchased it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the diamond clean standard, and I&#x27;ve tried the Pro-results standard size.</li>
            <li> I use the standard size, also available here on Amazon, and find that both sizes last about six months is normal service, with proper usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These brushes, like the larger standard-size brushes, work very well.</li>
            <li> People with smaller mouths may prefer this smaller size, and so might people who just like the feel and sense of precise control of this smaller size.</li>
            <li> tooth brush makes loud noises with this brush head.</li>
            <li> the way these brushes since they&#x27;re compacted, they work VERY well reaching to the back of the mouth.</li>
            <li> My dentist gives me the small children&#x27;s brushes but the bristles are too soft to clean adult teeth.</li>
            <li> This is the third time we have ordered new brush heads in about 18 months.</li>
            <li> When the blue fads, it&#x27;s time to put on a new one.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use these as our daily toothbrush heads because they can really help with our back molars.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth, so on the advice of my dentist, I purchased these smaller head brushes in order to better cover the back of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I suggested to another reviewer who felt these brush heads wear out very quickly, it&#x27;s important not to press too hard with these brushes.  </li>
            <li> I have used a Sonicare toothbrush for nearly four years now, and I&#x27;ve finally convinced my wife to start using one.</li>
            <li> I am able to get behind my wisdom teeth.</li>
            <li> The design of the tiny colorful circle at the end of brush head is also a completely different design from the previous ones I bought from off-line</li>
            <li> New compact heads allow me to reach every single spot.</li>
            <li> I just bought my 4th Philips Sonicare Flexcare electric toothbrush (love the toothbrush but not the fact you can&#x27;t buy a replacement battery), and in addition to the standard brush head, I also use the compact size to get behind my front teeth and the very back molars.</li>
            <li> I ordered these refills for my son who complained when using the full side head for his Sonicare.</li>
            <li> This brush head is quite a baby size comparing to the normal sized brother, almost half of the size of it.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Only negative is you need more toothpaste as you brush since you can only do a small area at a time.</li>
            <li> Love the small heads to get into the hard to reach areas way in the back.  </li>
            <li> I have no idea but these compact brushes they do not last very long.</li>
            <li> Just had a bad batch and as usual Amazon&#x27;s outstanding customer service got me a refund on the first set.</li>
            <li> The ProResults logo is stretched out</li>
            <li> The toothbrush &amp;#34;lasts&amp;#34; a long time.</li>
            <li> i wish it was a little easier to open the package so that i could keep the brush heads in them and put them away but the way i had to open it, i ended up having to put them in a ziplock or something.</li>
            <li> If you are buying these for just yourself they should last at least nine months if not a little longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the one brush for around a month in a half now and the blue bristles have already started to change colors.</li>
            <li> Was just what I expected.</li>
            <li> I was wondering why this would be since I haven&#x27;t been brushing any harder.</li>
            <li> These are pretty expensive and I got a batch that wouldn&#x27;t stay on the sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they tend to wear out a little quicker, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I have had a ton of dental work done and have some hard to reach places in the back of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> so thought the metal piece might be worn down but wanted to try another set before I replaced it.  </li>
            <li> IN LESS THAN A MONTH</li>
            <li> Each brush lasted less than a month and a half.  </li>
            <li> I may be doing something wrong (although it seems simple enough to just slip the replacement head onto the toothbrush handle) but the replacement head is a little lose</li>
            <li> She prefers small toothbrush heads, due to an over-active dental gag reflex, so we bought a supply of compact brush heads for her.</li>
            <li> the larger ones will feel unnecessarily bulky.</li>
            <li> This replacement head does not fit either of our two units.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to saving some money on these expensive gadgets, but these were a complete waste of money, as the head worked its way off the handle while I was brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> We had a slight issue with one of the heads, but the company reached out and took care of the issue!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find adult small brushes.</li>
            <li> My mouth is small</li>
            <li> wife has small mouth, small teeth, small jaw, small face, small.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and just cant</li>
            <li> These brushes, as well as the regular size brushes, are very poor quality.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find the small head replacements.</li>
            <li> the toothbrush do all the work.\\&quot; Pressing hard against the tooth surfaces while brushing with the Sonicare does not increase its cleaning power, and probably causes the brush bristles to wear out faster.</li>
            <li> It makes it easier to get to those hard to reach areas in the mouth.</li>
            <li> My dentist noticed gum decay from the brush being too hard.</li>
            <li> she digs these suckers</li>
            <li> THAN I THOUGHT, BUT THE BIGGEST COMPLAINT IS  </li>
            <li> The regular brush heads from Sonicare are unpleasant for me because they are so bulky.</li>
            <li> Super annoying!</li>
            <li> , THEY ARE SO SMALL THAT THEY DO A VERY POOR JOB, DO NOT</li>
            <li> just was not happy about the brush head just vibrating of the handle.</li>
            <li> The color of white doesn&#x27;t match the toothbrush base</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is useless, want to use it.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with delivery</li>
            <li> THE BRUSH IS USELESS.  </li>
            <li> may be wrong, and it seems that Philips is selling those themselves, but I am very skeptical of the genuity of the product.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> now the brush just vibrate of the base handle.</li>
            <li> so if I am not holding it with my finger at the base while brushing my teeth, it will fall off from the vibrations...</li>
            <li> I hate paying the exorbitant prices for brush heads these companies charge, so this is a way to get around some of it.</li>
            <li> The metal ring inside at the base will corrode</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product!!  We had a slight issue with one of the heads, but the company reached out and took care of the issue!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> I just bought my 4th Philips Sonicare Flexcare electric toothbrush (love the toothbrush but not the fact you can&#x27;t buy a replacement battery), and in addition to the standard brush head, I also use the compact size to get behind my front teeth and the very back molars. The compact size is a perfect fit for both.</li>
            <li> There are the newer ones and they work much better than the older ones.  I&#x27;ve been using Philips for over 9 years.</li>
            <li> They work great for smaller mouths like mine</li>
            <li> Hard to find the small head replacements. These worked great.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for adults with smaller mouth.</li>
            <li> it worked great for 2 weeks. now the brush just vibrate of the base handle. seller was prompt at shipping the brush. just was not happy about the brush head just vibrating of the handle.</li>
            <li> I love the compact head better than the standard head.  It fits my mouth better.  Price from Amazon is a good bit higher than Sam&#x27;s.Club.</li>
            <li> Compact heads are the best!  They fit in your mouth easier to get around your back teeth.</li>
            <li> Has been using this brand of sonic toothbrush. See a discount sale, immediately laid hands on him.&lt;br /&gt;It is useless, want to use it.</li>
            <li> Arrived timely. Quality product. It&#x27;s Philips Sonicare. What more needs to be said.</li>
            <li> I have a crowded mouth &amp; the compact brushes are very small, perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Item exactly as advertised. Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered.  My mouth is small so these work much better.</li>
            <li> I prefer these smaller brush heads. The larger heads are OK, but once you try the compact heads the larger ones will feel unnecessarily bulky. The item I received is a genuine Philips product.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are great but they wear out quicker and the fact that their a bit costly. Been using these kind of brush heads for years and no they don&#x27;t last 3 months.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is wonderful, only wish is that the replacements had 4 heads instead of 3, it would make it easier for my family size.  I need up buying two at a time to even them out.</li>
            <li> Love the small heads to get into the hard to reach areas way in the back.  My dentist is happy &amp; so are we.  We will never go back to regular toothbrushes again.</li>
            <li> The product came as described, and right on time. I prefer the compact head brush as being easier to concentrate on smaller areas.</li>
            <li> The first of the three I used started spinning on the toothbrush spindle in about a month; am trying the second one now. When I called Philips about it, they said I had to go through all three before they would consider doing anything. This is B.S. You make a defective product, you back it up with a replacement.</li>
            <li> Compared to the regular brush heads, the compact fits like it was customized for me.  It cleans effectively and efficiently.  They arrived quickly and at a competitive price.</li>
            <li> wife has small mouth, small teeth, small jaw, small face, small. she digs these suckers &#x27;cuz they&#x27;re the perfect size for her girly-ness &amp; if Mama&#x27;s happy, everybody&#x27;s happy!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a brush that was easy to use for the back of my teeth.  It was perfect for this.  I&#x27;ll be purchasing more of these in the future.</li>
            <li> Great brush heads. They do the job well and I did not have any problems with them fitting on my Phillips Sonicare.</li>
            <li> The brush head is ideal for people with a small mouth cavity. The small head makes it easy to reach and clean the back teeth - no problem. It&#x27;s difficult to find adult small brushes. My dentist gives me the small children&#x27;s brushes but the bristles are too soft to clean adult teeth. Get yourself a Sonicare and use these brush heads. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> These brush heads work great on my Sonicare toothbrush and they are a great buy - I would purchase them again.</li>
            <li> I love the compact brush heads,  I have had a ton of dental work done and have some hard to reach places in the back of my mouth.  These are great for getting into those tight spaces.  I have permanently made the switch from the standard heads to the compact.  Way better than the generic or non-sonicare branded heads too.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use these as our daily toothbrush heads because they can really help with our back molars. We like the compact size best, they don&#x27;t make us gag like normal toothbrush heads do.</li>
            <li> This purchase was exactly  what I wanted and received very quickly.</li>
            <li> These brushes, like the larger standard-size brushes, work very well. People with smaller mouths may prefer this smaller size, and so might people who just like the feel and sense of precise control of this smaller size.</li>
            <li> These little heads work great. My dentist and hygenist have no complaints about my dental care. I change them about once per month instead of every three months.</li>
            <li> Still enjoying the Sonicare after after a few years . New compact heads allow me to reach every single spot.</li>
            <li> I bought these replacement heads for my HX6511/50 EasyClean Sonicare because the description said it fits all EasyClean&#x27;s. I may be doing something wrong (although it seems simple enough to just slip the replacement head onto the toothbrush handle) but the replacement head is a little lose so if I am not holding it with my finger at the base while brushing my teeth, it will fall off from the vibrations... Super annoying! Or if I pick up the toothbrush by the stem of the brush head it will slip right off the toothbrush (the brush head that came with the toothbrush was snug enough that it would not come off that easily). I&#x27;m going to try the HX6013&#x27;s but I&#x27;m worried i&#x27;m going to get the same results. I&#x27;ll post an update when I try the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I tried the Philips Sonicare HX6013 ProResults Brush Head Standard and I am happy to report that these fit the HX6511/50 :)</li>
            <li> I ordered these to fit my sonicare toothbrush and it&#x27;s just what i needed! Everything is as described at prompt shipping. i wish it was a little easier to open the package so that i could keep the brush heads in them and put them away but the way i had to open it, i ended up having to put them in a ziplock or something. I like that it also comes with the color rings so you can tell different brush heads apart. i lost that pack on my last box so i was pleased to get new ones! Overall works great and the compact size makes it good for travel.</li>
            <li> Love these smaller heads because they get around the tooth better. I actually feel it gives my mouth a deeper clean.  I received product as scheduled and really pleased discreet package.  Nothing to hide but it was nice to just be able to grab envelope and be on my way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will only be using compact brush head from now on</li>
            <li> These are nice but I think I can get a better brush from using my toothbrush over this. Plus, i feel that I need to replace them very often.</li>
            <li> The brush heads are smaller than my original Sonicare Toothbrush head.  I guess the word &amp;#34;compact&amp;#34; was my clue.  Otherwise, these compact toothbrush heads are fine.  They work reasonably well, fit the base perfectly. I did, however, find a larger package of the regular size Sonicare Brush Heads in one of the Warehouse Club stores where I shop.  In the future, I will get my Sonicare Toothbrush heads there.</li>
            <li> I like these small Sonicare toothbrush heads much more than the larger ones; I feel that they&#x27;re easier to use to clean my teeth (including my hard-to-reach wisdom teeth) more thoroughly.  The downside is that the newer Sonicare compact toothbrush heads have a slightly smaller (or differently shaped) socket in the bottom of them.  They still attach to my Sonicare toothbrush just fine, but my Sonicare toothbrush came with a UV sanitizer accessory that has nubs for the toothbrush heads to sit on, and the toothbrush heads don&#x27;t quite attach to those nubs like the older toothbrush heads did.</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly and works well.</li>
            <li> Brush head vibrates off the handle.</li>
            <li> I have used a Sonicare toothbrush for nearly four years now, and I&#x27;ve finally convinced my wife to start using one. She prefers small toothbrush heads, due to an over-active dental gag reflex, so we bought a supply of compact brush heads for her. I use the standard size, also available here on Amazon, and find that both sizes last about six months is normal service, with proper usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I suggested to another reviewer who felt these brush heads wear out very quickly, it&#x27;s important not to press too hard with these brushes.  As my hygienist told me, \\&quot;Let the toothbrush do all the work.\\&quot; Pressing hard against the tooth surfaces while brushing with the Sonicare does not increase its cleaning power, and probably causes the brush bristles to wear out faster. I have even been reluctant to replace them after six months- they look and feel fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These replacements are a perfect fit for the appropriate Sonicare devices, and, at about $8 apiece, may seem somewhat expensive. But they provide good service, excellent cleaning, ease of use (compared with a manual toothbrush), and are a darn sight cheaper than dental work!</li>
            <li> I love the product, it&#x27;s effective where you&#x27;re need the most, hard to reach areas ,did a great job for small brushes. Great price.</li>
            <li> The compact Sonicare tooth brushes work best for brushing the back of the upper and bottom teeth. The are more maneuverable than the normal brush heads. They are a bit more difficult to find in retail stores but I&#x27;ve always found them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> These work very well in my Phillips sonic care pro, they do a fantastic job cleaning my teeth, the brush is about the size of a kids tooth brush, highly recommend</li>
            <li> Great smaller toothbrush heads for your sonicare</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product; my teeth feels super clean, especially with the smaller brush head.</li>
            <li> we always lie these its a great deal and we don&#x27;t have to leave home to get them.</li>
            <li> Been using for years, great brush heads.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrushing system and the compact brush heads work best for me.</li>
            <li> The Phillips Sonicare Proresults Compact Brush Heads are exactly what I needed for my Sonicare Flexcare toothbrush.  They fit perfectly and come with color-coded rings so each person knows which head belongs to them.  They easily snap on and off of your Sonicare toothbrush.  The blue strip is the indicator to let you know when the brush needs changing and will noticeably turn light blue the more you use it.  As I stated this is exactly what I needed.  I have a small mouth and this fits perfectly and gets into all the little nooks and crannies in your mouth for a better cleaning experience.  If you are buying these for just yourself they should last at least nine months if not a little longer.</li>
            <li> Excellent service, great product and good price</li>
            <li> Original brush heads for sonicare at very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Have used these toothbrushes for years.  Still my favorite.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we needed.  Great for tiny mouths.</li>
            <li> This is the third time we have ordered new brush heads in about 18 months. They wear well and clean exceptionally well. Very pleased and will stick with this whole setup as we have been getting rave reviews from out dentist.</li>
            <li> The brushes are excactly as described.  No issues with it.  Do not know what else to say as it is factory replacement.</li>
            <li> They work great. thanks.</li>
            <li> Brushes are smaller than the brush that came with it but probably better to get into those smaller spaces.</li>
            <li> Works as expected, but doesn&#x27;t fit exactly.</li>
            <li> Was just what I expected.</li>
            <li> This brush head is quite a baby size comparing to the normal sized brother, almost half of the size of it.&lt;br /&gt;But I really like it because it much easier to get to my wisdom teeth. I would buy it again and again :)</li>
            <li> item came in a timely manner and was as advertised</li>
            <li> If you dislike going to the dentist, then you will LOVE the Phillips Sonicare Easy Clean Rechargeable Toothbrush.  These brush heads each have 2 blue sets of bristles. When the blue fads, it&#x27;s time to put on a new one. The toothbrush is also quadrant timed so you get a great cleaning and wonderful checkups from that &#x27;dreaded&#x27; dentist.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with delivery it was fine.  The product has lost it&#x27;s quality.  Instead of the brush head lasting three months, it only lasts for one month.  Sonicare needs to get it&#x27;s act together.</li>
            <li> Think I&#x27;ve already reviewed this ... I swear by these toothbrushes and don&#x27;t know what I would do without them.</li>
            <li> it does not fit my easy clean tooth brush.  tooth brush makes loud noises with this brush head.</li>
            <li> Pricey but cleans well.</li>
            <li> These are pretty expensive and I got a batch that wouldn&#x27;t stay on the sonicare.  It&#x27;s a pretty old sonicare so thought the metal piece might be worn down but wanted to try another set before I replaced it.  As it turns out they fit perfectly and stay on fine. Just had a bad batch and as usual Amazon&#x27;s outstanding customer service got me a refund on the first set.</li>
            <li> Great product and great seller!</li>
            <li> I have owned my sonicare for a year and one of the brushes didn&#x27;t fit.  It was almost like it was stripped.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd Sonicare I&#x27;ve had and feel it is the best. New brush heads are easier to clean and swap out.</li>
            <li> Great product and arrived ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li> These fit the Diamond Clean SoniCare model (recommended highly, worth the cost, the only brush to use (do not use Oral-B spin brushes) great value at Costco) and are compact (small size, not available at Costco, best bought on Amazon). Compact means more focused brushing, and I would never use a large toothbrush. I have been using this type of replacement brush for a year and recommend it, will buy more, and did, and I hope this helps someone.</li>
            <li> Perfectly what I was looking for. Thanks</li>
            <li> They fit my electric toothbrush and my dentist tells me to use it.</li>
            <li> I like the compact brush better than the regular size as it gets each tooth squeaky clean and fits better in small mouths.  It allows me to clean more easily without missing any teeth.  Only negative is you need more toothpaste as you brush since you can only do a small area at a time.</li>
            <li> So hard to find these in store and such a great price. fits my Sonicare perfect and will be back again</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Can&#x27;t believe I wasn&#x27;t using this all along. My teeth feel cleaner than they ever have and I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to find compact head replacement brush heads and a really good price. Almost like getting 1 for free.</li>
            <li> What can one say? They work the way they&#x27;re supposed to work.</li>
            <li> We have the Philips Sonicare HX6733/70. This replacement head does not fit either of our two units. It does not seat properly and wobbles. It may fit other models, but not ours, although the description states it should. Returned.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to saving some money on these expensive gadgets, but these were a complete waste of money, as the head worked its way off the handle while I was brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> These are great - both quality &amp; value!</li>
            <li> Love my Philips Sonicare and these compact head brushes! It is difficult to find the compact size in the stores, so I love being able to purchase them through Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare for over 4 years now. This is the first batch of brush heads that the blue never faded even though the toothbrush is out of shape (after 2 months). The design of the tiny colorful circle at the end of brush head is also a completely different design from the previous ones I bought from off-line stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may be wrong, and it seems that Philips is selling those themselves, but I am very skeptical of the genuity of the product.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. The brush wore out quickly. So I bought a set of compact brush heads.  My God. I am able to get behind my wisdom teeth. This thing is amazing. My teeth feel great.</li>
            <li> I like the size of the compact head.  It makes it easier to get to those hard to reach areas in the mouth.</li>
            <li> Great product and  I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> THE BRUSHES ARE GOOD, WOULD HAVE RATED THEM HIGHER, BUT THEY ARE SO OVER PRICED AS ARE ALL BRUSHES, YOU JUST HAVE TO EXPECT THAT.  I HAVE CHANGED MY OPINION ON THESE BRUSHES, THEY ARE EVEN MORE OVER PRICED THAN I THOUGHT, BUT THE BIGGEST COMPLAINT IS  THEY DO NOT LAST.  IN LESS THAN A MONTH THE BRUSH IS USELESS.  NOT ONLY DO THEY NOT LAST, THEY ARE SO SMALL THAT THEY DO A VERY POOR JOB, DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT BUY THIS BRUSH, EVEN THOUGHT AMAZON RECOMMENDED IR, WHY I DO NOT KNOW</li>
            <li> The regular brush heads from Sonicare are unpleasant for me because they are so bulky. I can&#x27;t get in the back very good and the plastic vibrates like a jackhammer against my other teeth first thing in the morning. These solved that problem for me. Unfortunately, they tend to wear out a little quicker, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I hate paying the exorbitant prices for brush heads these companies charge, so this is a way to get around some of it.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted, fit my Sonicare just fine.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> These are compact size. I didn&#x27;t think I would mind the smaller brush head but I prefer the larger ones.</li>
            <li> I ordered these refills for my son who complained when using the full side head for his Sonicare. I use them myself and have been pleased with the results. A good buy.</li>
            <li> These are the brushes that I ended up preferring after using my Sonic Care Toothe Brush.  My Dentist/Hygenist (sp?) also said she prefers me to use the smaller head toothebrush...</li>
            <li> I USE THIS ITEM ALL OF THE TIME.  IT IS GREAT, JUST AS I EXPENTED.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the diamond clean standard, and I&#x27;ve tried the Pro-results standard size. I have no idea but these compact brushes they do not last very long. I&#x27;ve been using the one brush for around a month in a half now and the blue bristles have already started to change colors. I&#x27;m going to try out the diamond clean compact brushes and see how they do. As for the cleaning power its the same as the standard, it leaves your teeth very clean and fresh feeling. I feel like the pro-results does not remove as much surface stains than the diamond clean (I use crest 3D white toothpastes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way these brushes since they&#x27;re compacted, they work VERY well reaching to the back of the mouth.</li>
            <li> Brushes were the right fit at the right price.  Delivery was on time.</li>
            <li> Fit my Philips Sonicare perfectly . Good price, well made . Will order again when needed.</li>
            <li> COUNTERFEIT! Consumers beware!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this item from Aroma Beauty (July 21st, 2014) and it took me a while to realize it was counterfeit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s is how you can tell if you have a counterfeit:&lt;br /&gt;1. The metal ring inside at the base will corrode&lt;br /&gt;2. It doesn&#x27;t snap on/off as easily&lt;br /&gt;3. The color of white doesn&#x27;t match the toothbrush base&lt;br /&gt;4. The ProResults logo is stretched out some&lt;br /&gt;5. The toothbrush &amp;#34;lasts&amp;#34; a long time. That is to say that the blue indicator bristles don&#x27;t fade away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should take great concern if your brushes are fake. My dentist noticed gum decay from the brush being too hard. I was wondering why this would be since I haven&#x27;t been brushing any harder. This is just one thing that could be affecting you. We do not know what chemicals the counterfeit manufacturers are using and if they may be harmful to your health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take action! Call Philips Sonicare Support at 1-800-682-7664 and let them know.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a loyal Sonicare user. I have sensitive teeth and have good results with these heads and the Sensitive setting on my brush.</li>
            <li> Philips seems to bide by the adage of keeping the cost of their electric toothbrushes within reason but then leveling a high cost for their replacement brushes -- a method used by many corporations to keep a steady stream of substantial profit coming to them.  Philips purchased Sonicare many years ago, and since then both the electric toothbrushes and the replacement heads have taken a discernible fall in quality and longevity.  My first Sonicare toothbrush died after 12 years, and the replacement brushes lasted a good three months.  I have a small mouth, so on the advice of my dentist, I purchased these smaller head brushes in order to better cover the back of my teeth.  Each brush lasted less than a month and a half.  These brushes, as well as the regular size brushes, are very poor quality.  Unfortunately Philips is profiting greatly from their replacement brushes from the consumers who are captured by the purchase of their electric toothbrushes, which are products that dentists insist are necessities for our oral health.  The original Sonicare managed to produce quality products at the same prices that Philips is charging now.  So why can&#x27;t Philips produce quality products that perform as promised?</li>
            <li> These are the bomb for use with my Sonicare brush.  I have a small mouth and just cant&lt;br /&gt; get the larger brush heads to to the job.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I can easily brush my molars with the compact brush. It is quite small, but I&#x27;m still glad we purchased it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Sonicare for several years.  The size of the compact brush heads make it much easier to use.  The price of the compact brush heads on Amazon is much lower than at a retail location.  My order was received promptly.  I will continue to purchase this item from Amazon.</li>
