            <li>Good hair love the soft touch i will be buying this hair again and again.üòç</li>
            <li>I did a test strand of bleach and it came out fine</li>
            <li>It smells fine.</li>
            <li>Love this hair very pretty and silky</li>
            <li>&amp; did I mention it came with a FREE paddle brush</li>
            <li>and I am also pretty sure that this hair is longer that 16 and 18.</li>
            <li>It barely sheds and was still in good condition after being washed and bleached.</li>
            <li>UPDATE my original post below was done on 8/19/2015 when I got the hair and my post now</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s softer than when i originally got it.</li>
            <li>so I bleached the ends and there still soft and smooth!!</li>
            <li>This is such good quality hair</li>
            <li>IS REALLY GOOD HUMAN HAIR</li>
            <li>I just got this hair, it&#x27;s really soft and nice</li>
            <li>holding spray these curls are full and bouncy.</li>
            <li>I just wanted to give a full updated on my experience with this hair.</li>
            <li>It does shed a lot but overall good for the price..</li>
            <li>Hair was definitely full.</li>
            <li>No smell, true to length, and very soft,!!!!</li>
            <li>This hair is soft and has a very light airy feel.</li>
            <li>This hair curls great and with a little bit of my Garnier Fructis</li>
            <li>.. Got my moneys worth..</li>
            <li>then this is worth the money.</li>
            <li>but you may need another bundle because it is thin but great quality!.</li>
            <li>Came early then the expected date the ends are great</li>
            <li>FIRST REVIEW:</li>
            <li>Kinda smelled funny but nothing that shampoo can&#x27;t get rid of..</li>
            <li>the bundles are thick bundles for the price the hair is great</li>
            <li>I will write to reviews one for how they first came and are</li>
            <li>shipping was kinda slow, but this hair is GREAT.</li>
            <li>Seller is also very helpful!</li>
            <li>The length was exactly what 16&amp;#34; and 18&amp;#34; should be.</li>
            <li>It blends right in with my real hair.</li>
            <li>Great hair recieved it yesterday earlier than expected hair is beautiful soft and thick</li>
            <li>hair came in like a number 2 color but super soft ...</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 sets and they both came as body wave instead of straight</li>
            <li>really like the hair will purchase from seller again üòç</li>
            <li>Also the shipment was really fast.</li>
            <li>I just got my hair in the mail and the hair is very smooth,soft.</li>
            <li>n didn&#x27;t shed as much.</li>
            <li>They came nice and secure though they thin at the bottom</li>
            <li>Its really soft and pretty</li>
            <li>but two bundles isnt enough for a full head</li>
            <li>hair was super short and stringy.</li>
            <li>Hair is really niice and soft</li>
            <li>The 16&amp;#34; is thicker than the 18&amp;#34; which is normal.</li>
            <li>Very soft and SilkyüëåüèΩ highly recommended</li>
            <li>I had to wash &amp; deep condition before it acted right..</li>
            <li>This hair came very soft took about 2 1/2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I got some wind action and this hair was flowing and falls right back into place.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any shedding and they are soft to the touch!</li>
            <li>The texture feels AMAZINGLY soft!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll update if anything changes, but so far I like it!</li>
            <li>Arrived on time with rush shipping, little sheeding, curls fine.</li>
            <li>So I washed it twice until the water ran clear.</li>
            <li>I am 5&#x27;4 and the hair is near my butt.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE UR MONEY.</li>
            <li>and the hair completely came apart.</li>
            <li>Theirs no shedding so far</li>
            <li>and I sewed the hair (all 4 bundles) to a wig cap and used a lace closure to complete my wig.</li>
            <li>no complaints so far</li>
            <li>Came in Fast Actual inches !</li>
            <li>So far package delivered on time.</li>
            <li>So far it hasnt shed when I pulled my finger through to feel the texture.</li>
            <li>The hair doesn&#x27;t hold curls very long and when washed it doesn&#x27;t turn back to the normal pattern, which reminds me that the description says silky straight, however I received body wave.</li>
            <li>I love it last a long time doesn&#x27;t shed too bad which is nice only issue</li>
            <li>Definitely looks natural.</li>
            <li>Normally 16 and 18 reaches the middle of my back.</li>
            <li>just sheds a little too much</li>

            <li> I love it last a long time doesn&#x27;t shed too bad which is nice only issue</li>
            <li> Definitely looks natural.</li>
            <li> Normally 16 and 18 reaches the middle of my back.</li>
            <li> just sheds a little too much</li>
            <li> I got a little bit of shedding after the wash and condition with is normal.</li>
            <li> I then flat ironed the hair on the highest heat setting using my Silk Elements Megasilk Olive Heat Protection Spray.</li>
            <li> Cheap and Quality usually don&#x27;t mix when it comes to hair but BAYBAY!!!</li>
            <li> I just opened the hair and was so shocked and surprised of the quality of this hair especially for it being so cheap.</li>
            <li> I let the hair air dry</li>
            <li> an the hair is full as so are the bundles also has a weird smell to it</li>
            <li> This hair was at first was frustrating..</li>
            <li> Received hair in a timely fashion, but I received curly instead of straight also hair was thin at the ends.</li>
            <li> Minimal shedding.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s minimal..</li>
            <li> soft and thick hair.</li>
            <li> The only down side is the hair has a bit of a smell to it, which is common, nothing a neutralizing wash and deep condition can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT REAL HAIR!</li>
            <li> But Other Than That I&#x27;d Order Again.</li>
            <li> Hair is full bundles,no thin ends!!</li>
            <li> The hair price seems to be going up but the ratings are going down.</li>
            <li> The hair was a dark 1B (not quite jet black)</li>
            <li> so when I washed the hair with my Silk Elements Silky Neutralizing Shampoo a black die was coming off the hair.</li>
            <li> The 16 were brown &amp; 18 were black.</li>
            <li> The black does not color what so ever, but the brown does.. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t actually used the hair yet but they are very thin, especially on the ends..</li>
            <li> Not true to length and not two bundles of hair</li>

            <li> UPDATE: I have had this hair in for about 2 1/2 weeks, this hair sheds A LOT. Besides the shedding the hair is pretty good, I&#x27;ve bleached it and colored it and the hair is still in good shape.. The hair doesn&#x27;t hold curls very long and when washed it doesn&#x27;t turn back to the normal pattern, which reminds me that the description says silky straight, however I received body wave. I ordered 2 sets and they both came as body wave instead of straight and I am also pretty sure that this hair is longer that 16 and 18. I am 5&#x27;4 and the hair is near my butt. Normally 16 and 18 reaches the middle of my back. FIRST REVIEW: I haven&#x27;t actually used the hair yet but they are very thin, especially on the ends.. Doesn&#x27;t seem like 3oz more like 2..</li>
            <li> horrible. hair was super short and stringy. nothing like the description</li>
            <li> The 2 bundles came in a giant box . Bundles are two different colors , feels like Yaki hair not Remi . Seemsike a lower quality hair</li>

            <li> Good for a bob because you&#x27;ll need to cut 6 inches off. Ends are too thin and weft is too thick. Save your money up</li>

            <li> I like the hair , it feels so good .it just sheds a little too much</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE UR MONEY. Hair thin and shedding. According to the description you can lift the color. So i did so and the hair completely came apart. THIS IS NOT REAL HAIR! I usually dont do reviews but this one had to be done. If i could save someone else from the aggravation</li>

            <li> I will write to reviews one for how they first came and are and after I bleach them and dye them. Second review UPDATE The extensions are amazing they got the color well and I have seen little to no shedding! First review: I really love the hair! They came nice and secure though they thin at the bottom but I still love them! I haven&#x27;t seen any shedding and they are soft to the touch! They do have a funky smell but it&#x27;s fine!</li>
            <li> Received hair in a timely fashion, but I received curly instead of straight also hair was thin at the ends. I&#x27;m reordering to see if it will be any better</li>
            <li> I have amazon prime so I got it the next day !!! No smell, true to length, and very soft,!!!! I love it I need to order more</li>
            <li> I recommend them price is great Wefts are sturdy  purchasing more from Them.</li>
            <li> It was terrible hair quality</li>
            <li> I love it last a long time doesn&#x27;t shed too bad which is nice only issue I had the second time around was there was a little bit of glue in there but otherwise I&#x27;ve had nothing but great experiences</li>
            <li> Not true to length and not two bundles of hair I feel robbed</li>
            <li> I just got this hair, it&#x27;s really soft and nice BUT it&#x27;s thin! And 18 inch doesn&#x27;t even look like an 18&amp;#34;..</li>
            <li> What I received  was not anywhere close  it wasn&#x27;t even a bundle  if I could give 0 stars I would Don&#x27;t order</li>
            <li> Hair is really niice and soft it took 2 weeks for me to recieve the hair. Came early then the expected date the ends are great an the hair is full as so are the bundles also has a weird smell to it but its nothing shampoo an some moracon organ oil cant fix i gave 4 stars because i havent installed it yet and im soon going to bleach it after its installed i will post the pics of it in. Do i recommend the hair ? Yes i do its definantely a great deal an great hair.</li>
            <li> I Loved It. I Will Be Honest And Say It Does Require Some Brushing. But Other Than That I&#x27;d Order Again.</li>
            <li> Very good hair , for a good price but two bundles isnt enough for a full head</li>
            <li> For the price, excellent buy!!! Arrived on time with rush shipping, little sheeding, curls fine. I ordered 2 (total 4 bundles) used 3. I will buy this hair again.</li>
            <li> UPDATE my original post below was done on 8/19/2015 when I got the hair and my post now 8/21/2015 are my results after making the wig the same day. The hair was a dark 1B (not quite jet black) when I got it so when I washed the hair with my Silk Elements Silky Neutralizing Shampoo a black die was coming off the hair. So I washed it twice until the water ran clear. Then I deep conditioned the hair for 1 hour with a combination of the Silk Elements Deep Nourishing Conditioner and the Silk Elements Megasilk Olive Moisturizing Creme. I got a little bit of shedding after the wash and condition with is normal. I let the hair air dry and I sewed the hair (all 4 bundles) to a wig cap and used a lace closure to complete my wig. I got no shedding after the installation as I sew the tracks using the flip over method and do no cut my wefts. I then flat ironed the hair on the highest heat setting using my Silk Elements Megasilk Olive Heat Protection Spray. The only thing I will say is the ends are a bit thin so I trimmed the end about 1 inch and this hair is everything yall. It&#x27;s softer than when i originally got it. I have wore the wig out and the hair is still laid. I got some wind action and this hair was flowing and falls right back into place. I will still give this hair 5 stars because of the price and if you take good care of your hair like i do then this is worth the money. I used a curling wand on the wig this morning and this hair and these curls i have are giving me every bit of life. This hair curls great and with a little bit of my Garnier Fructis sleek and shine vilumizing holding spray these curls are full and bouncy. As a stylist I like to try all types of human hair from inexpensive hair to really expensive hair. My clients range in what they can afford. Some can afford $150 per bundle and some can not so this is great affordable hair that I recommend. I just wanted to give a full updated on my experience with this hair. I have gotten so many compliments on my hair today in the salon. when i told them this hair was $80 for 4 bundles nobody believed me. Its all about what you do with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OMG!!!! OMG!!! OMG!!! I was really skeptical about ordering this Peruvian hair because of the mixed reviews. I bought 4 bundles (2/16in and 2/18in) and I ordered thru Amazon Prime and got it the next day and let me just say this hair is EVERYTHING!!! I don&#x27;t know where these negative reviews are coming from. Maybe its the vendor that sent the hair I don&#x27;t know but Amazon did that. I just opened the hair and was so shocked and surprised of the quality of this hair especially for it being so cheap. Cheap and Quality usually don&#x27;t mix when it comes to hair but BAYBAY!!! This hair is soft and has a very light airy feel. The wefts are great and I ran my hand thru each bundle about 15 times and I got NO SHEDDING. The only down side is the hair has a bit of a smell to it, which is common, nothing a neutralizing wash and deep condition can&#x27;t fix. I usually wear 14 inch but when I saw the price I had to give it a try. Maybe its the luck of the draw but this hair is GREAT!!! I will being using all 4 bundles of this hair and a 12in brazilian closure from Helen Hair. I am more than happy I took the chance and purchased this hair.</li>
            <li> Goodshipping didnt put it in my hair as of yet but i cant waiit!!!</li>
            <li> Gave it as a gift she loved, the Peruvian remy hair, she said it was great, can reuse it over and over, if taken care of. Does not matte up or shed, the product is very good.</li>
            <li> Ordered it on Tuesday received it on Friday, gave it a lil color &amp; it came out üëåüëå no complaints so far oh &amp; did I mention it came with a FREE paddle brush</li>

            <li> shipping was kinda slow, but this hair is GREAT. I did a test strand of bleach and it came out fine so I bleached the ends and there still soft and smooth!! Can&#x27;t wait to put them in, BEST HAIR ON AMAZON!</li>
            <li> This hair perfect but you may need another bundle because it is thin but great quality!.</li>
            <li> This hair came very soft took about 2 1/2 weeks. The 16 were brown &amp; 18 were black. Minimal shedding. The black does not color what so ever, but the brown does.. Would buy again. Seller is also very helpful!</li>
            <li> Love this hair very pretty and silky I&#x27;m defenetly going to order this hair again</li>
            <li> Dyed my bundles and yes thy came out the way i wanted them too loving my hair</li>
            <li> Came in Fast Actual inches ! Good price beautiful hair love it got ut for back to school cant wait to install !!</li>
            <li> This hair is okay , this brand isn&#x27;t good quality.</li>
            <li> The hair price seems to be going up but the ratings are going down. I am getting the hair today and I will be COMPLETELY honest about the package, quality, amount and appearance of the hair. So far package delivered on time. Hoping for the best!   Okay. I just received the hair. It smells fine. Nothing horrible or unusual but what I consider normal for packaged hair. The texture feels AMAZINGLY soft! It does look like quality hair. The length was exactly what 16&amp;#34; and 18&amp;#34; should be. Bundles looks thick. The 16&amp;#34; is thicker than the 18&amp;#34; which is normal. Usually the longer the hair the shorter the width of the bundle. The color is a mix of #1b and #2. Definitely looks natural. So far it hasnt shed when I pulled my finger through to feel the texture. Once I install hair I will update SHEDDING and MATTING. Im hoping it doesn&#x27;t.   -1 STAR for no free gift. :( Dissapointed about that.</li>
            <li> This hair was at first was frustrating.. I had to wash &amp; deep condition before it acted right.. It does shed a lot but overall good for the price.. With a good amount of heat it curls beautifully.. I just wish it had more bounce n didn&#x27;t shed as much. Hair was definitely full.</li>
            <li> I love it. It blends right in with my real hair. üíãüíÅ</li>
            <li> The hair is good so far nice texture this is only my second day but I&#x27;m already seeing shedding but it&#x27;s minimal.. Its a little thin so I&#x27;d recommend 3-4 bundles.. i&#x27;ll update if anything changes, but so far I like it!</li>
