            <li>but I&#x27;ve b been doing my own nails for a while now.</li>

            <li>I bought this item because I love the idea that the handle can come off and be a lid over the brush in order to protect it.</li>
            <li>Love the handle</li>
            <li>but it still beat having top load</li>
            <li>I love this brush&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure was not intended.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more like a 6 .</li>
            <li>The brush is cute and hasn&#x27;t shed.  </li>
            <li>I totally love this brush, and the price makes it even better.</li>
            <li>i travel with my products and this keeps it safe.</li>
            <li>This just makes is so much more easier when doing acrylic nails.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>im not super impressed</li>
            <li>the product is exactly what I expected, I am satisfied with this item, its size is perfect and the color is very pretty, I love</li>
            <li>This brush was very useful.</li>
            <li>and I had to clean it out to manage the use of this tool .</li>
            <li>I plan on using this to clean the nail polish around my nails.</li>
            <li>I use it to clean up the nail polish off my cuticles after a manicure.</li>
            <li>much that I&#x27;ve bought 3 more</li>
            <li>Quick shipment.</li>
            <li>I doubt the brush is real sable hair, it&#x27;s cheap and definitely worth</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not even worth 2$</li>
            <li>Sure after a couple months a high quality brush will get gunk in it, that&#x27;s why I have the OPI brush cleaner, and I&#x27;m sure that would clean out this brush too, but it&#x27;s just not worth it to me to have to do it after each full set.</li>
            <li>This is just right</li>
            <li>I thought I would order it because it was cheap looked decent and did the job.</li>
            <li>not sure yet with gel but great for acrylic</li>
            <li>I have since used the brush a few more times and have more comments:&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product was as described, very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this as long as you are willing to fix a few things, because now I know that I will use this successfully for quite a while, and the price was economical.&lt;br /&gt;The metal cover for the bristles is really the best part, because it packs the size down substantially for storage.  </li>
            <li>However, after the first use acrylic built up in the bristles and it is no longer useable.</li>
            <li>Well this came apart after first use.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to a nail salon or anyone who is interested in this product.</li>
            <li>First time I used it the bristles fell out.</li>
            <li>I really did love this brush especially for the price, but it came apart after about a dozen uses.</li>
            <li>So I had to put a few drops of super glue in the fitting to keep them together.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I just put it back on and it is fine.</li>
            <li>but it does not have much use.</li>
            <li>i paid more than what i expected for this brush and it also lumps in the middle as the cheap brushes.</li>
            <li>and it absolutely rocks now.  </li>
            <li>very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shipment came in fast.  </li>
            <li>The price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>but I really like it.</li>
            <li>I would definitely get them again, and they came super fast!</li>
            <li>The first one I ruined being a new nail tech student.</li>
            <li>So far this brush is good a lil small</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say this is not a good acrtlic brush  </li>
            <li>but I live it in a larger size brush like a 14 if they had them</li>
            <li>the car up with top little ones just to drive a half hour away to get a nail brush.</li>
            <li>One issue is that the handle can be pulled off, however it can easily be replaced and it doesn&#x27;t feel loose or shaky when your using it.</li>

            <li> Also I ordered an oval brush and they sent me a flat brush (like you would use for concealer in makeup)</li>
            <li> I am saying that a few of the hairs fell down in position after first use in the acrylic liquid.  </li>
            <li> Smaller than expected</li>
            <li> n&#x27;t I will need another brush for a long time!</li>
            <li> and ive used like two other brushes that I have bought from a local beauty store which I didnt like.</li>
            <li> Brush kept slipping off</li>
            <li> I had to very slightly bend the metal in on each side so it would stay firmly attached when using.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic piece that actually holds the bristles is supposed to be permanently attached to the middle metal handle piece.  </li>
            <li> hard to clean poor quality brush.</li>
            <li> Due to the build up the brush itself lost its shape.</li>
            <li> One metal piece surrounds the plastic piece that holds the bristles, while the other metal piece comes off to allow you to cover the bristle hairs for storage.  </li>
            <li> I prefer them a little stiffer and flatter at the tip (it had an extreme point-</li>
            <li> I wish I could just sand the handle down after use like I used to do with a previous brush I had.  </li>
            <li> I bought the brush for acrylic nails, but it&#x27;s not worth it!</li>
            <li> This brush is firm and holds shape.</li>
            <li> a bought a few of them to try</li>
            <li> the brush came like if it was used already dried up&lt;br /&gt;not</li>
            <li> not so a good quality!and expencive for so a bad quality but to bad</li>
            <li> im an amateur at acrylic nails but</li>
            <li> it works well with small hands.</li>
            <li> not very good</li>
            <li> Brush loses the brisles when putting on the acrylic.</li>
            <li> know this sounds ridiculous, but I would still rate this brush as five stars.  </li>
            <li> Worse purchase I ever made.</li>
            <li> Its in poor shape.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just disappointed I wasted four dollars on shipping.</li>
            <li> the handle isn&#x27;t anything crazy glue cant fix.</li>
            <li> and it was bad</li>

    <ol>
            <li> im an amateur at acrylic nails but this brush is alright. im not super impressed but it gets the job done, and the handle isn&#x27;t anything crazy glue cant fix.</li>
            <li> This is a very good quality brush, it is a bargain at this price. This brush is firm and holds shape. Quick shipment.</li>
            <li> Fabulous brush!!! It makes a difference in the beads when have a fantastic brush! I recommend it for even the beginners, even if is is a size 10. I don&#x27;t I will need another brush for a long time!</li>
            <li> The hairs literally fall off when you touch the hairs from the brush I didn&#x27;t expect this to be worthless</li>
            <li> I can work all day with this..only thing is the hair of the brush is folling now..:( i thout its koliski</li>
            <li> The bristles on the brush are plastic and it&#x27;s low quality. It&#x27;s not meant for acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> Good product would definetly buy again good size for a good price easy to use and very nice nice handle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking about price and style but I live it in a larger size brush like a 14 if they had them but, I have not yet seen them on line. I am awaiting for the larger one (brush)</li>
            <li> not so a good quality!and expencive for so a bad quality but to bad a bought a few of them to try and it was bad</li>
            <li> the product is exactly what I expected, I am satisfied with this item, its size is perfect and the color is very pretty, I love</li>
            <li> The acrylic gets stuck in the brush once you get to the 2nd finger !&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any brush cleaner so it just stayed a big glob :(&lt;br /&gt;If it dident get stuck it would b a nice brush</li>
            <li> I bought this brush 2 weeks ago. I only did one set of clients nails before the acrylic started building up inside the bristles of the brush. Due to the build up the brush itself lost its shape. I would not recommend this brush to anybody. Don&#x27;t buy it it&#x27;s not even worth 2$</li>
            <li> I bought this item because I love the idea that the handle can come off and be a lid over the brush in order to protect it. However, after the first use acrylic built up in the bristles and it is no longer useable. I am an experienced Nail Technician and have never had that problem before. Sure after a couple months a high quality brush will get gunk in it, that&#x27;s why I have the OPI brush cleaner, and I&#x27;m sure that would clean out this brush too, but it&#x27;s just not worth it to me to have to do it after each full set. I doubt the brush is real sable hair, it&#x27;s cheap and definitely worth the price you pay for it. I&#x27;m just disappointed I wasted four dollars on shipping.</li>
            <li> the brush came like if it was used already dried up&lt;br /&gt;not only that the brush head fell off the same day&lt;br /&gt;very disappointed</li>
            <li> hard to clean poor quality brush. nice to look at but it does not have much use. not very good</li>
            <li> I really did love this brush especially for the price, but it came apart after about a dozen uses. Hence the 3 rating</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Love the handle it works well with small hands.</li>
            <li> when I received my marbles sable  acrylic nail art brush&lt;br /&gt;it started doing the job but since you can open it and close it like a pen it constantly comes off the cover comes off constantly...not letting you finish your job I having used it since I won&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a pro or anything but I&#x27;ve b been doing my own nails for a while now. I thought I would order it because it was cheap looked decent and did the job. It came a week before our was suppose to and I thought over all it was a good product. Only thing is the acrylic get caught in the middle of the brush no matter how you use it but it still beat having top load the car up with top little ones just to drive a half hour away to get a nail brush. Would order again do to shipping and price.</li>
            <li> i paid more than what i expected for this brush and it also lumps in the middle as the cheap brushes. fustrating</li>
            <li> Brush loses the brisles when putting on the acrylic.</li>
            <li> Im just now starting to do Acrylic nails and ive used like two other brushes that I have bought from a local beauty store which I didnt like. So far this brush is good a lil small but it does its job!</li>
            <li> I love this brush&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it&lt;br /&gt;So much that I&#x27;ve bought 3 more&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for acrylic nails not sure yet with gel but great for acrylic</li>
            <li> I have to try and find an inexpensive wooden handle next time.  I have a problem with the handle getting sticky from acrylic powder and liquid getting on it.  I wish I could just sand the handle down after use like I used to do with a previous brush I had.  I guess I could just use acetone on the handle, but I don&#x27;t want to get any on my nails after I&#x27;ve done them.&lt;br /&gt;12/31/12  I have since used the brush a few more times and have more comments:&lt;br /&gt;The sticky handle isn&#x27;t an issue.  I guess I am just being neater as I work!&lt;br /&gt;But, I had to trim the tip of the brush hairs as they were not even.  The way it was I&#x27;m sure was not intended.  I know some brushes come pointed for painting ...this was not like that.  I am saying that a few of the hairs fell down in position after first use in the acrylic liquid.  This is not a reason not to buy it, I think.  I just had to use micro scissors to cut the hairs precisely.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the metal handle is made in such a way that the end comes detachable to allow you to cover the brush head for storage.  So there are two metal pieces.  One metal piece surrounds the plastic piece that holds the bristles, while the other metal piece comes off to allow you to cover the bristle hairs for storage.  But the handle/cover piece does not stay on unless you \\&quot;amend\\&quot; it with needle nose pliers just a smidgen.  I had to very slightly bend the metal in on each side so it would stay firmly attached when using.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic piece that actually holds the bristles is supposed to be permanently attached to the middle metal handle piece.  Well this came apart after first use.  So I had to put a few drops of super glue in the fitting to keep them together.&lt;br /&gt;I know this sounds ridiculous, but I would still rate this brush as five stars.  I have been using it successfully since I made those fixes and it absolutely rocks now.  I would recommend this as long as you are willing to fix a few things, because now I know that I will use this successfully for quite a while, and the price was economical.&lt;br /&gt;The metal cover for the bristles is really the best part, because it packs the size down substantially for storage.  But when you stick the metal cap piece on the handle for use it lengthens it nicely.</li>
            <li> The brush is nice looking and has a nice handle to hold. But the actual bristles are basically not trainable. The hairs fall out very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to utilize these brushes for my students at my school and all were hairless and or untrained within a week or two of instruction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some kept them to use on mannequin hands, but the are not permissible on clients. (no control)</li>
            <li> I have ordered two of these brushes. The first one I ruined being a new nail tech student. The 2nd one I received damaged!! I have tried contacting the seller to get a replacement but have not gotten a response from them! It&#x27;s been 3 mths since I have requested a replacement!!</li>
            <li> Product was as described, very reasonable price. I would recommend this product to a nail salon or anyone who is interested in this product.</li>
            <li> This is not a size  10 brush it&#x27;s more like a 6 . The acrylic product kept getting in the brush and I had to clean it out to manage the use of this tool . I have done nails for 26 yrs and I can honestly say this is not a good acrtlic brush  .. waist of Money .. And not to mention it took forever to get here.</li>
            <li> This nail brush is nice, looks like good quality. I plan on using this to clean the nail polish around my nails.</li>
            <li> The brushes definitely aren&#x27;t the BEST quality, but awesome for the price. I prefer them a little stiffer and flatter at the tip (it had an extreme point- but I clipped that off). I would definitely get them again, and they came super fast!</li>
            <li> This shipment came in fast.  The brush is cute and hasn&#x27;t shed.  It comes with a cute container that&#x27;s good for storage.  One issue is that the handle can be pulled off, however it can easily be replaced and it doesn&#x27;t feel loose or shaky when your using it. I totally love this brush, and the price makes it even better.</li>
            <li> Does what it was intended. Its a great size for a full set, fills and some art. i like the cap becuase i travel with my products and this keeps it safe. i would buy again!</li>
            <li> Crazy Cart has done it again ! Quick delivery,great quality and great customer service. This just makes is so much more easier when doing acrylic nails. This is just right I would even say perfect.</li>
            <li> I use it to clean up the nail polish off my cuticles after a manicure. It&#x27;s a great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush for practice i actually use this one for when i add color to the monomer. The price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> This brush was very useful. Everytime I&#x27;ve used this brush it kept its shape even after cleaned with brush cleaner.</li>
            <li> First time I used it the bristles fell out. Also I ordered an oval brush and they sent me a flat brush (like you would use for concealer in makeup)</li>
            <li> I bought the brush for acrylic nails, but it&#x27;s not worth it! It clumped up and everything. Worse purchase I ever made.</li>
            <li> I did not realize this items was used. Its in poor shape. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected but I really like it.</li>
            <li> Brush kept slipping off so I had to glue it. Nice that it reverts to compact size.</li>
            <li> I like this brush. It seems to do everything I need it too. The one problem I have had is that the metal part can be pulled off of the plastic on the handle. I just put it back on and it is fine.</li>
