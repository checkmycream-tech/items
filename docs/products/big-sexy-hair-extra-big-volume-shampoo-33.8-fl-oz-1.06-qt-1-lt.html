            <li>Online purchase gave me a great price option too!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this wonderful shampoo to anyone who likes to have great hair.</li>
            <li>I also use the root pump plus and the hairspray after and it holds beautifully all day.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s wonderful for my hair! :)</li>
            <li>Good to know</li>
            <li>I used this when visiting my cousin, and loved it.  </li>
            <li>It is a good value.</li>
            <li>YOur hair gets clean and feels good.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years.</li>
            <li>I love many products of this line, but have not cared for the shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and routinely buy it on amazon.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>They do not have sulfates, which can lead to breakage and are in most shampoos on the market today.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this product,and as long as Amazon has it in the quantity and price listed</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and after washing and drying it I look like I have more hair with lots of volume.</li>
            <li>Amazon offers a great price for it.</li>
            <li>The lather is light, and washes out easily.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend that if you have fine hair with a tendency toward breakage, try the Abba or Kenra product lines.  </li>
            <li>When I placed this order it was for free shipping, but when checking out I was charged for shipping.  </li>
            <li>This is not the genuine product.</li>
            <li>so I highly recommend it for this kind of use.</li>
            <li>I always find it with the super saver shipper.</li>
            <li>I love the Big Sexy Hair products that I purchase from salons, but whatever was in this bottle, it wasn&#x27;t Big Sexy Hair shampoo!</li>
            <li>This is NOT Big Sexy Hair Shampoo!</li>
            <li>I have fine, mostly straight hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been growing it out for a year and the disadvantage is that fine hair doesn&#x27;t really have a lot of volume.  </li>
            <li>I use this shampoo because it is the only kind that does not make my hair greasy.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for several years and knew I liked it.</li>
            <li>I used it for four months while thinking something wasn&#x27;t right with this product, but wanting to get my money&#x27;s worth and reasoning that my hair could just be changing texture.</li>
            <li>It is much more economical to buy it through this seller than the local salon.  </li>
            <li>I think it would be fine if you have naturally thicker hair with a stronger hair follicle, but my hair just can&#x27;t take it.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Big Sexy Hair products for 4+ years.</li>
            <li>THIS DOES WORK BECAUSE IT IS NOT REALLY BIG SEXY HAIR SHAMPOO.</li>
            <li>Whatever is inside the container is not Big Sexy Shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo and would definitely recommend it to others.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery too!</li>
            <li>So when I saw the great price on the big bottle I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised when I got it to see it was crystal clear</li>
            <li>(Big Sexy Hair Shampoo is creamy) and had a fragrance to it.</li>
            <li>and you get much more for your money!!I use it daily w/o any drying etc.to</li>
            <li>Big Sexy Hair Volume shampoo.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
            <li>cant beat the price, one small bottle is the price of this extra large bottle, and besides the shampoo is great</li>
            <li>Using this shampoo (with the same brand conditioner) increased the volume of my hair significantly.  </li>
            <li>further inspection found that the bottle had a strip of tape across the top, one third of the product was gone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The product is also clear and smells a lot different which didn&#x27;t matter to me as long as the results were good, but they weren&#x27;t so I&#x27;m returning the extra bottle that I bought.</li>
            <li>If you have trouble with gluten or wheat though beware because this product uses wheat germ :)</li>
            <li>I have very fine, naturally dark blonde hair, which is prone to damage and getting split ends and breakage.  </li>
            <li>I know what Big Sexy Hair Shampoo, Conditioner, and every other BSH product looks and works like.  </li>
            <li>I like this shampoo because it&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t weigh down you hair.</li>
            <li>I would only recommend using this shampoo for a special occasion when you need that extra volume.</li>
            <li>This shampoo did give decent volume, however it has sulfates in it, which apparently causes issues and damage to my hair.  </li>
            <li>It gives my hair body and a natural shine.  </li>
            <li>I occasionally dye my hair and it cannot take much stress at all.  </li>
            <li>Last week I finally purchased this product from my usual salon, and VOILA, my hair is back to being full, feeling clean, and having body!</li>
            <li>Big Sexy hair shampoo is not clear, it is a pink pearly color, and it is not scented like this.</li>
            <li>I chose this over the regular Big Volume shampoo thinking it might be a little better.  </li>
            <li>A volume shampoo should not weigh down your hair so in that sense it&#x27;s a good product but be careful this product will dry out your hair BIG TIME.</li>
            <li>I have natural curly/wavey hair and the extra big volume shampoo</li>
            <li>This shampoo left my hair very soft, but very flat.  </li>
            <li>This huge bottle lasts a long time as you only need to use a small amount.  </li>
            <li>I have seriously thin hair but with this shampoo and gel, my hair looks normal (which for me is super big hair....).</li>

            <li> When we received the product, The box was wet on one end.</li>

            <li> I have moderately thick hair that normally keeps curl and body for two days after showering, but my hair was so limp, lifeless, and sticky-feeling after shampooing with this!</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling dry and dull.</li>
            <li> Whenever I would use it, I could never give the fly-aways to tame down, even after using Redken Anti-Snap leave-in treatment.  </li>
            <li> WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li> It would go limp immediately after styling and felt dirty constantly; it felt and looked like I needed to wash it just a few hours after showering.</li>
            <li> I ordered this shampoo from Amazon which I usually get from my salon,but here it was way cheaper</li>
            <li> so we marked it up as a bad deal.</li>
            <li> It is thick and luxurious.  </li>
            <li> IT MADE MY HAIR VERY DIRTY LOOKING,AND FLAT</li>

            <li> THIS STUFF SUCKS!! IT MADE MY HAIR VERY DIRTY LOOKING,AND FLAT,I BOUGHT MINE AT WALMART FOR 10.00  A BIG WASTE...DON\\&quot;T WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I use it daily. It gives my hair lots of lift and body.I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Purchased this from Amazon. I love the Big Sexy Hair products that I purchase from salons, but whatever was in this bottle, it wasn&#x27;t Big Sexy Hair shampoo! I used it for four months while thinking something wasn&#x27;t right with this product, but wanting to get my money&#x27;s worth and reasoning that my hair could just be changing texture. I have moderately thick hair that normally keeps curl and body for two days after showering, but my hair was so limp, lifeless, and sticky-feeling after shampooing with this! It would go limp immediately after styling and felt dirty constantly; it felt and looked like I needed to wash it just a few hours after showering. Last week I finally purchased this product from my usual salon, and VOILA, my hair is back to being full, feeling clean, and having body! Good to know it&#x27;s not just my hair. And ick, never purchasing a beauty product from Amazon again!</li>
            <li> This shampoo gives my hair a fullness and bounce without drying it out.  This huge bottle lasts a long time as you only need to use a small amount.  I always find it with the super saver shipper.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo because it&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t weigh down you hair.

            <li> I have been using Big Sexy Hair products for 4+ years. This is NOT Big Sexy Hair Shampoo! Big Sexy hair shampoo is not clear, it is a pink pearly color, and it is not scented like this. I use this shampoo because it is the only kind that does not make my hair greasy. After going through KMS, Biolage, Redken, Paul Mitchell, Bumble Bumble and just about every other quality shampoo out there, I know what works and does not work with my hair type. THIS DOES WORK BECAUSE IT IS NOT REALLY BIG SEXY HAIR SHAMPOO. I know what Big Sexy Hair Shampoo, Conditioner, and every other BSH product looks and works like.  I am simply disgusted to receive different cheap shampoo in a Big Sexy Hair bottle. If I could put 0 stars I would. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> My order was fulfilled by NewVoBeauty. Do not order from them. Whatever is inside the container is not Big Sexy Shampoo. I have used this product for many years. It was painfully obvious. Shame on NewVoBeauty.</li>
            <li> cant beat the price, one small bottle is the price of this extra large bottle, and besides the shampoo is great</li>
            <li> Do not buy this if you want volume.  I chose this over the regular Big Volume shampoo thinking it might be a little better.  This shampoo left my hair very soft, but very flat.  It is also harder to brush your hair out after using this. The product is also clear and smells a lot different which didn&#x27;t matter to me as long as the results were good, but they weren&#x27;t so I&#x27;m returning the extra bottle that I bought.</li>

            <li> I used this when visiting my cousin, and loved it.  I couldn&#x27;t locate the larger bottle in my area.  Online purchase gave me a great price option too!</li>
            <li> When we received the product, The box was wet on one end. further inspection found that the bottle had a strip of tape across the top, one third of the product was gone. We didn &#x27;t know where to return it so we marked it up as a bad deal. We e-mailed the address on the package, and got no responce.  John McGlamery</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and would definitely recommend it to others.  It is much more economical to buy it through this seller than the local salon.  Fast delivery too!</li>
            <li> This is a wonder hair product. I&#x27;ve used it for years.  Amazon offers a great price for it. Going forward, I will never order anything from Amazon. When I placed this order it was for free shipping, but when checking out I was charged for shipping.  I called immediately and was told I could not be refunded for the shipping charged, nor could not cancel the order.</li>
            <li> I almost always read the Amazon reviews but for this product I did not. I have been using it for several years and knew I liked it. So when I saw the great price on the big bottle I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised when I got it to see it was crystal clear (Big Sexy Hair Shampoo is creamy) and had a fragrance to it. In addition, the label had some of the lettering coming off. I got online, read the other reviews and printed out my return label. This is not the genuine product.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and routinely buy it on amazon. it&#x27;s wonderful for my hair! :)</li>
            <li> I have seriously thin hair but with this shampoo and gel, my hair looks normal (which for me is super big hair....). If you have trouble with gluten or wheat though beware because this product uses wheat germ :)</li>
            <li> I ordered this shampoo from Amazon which I usually get from my salon,but here it was way cheaper and you get much more for your money!!I use it daily w/o any drying etc.to my hair or scalp so I highly recommend it for this kind of use.I have fine hair and after washing and drying it I look like I have more hair with lots of volume.I also use the root pump plus and the hairspray after and it holds beautifully all day.I&#x27;m very happy with this product,and as long as Amazon has it in the quantity and price listed I will order it from them.Thank you!!LOVE THESE HAIR PRODUCTS!!!!!!

            <li> I love this shampoo.  It gives my hair body and a natural shine.  It is thick and luxurious.  The lather is light, and washes out easily.  I would recommend this wonderful shampoo to anyone who likes to have great hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, naturally dark blonde hair, which is prone to damage and getting split ends and breakage.  I occasionally dye my hair and it cannot take much stress at all.  This shampoo did give decent volume, however it has sulfates in it, which apparently causes issues and damage to my hair.  This shampoo made my hair frizzy and increased my fly-aways.  Whenever I would use it, I could never give the fly-aways to tame down, even after using Redken Anti-Snap leave-in treatment.  I think it would be fine if you have naturally thicker hair with a stronger hair follicle, but my hair just can&#x27;t take it.  I would recommend that if you have fine hair with a tendency toward breakage, try the Abba or Kenra product lines.  For flyaways, I would recommend Redken Extreme Anti-Snap.  They do not have sulfates, which can lead to breakage and are in most shampoos on the market today.</li>
            <li> It is a shampoo I have used for a long time. It is a good value.Big Sexy Hair Volume shampoo.</li>
            <li> This product does what it promises to do. YOur hair gets clean and feels good. It adds lots of volume.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  I have natural curly/wavey hair and the extra big volume shampoo puts the volume in my hair that I need to hold it.  I have to have the &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; big volume&amp;#34;  shampoo for it to work.</li>
