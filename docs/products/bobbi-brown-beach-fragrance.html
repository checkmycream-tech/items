            <li>Reminds me of warm weather.</li>
            <li>Saying that I give it four stars because I liked the smell.</li>
            <li>Kind of Coppertone hints in the fragrance.</li>

            <li>I absolutely love this scent.  </li>

            <li>They both love the beach fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love the smell of sunscreen and this smells just like it.</li>
            <li>I love the beach and this is quite possibly the best perfume I have ever bought!</li>
            <li>I love the beach smell...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s interesting...</li>
            <li>I love putting it on it</li>
            <li>Well I do not have to do that any more.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this scent, I feel like I am at the beach all the time.</li>
            <li>If you grew up using coppertone, you will love this scent.</li>
            <li>scent a wonderful addition to my perfume wardrobe, and I am on my second summer</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>But more than smelling sun tan lotion, it is the beach itself.  </li>
            <li>which is my favorite place in the world.</li>
            <li>A favorite scent, it smells like coppertone sunscreen :)</li>
            <li>The scent lasts all day so for the price, well worth it!!</li>
            <li>I was told the original smelled more like the beach</li>
            <li>It goes on strong but doesn&#x27;t stay that way.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, but doesn&#x27;t really linger; even if you spray quite a bit..</li>
            <li>Clean, fresh, and &#x27;summery&#x27;.</li>
            <li>It is super girlie on me.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I was thinking of!</li>
            <li>They said it such a gentle fragrance they both loved it.</li>
            <li>and then I found Almost Bare by Bobbi Brown which is very similar, although I liked it a bit more than W.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know how they did it, but it really does smell like the beach!  </li>
            <li>Aromatherapy for those who have enjoyed the beach in the earlier &amp;#34;Coppertone&amp;#34; days.  </li>
            <li>it smells exactly like suntan lotion.  </li>
            <li>It really is everything.</li>
            <li>but I can really smell the jasmine and would not call this unisex.</li>
            <li>Very unisex.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>effect is of old time Coppertone Sun lotion mixed with the exotic touch of patchouli.....</li>
            <li>you Bobbi Brown for the simple joy of nostalgia!!&lt;br /&gt;I can live Forever Summer, even in the dead of Winter.....</li>
            <li>so I can only wear it on special occasions.</li>
            <li>My beach wedding is now complete thanks to &#x27;Beach&#x27; by Bobbi Brown!</li>
            <li>This has an incredible sunscreen type smell and to me, at least, not a very feminine fragrance.</li>
            <li>Certainly in 30 minutes it&#x27;s completely gone.  </li>
            <li>I normally get migraines from perfume, but not from this one.</li>
            <li>first then Coppertone and finally surf with a touch of sunshine (yes there is a smell to sunshine and this has it).</li>
            <li>The problem is, it&#x27;s very very light to begin with, and second, it disappears after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>yes, it smells like Coppertone, but more complex.</li>
            <li>Surprised the price went up.</li>
            <li>I get an infinitely longer lasting scent from my much cheaper Gap body spray.  </li>
            <li>First notes deffo are sand and surf, then the second note is light jasmine and heavy Coppertone from my childhood (90&#x27;s era Coppertone smell), the final notes are sand and jasmine</li>
            <li>I did blind buy based on reviews, and if you like what you read you will love this scent!</li>
            <li>and you can barely smell it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unfortunate because this is such a great fragrance, but for the price, it&#x27;s a complete waste.  </li>

            <li> I am so in love with this scent. It really is everything. I am not sure if it is a person by person skin by skin thing but I can really smell the jasmine and would not call this unisex. It is super girlie on me. First notes deffo are sand and surf, then the second note is light jasmine and heavy Coppertone from my childhood (90&#x27;s era Coppertone smell), the final notes are sand and jasmine first then Coppertone and finally surf with a touch of sunshine (yes there is a smell to sunshine and this has it). It&#x27;s the beach in a bottle. I did blind buy based on reviews, and if you like what you read you will love this scent! It is exactly what I was thinking of! Comes packaged like jewelry as well.  Is this perfume everything I wanted for my wedding day bottled up? You betcha. My beach wedding is now complete thanks to &#x27;Beach&#x27; by Bobbi Brown!</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance.  Some only wear it in the summer, but I use it all year.  Reminds me of warm weather.</li>
            <li> Absolutely incredible fragrance. I&#x27;m a guy and love the smell of the summer. This has an incredible sunscreen type smell and to me, at least, not a very feminine fragrance. Very unisex. It goes on strong but doesn&#x27;t stay that way. The scent lasts all day so for the price, well worth it!! I purchased it only off of reviews and was nervous it would be &#x27;girly&#x27; and it wasn&#x27;t at all. Clean, fresh, and &#x27;summery&#x27;. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This scent takes me to my happy place...yes, it smells like Coppertone, but more complex. I get compliments every time I wear it, but more important, it&#x27;s my aromatherapy during this long, horrible winter.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent.  It DOES smell like the beach.  I defy someone to find a fragrance that smells more like the beach than this one!  Those who say it does not, I swear their sniffers aren&#x27;t working.  I used to wear W by Banana Republic for years and years and then I found Almost Bare by Bobbi Brown which is very similar, although I liked it a bit more than W.  And then there was BEACH.  I even add the Beach Oil to my bath.  I get stopped every single day with women (and sometimes men!) asking me what I am wearing since they love it.  One man wrote it down and asked where he might buy some for his girlfriend.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter in law and my daughter.They both love the beach fragrance.They said it such a gentle fragrance they both loved it.</li>
            <li> This smells just like the beach! I love it and it&#x27;s not strong at all... Very subtle</li>
            <li> Love the smell!! I love the smell of sunscreen and this smells just like it.</li>
            <li> Great. Everyone likes it. Surprised the price went up. I still will buy it!</li>
            <li> Ordered this thinking it would smell like the beach, it does not! Saying that I give it four stars because I liked the smell. If I had to change the name I would call it Jasmine because that is all I can smell. I was told the original smelled more like the beach so keep that in mind.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it but shipping takes a long time</li>
            <li> Love it! Kind of Coppertone hints in the fragrance. Very light and refreshing for summer!</li>
            <li> I love the beach and this is quite possibly the best perfume I have ever bought! Smells so good. I love the beach smell...even sunscreen! I also have the lotion and gel so staying power is not a problem. I don&#x27;t think I will ever wear another scent.</li>
            <li> Definitely has a sunscreen smell. It&#x27;s interesting...I like it for running around on the weekends, but I feel like I can&#x27;t wear the scent to work because I smell like I&#x27;ve just come from the pool. I probably won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of my childhood when I lived on the beach all summer.  Don&#x27;t know how they did it, but it really does smell like the beach!  My only complaint is the price.  Very expensive so I can only wear it on special occasions.</li>
            <li> I had hoped for a &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; fragrance but this has a slight chemical smell to it.  It reminds me of beach after they&#x27;ve sprayed for mosquitoes.  I still haven&#x27;t found the fragrance that is truly beach.</li>
            <li> one spritz is all it takes to make me happy</li>
            <li> I normally get migraines from perfume, but not from this one. I love putting it on it reminds me of when I was younger.  I hung out at the beach taking in the sun and the ocean breeze.  I loved the smell of the ocean and the way the sand felt on my feet.  I use to put suntan lotion on just to smell the beach.  Well I do not have to do that any more. Beach says it all.  I love it.  This is the only thing I will wear.  I am stocking up as we speak.  Get your purchase of beach you will not reach for any other perfume.</li>
            <li> This smells so wonderful I can hardly stand it.  The problem is, it&#x27;s very very light to begin with, and second, it disappears after a few minutes.  I have the roller ball and I can roll and roll and roll for several minutes and you can barely smell it.  Certainly in 30 minutes it&#x27;s completely gone.  I get an infinitely longer lasting scent from my much cheaper Gap body spray.  It&#x27;s unfortunate because this is such a great fragrance, but for the price, it&#x27;s a complete waste.  Maybe Bobbi Brown will get it together someday.  Until then, I don&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> Love this scent, I feel like I am at the beach all the time. If you grew up using coppertone, you will love this scent.</li>
            <li> Instantly transports you and anyone nearby to the idyllic beach days of our Youth.......&lt;br /&gt;This scent a wonderful addition to my perfume wardrobe, and I am on my second summer&lt;br /&gt;Wearing it constantly!&lt;br /&gt;The effect is of old time Coppertone Sun lotion mixed with the exotic touch of patchouli.....Yum.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Bobbi Brown for the simple joy of nostalgia!!&lt;br /&gt;I can live Forever Summer, even in the dead of Winter.....</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.  Aromatherapy for those who have enjoyed the beach in the earlier &amp;#34;Coppertone&amp;#34; days.  But more than smelling sun tan lotion, it is the beach itself.  And, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> My new FAVORITE perfume!!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!  Totally reminds me of the beach!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, but doesn&#x27;t really linger; even if you spray quite a bit..</li>
            <li> Loved the beach smell. Makes me feel like I&#x27;m at the beach which is my favorite place in the world.</li>
            <li> it smells exactly like suntan lotion.  My girl wanted it....you can get the same fragrance out of a $3 bottle of sun block....spend your money somewhere else, you&#x27;re only paying to support a washed up singer...</li>
            <li> Just as described...if you love the smell of summer then this fragrance is for you!</li>
            <li> Not loving it!  I&#x27;m told by several people I smell like sunscreen and that&#x27;s NOT what I was trying to smell like!</li>
            <li> A favorite scent, it smells like coppertone sunscreen :)</li>
