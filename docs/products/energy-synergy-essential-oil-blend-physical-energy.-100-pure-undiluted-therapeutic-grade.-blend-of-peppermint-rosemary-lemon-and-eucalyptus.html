            <li>I don&#x27;t even miss my coffee in the morning when I get to wake up to this :)</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;d be better as a massage oil or something.</li>
            <li>maybe because I\\&quot;m not quite sure how to use it, unlike the Muscle Aid and Pain Relief blends.</li>
            <li>I do give five stars to the product! :)</li>
            <li>I need to use it more conscientiously to determine its efficacy.</li>
            <li>I have health problems and have tried many different&lt;br /&gt; &amp;#34;alternative therapies&amp;#34; and this oil seems to make a difference in my mood for the better.</li>

            <li>Smells great, and definitely makes the environment feel energized!!!!!</li>
            <li>It pretty much smells like Eucolyptus, but it is not as strong, which is good, because I can put it on at work and nut run people out of the office.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s mind over matter, but when I use this, I really do feel more &amp;#34;awake&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This co has high quality, effective oils at Very reasonable prices.</li>
            <li>Other than that it is a great product.</li>
            <li>Would be great in a spray bottle with a little alcohol and water.</li>
            <li>This is a good addition to your essential oil collection or a good one to start with if you are just starting out using essential oils.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m pretty picky when it comes to smells etc.  </li>
            <li>Aromatherapy is very personal; I find I like to add a bit more rosemary to this blend when I add it to a carrier oil or lotion, but otherwise really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Energy blend in particular smells very fresh and lively, but I did not give it five stars because the peppermint and eucalyptus almost overpower the lemon and rosemary scents.</li>
            <li>The oil arrived very promptly and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>not at pure as others I have tried.</li>
            <li>I really like invigorating fragrance</li>

            <li>It has a pleasing scent and works very well for opening up the airways.</li>
            <li>They have high quality products at a reasonable price and this one is no exception.  </li>
            <li>Spray the body down when you need a boost : )</li>

            <li>I use this when I feel run down (which is a lot while I&#x27;m battling lyme disease) and it really does help boost my energy level.</li>

            <li> Put this in a diffuser every morning.  Helped awaken my senses and clear my mind for the day.&lt;br /&gt;Would be again.</li>
            <li> I use an electric scented oil diffuser in my home for aromatherapy and freshening the air.  Plant Therapy sells many wonderful oils that can be used for this purpose.  The Energy blend in particular smells very fresh and lively, but I did not give it five stars because the peppermint and eucalyptus almost overpower the lemon and rosemary scents.</li>
            <li> Ive added a few drops to my candle warmer, to fill room with Energy.  So far, Im liking the Energy!!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I really like this essential oil.  It&#x27;s a good quality oil blend and smells wonderful.  I use this with my diffuser.  The scent us uplifting and a good additional to dab on your forehead temples and by your ears before a workout of just while working around the house.

            <li> Thank you. I have used it on the bottom of my feet in the morning.I believe it helps with energy.</li>
            <li> I really like invigorating fragrance, I&#x27;m pretty picky when it comes to smells etc.  Although it has quite a kick when warm, honestly I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement.</li>
            <li> I use this when I feel run down (which is a lot while I&#x27;m battling lyme disease) and it really does help boost my energy level. Just rub some on my temples and wrists.</li>
            <li> This blend is very uplifting and energizing. It smells lovely and is so refreshing! I don&#x27;t even miss my coffee in the morning when I get to wake up to this :)</li>

            <li> Great product! Love this company!!</li>
            <li> Arrived intact and promptly. Looking forward to using it and I enjoy the fragrance. I am hoping to put it in a salve or lotion.</li>
            <li> Instead of coffee I use this!! It&#x27;s great and really, really works!! I especially love it before a workout!! It&#x27;s an essential part of my day.</li>
            <li> Smells great, and definitely makes the environment feel energized!!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for use in a diffuser, but can&#x27;t stand it - it smells like mildew! Maybe it&#x27;d be better as a massage oil or something.</li>
            <li> I use this in the morning in a spritz of almond oil. I Also pass some through my scalp, invigorating!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had much experience with this blend yet...maybe because I\\&quot;m not quite sure how to use it, unlike the Muscle Aid and Pain Relief blends. It does does wonderful.</li>
            <li> I was sceptical at using the product at first and tryed it with eyes wide open. I was surprized that it did really work and helped to get me to the gym..... I do give five stars to the product! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a couple of time and can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed any difference in my energy level or ability to concentrate.  I need to use it more conscientiously to determine its efficacy.</li>
            <li> I really like this blend. I put a few drops in a cold bath. Jump in for a few splashes after exercise and I feel great.&lt;br /&gt;Plant Therapy has brought together the best of the Refreshing oils and I appreciate the blend and the price. Would be great in a spray bottle with a little alcohol and water. Spray the body down when you need a boost : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The oil blend is good but I am not sure about the quality. It really does not have the strong characteristics of these oils at their best.</li>
            <li> The smell is AMAZING and it wakes me up and gets me going for the day!</li>
            <li> Love this scent, I add a little bit to my diffuser by my desk during the day.</li>
            <li> I use this oil to help clear up my congested nose during allergy season.  It is great and the price is awesome too!</li>
            <li> The oil arrived very promptly and was exactly as described. I have health problems and have tried many different&lt;br /&gt; &amp;#34;alternative therapies&amp;#34; and this oil seems to make a difference in my mood for the better.</li>
            <li> oil was ok not the best I have bought. will not buy again. not at pure as others I have tried. cheaper but not better.</li>
            <li> Does give you energy!  Great product:)</li>
            <li> Good oil! It helps but I wish it lasted can longer. Have ordered before and will continue to.</li>
            <li> Worked well and helped get through those long nights at work!!!</li>
            <li> Good company, quality oil, not crazy about the scent though.</li>
            <li> I was annoyed that this has a roller ball attached, I thought when purchasing I would be able to use it to drop the oil into my vaporizer.  I am able to take the roller ball top off, but which I had known before purchasing.</li>
            <li> This blend is really great.  It has a pleasing scent and works very well for opening up the airways. The particular oils used in this have awesome healing properties as well.  Invigorating and soothing all at once, I recommend this product for everyone.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It has a good smell to it and seems fresh. Aromatherapy is very personal; I find I like to add a bit more rosemary to this blend when I add it to a carrier oil or lotion, but otherwise really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 4-star comes from the dropper.  It does not drop well - it sort of just pours out.  I have had this issue with other of the same brand so I am guessing it is the dropper style.  You just have to be careful when pouring.  Other than that it is a great product.</li>
            <li> I love this oil..smells great and really works</li>
            <li> The product is excellent. Exactly as expected. Will purchase again.</li>
