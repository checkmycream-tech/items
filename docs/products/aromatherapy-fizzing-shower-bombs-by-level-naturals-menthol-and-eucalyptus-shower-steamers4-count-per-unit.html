            <li>They work awesome...</li>
            <li>Soooooo awesome.</li>

            <li>Very good.</li>
            <li>Almost as good as a neti pot!</li>
            <li>A great gift, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are just great.  </li>
            <li>While the water hits the tablet it vaporizes and smells great, just like Vick&#x27;s vapor rub.  </li>
            <li>Smells  great and arrived on time</li>
            <li>this product is a great idea</li>
            <li>not so great.  </li>
            <li>it was great however.</li>
            <li>A SHOWER SO REFRESHING!!</li>
            <li>They smell very nice, but you blink</li>
            <li>Love these, the smell is great!</li>
            <li>I really love the wonderful Eucalyptus scent.</li>
            <li>the shower fizz melts very, very quickly, but, the bathroom is scently wonderfully.</li>
            <li>size is fine, and the smell is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>WHAT IT SAYS IT DOES AND SMELLS GOOD</li>
            <li>Good concept needs improvement.</li>
            <li>I took a shower and did have to move this around for a bit with my foot to determine optimum placement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not as good as I hoped.</li>
            <li>I love these!  </li>
            <li>anyhow these shower bombs are amazing.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, though.</li>
            <li>These are amazing - I just wish they were larger.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are amazing.</li>
            <li>but it lasted almost 2 showers (one tablet), which is nice</li>
            <li>I will be using these more often, good product.</li>
            <li>but the scent is good and strong while it lasts.</li>
            <li>I liked the product to say it was just okay for the price.</li>
            <li>The product is ok, but is not as effective as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>These shower bombs have a very pleasant, healing scent, great for when you have a little nasal congestion.</li>
            <li>I just ordered more.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Ordered more to give to my family and they were amazed at how well they worked for their colds.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m really glad they&#x27;re on Amazon now...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, these things help me wake up better than two cups of coffee</li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t even have caffeine :-)</li>
            <li>and I LOVE to take baths using my Menthol/Eucalyptus/Camphor products</li>
            <li>Maybe they&#x27;ll work better in a bath then the shower.</li>
            <li>Spend the money and buy a name brand version for sure.</li>
            <li>Unless that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, which I suppose many might be, I&#x27;d look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>so I can smell it better.</li>
            <li>Love love love these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased more and will continue to buy these.</li>
            <li>I will be keeping these in stock for sure.</li>
            <li>i bought this more for the scent, which works for me.  </li>
            <li>We love them for when we have colds.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>and I LOVE to take baths using my Menthol/Eucalyptus/Camphor products</li>
            <li>These things are amazing, turns a regular shower into a steam shower with a wonderful minty eucalyptus steam that clears our your sinuses and leaves you feeling fresh and revived.  </li>
            <li>Such a great way to feel better!  </li>
            <li>Nice, but disappear so quickly</li>
            <li>so others, they do crumble really easily and go very quickly</li>
            <li>they are definitely strong and work well with head congestion</li>
            <li>Not as strong a smell as I was hoping for...</li>
            <li>I was expecting a strong eucalytic aroma and there was nothing.</li>
            <li>Enjoy...</li>
            <li>These smell fabulous.</li>
            <li>I love a hot shower, these just dissolved so very quickly.</li>
            <li>Smells minty, so fresh, and so clean!</li>
            <li>My sinuses are feeling pretty nice right now, as well.  </li>
            <li>It works great and costs way less with more uses.</li>
            <li>I ordered 3 more boxes after the first one worked out well.</li>
            <li>I would also have liked if it would be compact/slower disolving material so to last for more than just one shower.  </li>
            <li>They dissolve very fast and have a nice menthol fragrance  but doesn&#x27;t do much else.</li>
            <li>These are not bad, but they are not the shower soothers, as they dissolve quickly.</li>
            <li>The shower bombs dissolve extremely quick, so you will end up using two (if you can get them out of the plastic wrapper)</li>
            <li>Dissolves too quickly.</li>
            <li>Some aroma, but disappears quickly before the shower is over.  </li>
            <li>They did have a strong smell that is very relaxing.</li>
            <li>These little bath bombs are great.</li>
            <li>I liked that each of the bath bombs were individually wrapped.</li>
            <li>Also, the oils really make your feet nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li>This is my second time buying these, if you are looking for a nice relaxing shower go for these.</li>
            <li>They are definitely worth it as a treat once in a while.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much more potent and energizing than I had expected.</li>
            <li>I thought these were pretty cool.  </li>
            <li>Not the best idea for a product that crumbles very easily :(</li>
            <li>so far so good , have only used one</li>
            <li>EXACTLY</li>
            <li>The instructions say to just put the product on the floor in the shower and the hot water will make the aroma rise.</li>
            <li>They are a great way to wake up in the morning - especially after a long night on the town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have three more of these in my package and I&#x27;ll be amazed if I can keep myself from using all of them in the same week.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll probably be able to use it on a second shower.</li>
            <li>The scent was nice for the little it lasted, but both worth the cash.</li>
            <li>They did not melt as fast as I thought they would in the hot show.  </li>
            <li>He said at first the scent was fairly strong and did help but just a few minutes into the shower, the bomb quickly dissolved.  </li>
            <li>He said at first the scent was fairly strong and did help but just a few minutes into the shower, the bomb quickly dissolved.</li>
            <li>An absolute must try product.  </li>
            <li>They arent really &amp;#34;fizzy,&amp;#34; though.</li>
            <li>I have ordered products like this in the past and have always been very pleased until now.</li>
            <li>I bought these thinking they would be similar to Shower Soothers, which are no longer available.  </li>
            <li>It really smells up your bathroom</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t really helpful.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t turn into a steamy shower and the scent was really faded.</li>
            <li>but once in the shower you really could not smell the aroma therapy.</li>
            <li>so I suppose one shouldn&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li>Part of gift, can&#x27;t wait to hear how much they like it.</li>
            <li>These &amp;#34;bombs&amp;#34;, while the fragrance in nice, are a waste.</li>
            <li>Tried placing the shower bomb in different places in the tub, but never really got a good scent.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first but definitely a great buy.</li>
            <li>Very crumbly, and smelled highly medicinal.</li>
            <li>I guess maybe the product dissolved faster than I expected and didn&#x27;t last as long / wasn&#x27;t as strong as I would have liked, but perhaps because it is all-natural.</li>
            <li>The first shower I used one, off to the side, like I did the old shower soothers.  </li>
            <li>I have no idea how anyone could claim that these last for a full shower, unless they learned to shower in the Army or something.  </li>
            <li>Its not a bad product, but it doesnt release enough scent while the shower is on just from the steam.  </li>
            <li>The aroma isn&#x27;t nearly strong enough to be useful for sinuses and I have a sensitive nose for such things.  </li>
            <li>Not as strong as I expected.</li>
            <li>Not as strong as I expected.</li>
            <li>Unless I put my face near the bomb on the floor, there wasn&#x27;t much aroma being released.</li>
            <li>your sinuses open right up...</li>
            <li>The bomb lasted maybe 10-15 minutes, so for those who take super long showers</li>
            <li>One in the shower provides very little aroma anything; they vanish pretty quickly when in much contact with the water from the shower.</li>
            <li>Dissolves very quickly and is not very strong.</li>
            <li>for the 6 minutes they last in a hot shower.</li>
            <li>If the second one last longer when I move it further away from the water stream, I will update with a better review.</li>
            <li>Gave off little &amp;#34;aroma therapy.&amp;#34; Have purchased similar products in the past that were much more enjoyable.</li>
            <li>The second shower I used two, directly near the drain, figuring even if it dissolved fast, some scent with little lasting power was better than nothing.  </li>
            <li>Helps to clear everything up.</li>
            <li>He is not one to take a bath but has a fairly busy, stressful life</li>
            <li>Dropped in the tub as opposed to the shower ONCE and nearly burnt my eyes out.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME!&lt;br</li>
            <li>As for use, the shower bomb didn&#x27;t even last my whole shower.  </li>
            <li>Lasts longer if not in direct stream.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised with the scent-</li>
            <li>The scent was strongest towards the end, when it had almost completely disintegrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He is not one to take a bath but has a fairly busy, stressful life</li>
            <li>expensive but loved them</li>
            <li>Love the smell, last as long as can be expected for a shower fizz.  </li>
            <li>Love it when I give myself a little extra shower time to pop one of these guys on the shower floor and can breath it in deep.</li>
            <li>I initially put the bomb in the center of the shower, but saw it was dissolving so quickly, so I kicked it off to the side.</li>
            <li>Purchased these as a gift, they were much smaller than a normal shower bomb</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t last a super long time, but it did last for 2/3 of my shower.  </li>
            <li>some of the other reviewers, I did think these were pretty crumbly.  </li>
            <li>Psychologically, the scent was a little comforting, but as noted, it lasted for a very short time and didn&#x27;t seem to actually help any more than steam alone.  </li>
            <li>Definitely helps clear my sinuses</li>
            <li>each one would need to be far larger in size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent was barely discernible and did nothing to relieve any congestion symptoms.</li>
            <li>I have used a couple different products like this one, and unless you put it almost completely under the shower it doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There was barely any scent at all.  </li>
            <li>I only used one so far.</li>
            <li>i wanted a natural alternative to the tablets they sell at the drugstore, but I don&#x27;t know that these worked well enough for me to re-order.</li>
            <li>I think I want to use these in every shower now, although I will try other brands of similar product first to see if I can find something that lasts longer.</li>
            <li>I ordered it and was surprised at how teeny tiny these actually are.  </li>
            <li>Nice item, but expensive and not very long lasting.</li>
            <li>When you put it under direct water though it does not last very long.</li>
            <li>Essential oils are just as good and less expensive.</li>
            <li>Expected the scent to be stronger in the center due to drying process, but never really got a strong scent.  </li>

            <li> The shower bombs dissolve extremely quick, so you will end up using two (if you can get them out of the plastic wrapper)</li>
            <li> Dissolves too quickly.</li>
            <li> Some aroma, but disappears quickly before the shower is over.  </li>
            <li> They did have a strong smell that is very relaxing.</li>
            <li> These little bath bombs are great.</li>
            <li> I liked that each of the bath bombs were individually wrapped.</li>
            <li> Also, the oils really make your feet nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying these, if you are looking for a nice relaxing shower go for these.</li>
            <li> They are definitely worth it as a treat once in a while.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much more potent and energizing than I had expected.</li>
            <li> I thought these were pretty cool.  </li>
            <li> Not the best idea for a product that crumbles very easily :(</li>
            <li> so far so good , have only used one</li>
            <li> EXACTLY</li>
            <li> The instructions say to just put the product on the floor in the shower and the hot water will make the aroma rise.</li>
            <li> They are a great way to wake up in the morning - especially after a long night on the town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have three more of these in my package and I&#x27;ll be amazed if I can keep myself from using all of them in the same week.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll probably be able to use it on a second shower.</li>
            <li> The scent was nice for the little it lasted, but both worth the cash.</li>
            <li> They did not melt as fast as I thought they would in the hot show.  </li>
            <li> He said at first the scent was fairly strong and did help but just a few minutes into the shower, the bomb quickly dissolved.  </li>
            <li> He said at first the scent was fairly strong and did help but just a few minutes into the shower, the bomb quickly dissolved.</li>
            <li> An absolute must try product.  </li>
            <li> They arent really &amp;#34;fizzy,&amp;#34; though.</li>
            <li> I have ordered products like this in the past and have always been very pleased until now.</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking they would be similar to Shower Soothers, which are no longer available.  </li>
            <li> It really smells up your bathroom</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t really helpful.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t turn into a steamy shower and the scent was really faded.</li>
            <li> but once in the shower you really could not smell the aroma therapy.</li>
            <li> so I suppose one shouldn&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li> Part of gift, can&#x27;t wait to hear how much they like it.</li>
            <li> These &amp;#34;bombs&amp;#34;, while the fragrance in nice, are a waste.</li>
            <li> Tried placing the shower bomb in different places in the tub, but never really got a good scent.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but definitely a great buy.</li>
            <li> Very crumbly, and smelled highly medicinal.</li>
            <li> I guess maybe the product dissolved faster than I expected and didn&#x27;t last as long / wasn&#x27;t as strong as I would have liked, but perhaps because it is all-natural.</li>
            <li> The first shower I used one, off to the side, like I did the old shower soothers.  </li>
            <li> I have no idea how anyone could claim that these last for a full shower, unless they learned to shower in the Army or something.  </li>
            <li> Its not a bad product, but it doesnt release enough scent while the shower is on just from the steam.  </li>
            <li> The aroma isn&#x27;t nearly strong enough to be useful for sinuses and I have a sensitive nose for such things.  </li>
            <li> Not as strong as I expected.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as I expected.</li>
            <li> Unless I put my face near the bomb on the floor, there wasn&#x27;t much aroma being released.</li>
            <li> your sinuses open right up...</li>
            <li> The bomb lasted maybe 10-15 minutes, so for those who take super long showers</li>
            <li> One in the shower provides very little aroma anything; they vanish pretty quickly when in much contact with the water from the shower.</li>
            <li> Dissolves very quickly and is not very strong.</li>
            <li> for the 6 minutes they last in a hot shower.</li>
            <li> If the second one last longer when I move it further away from the water stream, I will update with a better review.</li>
            <li> Gave off little &amp;#34;aroma therapy.&amp;#34; Have purchased similar products in the past that were much more enjoyable.</li>
            <li> The second shower I used two, directly near the drain, figuring even if it dissolved fast, some scent with little lasting power was better than nothing.  </li>
            <li> Helps to clear everything up.</li>
            <li> He is not one to take a bath but has a fairly busy, stressful life</li>
            <li> Dropped in the tub as opposed to the shower ONCE and nearly burnt my eyes out.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME!&lt;br</li>
            <li> As for use, the shower bomb didn&#x27;t even last my whole shower.  </li>
            <li> Lasts longer if not in direct stream.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised with the scent-</li>
            <li> The scent was strongest towards the end, when it had almost completely disintegrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He is not one to take a bath but has a fairly busy, stressful life</li>
            <li> expensive but loved them</li>
            <li> Love the smell, last as long as can be expected for a shower fizz.  </li>
            <li> Love it when I give myself a little extra shower time to pop one of these guys on the shower floor and can breath it in deep.</li>
            <li> I initially put the bomb in the center of the shower, but saw it was dissolving so quickly, so I kicked it off to the side.</li>
            <li> Purchased these as a gift, they were much smaller than a normal shower bomb</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t last a super long time, but it did last for 2/3 of my shower.  </li>
            <li> some of the other reviewers, I did think these were pretty crumbly.  </li>
            <li> Psychologically, the scent was a little comforting, but as noted, it lasted for a very short time and didn&#x27;t seem to actually help any more than steam alone.  </li>
            <li> Definitely helps clear my sinuses</li>
            <li> each one would need to be far larger in size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent was barely discernible and did nothing to relieve any congestion symptoms.</li>
            <li> I have used a couple different products like this one, and unless you put it almost completely under the shower it doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There was barely any scent at all.  </li>
            <li> I only used one so far.</li>
            <li> i wanted a natural alternative to the tablets they sell at the drugstore, but I don&#x27;t know that these worked well enough for me to re-order.</li>
            <li> I think I want to use these in every shower now, although I will try other brands of similar product first to see if I can find something that lasts longer.</li>
            <li> I ordered it and was surprised at how teeny tiny these actually are.  </li>
            <li> Nice item, but expensive and not very long lasting.</li>
            <li> When you put it under direct water though it does not last very long.</li>
            <li> Essential oils are just as good and less expensive.</li>
            <li> Expected the scent to be stronger in the center due to drying process, but never really got a strong scent.  </li>
            <li> and they last a while so, not great for a quick shower.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really work and are really small.</li>
            <li> It lasts for just a few seconds, no matter where you put it in the shower (as far back as you possibly can).</li>
            <li> I live in one of the allergy capitals of the world and suffer almost year round.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t last very long in the shower.</li>
            <li> And if you place it directly under the water spray, it just makes a mess.</li>
            <li> But the few minutes it worked, it did help clear his sinuses.</li>
            <li> But the few minutes it worked, it did help clear his sinuses.</li>
            <li> maybe I had it too close to the stream of water, just didn&#x27;t seem like it lasted long at all.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a smell that lasts long.</li>
            <li> Nothing like it after a long day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a Sudafed Shower Soother replacement for a very long time</li>
            <li> The tablets last only a few minutes and aren&#x27;t that &amp;#34;potent.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> /&gt;Given the cost, I can only describe them as a big waste of money.</li>
            <li> I would use them on a limited basis because of the strength of the aroma.  </li>
            <li> I wish these were available in a case size, because they are a little expensive to use regularly, and I could see myself buying 24 or 48 of them at a time.</li>
            <li> li does not last very long milk goes down the drain fix it</li>
            <li> The only things these &amp;#34;bombs&amp;#34; do is dissolve and go down the drain along with your money.</li>
            <li> It is also very hard to get out of the packaging; it is packaged with the plastic very tightly against the product, forcing you to pick, pinch and otherwise squeeze to give yourself enough leeway to gently tear it open.</li>
            <li> Each shower bomb is smaller then a half dollar</li>
            <li> bomb is small and does not last the entire shower</li>
            <li> Not recommended for showers with center drains though.</li>
            <li> I didnt get it completely wet</li>
            <li> , I was worried it would dissolve when it got wet, but it takes longer than that.</li>
            <li> I simply wouldn&#x27;t waste anymore money on this product.  </li>
            <li> but it was nothing like what I expected.  </li>
            <li> No much  to rave about.</li>
            <li> Worked exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> So small I could barely see them.  </li>
            <li> Dissolved instantly with very little aromas being released.</li>
            <li> The item is too small needs to be bigger</li>
            <li> I solved that problem by removing the plastic wrapper with scissors (I keep sharp scissors in my bathroom cabinet) over the tub.</li>
            <li> Would try other brands.</li>
            <li> A little expensive at three dollars each but worth it when you are nor feeling good.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the luxury.</li>
            <li> My only disappointment is that the bombs are a little on the small side (only a few inches tall), so they dissipate quickly in the shower.</li>
            <li> So only use it when youre sick because it helps to clear up sinuses but don&#x27;t use it just to have a nice shower because the smell is very faint</li>
            <li> The price is very high for such a small and barely faint smelling product</li>
            <li> Not really worth it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so small and doesn&#x27;t last but a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> not very strong, you need to use 2 at a time</li>
            <li> The scent is mediocre, not overwhelming even though I had the shower blasting hot water with lots of steam.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are a bit expensive for every day use, but I will keep them around for when I&#x27;m particularly stressed.</li>
            <li> He wished it lasted a little longer.  </li>
            <li> little pricey</li>
            <li> I think to have the desired effect, you would need between 5 and 10 of these little things at your feet while showering and/or</li>
            <li> He wished it lasted a little longer.</li>
            <li> Too pricey for too little product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.  </li>
            <li> it melts away in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I also have allergies and sinus trouble.  </li>
            <li> Shocked to see that $8 + $4 shipping meant only 1 box of 4 tiny shower bombs...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure.</li>
            <li> I have a relatively small sower and was concerned of being over-powered by these</li>
            <li> and I got a small whiff of it during those minutes</li>
            <li> Not sure if if was an user error</li>
            <li> 4 little bombs for $9 is not a good value.  </li>
            <li> I was saving them for a rough day or something, but when I got sick recently (cold), I used one and the menthol cleared me up and let me breathe for the whole shower, it was so relieving!</li>
            <li> Hard to find in the store.</li>
            <li> I have been having an acid reflux problem lately and my throat is sore</li>
            <li> They are every small, and used up in 30 seconds!</li>
            <li> Very expensive for 4 showers only.</li>
            <li> A little expensive. ...</li>
            <li> He recently became sick</li>
            <li> He recently became sick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used CVS shower soothers and thought they were on the weak side</li>
            <li> Not very impressed.</li>
            <li> I got them when I had a horrible sinus infection and was hoping the menthol would help clear my head.  </li>
            <li> Not so fizzy and the smell is faint...</li>
            <li> but in actuality I had to place my face within inches of these to get a faint whiff of eucalyptus.</li>
            <li> If these werent so expensive I would use one for every shower I take.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t expensive</li>
            <li> I hate giving negative reviews</li>
            <li> Used one this morning and absolutely no fragrance at all, very disappointing and worthless product.</li>
            <li> I found it to be a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> The eucalyptus aroma is very faint</li>
            <li> Worked wonders for my son when he was sick</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift for a spa enthusiast, and was sorely disappointed with the product itself.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> Will not buy again :((</li>
            <li> very disappointed</li>
            <li> but I was very disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very good. Not recommended for showers with center drains though.</li>
            <li> Love these, the smell is great!</li>
            <li> Not really worth it. The tablets last only a few minutes and aren&#x27;t that &amp;#34;potent.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Not as strong as I expected. Gave off little &amp;#34;aroma therapy.&amp;#34; Have purchased similar products in the past that were much more enjoyable.</li>
            <li> Worked wonders for my son when he was sick</li>
            <li> so far so good , have only used one</li>
            <li> Not enough smell in shower.</li>
            <li> These little bath bombs are great.Their about 3 to 3.5 inches in height and width. The scent is mediocre, not overwhelming even though I had the shower blasting hot water with lots of steam. They last about five minutes in the shower for me. I liked that each of the bath bombs were individually wrapped. Its one of those &amp;#34;you get, what you pay for&amp;#34; items.</li>
            <li> I liked the product to say it was just okay for the price. I guess maybe the product dissolved faster than I expected and didn&#x27;t last as long / wasn&#x27;t as strong as I would have liked, but perhaps because it is all-natural. I&#x27;m not really sure. I don&#x27;t have buyer&#x27;s remorse, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> i got one brief whiff and it was gone. no steam. no spa. nothing. very disappointed</li>
            <li> Definitely helps clear my sinuses</li>
            <li> Awesome if you have sinus blockage. I wish these were available in a case size, because they are a little expensive to use regularly, and I could see myself buying 24 or 48 of them at a time. I ordered 3 more boxes after the first one worked out well.</li>
            <li> Great product! I just ordered more.</li>
            <li> they are definitely strong and work well with head congestion</li>
            <li> An absolute must try product.  These things are amazing, turns a regular shower into a steam shower with a wonderful minty eucalyptus steam that clears our your sinuses and leaves you feeling fresh and revived.  I am hooked!</li>
            <li> not very strong, you need to use 2 at a time</li>
            <li> Not as strong a smell as I was hoping for...</li>
            <li> I tried this product because I use to use shower soothers that Vicks took off the market.  These are not bad, but they are not the shower soothers, as they dissolve quickly.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. The only things these &amp;#34;bombs&amp;#34; do is dissolve and go down the drain along with your money. There is no vapor or anything.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Ordered more to give to my family and they were amazed at how well they worked for their colds.</li>
            <li> WILL CONTINUE TO BUY THIS ! DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT SAYS IT DOES AND SMELLS GOOD ..MAKES A SHOWER SO REFRESHING!!</li>
            <li> These things are great! I was saving them for a rough day or something, but when I got sick recently (cold), I used one and the menthol cleared me up and let me breathe for the whole shower, it was so relieving! Also, the oils really make your feet nice and soft. They arent really &amp;#34;fizzy,&amp;#34; though. I didnt get it completely wet but it lasted almost 2 showers (one tablet), which is nice, I was worried it would dissolve when it got wet, but it takes longer than that. I will be using these more often, good product.</li>
            <li> Not so fizzy and the smell is faint...</li>
            <li> I found it to be a disappointment.  The aroma isn&#x27;t nearly strong enough to be useful for sinuses and I have a sensitive nose for such things.  I would also have liked if it would be compact/slower disolving material so to last for more than just one shower.  I simply wouldn&#x27;t waste anymore money on this product.  I&#x27;m considering a vicks waterless evaporator product to put by the sink or edge of the tub during my shower.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband and he loves these. He has sinus problems</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Level Naturals since finding them about a year ago so I&#x27;m really glad they&#x27;re on Amazon now... anyhow these shower bombs are amazing. They have a lot of menthol, so you drop it in the shower and instantly your shower feels like a steam room... your sinuses open right up... your skin feels tingly and awake... it&#x27;s AWESOME! A great gift, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, these things help me wake up better than two cups of coffee and they don&#x27;t even have caffeine :-)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband.  He is not one to take a bath but has a fairly busy, stressful life and I LOVE to take baths using my Menthol/Eucalyptus/Camphor products so I figured a shower bomb would be perfect to help him relax some.  He recently became sick so he finally used one.  He said at first the scent was fairly strong and did help but just a few minutes into the shower, the bomb quickly dissolved.  He wished it lasted a little longer.  But the few minutes it worked, it did help clear his sinuses.</li>
            <li> I have ordered products like this in the past and have always been very pleased until now. Used one this morning and absolutely no fragrance at all, very disappointing and worthless product. Save your money and buy something else.</li>
            <li> These are just great.  You open one up and place it in the shower with you.  While the water hits the tablet it vaporizes and smells great, just like Vick&#x27;s vapor rub.  A little expensive at three dollars each but worth it when you are nor feeling good.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the luxury.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used CVS shower soothers and thought they were on the weak side so I decided to try these. These are even weaker. I have a relatively small sower and was concerned of being over-powered by these but in actuality I had to place my face within inches of these to get a faint whiff of eucalyptus. Maybe they&#x27;ll work better in a bath then the shower. I&#x27;ll stick with CVS&#x27;s shower Soothers at $5.</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking they would be similar to Shower Soothers, which are no longer available.  Not even close, I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> my feet burned for hours after use in shower</li>
            <li> Dissolved instantly with very little aromas being released. Dropped in the tub as opposed to the shower ONCE and nearly burnt my eyes out. Spend the money and buy a name brand version for sure.</li>
            <li> THESE SUCK~DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME!&lt;br /&gt;NO FRAGRANCE~TEENY TINY BOMBS!&lt;br /&gt;THIS PRODUCT BOMBS IN A BAD WAY!!</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift for a spa enthusiast, and was sorely disappointed with the product itself. Very crumbly, and smelled highly medicinal. Unless that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, which I suppose many might be, I&#x27;d look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really work and are really small.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in the store. they work great!</li>
            <li> maybe I had it too close to the stream of water, just didn&#x27;t seem like it lasted long at all.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.  I&#x27;m returning mine back today.  I ordered it and was surprised at how teeny tiny these actually are.  As for use, the shower bomb didn&#x27;t even last my whole shower.  I caught whiffs of it here and there but it was nothing like what I expected.  I was expecting to experience something similar to a sauna or spa with aromatherapy.  Save yourself some money and buy a bottle of Eucalyptus oil and mix with some baking soda and use that.  It works great and costs way less with more uses.</li>
            <li> A little expensive. ...</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell that opens up your senses!  If these werent so expensive I would use one for every shower I take.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Package arrived on time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-  The eucalyptus aroma is very faint&lt;br /&gt;-  Each shower bomb is smaller then a half dollar&lt;br /&gt;-  The price is very high for such a small and barely faint smelling product&lt;br /&gt;-  The shower bombs dissolve extremely quick, so you will end up using two (if you can get them out of the plastic wrapper)</li>
            <li> Assume ... I wish 1-bomb would last for 60-minutes.  That&#x27;s how wonderful you feel during and after your shower.  Enjoy...</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t last very long in the shower. but the scent is good and strong while it lasts.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a strong eucalytic aroma and there was nothing. I was really disappointed in the product. I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> The item is too small needs to be bigger evaporates too soon improve li does not last very long milk goes down the drain fix it</li>
            <li> It really smells up your bathroom but it&#x27;s not a smell that lasts long. You&#x27;ll get the same effect from using a bath and body works shower gel.</li>
            <li> The instructions say to just put the product on the floor in the shower and the hot water will make the aroma rise. I decided that it&#x27;s easier to just hold the product in my hand so I can smell it better. It smells amazing, though.</li>
            <li> I live in one of the allergy capitals of the world and suffer almost year round. Love it when I give myself a little extra shower time to pop one of these guys on the shower floor and can breath it in deep. Helps to clear everything up. Quite happy!</li>
            <li> As close as I can get to the shower so others, they do crumble really easily and go very quickly</li>
            <li> it melts away in just a few minutes. I love that it&#x27;s natural but it&#x27;s so small and doesn&#x27;t last but a few minutes. Will not buy again :((</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t smell this product!</li>
            <li> They dissolve very fast and have a nice menthol fragrance  but doesn&#x27;t do much else. No much  to rave about.</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying these, if you are looking for a nice relaxing shower go for these. They are definitely worth it as a treat once in a while.</li>
            <li> Love love love these. I was skeptical at first but definitely a great buy. I&#x27;ve purchased more and will continue to buy these.</li>
            <li> Misleading - 4 pack suggested 4 boxes for that price. Very expensive for 4 showers only. Shocked to see that $8 + $4 shipping meant only 1 box of 4 tiny shower bombs...</li>
            <li> I received this as part of a subscription service and went off in search of it - and of course Amazon had it.  These are amazing - I just wish they were larger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The menthol &amp; eucalyptus scent is excellent for clearing out the sinuses.  I will be keeping these in stock for sure.</li>
            <li> These &amp;#34;bombs&amp;#34;, while the fragrance in nice, are a waste. They are every small, and used up in 30 seconds! Not even a short shower! Essential oils are just as good and less expensive.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot, it&#x27;s just that you have to hold it up to your nose to smell it. So only use it when youre sick because it helps to clear up sinuses but don&#x27;t use it just to have a nice shower because the smell is very faint</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to try a shower bomb and I finally sprung when I was suffering from a sinus infection. Now, I don&#x27;t think that I can take a shower ever again without one of these guys. They steam up immediately and relieve chest congestion. They are a great way to wake up in the morning - especially after a long night on the town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;See above&lt;br /&gt;Relaxing&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Do not leave a residue in the shower&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;A little pricey&lt;br /&gt;You will get hooked&lt;br /&gt;The bomb is small and does not last the entire shower&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;I have already bought again and you should too.</li>
            <li> Not very impressed. Tried placing the shower bomb in different places in the tub, but never really got a good scent.  Finally just held it in my cupped hands and inhaled the fumes. Expected the scent to be stronger in the center due to drying process, but never really got a strong scent.  Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> if you are a fan of Vick&#x27;s mentholated scent, then, you will adore this scent.  i bought this more for the scent, which works for me.  the shower fizz melts very, very quickly, but, the bathroom is scently wonderfully.</li>
            <li> About the best replacement for the discontinued &amp;#34;Shower Savers&amp;#34; that I have found. I wish they were a touch bigger.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as I expected.</li>
            <li> Lasted all of 2-3 minutes and I got a small whiff of it during those minutes and that&#x27;s it. I won&#x27;t buy this product again. Wasn&#x27;t really helpful.</li>
            <li> Not sure if if was an user error but it didn&#x27;t turn into a steamy shower and the scent was really faded.</li>
            <li> Purchased these to test out. Not impressed. One in the shower provides very little aroma anything; they vanish pretty quickly when in much contact with the water from the shower. I think to have the desired effect, you would need between 5 and 10 of these little things at your feet while showering and/or each one would need to be far larger in size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the cost, I can only describe them as a big waste of money.</li>
            <li> The scent was barely discernible and did nothing to relieve any congestion symptoms.</li>
            <li> Nice, but disappear so quickly I won&#x27;t buy again.  They smell very nice, but you blink and it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> expensive but loved them</li>
            <li> I have used a couple different products like this one, and unless you put it almost completely under the shower it doesn&#x27;t smell. When you put it under direct water though it does not last very long.</li>
            <li> I hate giving negative reviews but I was very disappointed in this product.  I&#x27;ve been searching for a Sudafed Shower Soother replacement for a very long time and I was hoping this was it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was barely any scent at all.  The first shower I used one, off to the side, like I did the old shower soothers.  Nothing.  The second shower I used two, directly near the drain, figuring even if it dissolved fast, some scent with little lasting power was better than nothing.  I maybe got a whiff of the eucalyptus before it was gone.  I will say even directly next to the drain, it didn&#x27;t dissolve immediately, so I guess that was a bonus (maybe?) but if you are buying this for the scent, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> Purchased these as a gift, they were much smaller than a normal shower bomb but the recipient seemed to like them.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, last as long as can be expected for a shower fizz.  Lasts longer if not in direct stream. We love them for when we have colds. Would have given them a 5 if they weren&#x27;t so pricey.</li>
            <li> Dissolves too quickly.</li>
            <li> Smells  great and arrived on time this product is a great idea but once in the shower you really could not smell the aroma therapy. Good concept needs improvement.</li>
            <li> Worked exactly as expected. Delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li> So small I could barely see them.  Very disappointed with this product.  Did not give it for Christmas as I was embarrased.</li>
            <li> They work awesome...for the 6 minutes they last in a hot shower. I love a hot shower, these just dissolved so very quickly. They did have a strong smell that is very relaxing. If there was just a way to make them last longer...</li>
            <li> not so great.  Some aroma, but disappears quickly before the shower is over.  Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Dissolves very quickly and is not very strong. The scent was nice for the little it lasted, but both worth the cash.</li>
            <li> I love these!  Soooooo awesome. Nothing like it after a long day</li>
            <li> I got these in the mail today, and just got out of the shower. Oh my gosh it makes the shower heavenly! Smells minty, so fresh, and so clean! I initially put the bomb in the center of the shower, but saw it was dissolving so quickly, so I kicked it off to the side. That definitely did the trick. The dissolution of the bomb slowed, but the minty aroma stayed. The bomb lasted maybe 10-15 minutes, so for those who take super long showers this may be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;These are a bit expensive for every day use, but I will keep them around for when I&#x27;m particularly stressed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. They didn&#x27;t work. I put it in the shower and you couldn&#x27;t smell anything. I was waiting for the eucalyptus scent but got nothing.</li>
            <li> Such a great way to feel better!  Love it</li>
            <li> Unless I put my face near the bomb on the floor, there wasn&#x27;t much aroma being released. I also found the packing to be too fussy for a product that crumbles.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t expensive so I suppose one shouldn&#x27;t expect much. It lasts for just a few seconds, no matter where you put it in the shower (as far back as you possibly can). While it did last...it was great however. It is also very hard to get out of the packaging; it is packaged with the plastic very tightly against the product, forcing you to pick, pinch and otherwise squeeze to give yourself enough leeway to gently tear it open. Not the best idea for a product that crumbles very easily :(</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised with the scent- it&#x27;s much more potent and energizing than I had expected. My only disappointment is that the bombs are a little on the small side (only a few inches tall), so they dissipate quickly in the shower.</li>
            <li> I thought these were pretty cool.  I have been having an acid reflux problem lately and my throat is sore (it&#x27;s not heartburn; it&#x27;s actually in my pharynx).  I also have allergies and sinus trouble.  So I thought a shower with lots of menthol and eucalyptus vapor would be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like some of the other reviewers, I did think these were pretty crumbly.  I solved that problem by removing the plastic wrapper with scissors (I keep sharp scissors in my bathroom cabinet) over the tub. I took a shower and did have to move this around for a bit with my foot to determine optimum placement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t last a super long time, but it did last for 2/3 of my shower.  The scent was strongest towards the end, when it had almost completely disintegrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought this was definitely soothing; I breathed a lot through my mouth during the shower and I think it helped my throat.  My sinuses are feeling pretty nice right now, as well.  I have three more of these in my package and I&#x27;ll be amazed if I can keep myself from using all of them in the same week.  I think I want to use these in every shower now, although I will try other brands of similar product first to see if I can find something that lasts longer.</li>
            <li> These shower bombs seemed to ease my allergy symptoms.  They did not melt as fast as I thought they would in the hot show.  I would use them on a limited basis because of the strength of the aroma.  I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product similar to Sudacare shower soothers. This wasnt it.  Its not a bad product, but it doesnt release enough scent while the shower is on just from the steam.  And if you place it directly under the water spray, it just makes a mess.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I hoped.</li>
            <li> I bought these because my husband and I both had congestion, and you can&#x27;t find them in the store anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size is fine, and the smell is wonderful.  However, once it goes in the shower, one bomb only lasted about five minutes.</li>
            <li> 4 little bombs for $9 is not a good value.  I will not purchase again</li>
            <li> Part of gift, can&#x27;t wait to hear how much they like it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. He is not one to take a bath but has a fairly busy, stressful life and I LOVE to take baths using my Menthol/Eucalyptus/Camphor products so I figured a shower bomb would be perfect to help him relax some. He recently became sick so he finally used one. He said at first the scent was fairly strong and did help but just a few minutes into the shower, the bomb quickly dissolved. He wished it lasted a little longer. But the few minutes it worked, it did help clear his sinuses.</li>
            <li> Nice item, but expensive and not very long lasting. Would try other brands.</li>
            <li> The tablet dissolved in about 3 minutes time and had no &amp;#34;aromatherapy&amp;#34; what so ever.</li>
            <li> These smell fabulous. I only used one so far. It lasted in the shower for about 5 minutes and it was gone. If the second one last longer when I move it further away from the water stream, I will update with a better review.</li>
            <li> These are amazing. When you don&#x27;t have time for a bath but want to treat yourself a bit, these are perfect. The bonus is that they also work well for clearing blocked sinuses. The effect actually lasted a couple hours. Almost as good as a neti pot!</li>
            <li> These shower bombs have a very pleasant, healing scent, great for when you have a little nasal congestion. I really love the wonderful Eucalyptus scent. However, they do take about 5 minutes to start working and they last a while so, not great for a quick shower. You&#x27;ll probably be able to use it on a second shower.</li>
            <li> Too pricey for too little product.</li>
            <li> The product is ok, but is not as effective as I had hoped. i wanted a natural alternative to the tablets they sell at the drugstore, but I don&#x27;t know that these worked well enough for me to re-order.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how anyone could claim that these last for a full shower, unless they learned to shower in the Army or something.  I got them when I had a horrible sinus infection and was hoping the menthol would help clear my head.  Psychologically, the scent was a little comforting, but as noted, it lasted for a very short time and didn&#x27;t seem to actually help any more than steam alone.  Definitely way over-priced.</li>
