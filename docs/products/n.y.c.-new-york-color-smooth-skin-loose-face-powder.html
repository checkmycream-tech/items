            <li>The NYC Smooth Skin Loose Face Powder 741A is the perfect powder!  </li>
            <li>but my powder brush works just fine.</li>
            <li>but I just brush it off with my hands, and there everything was fine</li>
            <li>And its soo light weight on your face, and again does not look ashy</li>
            <li>I use it to seal my foundation into place and as a high lighter, I love it!</li>
            <li>It helps my makeup stay put throughout the day and feels super smooth.</li>
            <li>I love this powder so much</li>
            <li>Decent- didn&#x27;t keep me matte as long as I wanted but very nice and smooth while it lasts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair, and most other powders have that slightly yellow tint that looks cakey up close.  </li>
            <li>Shipped fast!!</li>
            <li>Anyway its amazing, especially for my darker skin.</li>
            <li>Does not look powdery, just natural and healthy.</li>
            <li>My skin usually becomes very oily once my makeup is applied, but this powder certainly handles even the oiliest of skins and sets the makeup beautifully!</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I got translucent and there&#x27;s honestly SOOO much product especially considering the price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for some time just haven&#x27;t been able to locate it locally</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>It sets my makeup and eliminates shine well, is very inexpensive, and unlike SO MANY other powders is genuinely translucent.  </li>
            <li>AMAZING, and yes at first it does leave a little bit of a &amp;#34;white cast&amp;#34; on the face, however if applied sparingly it goes away after a while.</li>
            <li>but I believe with most loose powders</li>
            <li>I dont really like the sponge that comes with it</li>
            <li>Gotta love it when the least expensive option works the best!</li>
            <li>I have no idea why my local stores stopped selling this, but luckily I can find it here.  </li>
            <li>It feels very light and doesn&#x27;t create a pale cast on my face.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need alot to get that soft blurred look and it blends very well.</li>
            <li>It gets Hides the oils and makes your face look clear</li>
            <li>Does not irritate my sensitive skin and wears all day.</li>
            <li>Came early I&#x27;m e cited to use it ☺️</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and has very little or no fragrance.</li>

It came in good condition and yess it is messy but if you actually take the time to carefully use it you wont make that big of a mess. And its soo light weight on your face, and again does not look ashy it got on my clothes and sheet but I just brush it off with my hands, and there everything was fine so im not an expert but I believe with most loose powders u might get a little mess. Just use with caution people dont bad mouth the product because your not careful. Anyway its amazing, especially for my darker skin.</li>
            <li> I use it to seal my foundation into place and as a high lighter, I love it! It works with dramatic make up looks and more natural looks. Goes on flawlessly. And my makeup looks fabulous all day! Delivery was fast and the price was great! I will be ordering more soon!!!</li>

I&#x27;m very fair, and most other powders have that slightly yellow tint that looks cakey up close.  This one blends perfectly.  I have no idea why my local stores stopped selling this, but luckily I can find it here.  Gotta love it when the least expensive option works the best!</li>
