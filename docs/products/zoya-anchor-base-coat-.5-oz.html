            <li>/&gt;Natural is best.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>Works well; dries quickly Am impressed with all Zoya products.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with Zoya products!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this item yet, but I know this is going to be great.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the purchase &amp; the seller.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great selection of colors and nail aids.  </li>
            <li>I read that Zoya was one of the best products to use that was free of toxins.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased that this will meet the requirements that Dr. Oz recommends.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Better than OPI but without all the chemicals!</li>
            <li>Zoya is amazing and without all of the chemicals.</li>
            <li>Great product, good price, and decent shipping.  </li>
            <li>chemicals than most polishes.</li>
            <li>I find most zoya colors wear off at the tip of my nails but not chip.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Easy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less</li>
            <li>Easy flow , goes on well.  </li>
            <li>and it dries quickly!</li>
            <li>That helps the polish to stay on longer and is virtually chip free.</li>
            <li>I used another brand of toxic free nail color on my toes and have had no chips in two weeks.</li>
            <li>Yes, cosmetics are ungodly expensive--no matter which kind you buy--but the cheaper ones are also toxic and that will run you a lot more in the long run than paying just a bit more for something kinder to your body.  </li>
            <li>Excellent coat polish for who has allergy with ordinary nail polish.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really seem to keep my nail polish on any longer or better than when I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly and adheres well.  </li>
            <li>The seller shipped this item quickly.</li>
            <li>Also, this stuff really lasts!  </li>
            <li>Anchor dries incredibly quickly and so far, has done an excellent job at keeping my polish (both Zoya and other brands that are not 5 free formulas) on my nails.  </li>
            <li>Went on smoothly and gave a lasting glow to the nail bed.</li>
            <li>The polish stays on my toes a long time without chipping and is easy to remove when the time comes.  </li>
            <li>so I think I&#x27;m going to give it another try to see if I&#x27;d like it a little better.</li>
            <li>I live by this stuff.</li>
            <li>As someone who paints their nails twice a week, I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I ordered it because I have developed a allergy reaction with ordinary nail polish that I have had use for many years.</li>
            <li>Always paint clear before the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It bonds color so it doesn&#x27;t chip early on.</li>
            <li>This is not heavy at all.  </li>
            <li>But it does dry fast and your color does go on smoother.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I thought that since Zoya was toxic free it wouldn&#x27;t have any smell.</li>

            <li> , I am hard on my nails, but these products really stand up to my constant dishwashing, sewing, and crafting forays.  </li>
            <li> When they say it&#x27;s professional quality, they mean it apparently!</li>
            <li> Helps to make polish long wearing with minimal chipping or wear down;.</li>
            <li> I use the top and base coat with the polish and it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> Makes my nails peel just like every other polish out there</li>
            <li> My manicures typically last 5-7 days and don&#x27;t usually chip but will have fading/wear at the edges.</li>
            <li> Better then any other base coat I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve applied this base coat once since it arrived and am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Love this base.</li>
            <li> I use the top and base coats, along with my polish which lasts about 7-10 days.</li>
            <li> I use the Anchor Base Coat with two coats of my Zoya nail polish but do not use a top coat.  </li>
            <li> I believe in base coats before applying the color to give it gloss, shine and a smooth look!</li>
            <li> Love the base coat.</li>
            <li> I like this just as much as Essie Sticky Base.</li>
            <li> not too thick or thing.</li>
            <li> My finger nail polish lasted a week, and I&#x27;m hard on my nails!</li>
            <li> My finger nail polish never wants to stay but with the zoya base and topcoat</li>
            <li> it stays put for at the very least one week!</li>
            <li> Difficult to find in stores.</li>
            <li> This base coat is sticky and adheres to the polish like no other base coat does.</li>
            <li> This base didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> so I will probably use this base for those polishes.</li>

            <li> Great product, good price, and decent shipping.  Yes, cosmetics are ungodly expensive--no matter which kind you buy--but the cheaper ones are also toxic and that will run you a lot more in the long run than paying just a bit more for something kinder to your body.  Also, this stuff really lasts!  I don&#x27;t spend my days floating around in clouds of taffeta, I am hard on my nails, but these products really stand up to my constant dishwashing, sewing, and crafting forays.  When they say it&#x27;s professional quality, they mean it apparently!</li>
            <li> This base coat is sticky and adheres to the polish like no other base coat does. That helps the polish to stay on longer and is virtually chip free.</li>
            <li> Makes my nails peel just like every other polish out there EXCEPT the ones with formaldehyde...which i do not want to use.</li>
            <li> my wife has used it before&lt;br /&gt;She continues to use it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really seem to keep my nail polish on any longer or better than when I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I read that Zoya was one of the best products to use that was free of toxins. I&#x27;ve applied this base coat once since it arrived and am pleased with the results. I used another brand of toxic free nail color on my toes and have had no chips in two weeks. My only complaint is that I thought that since Zoya was toxic free it wouldn&#x27;t have any smell. It smelled like regular nail polish to me. I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Love this base. Dries quickly and adheres well.  Difficult to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Went on smoothly and gave a lasting glow to the nail bed.</li>
            <li> This base didn&#x27;t work for me however I only use it once so I think I&#x27;m going to give it another try to see if I&#x27;d like it a little better.</li>
            <li> Zoya is amazing and without all of the chemicals. I use the top and base coats, along with my polish which lasts about 7-10 days. Love it!</li>
            <li> I like this just as much as Essie Sticky Base. I could not tell the difference in wear. My manicures typically last 5-7 days and don&#x27;t usually chip but will have fading/wear at the edges. I work with my hands a lot and wash my hands a lot but I try not to use my nails for tools. I would purchase again. Easy to apply. I have several zoya polishes so I will probably use this base for those polishes. No complaints. Would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Excellent coat polish for who has allergy with ordinary nail polish. I ordered it because I have developed a allergy reaction with ordinary nail polish that I have had use for many years.</li>
            <li> I use the Anchor Base Coat with two coats of my Zoya nail polish but do not use a top coat.  The polish stays on my toes a long time without chipping and is easy to remove when the time comes.  Very pleased with Zoya products!</li>
            <li> Helps to make polish long wearing with minimal chipping or wear down;. My finger nail polish lasted a week, and I&#x27;m hard on my nails!</li>
            <li> I believe in base coats before applying the color to give it gloss, shine and a smooth look! This definitely does that and it dries quickly! I love it!</li>
            <li> GREAT!!! I will use this seller again.</li>
            <li> Zola brand is great! I use the top and base coat with the polish and it lasts for a long time. Better than OPI but without all the chemicals!</li>
            <li> Anchor dries incredibly quickly and so far, has done an excellent job at keeping my polish (both Zoya and other brands that are not 5 free formulas) on my nails.  It&#x27;s also prevented even the vampiest and darkest of polish from staining my nails.  No complaints on this one!</li>
            <li> Always paint clear before the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natural is best.  Peels off sometimes.  Easy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less chemicals than most polishes.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this item yet, but I know this is going to be great. I am very pleased that this will meet the requirements that Dr. Oz recommends. The seller shipped this item quickly. I am happy with the purchase &amp; the seller.</li>
            <li> I live by this stuff. It bonds color so it doesn&#x27;t chip early on. It&#x27;s great! As someone who paints their nails twice a week, I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Great product. Better then any other base coat I have tried. Will always buy this brand.</li>
            <li> Works well; dries quickly Am impressed with all Zoya products.  Great selection of colors and nail aids.  Will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> This is not heavy at all.  Easy flow , goes on well.  I&#x27;ve had no problems removing it either.  doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of residue at the cuticle.  I wear polish all the time and this one is a keeper.</li>
            <li> Love the base coat. not too thick or thing. keeps my polish in place! My finger nail polish never wants to stay but with the zoya base and topcoat it stays put for at the very least one week!</li>
            <li> I have worn it by it&#x27;s self and it doesn&#x27;t wear well. It does chip and I bet it made my color chip when I wore it under a color.  I find most zoya colors wear off at the tip of my nails but not chip.  But it does dry fast and your color does go on smoother.</li>
