            <li>Great customer service and lots of good instruction from the seller.</li>
            <li>Using the Baiden Mitten was the most incredible experience!  </li>
            <li>I cannot belive how effective it was!  </li>
            <li>The price reflects the excellent quality and the helpful emails from the company are outstanding.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving a 5 star mostly for customer service, which is exquisite.</li>
            <li>Plus the most excellent customer service I have ever encountered with any product I have ever bought!</li>
            <li>this product is the most effective at smoothing out the texture of those lines working best on my newer/thinner hip stretchmarks.</li>
            <li>, this is the best and most effective exfoliating mitt I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing investment and works great.</li>
            <li>At night, my creams are more effective and by day my makeup is flawless.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t hurt at all, though my skin felt puckered and turned bright</li>
            <li>This product got some good reviews</li>
            <li>(but it was a good thing!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t mind having a good reason to sweat.</li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s important to point out that I don&#x27;t at all dispute the excellent exfoliating abilities of the Baiden mitten.  </li>
            <li>Great customer service and a nice product.</li>
            <li>I also recommended it to my sister who bought one about a week ago and has used it once and absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>and I loved it (already started telling my friends about it).</li>
            <li>I then soak in a bath with just water for a good 10 minutes</li>
            <li>I will use this item for the rest of my life, it&#x27;s THAT good.  </li>
            <li>While I thought my skin was in good condition for a 63 yr.</li>
            <li>It is supposed to be good for up to two years use.  </li>
            <li>It works find but not as good as advertised.</li>
            <li>while it worked good on my body, I have to say that I would be PETRIFIED to use it on my face EVER again.</li>
            <li>So good.</li>
            <li>Loved my esthetician, but haven&#x27;t seen her in quite a loooong time.  </li>
            <li>and they both too loved it.</li>
            <li>Ive had mine for 8 months and its still looking good</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s incredibly invigorating and refreshing afterwards.  </li>
            <li>But I read all of the good reviews and thought I&#x27;d take a chance....</li>
            <li>Really surprising.</li>
            <li>These are effective, non-toxic tools to use to get great results.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely loved it, I used it for 2 years and had to buy a replacement.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does take a bit to figure out but as someone with fair skin, I use this once week and my skin has never looked better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let me also add that their customer service and friendly e-mails/instructions are excellent.</li>
            <li>Its amazing tool for your skin care, really amazing!</li>
            <li>Amazing customer service and mitten works amazing also!</li>
            <li>The seller is amazing and sent me a detailed email describing how to best use the mitten and those are the instructions that I followed.</li>
            <li>I originally bought my Baiden mitten after reading an excellent and popular review for a self-tanning product, in which the author said she used the Baiden to slough before doing her tanning.  </li>
            <li>What is extraordinary in my mind and to my way of thinking, the customer service is beyond compare!!!  </li>
            <li>While I love my children, I don&#x27;t wear my stretch marks proudly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and very satisfied.</li>
            <li>However for tanners great because you&#x27;ll get the most out of your tanning dollars.</li>
            <li>But, I am glad I did, it&#x27;s a great product and does what it says.</li>
            <li>They want to make sure you are happy with your purchase.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions (very important to do so, or you won&#x27;t get the killer results)!</li>
            <li>Excellent product, although it seems a bit overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions provided and got great results so far.</li>
            <li>I dipped the Baiden mitten in hot water and wrung it out the best I could. .</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anybody, no matter what problems you have with your skin or what results you want, you&#x27;ll be pretty happy with this mitten!!</li>
            <li>The company is interactive and gives you many helpful tips in order to maximize the efficiency of the product!</li>
            <li>You will be glad you did!   </li>
            <li>Furthermore, the Baiden Mitten exfoliated my skin so well that I had the most even airbrush tan ever!</li>
            <li>I love the product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;With all those disclaimers in there, I have to say the RESULTS are OUTSTANDING!</li>
            <li>Love this!  </li>
            <li>(yes it&#x27;s safe!)</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s pretty awesome!</li>
            <li>but I absolutely LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>I love the Baiden Mitten!</li>
            <li>Love the Baiden Mitten!</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten great results after a hot 10 minute shower rather than a soak in the bath, but one day when I have access to a nice tub, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be incredible.</li>

            <li>The results are amazing..</li>

            <li>but I am amazed how nice my skin feels.  </li>
            <li>Process:&lt;br /&gt;[I should note that both soaking in the bathtub and shower are just as effective a prep for the mitten</li>
            <li>nice to buy something that does what it claims.</li>
            <li>It is highly effective to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All opinions stated here are 100% honest and my exclusive opinion*******used.  </li>
            <li>All opinions stated here are 100% honest and</li>
            <li>It is perfect for getting ready for using self tanning.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m on the journey now and thrilled.</li>
            <li>Kind of tricky to keep it on.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product for the face and whole body.</li>
            <li>I wish that I could afford to buy them and give them out as gifts because I really do think that it is a wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>My skin is clearing up nicely too since I&#x27;ve been exfoliating with it</li>
            <li>and I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>After I explained my issue, I honestly didn&#x27;t expect to get any response.</li>
            <li>You will be thrilled with your results as I was.</li>
            <li>and so it takes a while to figure out what works best for you, how much pressure, how often to use it, etc.  </li>
            <li>After years of loofah-ing I can honestly say that I was just wasting my time.</li>
            <li>Their incredible customer service and quality promise is something so rare these days.</li>
            <li>Honestly this thing could replace a myriad of skin care products.</li>
            <li>I liked the mitten</li>
            <li>And my bank account is loving it, too.  </li>
            <li>Save your $49 dollars and go have a nice spa experience.</li>
            <li>Opinion is entirely my own.</li>
            <li>My wife swears by how effective the mitten works</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m not a bath taking kind of girl anyhow).</li>
            <li>so honestly it was probably closer to 30...)</li>
            <li>Love love love this!!</li>
            <li>they truly want you to love this product and are excited for you to get the incredible results that you will get after using this product....</li>
            <li>I have been a sun worshiper most of my life, and this is helping smooth my skin and make it beautiful.</li>
            <li>This thing is awesome and has greatly improved my dry, Denver-Winter, itchy skin.</li>
            <li>This mitt is incredible and work exactly like the the website said.</li>
            <li>I am a researcher when it comes to skin...always trying to find what&#x27;s new and best.</li>
            <li>i couldn&#x27;t stop touching my smooth skin the rest of the night, lol.</li>
            <li>WOW was I amazed at how great it worked and how great my skin felt after.</li>
            <li>The Baiden Mitten is an awesome tool for anyone who wants better looking skin.</li>
            <li>Excellent customer service and very soft skin.</li>
            <li>It was obviously VERY easy for me to over-do it...</li>
            <li>&quot; it has by far been the best investment to treat the appearance of the stretchmarks on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main</li>
            <li>this mitten is an most amazing product.  </li>
            <li>It is by far the best skin product I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>My skin felt very moist afterwards(no need for lotion, even though I used coconut oil), it was an incredible feeling.</li>
            <li>I am honestly convinced this glove is magical.</li>
            <li>I think it important to point out that this actually isn&#x27;t a good idea to use on your face.</li>
            <li>This is by far one of the best exfoliators on the market.</li>
            <li>Just like everyone else has said, when that top layer starts rolling off you&#x27;re kind of grossed out, but fascinated by how well it&#x27;s working.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wonderful soft skin awaits you</li>
            <li>I always thought I had pretty good skin (not a sun person since I am so fair)</li>
            <li>It provided a very smooth surface for a flawless tan and my skin felt rejuvenating and soft!  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love my mitten!</li>
            <li>received this product complimentary in exchange for an honest, and fair review.</li>
            <li>My feet are always the hardest to get entirely clean which takes forEVER to get good results with just a wash cloth and</li>
            <li>Over the years I have used many products to exfoliate, this is by far the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This worked perfectly and my skin feels as though I used a moisturizing soap or lotion, but it&#x27;s my bare skin!</li>
            <li>that I can FINALLY say that I am the proud owner of my very own Baiden Mitten</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and thought this was too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>This mit is truly effective and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The seller is also very attentive and sends you emails advising the user on proper ways to use and get best results with the baiden mitt.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because the mitten has given me dramatically softer, shiner, firmer, more beautiful skin, and more shallow wrinkles, I would say the Baiden mitten is a must-buy for every woman (and man that cares about their skin looking awesome!!!).</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect by this product.  </li>
            <li>I also noticed that when I used lighter pressure that there was more pilling.  </li>
            <li>If I should see more impressive results in the future, I will edit my review.</li>
            <li>this is not)should not be priced more than twenty bucks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with fantastic instructions, so read them and dont be a ding dong!</li>
            <li>However after multiple uses I can definitively say this is THE BEST exfoliator mitt on the market and</li>
            <li>I have suffered from a skin condition called keratosis pilaris for many years now</li>
            <li>I love this mitten.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for anyone who tans regularly!</li>
            <li>I may give it one more week.</li>
            <li>Note: If you do not body brush, you may have better results.</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels after I use it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>After reading such wonderful reviews I couldn&#x27;t resist.</li>
            <li>My  skin felt do smooth and soft after, it was wonderful.</li>
            <li>I tried a fourth time and used some tips and advice that the seller gave me and the results were great!</li>
            <li>The skin tone is way more even</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is definitely the best skin polisher that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I used the Baiden Mitten once and my spray Tan looks better than it ever has.</li>
            <li>so you&#x27;d expect a lot more.</li>

            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the tan is fabulous, too!</li>
            <li>In addition to the product there was a link for an ebook with more information and testimonials.  </li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I also use coconut oil and shea butter to moisturize and it penetrates better now.</li>

            <li>Absolutely love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The baiden mitten is so, so, so much better.</li>
            <li>This seller gives great tips on how to use it and she really cares if it works for you.</li>
            <li>Many will find this level unsuitable for any part of their body.&lt;br /&gt;b)</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to see skin &amp;#34;peel off&amp;#34; as advertised, but it does leave my skin nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>love having this anti aging weapon in my arsenal:)</li>
            <li>My wash cloth removes more than this.</li>
            <li>I stay in the bath for, the better it works.</li>
            <li>Works great fast shipping</li>
            <li>Better than any body scrub.</li>
            <li>I was glad to see the results in front of me.</li>
            <li>I was as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!...</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>Be sure to strictly adhere to the instructions until you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>And to me $50 is nothing for silky sexy skin.</li>
            <li>I just use more body lotion to fight the dryness.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of beauty products, and this one is in my top five all time favorites.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>and then his skin nourisher, and that way the moisturizer can absorb the skin better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So as much as I&#x27;d love to keep recommending it...</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s for sure, and</li>
            <li>and I immediately purchased it after reading most of the reviews.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to use lotion for several days and it allows perfect self tanner application.  </li>
            <li>i bought this having read the excellent reviews and obviously missing the not so good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure you follow instructions for optimal results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I took the chance</li>
            <li>- I am now in love with this thing and tell everyone about it.  </li>
            <li>this isn&#x27;t advertised more...</li>
            <li>I positively love my Baiden Mitten.</li>
            <li>most seemed to be written by distributors</li>
            <li>&#x27;s some tips on how to use it and achieve all of those gross skin rolls (that are so wonderful to see go!)&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s beyond phenomenal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, I like the Baiden Mitten better.</li>
            <li>and I am so pleased and think to myself,</li>
            <li>I love my Clarisonic which I have used for 7 years since my daughter was born.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the way the company makes sure you know how to use and take care of your mitt.  </li>
            <li>The more you use it the more it works</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really pleased with the results I&#x27;m having.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Then they followed up to make sure that I got it.</li>
            <li>It should be priced a lot better than that.</li>
            <li>I just wish they can include better instructions to help with specifically strechmarks.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>i ordered 2 more to give as gifts.  </li>
            <li>I was so impressed with how smooth and soft my skin was after using the Baiden Mitten.</li>
            <li>And after using it for a longer period of time I even noticed more results.</li>
            <li>and I am in love with this product.  </li>
            <li>So many things I&#x27;ve bought, ordered and tried, to no avail.</li>
            <li>Love this product and seller follow up</li>
            <li>I got just okay</li>
            <li>Victoria Winnard is the perfect example of what a person SHOULD do to promote their business and how a person should present themselves to let you know that they believe in their product.  </li>
            <li>One of those products that you discover online, use it, and it becomes something on the \\&quot;Favorite</li>
            <li>One of these days, I am going to create holiday gift baskets for my friends with all my favorite things and this will be in it.  </li>
            <li>(the coconut oil would be in the C&#x27;s Favorite Things Basket too -</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need Oprah money for these products, but they are still fabulous!)</li>
            <li>LOVE this thing.</li>
            <li>I am sure the more I use it, I will see better results on my arms.</li>
            <li>I can get the skin to roll off my face, but that may be because I exfoliate my face a lot more than my body.  </li>
            <li>Skin is visibly fresher and more youthful looking.</li>
            <li>but it has helped maintain a lovely smoothness.</li>
            <li>Because of the Baiden mitten, I&#x27;m more confident not wearing nylons</li>
            <li>I really think this is a great product</li>
            <li>I think more people would buy it if it were cheaper.  </li>
            <li>BUT.......I wish the manufacturers would drop the price so more people could buy it.</li>
            <li>I think I will like like it more as time goes on.</li>
            <li>I get that healthy glow all day.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I purchased this mitten about three weeks ago and have been more than pleased with what it has done for my skin.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>I really do love this product</li>
            <li>This mitten is fantastic!</li>
            <li>more frequently.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
            <li>I love that you can roll it up and throw it in your gym bag, unlike electrical defoliators.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>would recommend it. :)</li>
            <li>I would love if they made a face mitt-</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt better.  </li>
            <li>I love it on my face</li>
            <li>the baiden mitten is more of a cloth feeling material--made from bamboo fibers.</li>
            <li>i love to use it on my face--</li>
            <li>feels so smooth after using!</li>
            <li>skin and transforming it to smooth, nice looking skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I assume the more you use it, the better your skin feels.  </li>
            <li>enjoyed the relaxation of the procedure.</li>
            <li>and I love</li>
            <li>And, my skin feels so-o-o-o smooth!  </li>
            <li>A fantastic product!</li>
            <li>and then I followed up with my favorite moisturizer.</li>

            <li>great product it works great on my skin gets of all the dead skin and leaves you feeling smooth</li>
            <li>I completely freaked out when I was able to roll off my own skin with the mitt!</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I emailed the seller and she sent me more detailed instructions.  </li>
            <li>The best $50 I&#x27;ve ever spent on a beauty product.</li>
            <li>Okay - i sound like everyone else</li>
            <li>This is the best $50 I have EVER spent on a product!!!&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li>Skin is buttery soft and you feel great after using it.  </li>
            <li>Also is great for getting any old tan residue off.</li>
            <li>I started spray tanning and was looking for a way to get rid of blotchiness and really get a good exfoliation.</li>
            <li>This product is awesome, took my dry cracked heals to a smooth surface.....</li>
            <li>Loved the treatments, loved the dermabrasion, but noticed a couple days after dermabrasion, my skin became really dry and peely.  </li>
            <li>I spend lots of hours outdoors and my skin needed that fantastic help to rejuvenate in easy and effective way , and I was lucky to try this mitten and its works</li>
            <li>I love the Baiden mitten not only because it make my skin feel good but gives my whole body a great massage, which increases circulation.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this and was so excited to get the results everyone seems to be raving about</li>
            <li>All of the reviews you read on it - true!  </li>
            <li>Not painful at all!</li>
            <li>After using this mitt, I know that isn&#x27;t true!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the Baiden Mitten!</li>
            <li>you feel so clean and really able to breathe after using it.</li>
            <li>but this does the trick and is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Firstly, Korean Italy cloths are fairly easy to find, and are monumentally cheaper than the Baiden--you can buy them in any Korean market, on eBay, or even here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m VERY impressed and the baiden mitten is 100% worth the money.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, and easy to keep clean!&lt;br</li>
            <li>use this all over my body &amp; have used it gently on my face &amp; even my lips with great success.  </li>
            <li>Her pores are shrinking tremendously and her complexion is starting to look flawless, excepting the light scars from her breakouts that are still healing.</li>
            <li>I gave this item a 4 star, which could easily turn into a 5.</li>
            <li>Easy to use,  easy to care for..worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I saved myself a ton of cash, and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I was pretty impressed, my skin was SUPER SOFT and silky and it was very refreshing.</li>
            <li>First off, this seller is amazing.</li>
            <li>Though her acne did flare up a bit after the first use, since then, her skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li>The amount of skin that had fallen into the tub by then end of my first exfoliation session was absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li>I use a Clarisonic faithfully every day, so I already have pretty nice complexion.</li>
            <li>and i am completely amazed at the astounding results!</li>
            <li>I will admit that the price kind of deterred me at first</li>
            <li>With the first use my skin is smooth, glowing and drinking in the lotion that used to just sit on top!</li>
            <li>I was completely surprised and thrilled!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every imaginable form of exfoliation, and this is hands down, the BEST.</li>
            <li>otherwise the directions state to soak in a very warm tub, or stay in the shower with the water very warm for at least 15 mins).</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and smooth, my husband and I are both loving the results!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine....</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Best to purchase two, one for you and one for your significant other.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much from it, it just seemed too good to be true.</li>
            <li>When it arrived (quickly!)</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!! :O)</li>
            <li>If it really &amp;#34;detoxifies&amp;#34; your body that would be the cherry on top!  </li>
            <li>I thought it sounded perfect for me since I Mystic Tan weekly and am always looking for a way to exfoliate the old and prep the new.</li>
            <li>My skin is bright, smooth, soft...very soft!  </li>
            <li>My skin has never looked so good nor felt so smooth and soft!</li>
            <li>My skin was better after the first use!</li>
            <li>This product works wonderfully on my legs and arms, but I seem to struggle using it on my sides or breasts which are a little softer</li>
            <li>and you will see the benefits after the very first use!  </li>
            <li>From what I&#x27;ve seen and felt, I really have no doubt whatsoever that the Baiden is a high quality product that does what it says, beautifully.  </li>
            <li>At 63 it is so nice to have something that really adds to making me feel fabulous.</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing mitt, my skin feels like a young girls again.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say that this is nothing short of amazing.  </li>
            <li>it was smooth and glowing and felt great and stayed that way for several days.</li>
            <li>and I can see a huge improvement.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve suffered from keratosis pilaris on my arms for years and found this to be a HUGE help..  </li>
            <li>Despite not having the skin roll off, I did see and feel a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I know that exfoliating is important</li>
            <li>My skin did feel smooth when I was done...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using a light weight aloe lotion after I use it and didn&#x27;t experience any redness or any skin irritation.  </li>
            <li>If you do it too light nothing will happen.</li>
            <li>and it keeps them smooth.</li>
            <li>skin feels really smooth.</li>

            <li>Not only is the product great, but the customer service is as well.  </li>
            <li>You would think being a 49 year-old woman that I would know how important exfoliation was.  </li>

            <li>Take the time to read and follow them and I am sure you will love this product as much as I do.  </li>
            <li>I cant even remember it worked so good that even my husband (who knew nothing of my mitten) commented on how soft my skin felt..</li>
            <li>My skin has never been this soft, never looked this good....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far superior to any of the exfoliating sponges you buy in the supermarkets</li>
            <li>For myself, I&#x27;m wondering if I might need the regular versus Lite, but was still incredibly impressed by how much &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; came out of my pores on my cheeks and nose.</li>
            <li>Definitely provides a good polish&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t doubt the reviews I read, but I wasn&#x27;t sure how easy it would be and the results on the first use.  </li>
            <li>I love exfoliation..used it right away..</li>
            <li>My skin felt so smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>I soaked in the tub and used long strokes using a good amount of pressure but didn&#x27;t get any better results than I would with a sugar scrub.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to read the detailed instructions, when followed it works exactly the way you want</li>
            <li>I do like this, it does a good job of shedding the skin, not an unbelievable job, but a good one.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend buying one of your own.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product was right for me, I have psoriasis (not really bad but</li>
            <li>put lotion on immediately after rinsing off my skin with cool water and my skin has stayed smooth and silky for five days so</li>
            <li>I generally take good care of myself..</li>
            <li>well worth the money!</li>
            <li>Still I was excited to try it.  </li>
            <li>Oh make sure to rinse it in hot water before each use.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>Followed exact directions and was pleased with results.  </li>
            <li>but it DEFINITELY is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>The bath worked better for me on this than a hot shower.</li>
            <li>Had it shipped to my house because she was so excited to try it.</li>
            <li>this is ten times better than any of those and the more I use it the better the results.</li>
            <li>It is well worth it!</li>
            <li>Yes, it did take a while, but man was it worth it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the patience and the $50!</li>
            <li>The original names are &amp;#34;Turkish exfoliating gloves&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Korean cloths&amp;#34; which have been around for centuries...</li>
            <li>It was worth every penny!</li>
            <li>But I do love to look forward to using it after a steamy hot, relaxing bath.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!  </li>
            <li>Totally worth it!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Just after the first use I feel more relaxed and cleaner.</li>
            <li>well worth the money!</li>
            <li>This is a unique product-</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used it and when I saw the skin peeling it was a bit overwhelming.....</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>Worth the investment!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li>I had to clean out the tub</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll feel really clean.</li>
            <li>, I can honestly say that I am a total Baiden convert and won&#x27;t hesitate to gift this to friends in search of a better way to exfoliate.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too abrasive which I like and has helped the dry skin on my legs greatly.</li>
            <li>Fantastic, i love it so much</li>
            <li>As with many reviewers I experienced the dead skin rolls but the real bonus was how nice and fresh my skin felt afterwards.</li>
            <li>I realize why there are so many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I trusted the positive reviews on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the mitt one time so far and I&#x27;mvery pleased!</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel ridiculously soft, and It&#x27;s fascinating watching the skin roll right off of you.</li>
            <li>I suppose that one side effect of all the exfoliation is if you want to keep all that newly discovered skin fresh and healthy you had better break out the sunscreen, Chapstick and Lubriderm ....</li>
            <li>My skin feels amazing, and if this weather ever warms up enough for me to bare any amount of skin, I&#x27;m sure it will look better too :)</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a special technique to achieving results with this mitt.  </li>
            <li>i am throwing away my loofas, special wash clothes, exfoliating creams and a dermabrasion machine.  </li>
            <li>i paid 50 use for a piece of cloth - theres nothing special about it.</li>
            <li>have a lot of blackheads/ingrowns that cover large areas of my skin &amp; this clears most of them away.</li>
            <li>I am excited to use the mitten again in a couple days (the seller said to use it once a week) because apparently the more you use it the more radiant</li>
            <li>I rub till my skin is bright red and nothing.  </li>
            <li>but so far, this thing is amazing.  </li>
            <li>To be fair, I am basing this review on one use of the Baiden Mitten, after following directions.</li>
            <li>Really helped my pores and blackheads and my legs have never looked better.</li>
            <li>I had to put a fair amount of pressure before I saw results, maybe everyone is different</li>
            <li>but you get a full page of instructions on how to get it to work, and you need these instructions.</li>
            <li>This is true whether you are using a Baiden mitt or a Korean Italy</li>
            <li>This is true whether you are using a Baiden mitt or a Korean Italy</li>
            <li>ALL of the pictures on the internet are true to this product.</li>
            <li>Someone actually asked me if I had had a laser treatment on my face because my skin looked so good.</li>
            <li>Ok, it costs too much</li>
            <li>Then, they provided me with step by step instructions on how to use the mitt, what to expect, what not to expect, how to care for the mitt, and what I needed to do after using the mitt to ensure that I got the full benefits of the mitt.  </li>
            <li>They were so genuinely concerned with making sure I understood the science behind the mitt and getting the full benefits that this incredible mitt has to offer.....</li>
            <li>( REMEMBER not to rinse during the process, only after you&#x27;re done, otherwise it wouldn&#x27;t work as good)</li>
            <li>It exfoliates the body and face very well, better then any scrubs I tried</li>
            <li>and he has been loving how soft my skin is.</li>
            <li>Take good care of it and it should last a while.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so much smoother, softer and more even now -</li>
            <li>but I am getting good exfoliation, although not the miraculous entire body skin rolls like some people have reported.  </li>
            <li>Should have put more stock in the reviewers which basically said that it was highly overrated!  </li>
            <li>They were only fair...</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li>mitten is true to its claim for what it can do for the skin.</li>
            <li>but it looked so clean and felt super</li>
            <li>My skin is softer and more supple, and I really notice the difference in my face.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this mitten.</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant about purchasing this product due to the cost, but after reading so many glowing reviews I decided to splurge &amp; I am so happy I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first took a very warm shower for about 10 mins, then I did a steam ( I have access to a private steam,</li>
            <li>In the process, it doesn&#x27;t look nice when you have these rolls of dead skin on you, and have to keep scrubbing, but once you&#x27;re done, the skin feels heavenly smooth!!</li>
            <li>The first time it does work, but as promised, it indeed works more thoroughly over time~ in 2 yrs, I will certainly be buying another one!</li>
            <li>After using this mitten, I now know why my lotions never &#x27;worked&#x27; - I was rubbing lotion over dead skin and what good does that do!?</li>
            <li>I think my technique was good, but maybe I could work on it a little more.</li>
            <li>my new \\&quot;loofa\\&quot; is here to stay! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>My older/wider thigh stretchmarks have improved smoothnessa lot, but not as quickly as the hips.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A fantastic natural product that makes your skin lovely....</li>
            <li>I definitely will recommend this product, and communication with seller has been exceptional.</li>
            <li>mitten has revolutionized my understanding of my skin and how to maximize smooth and soft and healthy glowing</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I then take a quick shower to rinse off and wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;-After</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve only used it once, I need some more time with my Baiden Mitten before I write more about it.</li>
            <li>I personally had no problems and Ilove, love, love my mitten....</li>
            <li>It does an awesome job at removing dead skin and making the skin soo much smoother.</li>
            <li>A fantastic natural product that makes your skin lovely....</li>
            <li>I have had excellent results from using this product, I use it almost daily to do a quick energize and weekly or bi-weekly for a deep exfoliation.</li>
            <li>but the customer follow-up was super.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and smooth and has never felt better.</li>
            <li>Sunspots,scars and stretchmarks are quickly fading</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s way and periodically receive e-mails to make sure I&#x27;m still satified with the product, I&#x27;m able to ask questions and get a quick response back, and they give hints/tips on usage.  </li>
            <li>Quite impressed at how well such simple cloth can exfoliate.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>And I have the most even tan of my life...and its more of a healthy glow; not freckled orange mess.  </li>
            <li>I love this mitten and highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>Very glad I finally ordered!</li>
            <li>which is very much improved (almost gone!)</li>
            <li>Make the water as hot as you can tolerate comfortably.  </li>

            <li>These people selling the &amp;#34;baiden mitten&amp;#34; pretty much bought the cheap versions of it, have created their own personal embroidery on it and are selling them for more than triple the price..</li>
            <li>I take a very hot shower without soap or anything &amp; after 15 minutes</li>
            <li>own a magnifying mirror that magnify s 20 times and has a light to really help you feel self conscious.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it it did make my skin smooth but didn&#x27;t come off peeling like the pictures you see online.</li>
            <li>My skin has not looked or felt this good in so long</li>
            <li>My tips: don&#x27;t scrub all willy nilly; use a good amount of pressure and make long even strokes.</li>
            <li>( just wash it with a mild body wash, squeeze the water really good, and let it air dry)</li>
            <li>My skin has never been so smooth, soft and clean!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t honestly expect the mitten to do much to my skin other than prep it for a nice layer of tanner.  </li>
            <li>This is my new top gift.</li>
            <li>One of my New Years resolutions was to start taking better care of my skin, so I&#x27;m looking at this as an investment in my skin.</li>
            <li>This thing has to be dark magic, my skin looks and feels AMAZING</li>
            <li>The skin on my face now feel like &#x27;skin&#x27; and even the super tough places, i.e., feet, feel wonderful.</li>
            <li>I am not sorry!  </li>
            <li>I overall feel better!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>and when I saw the first rolls of dirt when I applied the mitten to my skin I was excited.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal!!</li>
            <li>So excited about this product, I might just toss most of my other exfoliants :)</li>
            <li>It does exactly what they say it does!</li>
            <li>If you want great results make sure no soap prior to using it and water is very hot so the dead skin will come off easy..</li>
            <li>So even though I soaked I believed i need to get squeaky clean first..</li>
            <li>After reading a million reviews and full feature articles about the Baiden Mitten on Refinery29, I finally got on top of purchasing one, and it is so worth the money!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s to last for two years or more, so I consider it a worthy investment!</li>
            <li>Yes it&#x27;s simple and simply amazing.</li>
            <li>I finally got to use my Baiden, it really is amazing.</li>
            <li>and it really makes my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>As someone who already exfoliates regularly and uses products containing glycolic acid the Baiden Mitten wasn&#x27;t as amazing as everyone made it out to be.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the detailed guide.</li>
            <li>really get in there like the Korean Cloths since its gentle.&lt;br /&gt;-Only available on Amazon and the official site.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to see those rolls of dead skin come off.</li>
            <li>Even one that might be rare or exceptional(which</li>
            <li>I can say, is worth every penny and more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thank it was well worth the money.</li>
            <li>This product is worth every penny..</li>
            <li>The more water I drink, the more lotion I use, the more coconut oil I use topically and internally, the dryer I get.  </li>
            <li>but I read review after review that it was worth the price.  </li>
            <li>It it Def worth the money...</li>
            <li>The mitten is a bit pricey, but well worth it.</li>
            <li>This is definately worth money.</li>
            <li>but well worth the effort.</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling smooth and feeling healthy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey for what it is, but I think it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>I have a scar on my stomach and it almost completely vanished. :)</li>
            <li>I know have soft smooth skin I am comfortable in.</li>
            <li>Given that you have to soak until you are pruned, it isn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Personally, I&#x27;ve never had rolls of skin stripping off my body when using it, like others have said, but nonetheless it&#x27;s a nice product?</li>
            <li>Top that off with how SOFT my skin was after each treatment</li>
            <li>I know it is pricey, but with all of the use you will get out of it, it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I use it weekly, and my skin looks and feels glowing, healthy and alive.</li>
            <li>Best purchase I have made in a long, long time.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Never had such a great exfoliation without a professional being involved.  </li>
            <li>I love how soft my skin feels after I use it.</li>
            <li>It is a well made product and worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>I go and get spray tans frequently in the summer and know matter how many exfoliants I purchased at the store</li>
            <li>am nearly 40 and love mine.  </li>
            <li>The mitten is worth the price.  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s worth it to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be discouraged by the price, it is worth ever dime.</li>
            <li>- so it is worth the price in that sense.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>and so far I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>I hope to purchase another soon worth every penny of the price.</li>
            <li>The Baiden Mitten is one of those tools every individual should have handy.</li>
            <li>small investment is worth it for a life of beautiful skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I HAD to let everyone know that this purchase is so worth it.</li>
            <li>100% worth the price</li>
            <li>I have been using it in the shower and had success on my sides- between the legs.</li>
            <li>Great for exfoliating, especially if you get spray tans frequently.</li>
            <li>Well worth the splurge.</li>
            <li>You do tend to get what you pay for, and in my opinion, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Well worth the $.</li>
            <li>I have tried the cheaper versions of this product and had some success but not to this extent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>) Step into warm shower and wash with [[ASIN:B00EV1D79A Hibiclens Antimicrobial Skin Liquid Soap, 32 Fluid Ounce]], then rinse completely to ensure a clean and oil free surface to work</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited when I first discovered the Baiden Mitten, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this will pay for itself many times over in the amount of other treatments/procedures</li>
            <li>I take a quick shower first to get rid of and oil and dirt on my body</li>
            <li>Using this mitt makes your skin soft and silky and very clean.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this mitten to anyone who wants smoother, prettier skin - it&#x27;s well worth the price!</li>
            <li>You have to prep and do it just right and do it a lot to get the ball rolling so to speak.</li>
            <li>Took a minute to get it right</li>
            <li>Turns out I was doing everything right.</li>
            <li>but maybe I just haven&#x27;t quite figured out the right amount of pressure to use or how moist to keep my skin before a treatment.  </li>
            <li>comes right off.</li>
            <li>I stood up and put the Mitten on my right hand.  </li>
            <li>I have only used it twice so far and have had amazing results!  </li>
            <li>consistently (I hang mine in my shower to dry---and the visual of it is a nice reminder each time</li>
            <li>highly recommend to everyone to have it for your fabulous results.</li>
            <li>Baby soft, clean skin!  </li>
            <li>Amazing how much dead skin it  easily removed.</li>
            <li>The bath salts have worked great for me in the past</li>
            <li>The skin on my entire body is a lot shinier and more healthy-looking, and feels more alive.</li>
            <li>I was amazed of all the dead skin that came off, but most importantly my skin feels so smooth and looks rosy and healthier.  </li>
            <li>By the time I realized what was happening, the hot water had ran out and my bath was only slightly warm, instead of hot, like they advise, and I by no means was sweating like the product suggests.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend this product to anyone who wants healthy, soft skin!</li>
            <li>dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, while I have seen amazing results with dry skin, I am more excited to see what results I will achieve long term in regards to scaring, stretch marks and cellulite with this mitt.  </li>
            <li>I understood the concept behind the product and if it did work as good as stated it would be justified on spending the money for some good, long term skin care.</li>
            <li>I used it the day I received it, right after a hot shower.</li>
            <li>the Baiden mitten took it right off after the first use.</li>
            <li>At first I&#x27;m sure I didn&#x27;t do it right because no dead skin was coming off much.</li>
            <li>I thought I wouldn&#x27;t have much, being young and having very tight skin,but I did and it was awesome!</li>
            <li>Bonus, my skin feels amazing and my dry skin is diminishing.</li>
            <li>Its okay so far, not peeling no where as much as i would like to be.</li>
            <li>If your nail person just starts scrubbing on your dry feet, some comes off, but they don&#x27;t look nice at all.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m thinking this would make a great Christmas present for female family members.</li>
            <li>With this product, the brand matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, make sure you soak in clean water for a while (don&#x27;t shampoo/condition/soap up, etc), step out of the water, and don&#x27;t towel dry before you start scrubbing.</li>
            <li>My skin has completely changed thanks to this magic mitten.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t because it&#x27;s irritated my skin so much that my nominally mild acne has worsened and the pores on portions of my body are getting clogged...</li>
            <li>/&gt;One thing that had vexed me was that I use an epilator to pull the hair out of my legs, but I could spend an hour and pull out every last hair and my legs would still not be smooth, so I&#x27;d have to follow up with shaving if I wanted a truly smooth leg.  </li>
            <li>The but put by 3M was just as good and much less.</li>
            <li>The key for the product to work effectively is very moist, warm skin.</li>
            <li>The top layer of dead cells is swept off as you rub and your skin breaths better</li>
            <li>Tons of gray rolled up skin fell from my body even though I had showered earlier that day, so it was great to see that all of that gross stuff was leaving my body.</li>
            <li>only problem I had was it wasn&#x27;t as easy as I expected and took me several times to understand the best way to use it is when you&#x27;re hot and sweaty..</li>
            <li>It still doesn&#x27;t look like much, but it certainly was well worth it!  </li>
            <li>I expected better results with no streaks after using this thing, but no!</li>
            <li>My skin is really smooth and soft!  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;The Baiden Mitten, a ‘Course Woven Cloth’, that left their skin “as Smooth as the Finest Silk”, was developed for the most powerful Ladies of Sultan Osman’s Harem.&amp;#34;  </li>

            <li>Following the helpful directions makes it so easy to use, my skin is silky smooth and feels especially soft.</li>
            <li>I was overwhelmed with the amount of dead grimy skin that came off what I thought was my clean body!!!  </li>
            <li>I was a little nervous because of the high price, but it really is a great product.</li>
            <li>It molded pretty quickly and I made sure to always hang dry.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying my Baiden Mitten very much and feel, finally, there is hope for my skin!</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend the product and this seller -- they&#x27;ve sent helpful tips on how to use the mitten and really want to make it a fabulous experience.</li>
            <li>just love knowing that my skin is all fresh and smooth with all dead layers removed.</li>
            <li>This worked the first time I used it and my skin just glowed.  </li>
            <li>When you first buy it you receive a lengthy email with the history and directions, it does take some prep.</li>
            <li>After the first use, the dryness seemed to diaappear.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to try anything to relieve some pain and minimize their appearance.</li>
            <li>I washed using Hibiclens in the shower, then took a hot bath for about 20 minutes before having a go with the moistened and wrung out mitt.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful, but too expensive.</li>
            <li>This is doing exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure after using the mitten on a regular basis</li>
            <li>Exfoliates really well!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it promises.  </li>
            <li>I have only exfoliated 2 times, and I am really pleased.  </li>
            <li>I can definitely see that this might well help with cellulite because many massage techniques to remove cellulite include pressure, rubbing in an area, etc.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in the softness in my skin the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions and it worked for me the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Summer is coming and this is going to get me ready to put shorts on and show off my legs!  </li>
            <li>but it works exactly the way it says it will.</li>
            <li>I do think the price is pretty steep</li>
            <li>I just received my mitten and used it for the first time today.</li>
            <li>My skin is sooo soft and smooth</li>
            <li>The only thing I need more info on is why my face doesn&#x27;t peel when I use the Mitten on it.</li>
            <li>Like to keep the outside dirt-free and my mind in the gutter, always :)</li>
            <li>I have been an avid user of microdermabrasion cloths for years...</li>
            <li>The first time I used the mitten</li>
            <li>my skin felt cleaner, and softer after the first use.</li>
            <li>I do like the exfoliation I get from this mitten and how soft and smooth my skin is afterwards.  </li>
            <li>You must follow directions exactly in order to get results, so read the directions.</li>
            <li>What is left is smooth as a baby!</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions exactly</li>

            <li>This product really delivers!</li>
            <li>It took forever to get the whole process done, but it was worth it,</li>
            <li>would just like to say that you should probably do this on a day off because the first time took me an hour.</li>
            <li>Only used this once as you aren&#x27;t suppose to use more than once a week.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work for me the first time either because I tried to rush the process.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely adore my Baiden Mitten!</li>
            <li>Thank you SO MUCH!</li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>I followed the directions/tips exactly</li>
            <li>and my skin has never felt so soft and smooth in my life.  </li>
            <li>This thing is magic and there is not cheaper item that will produce the same results.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you this was the first time trying both</li>
            <li>(*barf*)</li>
            <li>It puts my Clairsonic to shame, but I only use the Baiden on my face about once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not paid to write this!  :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a product that provided such immediate and healthy results.</li>
            <li>First, when I first ordered the mitt - they contacted me to let me know exactly what the mitt was all about</li>
            <li>at first, you might even get grossed out at what you are seeing</li>
            <li>you have to soak in a hot tub for 15-20 minutes, but when you do- the skin rolls off.</li>
            <li>This mitten seemed to work the first time.  </li>
            <li>At first when I saw the mitt, I was like &amp;#34;this is it?!&amp;#34</li>
            <li>A product that works exactly as promised, if used as directed.</li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>BUT!, the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>My skin definitely looked better.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s it, and my skin is soft and as smooth as glass.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll be interested to see if it reduces stretch marks as it promises.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be investing in more mittens.</li>
            <li>I like it because it makes my skin so soft and leaves it smooth.  </li>
            <li>sure that your body has heated up enough in the water.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing/gross how much skin you will exfoliate off your body!  </li>
            <li>but I would advise them to be patient and make sure they are following directions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed that this product does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
            <li>(This is my first review ever so bear with me)  </li>
            <li>So much to say about this product!</li>
            <li>Soak your body in hot/very warm water for about 10-15 minutes, no soap or anything on the body before exfoliation, wet the cloth and use pressure etc.</li>
            <li>Most times these are just claims that you hear on your local cable ads -- not to be believed--</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>I have used my Baiden Mitten for the first time and could not believe how softer my skin was with just the first use.  </li>
            <li>This worked exactly as advertised for me.</li>
            <li>Works exactly like</li>
            <li>One of my favorite u tubers, SugarPuffandFluff, from Sweden did a simple review of this mitten vs another cheaper version.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money, highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This thing really works!  </li>
            <li>I have used the mitt now for two weeks exactly as described.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
            <li>It really worked for me!</li>
            <li>the first time i used it</li>
            <li>I found that using it on my body while I&#x27;m actually taking a shower works better than waiting until after my shower, except for my face.  </li>
            <li>but it definitely feels better to the touch</li>
            <li>My skin is now smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>and it feels like I&#x27;m actually getting into the top layers of the skin with it,</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s also really invigorating!</li>
            <li>The end result, after only one application, was astonishing.  </li>
            <li>I looked all over the Internet and found that on many different tanning forums people were saying the Baiden Mitten was a must.</li>
            <li>I will explain why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars after I rave about it first.  </li>
            <li>Used it for the first time yesterday.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an unbelievable product and everyone should own one!</li>
            <li>My skin is so much softer!</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time six days ago</li>
            <li>and I had to go to make an emergency dermatologist visit because not only does it appear that I have \\&quot;rug burn\\&quot; alllllllllll over my face, but the top layer of skin is basically gone in some areas of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really works well!</li>
            <li>Make sure you definitely follow the instructions.</li>
            <li>After a 90 degree NYC day, I went home and soaked in a hot tub for 10 minutes</li>
            <li>(I couldn&#x27;t stand any longer because it was so hot that day) and then used my mitten for the first time.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect with this mit!....</li>
            <li>soaking for about 15 minutes in a nice hot bath, I wet my Baiden Mitten and wrung it out.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t stop feeling my skin - it was so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Opinion is entirely my own.n getting the most out of your Baiden</li>
            <li>I works really well!</li>
            <li>She has since ordered several more Baiden Mittens for all the girls in our family ( including inlaws).</li>
            <li>however it became evident that by adjusting the pressure to suit my skin type I would get a noticeable benefit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for almost a year now and it still works as well as when I first bought it.</li>
            <li>At first I was hesitant to spend this much on an exfoliating tool but it truly is worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had mine a month, but after the two years&#x27; expiration date comes up on my Mitten, I will surely be buying another.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>Works exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I read the instructions well first.</li>
            <li>I live in Montana and am very fair skinned, so I wanted to buy some good self-tanner before I take a trip to the Virgin Islands and blind everyone with my white legs.  </li>
            <li>While the price may seem high, but the fact that you don&#x27;t have to purchase any exfoliating product makes up for it quickly.</li>
            <li>Easily took off many layers of dead skin, plus when used on the face</li>
            <li>I am SO happy to not experience dry skin even the next day!</li>
            <li>I have slightly mature skin, am fair complexioned, and have always suffered with dry skin.</li>
            <li>I can only imagine that with continued use, I will start to see even more positive results.  </li>
            <li>The second time though I wasn&#x27;t so impressed and felt like it didn&#x27;t really do anything, and the same with the third time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how much dead skin came off after the first use!</li>
            <li>Unique product that smoothes skin completely.  </li>
            <li>No complaints wish I would have purchased sooner well worth the money, it feels like you have new skin after using the mitten!</li>
            <li>I had a soft and fresh feeling right after first use...</li>
            <li>Really helps keep my arms soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I peel the skin off from neck to toe using as much pressure as I feel is necessary (more and for extended duration on stretchmarks).</li>
            <li>More than I&#x27;ve ever spent on a shower product, and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>So why or WHY I ask myself have I not been enjoying its benefits as much as I could have the last 2 years.</li>
            <li>I think it is because I take mostly showers and as a busy, busy mother</li>
            <li>This mitten is so good that I am not sure exactly how to describe it.  </li>
            <li>but the customer service was outstanding and very helpful with tips on how to properly use.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and it is well worth the price</li>
            <li>It is not a miracle cure but was completely worth the purchase price (even though that is high) when regarding the smoothness of my skin and the improvement in the stretchmarks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Yeah the price is bit high but worth it.</li>
            <li>At first I thought $50 for a bath mit was a little steep, but oh is it ever so much more than that!</li>
            <li>I thought the price was a little steep at first, but I absolutely love this!</li>
            <li>super soft and like it can breathe!</li>
            <li>I personally follow up my scrub with a light layer of coconut oil right before bed and use a lotion in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I personally follow up my scrub with a light layer of coconut oil right before bed and use a lotion in the morning.  </li>
            <li>After reading all the positive comments about the Baiden Mitten, I decided I wanted to try one.  </li>
            <li>This thing works exactly as promised and took an amazing amount of dead skin on my first use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(you want to be &amp;#34;sweaty&amp;#34;) and use straight strokes, not circles.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I throw pretty much anything at it</li>
            <li>You really notice a difference after your first use.</li>
            <li>Just soak in a hot shower or bath before hand, and then take a real shower afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just soak in a hot shower or bath before hand, and then take a real shower afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The reviews that say your skin becomes as soft as baby skin, it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li>Clearly some of the reviewers have never exfoliated - as it happens I use a body puff for light exfoliation with each shower and apparently that is quite adequate for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I got a detailed, honestly concerned for my satisfaction of this product email back,  in that email, she explained some other options that may work for me.</li>
            <li>Finally a product who&#x27;s marketing claims are 100% true!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even use lotion after exfoliating with the Baiden Mitten and my skin is super soft.</li>
            <li>and my arms feel super soft.</li>
            <li>I applied slightly more pressure on my legs and arms and saw a lot of old-looking, dry skin come off.</li>
            <li>Afterward, my skin felt super soft and looked radiant.</li>
            <li>I rarely mention cost, but I want you to know that your purchase goes to support Turkish workers at a better than average wage with benefits.  </li>
            <li>But when I used the Baiden Mitten prior to my first spray tan last summer, I got the best results I had ever gotten and the spray tan lasted twice as long and looked so natural.</li>
            <li>My skin is super soft now.  </li>
            <li>It does nothing more than what my dry brushing or salt scrubs do.</li>
            <li>but then when you have sensitive skin that replenishes too quickly (that&#x27;s what psoriasis is)</li>
            <li>This is a super product that helps keep my skin soft and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>easy on your face and sensitive parts the first few times, just to be safe.</li>
            <li>I will certainly give it another try for a month and post any updates.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m certain it is just an adjustment in my technique that needs changing.</li>
            <li>and now I cannot live without it!!</li>
            <li>By the time the next morning came around my skin had returned to  its normal color, but still felt as soft and amazing as it had the night before.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to know that the Korean Italy cloths are available in varying levels of coarseness, and the color of the cloth typically denotes the level of coarseness:&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have dark scars and with regular use of the mitten they have lighten them more than chemical peels have!!</li>
            <li>but I can certainly rate it highly for now!</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin from taking antihistamines for severe allergies most of my life.  </li>
            <li>It is so amazingly smooth and my fine lines are starting to fade (yeah!), but I&#x27;ve yet to see one tiny rolled up piece of skin come off my face when I use the Mitten.</li>
            <li>mitten is a bit hard to use, because it requires some manual labor and exertion for good results.</li>
            <li>This thing is tiring it is hard to get a good grab on your skin.</li>
            <li>My skin feels much smoother now, and I think with regular use I can achieve the smooth skin I have always trained.</li>
            <li>It is amazing how much dead skin you carry around yuk.</li>
            <li>If you follow the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions this mitt provides AMAZING results - takes some effort to get the hang of it and get the dead skin rolling off</li>
            <li>none of them really got the skin smooth enough.</li>
            <li>But it really made a difference to the skin appearance immediately..</li>
            <li>Really helped with my acne.</li>
            <li>my daughter raved about the mitten so much that I had to try it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>And it makes my skin feel Very bumpy.</li>
            <li>skin is sooooo soft too, definitely worth the investment</li>
            <li>That was a bit too much.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this thing to work.</li>
            <li>I really was hoping this would work.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, you need to really soak in the water before you use it.  </li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve received it and have seen my skin peel off and become so much smoother</li>
            <li>I was astonished at how much skin came off, even with gentle strokes.</li>
            <li>Very invigorating.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very helpful</li>
            <li>but I am really hopeful since it has lived up to</li>
            <li>They send you instructions which are very helpful.</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t seen much in the way of results.</li>
            <li>Really lightweight.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than the bath gloves I have from The Body Shop, but this product is many times more expensive for only a marginal improvement.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t see a drastic improvement in my keratosis pilaris on the backs of my arms, which I was really hoping for.</li>
            <li>I used it on my whole body</li>
            <li>so see how much pressure works for you..</li>
            <li>This really is a miracle product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey but really does the job.</li>
            <li>It is way too much of a hassle.</li>
            <li>bought the mitten because I was worried about some premature wrinkles (on my forehead, around my nose and eyes) and some leathery-looking skin on my shoulders from being out in the sun too much without sunscreen, and scrubbing with the mitten</li>
            <li>Exfoliates very well and</li>
            <li>there was SO MUCH.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>The company is very helpful, providing lots of tips.  </li>
            <li>It is quite unusual to get that level of customer service these days.  </li>
            <li>As it turns out, they all came straight from Korea.</li>
            <li>This configuration is not as cheap as the smaller pocket that accepts the wash</li>
            <li>This configuration is not as cheap as the smaller pocket that accepts the wash</li>
            <li>Thanks Victoria</li>
            <li>Really like this mitten.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like having a pedi-egg for your whole body.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions and absolutely nothing was removed.</li>
            <li>, money well spent I think:)</li>
            <li>Skin feels much softer.  </li>
            <li>I was absolutely amazed when I used it</li>
            <li>I cannot wait to continue to use it and really begin to see the effects.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Carla Marie from Z100 for re-sharing your post about it because otherwise I never would have found this product.  </li>
            <li>I also find that it really helps me with my clogged pores on my face.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t bother with imitations, I&#x27;ve tried them and the Baiden is the real thing.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so much softer.  </li>
            <li>But, wow, the benefits and the glowing skin are so well worth it....</li>
            <li>but my skin is still very irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really works if you follow instructions.  </li>
            <li>it cost too much to so ineffective.</li>
            <li>but this thing really works and i had a lot of cynicism</li>
            <li>This mitten needs more research and buyers need to be careful with their investments.  </li>
            <li>but so far I think it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not working very well.  </li>
            <li>Absolute beauty supply staple.  </li>
            <li>And it should go without saying, but I&#x27;ll say it - the exfoliation smoothness lasts much longer than a shave.  </li>
            <li>but now I see that these are probably real customers.</li>
            <li>tips that I found very helpful:&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be gentle when exfoliating your face, and don&#x27;t put too much pressure.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s an ongoing struggle trying to find products that help and really do as they say.</li>
            <li>I was blown away after the second use (the first time I didn&#x27;t use it correctly, but after paying better attention to the instructions and following them exactly)</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft (I rarely use moisturizer, and when I do just coconut) on my body after showering.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe I paid so much</li>
            <li>The pocket also reshaped after one gentle use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need as much lotion after use either.</li>
            <li>This product absolutely works if you use it as described.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive/adult acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>The instructions and follow up by the seller have been very helpful.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so much softer and smoother now.</li>
            <li>Even though I saw the pictures, I was still amazed how much came off on me.  </li>
            <li>Im there)you really will make a difference in your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>There is a bit of a learning curve and I still haven&#x27;t really mastered it</li>
            <li>My legs are now much smoother and the ingrown hairs are improving.  </li>
            <li>and my skin responded really well -</li>
            <li>It is very flexible when it is damp &amp; fits my hand nicely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You really have to see it to believe it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about six months and my skin is much, much smoother.</li>
            <li>Really like the product.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m for real.</li>
            <li>I really like the packaging, too.</li>
            <li>and it works really well.</li>
            <li>My skin felt sooo smooth, especially after putting on coconut oil after I was done.  </li>
            <li>Eventually I&#x27;ll be able to scrub harder.</li>
            <li>felt the intense feeling of \\&quot;ohhhhh</li>
            <li>This ensures that your skin is really moist.</li>
            <li>The usage tips and seller follow-up are greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>but the seller is very committed to providing education, tips etc.</li>
            <li>Skin is much smoother, even without lotion.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin smooth and younger looking.</li>
            <li>and I can really tell the difference.</li>
            <li>The instructions that were sent to my email address were very informative also.  </li>
            <li>My skin had never felt so smooth in my entire life.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li>The Baiden Mitten keeps my skin soft and fully exfoliated so that the lotion can be fully absorbed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always on the hunt for a product to make my skin as smooth as possible, I was intrigued.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Her skin improved very noticeable.</li>
            <li>so much healthier.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it gently on my face and neck every time I shower, and once a week I do my whole body after soaking in a bath.</li>
            <li>Speaking personally, this is an important feature, as both the cloth and the mitt MUST capture lots of DNA (aka, dead skin) in its crevices, so I would most definitely want to be able to wash it.</li>
            <li>It does what it says it will in getting rid of dead skin,  and does so rather effectively.</li>
            <li>smell after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;-Still effective after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;-Comes with handy dandy directions and tips.&lt;br /&gt;-Comes with a coupon.&lt;br /&gt;-60</li>
            <li>as effective after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t take enough time for me and a nice, long hot bath.</li>
            <li>Using this is *extremely* gross and *extremely* satisfying, and my skin afterwards is soft as a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li>It also took me several tries of using it on my face before I got a good exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>Is it worth the cost when you think of how much you would pay for professional exfoliating - YES.  </li>
            <li>I own several high-tech facial cleaners, etc., and they do not work as well as this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it about 2 times so far and love the results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once and did in fact feel nice results for several days after, so</li>
            <li>Well worth the money with better results than a single spa treatment and will last much, much longer!</li>
            <li>Works exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quickly and was followed by additional email instructions to ensure proper use.</li>
            <li>After a quick hot shower, I tried the mitten and was amazed when my skin actually started sloughing off.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t disappointed at all, it&#x27;s super awesome!  </li>
            <li>The area around my lips that was starting to show signs of aging is beginning to be much more smooth, as well as the fine lines from the corner of my lips down seem to be disappearing and the sagging jaw line is actually tightening.</li>
            <li>I felt like a new woman after that bath and getting rid of all the yucky stuff still on my skin even after a hot shower.</li>
            <li>It also seems very durable and well-made, so the length of time I&#x27;ll have it for definitely makes it worth the price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve long believed in exfoliation and have used such a skin care regime regularly for many years, using the &amp;#34;bath glove&amp;#34; found in most any store, and micro dermabrasion by an aesthetician on occasion.</li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical at first, but she was very enthusiastic about the mitten&#x27;s positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>It also does a better job than any other product of removing sunless tans.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it will last several years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not any better than other exfoliating gloves I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Not exactly making the situation better.</li>
            <li>, I draw a very hot bath that I can barely tolerate getting in to.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was such a breath of fresh air!  </li>
            <li>I figured it was safe to move to other parts of my body.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this mitten for anyone looking for smoother skin, improved appearance of stretchmarks, or just an actually effective way to slough of dead skin cells.</li>
            <li>My skin stays super soft with a little love from this mitten.</li>
            <li>It made my skin tender, especially in the region with the stretch marks at first, but the resulting fresh-feeling skin was worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, make sure to buy a Baiden name brand mitten (this exact product) and not a cheap knockoff.</li>
            <li>Only reason I gave this product 4 stars is because I just used the mitten once and after a couple of weeks, I find my skin dryer than before as if my skin feels more bare and unprotected.  </li>
            <li>, you have nothing to loose and some lovely soft skin to gain !</li>
            <li>You do have to be very gentle if you have sensitive skin like I do.</li>
            <li>It may seem a bit pricy at first, but if you consider buying exfoliates in a bottle, then using them every day, this mitten will last for years, where as a bottle of exfoliate will only last a few months at best.  </li>
            <li>Wow, this thing really works!  </li>
            <li>Also, I soak in a hot shower and then do my arms and torso, but I&#x27;ve found that that&#x27;s not quite enough hot steamy water for my legs to be ready for exfoliating, so if I&#x27;ve got time I&#x27;ll draw a bath and sit in that to do my legs.</li>
            <li>I had dark sun spots on my face, and most noticably on my chest.  </li>
            <li>Do not fall for these cheap imitations - I have use a few of them myself and can tell you that they do not exfoliate any better than a regular loofah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do not fall for these cheap imitations - I have use a few of them myself and can tell you that they do not exfoliate any better than a regular loofah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really follow the directions as well as I wanted to because while I was filling the tub with hot water, I didn&#x27;t realize that the drain plug was not all the way down and therefore was letting a ton of water out of my huge garden tub.  </li>
            <li>I am naturally pale and have very sensitive skin but the Baiden Mitten works amazingly.</li>
            <li>The first time, following the instructions, which are comprehensive and easy to follow, I only used it lightly - probably too lightly, so the second time I scrubbed harder</li>
            <li>Normally, my self tans come out fine sometimes a minor streak or two that I can fix.</li>
            <li>Better than any other I have ever purchased!</li>
            <li>After about 3 tries I finally found the right combo of techniques and my skin looks much better for it.  </li>
            <li>It has also helped smooth my lips and make my eyes look no so dry.</li>
            <li>On the areas with stretchmarks I run the mitten back and forth following alongthe indentation lines that had formed on my hips and thighs, finding this to be the most effective.&lt;br /&gt;[Initially</li>
            <li>What I do next is soak in a hot bath as hot as you can take it.</li>
            <li>The mitten even smoothed out my lips, which have always been chapped, and I think they are even plumper than before--which says a lot as they have been getting thinner and thinner as I get older.</li>
            <li>You really need to get that top layer of dead skin hydrated for it to roll off correctly.</li>
            <li>Blue is the most coarse, for heavy-duty sloughing on the tougher parts of your body, like arms and legs.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, if you wear lotions or creams, you might actually want to take a quick shower with soap BEFORE SOAKING IN THE TUB, to wash the lotion off.  </li>
            <li>Since there are so many different configurations of the KI cloth, I&#x27;ve also spotted KI pockets that are larger in size, for you to insert your hand into, like the Baiden.  </li>

            <li>I am super prone to ingrown hairs on my legs and arms especially.</li>
            <li>I wanted to use it again the very next day because im sure that there were spots that I missed but decided to follow protocol and wait until the next week.</li>
            <li>Really does take off te dead skin. :-)</li>
            <li>My face feels as brand-new-baby-like-butter-soft as my body does and the expensive moisturizers and lotions that I pay top dollar for literally absorb into my face and body and are able to do their job.</li>
            <li>I seem to have had better results the first time I used it, with a small amount of pencil eraser sized rolls on the floor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After following the instructions to soak in a very hot tub for 10 to 15 minutes I started exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>When exfoliating, be sure to soak in a tub of hot water for at least 1/2 hr (until your fingers and toes are pruned) before exfoliating, or your skin might not slough off as much as you&#x27;d like.</li>

            <li>After using it for the first time I could not believe how much dead skin came rolling off and how soft and smooth my skin was after and still is!</li>
            <li>more using harsh chemicals trying to fight dry skin, sun damage and fine lines.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to everyone...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product -</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve seen some that are sold here on Amazon for $8 or $9 and as high as $20, depending on the configuration and quantity...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Baiden mitt.</li>

            <li>The Baiden came highly recommended</li>
            <li>I operate a Mobile Spray Tan business, and I highly recommend my clients to get this mitten.</li>
            <li>I truely HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Baiden Mitten everyone.  </li>
            <li>and I was really, really surprised when the next day I noticed that my shoulders were very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>waited a little more than a week to treat again.  </li>
            <li>WOW!!  </li>
            <li>Wow, what a difference!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;- When laundering the cloth, although it&#x27;s okay to throw it into any load, keep in mind that fabric softener might neutralize a little bit of its coarseness.  </li>

            <li>My skin has never been this soft!!</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft!!  </li>
            <li>I use it once a week or up to every other day and its still going strong after almost a year of use...</li>
            <li>I bought this mainly for two reasons, I have been experiencing more and more ingrown hairs on my legs lately, and because my face has become extremely rough this winter.  </li>
            <li>I have keretosis pilaris and I feel like it&#x27;s really helping me shed that unwanted skin that just won&#x27;t shed naturally.</li>
            <li>Great for a fake tanning preparation too.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin so soft, really does what it claims.</li>
            <li>Thinking that if my body was drier, the mitten could get better traction and pick-up all those dead skin cells eagerly waiting to be sloughed away.    </li>
            <li>I bought a cheap one first and wasted $10 USD on a subpar product.</li>
            <li>Just like with the Baiden mitten, you should be able to roll strings of dead skin off of your skin surface as you do this.</li>
            <li>Just like with the Baiden mitten, you should be able to roll strings of dead skin off of your skin surface as you do this.</li>
            <li>My legs are quite stubborn so hopefully after a few more mitten treatments, they will start to cooperate.</li>
            <li>It removes layers and layers of dead skin revealing polished healthy skin that glows.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s still well worth the money, as the products will last up to 2 years</li>
            <li>but I am sure that will fade in a few hours.  </li>
            <li>I bought it for the few strechmarks I have, and use it every week and every week my strechmarks are blending into my skin tone even more.</li>
            <li>I purchased a few more to give as gifts to my sister and sister in law.  </li>
            <li>It always felt to me like I was putting on moisturizer and lotions on over top of dead skin.</li>
            <li>; True to the old adage, &#x27;quality not quantity&#x27;, this mitten will no doubt be the last exfoliation product I will ever need or buy.</li>
            <li>Its rare that a product like this actually lives up to the hype -</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to using it once a week, and will apply body lotion as I normally do after showering.</li>
            <li>worth every penny and will last me 2 yrs.</li>
            <li>I was told that the Epsom salts would help to soften the dead skin layer so the mitt would work better.  </li>
            <li>After I was done completely I rinsed my body and the mitten and applied extra virgin coconut oil to my body and sweet almond oil to my face.</li>
            <li>the people behind this product truly know what providing superior customer service is all about.  </li>
            <li>This secret was just too good to keep to my self.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan of body brushing, but this goes to a whole new level of regeneration, circulation, soft glowing skin.  </li>
            <li>I found out there were other mittens made the same and are just as good, so do your homework prior to purchasing this.  </li>
            <li>Instructions state to use plain water (soaps and oils will make your body to slippery and the Baiden will not be able to grip the skin).</li>
            <li>I do this for about 5 minutes all over my arm and hand, then I move to my right arm, my chest, my neck, face, back, legs, belly, thighs, then my bum.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Before I got this mitten I watched a YouTube video about how o properly use this and what you should/should not do to get results, because if you&#x27;re not doing it right, like waxing, the results can hurt or be unsatisfactory.</li>
            <li>Gross, right?</li>
            <li>Left and right.</li>
            <li>My super dry &amp;#34;bartender&amp;#34; hands and my whole body were sooooo soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>I also have very pliable skin as in its not very firm.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know how long the mitt will last, but I am quite satisfied with its results so far.</li>
            <li>I think this product actually works, however I&#x27;m sure you could get it at a much cheaper price, this is definitely not worth $50.</li>
            <li>In my opinion it&#x27;s high for a mitten, they should sell it for no more then $20, then more people would buy it.</li>
            <li>Check out this youtube video of how to use your new mitten:  </li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t new marks.  </li>
            <li>This is my new weekly exfoliating regimen.</li>
            <li>I feel like weight has been lifted off my body and feel like a new person.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this thing.</li>
            <li>My wife purchased this item for herself and now can&#x27;t live without one.</li>
            <li>I was able to remove all of the old dead skin cells every day, which made my skin look new and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>My super dry hand are improved, everything.</li>
            <li>It will likely replace my aesthetician ...except that I so enjoy the facial experience.</li>
            <li>I used it much more gently on my face and found my skin to be slightly brighter the following day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough to use on the whole body.</li>
            <li>, this Baiden mitten really does something no other product I&#x27;ve tried does.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do not be fooled no other mitten is like the Baiden Mitten this product really works.</li>
            <li>First of all, the fact that you can actually SEE the dead skin coming off of your body is not only amazing, but the way your body feels after is another.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone that loves the feeling of having silky soft skin.</li>
            <li>They are both at the point where they are very conscious about caring for their skin</li>
            <li>I confirmed with my husband, who was shocked too, that yes, my stretch marks had been much more noticeable then before my first use!  </li>
            <li>It never did what it claimed which was lift the top light surface of dead skin, rolling it up in little balls, even after soaking for 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I used this for the first time over the weekend and my skin feels very soft and I definitely notice a difference in the way my skin looks.</li>
            <li>After seeing some of the videos and &amp;#34;satisfied customers,&amp;#34; I thought this would be one of my answers to beautiful skin, but it&#x27;s a disappointment........</li>
            <li>Pain (Many people who have been affected by stretchmarks have constant pain/sensitivity associated with what are essentially tears in the skin, I am definitely one of those individuals.</li>
            <li>With the consistent use of this product and proper moisturizers I see that I&#x27;m improving the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>At first i bought a cheaper mittin claiming it gave the same results as baiden mittin..</li>
            <li>It is pricey, but if it lasts as long as claimed, it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>her skin is so soft!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly why this is so different, but boy, it worked.  </li>
            <li>I was worried that I was going to throw away 50 dollars to the trash, but I was happily surprised that it works!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I don&#x27;t think  i had done it correctly since I used an exfoliating scrub 2 days prior receiving this.</li>
            <li>The website is not slick but don&#x27;t let that throw you off.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I bought the exact same thing off ebay for £5.99.</li>
            <li>My skin is softer than ever before, and has a healthy glow to it now after just a few uses!</li>
            <li>It needs to be hot for it too work properly.  </li>
            <li>I have less fine lines on my forehead</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>, it seems to get a lot more skin off than the Korean cloths (but I&#x27;m not exactly sure about this since its been a while since I have used the Korean cloths.</li>
            <li>I have been able to stop using other products by simply using this&lt;br /&gt;Mitten!!!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Baby soft skin!  </li>
            <li>My skin is so soft!</li>
            <li>Baiden Mitten- has a unique woven design that separates it from other mitts on the market.</li>
            <li>I have used it twice so far and each time it has worked like a charm!  </li>
            <li>I just got it in the mail yesterday and used it for the first time last night.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Its insanely soft!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of shocking how much skin comes off, but in a good way.</li>
            <li>A shave would keep the legs smooth for a day and by the next day there would be some roughness (clearly since there was still many layers of dry dead skin).  </li>
            <li>and this is the ONLY thing that will work to get the old tan off!!!!  </li>
            <li>Yes, the pulled out hairs would last much longer VISIBLY, but to have the smooth touchable legs - that meant a second step, or live with a certain rough bumpiness - like the epilation sort of roughed up the skin when pulling out the hairs, raised up bumps where the hair follicles</li>
            <li>This item is a little bit pricey, but after your first use, you will realize that it was worth every penny..</li>
            <li>Her skin is as soft as a new born baby.</li>
            <li>My cousin recommended the baiden mitten and I was skeptical at first, but it&#x27;s really amazing.  </li>
            <li>I looked for a long time to find something to help smooth my skin, shrink my pores and improve the overall appearance of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have suffered with psoriasis for years, and after having scaly skin for so long, I didn&#x27;t think it was possible for it to feel smooth ever again.</li>
            <li>Not sure if I would spend again, but overall it&#x27;s a nice addition to my beauty routine.</li>
            <li>This product is worth every single penny.  </li>
            <li>Worth every single penny.</li>
            <li>Learn how to use it (long soak or end of shower, damp not wet skin, long stokes not circles) and you will be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I did not give it a full 5 stars because the price is too extreme.  </li>
            <li>nothing happened at first, but I pressed harder and after a few more scrubs...</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m 33), my pores are less visible and the texture of my skin is completely different and better.  </li>
            <li>I prefer to take a hot shower and let my skin get soft, then turn the water off, damp the mitten in the hot water and start scrubbing in the up and down motion.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, follow directions, and you&#x27;ll have smooth, soft skin like you&#x27;ve never experienced!</li>
            <li>I have the Clarisonic Mia and Classic but since receiving this they have barely been picked up.</li>
            <li>It really does roll away the top layer of dead, dry skin.</li>
            <li>This over priced rag, I mean, \\&quot;mitten\\&quot; will probably be the most useful to someone who has never ever exfoliated their skin in their lives, and are generally ignorant of such beauty rituals.</li>
            <li>My dead, dry skin rolled off easily after a hot shower.</li>
            <li>my original post, a few people commented that they&#x27;d tried the Korean Italy cloth and found it far too harsh for their skin, and several did not feel the KI cloths were suitable for exfoliating the face.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember how I actually stumbled on this little gem, but my skin is so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a slight change on my arms and a significant change on my legs.</li>
            <li>This is a little gross, but I really love using it under my armpits.  </li>
            <li>I was not scrubbing at all hard, nor was I using it more than suggested by the user information included with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been spray tanning (which this helps with tremendously), but the mitten is now getting a brown tint due to exfoliating the tanner.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that using small up &amp; down movements with a little force works the best.  </li>
            <li>Those pictures with huge bits of dead skin coming off?</li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive skin and thus exfoliating scrubs don&#x27;t work very well for me, but I had no issues with this causing any lasting irritation or skin damage.</li>
            <li>I am genuinely surprised at how much dead skin was on my Baiden mitt,  my skin feels smooth and rejuvenated.  </li>
            <li>The dead skin rolled off me as promised and my skin feels baby smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Although I had apprehensions about buying such an expensive mitt, I did want to try it and do everything she had done to get that great tan.  </li>
            <li>ITS CLEARLY OVERPRICED.&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li>so the price seems worth it if indeed it lasts the two or more years they say it will as during that time I would have spent at least $300.00 on scrubs compared to $50.00 on this.</li>
            <li>My skin feels silky soft and elastic after I use it.  </li>
            <li>so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Anywho, so far, this is a bust.</li>
            <li>It does make your t skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and I&#x27;m not even having to moisturize 5x a day like I used to.</li>
            <li>Your tan will last much longer now.  </li>
            <li>I also really appreciate the personal customer service of the seller.</li>
            <li>It has helped clear her skin and WOW</li>
            <li>I felt baby skin soft.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money</li>
            <li>When I get my WOW moment I will let you know.</li>
            <li>But I think they do look naturally plumber....)</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and I&#x27;m already beginning to see the fading of some impurities on my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is amazingly soft now.</li>
            <li>And the craziest thing is that my youngest is already 6 years old.  </li>
            <li>I know everyone says they&#x27;re surprised by the amount of skin that comes off, but holy cats, I had no idea</li>
            <li>My Korean mom used to call it &amp;#34;shining&amp;#34; her skin, and she swore it was the reason her skin was so soft.</li>
            <li>My Korean mom used to call it &amp;#34;shining&amp;#34; her skin, and she swore it was the reason her skin was so soft.</li>
            <li>Skin feels really soft after use.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps I simply did not need much exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>within second the mit was removing a ton of dead old skin:)</li>
            <li>I am a middle aged guy who is trying to keep a younger look about me and take care of myself a bit more.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I&#x27;m surprised at how soft my skin is</li>
            <li>old, nothing compares to the difference I&#x27;ve seen since purchasing and using the Baiden Mitten.</li>
            <li>My skin is literally glowing and SO SOFT.</li>
            <li>and then gave me a complete history about the mitt.  </li>
            <li>or a detox pore brush if u have sensitive</li>
            <li>I was surprised by this product.</li>
            <li>I am completely done, I spritz myself with rosewater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Then I&#x27;m amazed at how soft my skin is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: slough off old skin.</li>
            <li>The seller contacted me several times and seemed very concerned with everything being correct and to my liking.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Skin isn&#x27;t as soft as the Korean Italy</li>
            <li>Fast forward 2 years to a month ago, and low and behold</li>
            <li>My skin is so sensitive (yet oily)</li>
            <li>Used it on my 51 year old face, and bam...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the mitten for almost a year and keep it in my shower to use frequently.  </li>
            <li>I am 35 years old and a natural redhead</li>
            <li>I used sensitive skin lotion and cleansers, nothing was working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so far I like it.  </li>
            <li>My knees and elbows are so soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on my legs and arms and it is definitely an intense exfoliator, above any I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>and so far I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>I will never waste my time or money on those again.  </li>
            <li>so they can feel how soft they are!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also when the tan starts to naturally exfoliate I use the mitten to even it out so it doesn&#x27;t look so splotchy...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice now and my skin is so soft</li>
            <li>i surprised .</li>
            <li>In my experience you do not need to stay in the shower under hot water for too long.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have had some rashes using scrubs.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>If you want to be all soft and feeling refreshed, this is the product you want to use.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin slightly sensitive if I do it</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt so soft in my life and even my husband commented on how soft my skin was.</li>
            <li>It does say to be weary of the amount of pressure you use in sensitive skin areas, but does not explicitly state a duration of time for use or how to use on your face....</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>This is a low-tech device requiring no batteries and made from natural fibers.</li>
            <li>completely \\&quot;shed.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right before the wedding we all decided to do spray-on tanning.  </li>
            <li>I am totally investing in the whole package now.</li>
            <li>Those with sensitive skin would be advised to ease into a routine.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;It has left my skin softer and much cleaner than the every day cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I am into health and this would really be a bonus especially to get rid of toxins in my body!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>your face for last, once you get the hang of using the mitten on your body, and get a feel for how much pressure you should use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>your face for last, once you get the hang of using the mitten on your body, and get a feel for how much pressure you should use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Each mitt lasts me about 8 months (I use it about once a week, and I replace my mitts before they wear out completely).</li>
            <li>it did not work very well and where it did, my skin became very red (which it warned about in the directions)</li>
            <li>So far it is working well.  </li>
            <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t ever been so soft.  </li>
            <li>My husband notices how soft it is, too.  </li>
            <li>After each use, their skin is silky soft.</li>
            <li>(haha it sounds so gross</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t surprised.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s baby soft in areas where were so course and bumpy.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about a year now, and my overall skin quality has improved so much.</li>
            <li>The results you get from this are so far beyond what you get from a loofah or a scrub, once you try this</li>
            <li>My skin was so soft after just one use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now may 20th and the mitt is coming apart at the seams, and I haven&#x27;t used it that much, was away for 5weeks during this time, and no one else is at my home,</li>
            <li>It feels baby soft.</li>
            <li>There is a creepy yet awesome satisfaction in seeing all the rolls of dead skin that accumulate on the mitt, skin and shower floor.</li>
            <li>second time I used it, I didn&#x27;t exfoliate before, so a lot more dead skin rolled off.</li>
            <li>I have only had the opportunity to use this mitt once and hope to become more proficient removing dead skin.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good but very expensive.</li>
            <li>While the exfoliation causes super sensitivity initially in the stretchmarks, along with temporary raised red bumps along the lines in my case, in the long term my scars do not hurt as much or often as they did before I started use of the mitten.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>that first phase of dry old wrinkled skin)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a pretty obsessive about exfoliation; I used to dry brush every morning, use a clarisonic on my face, and exfoliating gloves in the shower.</li>
            <li>It never fails that every time I do the scrub, I think I&#x27;m a beast until I dry off.</li>
            <li>I was dubious about spending $50 on such a simple little product, but I have keratosis pilaris on my arms and dry, itchy skin all over and after seeing so many bloggers rave about it, I decided it would be worth a try since I could always return it.</li>
            <li>Since going through menopause, I developed little bumps on my skin and this mitten has really made it so much smoother!  </li>
            <li>When you first use your mitten and start rubbing make sure your skin in slightly wet but not too wet, there needs to be some friction to make the skin roll..if you start off too wet it wont work.</li>
            <li>I can only say to those who are curious give it a shot, you have nothing to loose and some lovely soft skin to gain !</li>
            <li>I tried to contact Baiden Mitten directly to ask about this, but when you click on the contact link on the main web page, there is no actual way to contact.  </li>
            <li>I was using like sandpaper, quick up and down motions.  </li>
            <li>They were excited to get new ones in their Christmas stockings this past Christmas.</li>
            <li>You have to soak in a HOT bath for a while to get your skin loose.</li>
            <li>Seriously, the Sahara Dessert has more moisture than I do.  </li>
            <li>Then once the tub is all drained I clean it off all the dead skin from the bottom of the tub (and trust me there will be a lot).</li>
            <li>My skin seriously looks and feels much better.</li>
            <li>The second time I used it, I didn&#x27;t see quite the same results as I did the first time.</li>
            <li>I tried it the first time and the next day, ran errands with no makeup, but had total confidence in my appearance because of the mitten.</li>
            <li>After the first use I noticed my skin was softer, but after a few week my skin has become much softer and lighter.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t get sucked into things that aren&#x27;t mainstream because I feel that I can&#x27;t always be sure the company or product is trusted, which is why I tend to stick to shopping at big beauty chains like Sephora and Ulta for my beauty supplies/tools.</li>
            <li>Stretch marks started to fade in appearance, small wrinkles at the corners of my eyes diminished and the overall look of my skin got better.</li>
            <li>I bought this product mainly for my Keratosis Pilaris that I have in the back of my arms and thighs</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also the most skeptical person on the planet - when I first read about the Mitten,</li>
            <li>Skin was very smooth after first usage, but a little dryer than usual.  </li>
            <li>I have some cellulite on the back of my legs (who doesn&#x27;t?), some serious abdominal scars from having my gallbladder removed, and some light stretch marks from getting tall very fast.</li>
            <li>I highly doubt the material used to create this product was so pricey that it could only be profitable to the seller to charge $50.00.</li>
            <li>I definitely thought the price was rather high going into it</li>
            <li>All in all I LOVE this product, but since its so expensive I will only recommend it to people who really want an intense exfoliating treatment.</li>
            <li>I searched high and low online -</li>
            <li>If you have trouble with stretchmarks, cellulite or dry skin, you will love this.</li>
            <li>(I would definitely suggest doing it in the tub so that you can easily wipe up the dead skin when done.)</li>
            <li>Pink is mild coarseness, and what I&#x27;ve used on my face personally to exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;d)</li>
            <li>actually replied to the seller&#x27;s email asking me if I&#x27;d received my mitten and explained that I received a huge gigantic ouchie mess of face from the mitten.</li>
            <li>results the first couple of tries, but</li>
            <li>I sat in a hot bath for 10 minutes with the shower curtain closed, exhaust fan off.</li>
            <li>My skin has always been dull and now it is FULL OF LIFE!</li>
            <li>Yellow comes with one side in mild coarseness, the other is medium.&lt;br /&gt;ii)</li>
            <li>I live in Minnesota and it is the middle of winter.</li>
            <li>I bought a new razor and only used each razor head a few times, I made exfoliation scrubs, which were effective but messy and too time consuming to do as often as needed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been really helpful for my dry skin</li>
            <li>I have seen my skin become healthier, less dry, and altogether better, especially my arms and face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with KP and dry skin my whole life, so</li>
            <li>as long as one spends about 15 minutes in an enclosed space with the buildup of hot steam, the warmer/hot (not scalding) water was essential in my case.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would imagine that just about any Korean who might stumble upon this product might have the exact same thought process as I did.  </li>
            <li>I would imagine that just about any Korean who might stumble upon this product might have the exact same thought process as I did.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s expensive, but it really works, unlike so many product promises.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>[take a hot steamy shower] long enough?</li>
            <li>I use the mitt in a saltwater bath once a week for a deep exfoliation treatment the rest of the week I gently use this and the facial one.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to sound like an infomercial, but every layer of dead skin that I exfoliated, layers of younger looking skin appeared.  </li>
            <li>I do use fake tanners so this comes in handy when you need to prep or slough off old tan.</li>
            <li>My young adult daughters have been using Baiden Mittens for several years now.</li>
            <li>I was initially put off by the $50 price tag of what I considered to be one very pricey loofa, but I thought what the heck, I&#x27;ll try it since it has a money back guarantee.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the mitten once so far, but WOW</li>
            <li>with all of it&#x27;s good reviews on Amazon, I thought it was a total fake.</li>
            <li>Skin began to literally roll right off my leg, and fall down into the tub.</li>
            <li>Love seeing those gross little rolls of dead skin, and it&#x27;s really improving the bumps on my arms.</li>
            <li>The next morning the bumps were almost completely gone!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re called Korean Italy cloths, for some strange reason, and as I read on further about how the Baiden would roll off strings of dead skin after a soak in a hot tub, I already knew that the Korean cloths did that as well--very effectively, in fact, and for a helluva lot less money--so, I sent my Baiden back without even trying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is supposed to last about two years, so if you break it down you really aren&#x27;t paying all that much for the type of results you will get.  </li>
            <li>I was concerned that I wasn&#x27;t using it properly, but after some tweaking of technique I was able to get the visible dead skin rolls, but only from my underarm area while everywhere else stayed the same.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this mitten for the very elderly or (maybe some) disabled folks, or just anyone who isn&#x27;t physically fit enough to rub their body pretty hard.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the material has changed, but the fabric of my new mitten feels much thinner and less durable.</li>
            <li>A little pricey but definitely worth</li>
            <li>I was a little unsure if it was worth the price</li>
            <li>This is basically a Turkish Hammam bath mitt, purchasable in Turkey for less than $5 and surely in America for less than $10.</li>
            <li>Then jumped into a tub of very hot *plain water for 25 minutes.     </li>
            <li>, because no other exfoliation has proven effective, I admit I was beyond skeptical when I ordered this product.  </li>
            <li>noticed very little skin came off my face, but I didn&#x27;t really soak my face and I use a gentle exfoliating scrub throughout the week</li>
            <li>The back of my arms are usually bumpy, but are now smooth after one use.</li>
            <li>If this were much cheaper, I wouldn&#x27;t mind, but this not worth anything near the price.</li>
            <li>After dousing the Baiden Mitten in warm/hot water wring it out then using forward/backward or side/side motions (essential to see results, circular motions are completely ineffective)</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft, but it probably would anyway if I turned off the water in the shower and used my gloves for the same length of time.     </li>
            <li>Maybe I will look around and see if there is some specific instructions for technique because so far it has been a time, money and effort waster at my house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only used it three times.  </li>
            <li>My whole life my shoulder area has been slightly rough and bumpy.  </li>
            <li>Just had a professional facial at</li>
            <li>I towel-dried my skin (after not carefully reading the instructions)</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it did actually help with those things.</li>
            <li>Trick is to scrub with a deodorant soap first face and all then soak in hot bath for at least ten minutes then scrub with baiden,</li>
            <li>second reason to consider the Korean Italy cloth is that it is completely machine washable, and lasts for YEARS.  </li>
            <li>I exfoliated my face as well as legs, arms, stomach, and back and didn&#x27;t see too much result from my face, but it&#x27;s only been one exfoliation, so maybe next time.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft &amp; silky and I&#x27;ve only been using it three weeks.</li>
            <li>It has helped almost completely rid me of  my ingrown hair problem after only a couple of uses.</li>
            <li>It will blow you away - its like going to a European masseuse and getting a complete body detoxing massage -</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll get the same results with a loofa from body shop or like the early comment</li>
            <li>So, the question remains why did they ban a simple review, and why is there no contact info on the companies direct web site.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the mitten twice so far, as I&#x27;m using it once weekly to get my skin used to it.</li>
            <li>My arms were sort of crepey from sun exposure and now are starting to look like my 22 year old daughter&#x27;s arms</li>
            <li>your skin REALLY soft and minimizes facial wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I would by several for my 50-something year old friends.</li>
            <li>This mitt never did anything it claimed for me, not even after giving it a second chance once we moved to a home with soft water-</li>
            <li>I have keratosis pilaris and this is the only product that allows me to have soft skin once again.  </li>
            <li>I did have a pretty dark spray tan that I was trying to remove so the skin rolling off</li>
            <li>I am in complete utter amazement of the after results.</li>
            <li>I had wonderfully SOFT skin for the first few weeks and was raving about this to everyone.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I dont know how you can go wrong purchasing and using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My skin was pink for a few hours after exfoliating, and I was glad I didn&#x27;t have to leave the house until the next morning.</li>
            <li>After a soak like that, just about anything remotely abrasive will easily remove dead skin.</li>
            <li>I had this dry patch of skin on my face that nothing was helping and this has fixed the problem completely.  </li>
            <li>Love this, it did not roll the dead skin off anywhere on my body except my chest but none the less</li>
            <li>It is a little bit of a workout for me to rub my skin with the mitten so hard and fast, even though I am young (24) and relatively fit.</li>
            <li>I mean, I knew it was an important step in skin care</li>
            <li>purpose of my informal trial run was to identify any positive or negative results on the portions of my skin affected by stretchmarks; I should note that I have very light/fair skin, but I&#x27;d recommend anyone who&#x27;s looking for improved skin tone and texture to try the product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(Long-term use faded the newer/thinner stretchmarks on my hips from purple to the silver/grey, making them largely less noticeable than they first were.</li>
            <li>The purple discoloration of the wider/larger thigh stretchmarks is still visible but to a drastically less degree than to when I first</li>
            <li>NO DRY SKIN!</li>
            <li>the whole bottom of my tub was filled with dead skin when i used it!!!!</li>
            <li>It is so smooth on my skin that it&#x27;s hard to believe it&#x27;s doing the same job as the scrubs.</li>
            <li>No matter how much I scrubbed with a facial sponge, or what kind of expensive exfoliating lotions and cleansers I used my face would always be extremely flaky.  </li>
            <li>it today for the 1st time, long steamy shower, do not dry off, wet the Mitten with hot water and wring out.</li>
            <li>Have no dry patches on my elbows, knuckles or knees.</li>
            <li>I was told once that I produce a lot of skin cells ( I get flakes not dry skin)</li>
            <li>So, upshot is, few weeks of use only, but definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I took a chance on this product, and the first couple of times I did struggle with it–only getting little rolls of skin here and there.</li>
            <li>Hi, I purchased my first Baiden Mitten a little over a year ago and started using it immediately when it came in.</li>
            <li>#34;chicken skin&amp;#34;) on the backs of my arms; however, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the Baiden Mitt not only exfoliated as well as any glove/device/scrub I&#x27;d used in the past, but was absolutely pain-free and didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling &amp;#34;raw&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; as I&#x27;d become accustomed to with all those other treatments.  </li>
            <li>Not quite what i expected for the money spent... maybe im just not using it right ubt i havent got it to work like mentioned in the packaging.</li>
            <li>I still have a little bit of flaking in my trouble spots, like the bridge of my nose, but I am now confident these will disappear with regular use of the mitten.  </li>
            <li>only treated half of my body the first time.  </li>
            <li>since I know the Baiden mitten works due to my experiences with the ORIGINAL less pricier version, it gets 3 stars.</li>
            <li>No matter how hard I tried, it did not work for me like other people and I read many reviews, instructions etc. and followed them.</li>
            <li>This helps my self-tanner last much longer than any other mitt.</li>
            <li>I stood up after that and started scrubbing in long pressured motions and wow is all I can say.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions, and my dead skin did not roll off, and my skin was no more smooth than it normally is.</li>
            <li>First time I noticed the rolls of dead skin cells.</li>
            <li>I was astonished how much dead skin came off the FIRST time I used it.</li>
            <li>after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;-Shrinks when it is under hot water.&lt;br /&gt;-Can slip off hand when using.&lt;br /&gt;-Can</li>
            <li>I was amazed at the amount of debris that was pulled out of my skin the first few times.</li>
            <li>, I think that if the company would cut the price in half they would make up for the cut in price by the pure volume in sells...</li>
            <li>If you have moderately dry skin it helps but for severely dry skin not so much.</li>
            <li>Make sure that there are no bath salts, lotions, creams, or anything else but plain water that you soak in, or the dead skin will not peel off properly.</li>
            <li>Make sure that there are no bath salts, lotions, creams, or anything else but plain water that you soak in, or the dead skin will not peel off properly.</li>
            <li>Now before using your mitten wash it in plain soapy hot water.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It takes probably about a half hour to completely do my whole</li>
            <li>my skin feels so soft afterwards and i no longer have itchy dry skin in the winter.  </li>
            <li>Yes, they are young, but their skin gets dry.</li>
            <li>I think it works the same as Dr. Lancer&#x27;s Method for skincare, where you use his skin polisher first to get the dead skin off your face, then use his cleanser</li>
            <li>But I guess it is encouraging to see a company stand behind their product so strongly.</li>
            <li>I guess I have to mandatorily use the mitten every single week as instructed, but my busy schedule doesn&#x27;t always allow room for pampering.  </li>
            <li>that came off the first time I used it, and the next few times I had the same results.  </li>
            <li>few hours later my skin was HOT, red, buuuuuuuuuuuurning and I</li>
            <li>Even in the dead of winter up here in New England, my skin feels as soft as a baby&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>But, really the exfoliating gloves found at your local retailer could do the job just as well for a lot less money.</li>
            <li>Turkish cloth looks exactly the same (same size, same colour) and I was amazed with how much dead skin came off, especially because I exfoliate regularly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will be buying this product for as long as I live or as long as they keep making it (which I hope they do for decades to come!)</li>
            <li>I followed the directions to the letter - soaked in a plain bath for 30 minutes, lightly toweled off, rubbed the mitt across back and forth and then up and down (and not in a circle).  </li>
            <li>and I use pure coconut oil everyday..</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant to order because of the cost, and it didn&#x27;t look like there was much to it.  </li>
            <li>I have super pale fair skin and dirt on me sticks to my dead skin and makes me look dirty.</li>
            <li>I was walking around with such a layer of dead, dull skin hiding my baby soft smooth skin</li>
            <li>And my skin is very resilient, I would never ever consider it &#x27;sensitive&#x27; or &#x27;thin&#x27; or &#x27;mature&#x27; skin that I would take caution with.</li>

            <li> Using the Baiden Mitten was the most incredible experience!  </li>
            <li> I cannot belive how effective it was!  </li>
            <li> The price reflects the excellent quality and the helpful emails from the company are outstanding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving a 5 star mostly for customer service, which is exquisite.</li>
            <li> Plus the most excellent customer service I have ever encountered with any product I have ever bought!</li>
            <li> this product is the most effective at smoothing out the texture of those lines working best on my newer/thinner hip stretchmarks.</li>
            <li> , this is the best and most effective exfoliating mitt I have ever used.</li>

            <li> This product got some good reviews</li>
            <li> (but it was a good thing!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t mind having a good reason to sweat.</li>
            <li> think it&#x27;s important to point out that I don&#x27;t at all dispute the excellent exfoliating abilities of the Baiden mitten.  </li>
            <li> Great customer service and a nice product.</li>
            <li> I also recommended it to my sister who bought one about a week ago and has used it once and absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> and I loved it (already started telling my friends about it).</li>
            <li> I then soak in a bath with just water for a good 10 minutes</li>
            <li> I will use this item for the rest of my life, it&#x27;s THAT good.  </li>
            <li> While I thought my skin was in good condition for a 63 yr.</li>
            <li> It is supposed to be good for up to two years use.  </li>
            <li> It works find but not as good as advertised.</li>
            <li> while it worked good on my body, I have to say that I would be PETRIFIED to use it on my face EVER again.</li>
            <li> So good.</li>
            <li> Loved my esthetician, but haven&#x27;t seen her in quite a loooong time.  </li>
            <li> and they both too loved it.</li>
            <li> Ive had mine for 8 months and its still looking good</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s incredibly invigorating and refreshing afterwards.  </li>
            <li> But I read all of the good reviews and thought I&#x27;d take a chance....</li>
            <li> Really surprising.</li>
            <li> These are effective, non-toxic tools to use to get great results.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely loved it, I used it for 2 years and had to buy a replacement.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does take a bit to figure out but as someone with fair skin, I use this once week and my skin has never looked better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let me also add that their customer service and friendly e-mails/instructions are excellent.</li>
            <li> Its amazing tool for your skin care, really amazing!</li>
            <li> Amazing customer service and mitten works amazing also!</li>
            <li> The seller is amazing and sent me a detailed email describing how to best use the mitten and those are the instructions that I followed.</li>
            <li> I originally bought my Baiden mitten after reading an excellent and popular review for a self-tanning product, in which the author said she used the Baiden to slough before doing her tanning.  </li>
            <li> What is extraordinary in my mind and to my way of thinking, the customer service is beyond compare!!!  </li>
            <li> While I love my children, I don&#x27;t wear my stretch marks proudly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and very satisfied.</li>
            <li> However for tanners great because you&#x27;ll get the most out of your tanning dollars.</li>
            <li> But, I am glad I did, it&#x27;s a great product and does what it says.</li>
            <li> They want to make sure you are happy with your purchase.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions (very important to do so, or you won&#x27;t get the killer results)!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, although it seems a bit overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions provided and got great results so far.</li>
            <li> I dipped the Baiden mitten in hot water and wrung it out the best I could. .</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anybody, no matter what problems you have with your skin or what results you want, you&#x27;ll be pretty happy with this mitten!!</li>
            <li> The company is interactive and gives you many helpful tips in order to maximize the efficiency of the product!</li>
            <li> You will be glad you did!   </li>
            <li> Furthermore, the Baiden Mitten exfoliated my skin so well that I had the most even airbrush tan ever!</li>
            <li> I love the product!</li>
            <li> /&gt;With all those disclaimers in there, I have to say the RESULTS are OUTSTANDING!</li>
            <li> Love this!  </li>
            <li> (yes it&#x27;s safe!)</li>
            <li> But... I love it already!</li>
            <li> Never had my skin this smooth!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty awesome!</li>

            <li> I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I did get a bit of sloughing, but wasn&#x27;t impressed at first.</li>

            <li> Let me start by saying that I love my baiden mitten!</li>
            <li> :) thank you to the sellers of this product!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I found this product while looking into at-home microdermabrasion machines, and I&#x27;m so glad that I got this instead!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Baiden mitten!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and great for exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten great results after a hot 10 minute shower rather than a soak in the bath, but one day when I have access to a nice tub, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be incredible.</li>
            <li> Great product and super service!</li>
            <li> The results are amazing..</li>
            <li> However, if she soaks your feet 20 minutes before she takes a pumice stone to your feet, the results are amazing.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks better,and feels amazing.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly.</li>

            <li> nothing amazing just yet.  </li>
            <li> it is amazing.</li>
            <li> but I am amazed how nice my skin feels.  </li>
            <li> Process:&lt;br /&gt;[I should note that both soaking in the bathtub and shower are just as effective a prep for the mitten</li>
            <li> nice to buy something that does what it claims.</li>
            <li> It is highly effective to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All opinions stated here are 100% honest and my exclusive opinion*******used.  </li>
            <li> All opinions stated here are 100% honest and</li>
            <li> It is perfect for getting ready for using self tanning.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m on the journey now and thrilled.</li>
            <li> Kind of tricky to keep it on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for the face and whole body.</li>
            <li> I wish that I could afford to buy them and give them out as gifts because I really do think that it is a wonderful product.  </li>
            <li> My skin is clearing up nicely too since I&#x27;ve been exfoliating with it</li>
            <li> and I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> After I explained my issue, I honestly didn&#x27;t expect to get any response.</li>
            <li> You will be thrilled with your results as I was.</li>
            <li> and so it takes a while to figure out what works best for you, how much pressure, how often to use it, etc.  </li>
            <li> After years of loofah-ing I can honestly say that I was just wasting my time.</li>
            <li> Their incredible customer service and quality promise is something so rare these days.</li>
            <li> Honestly this thing could replace a myriad of skin care products.</li>
            <li> I liked the mitten</li>
            <li> And my bank account is loving it, too.  </li>
            <li> Save your $49 dollars and go have a nice spa experience.</li>
            <li> Opinion is entirely my own.</li>
            <li> My wife swears by how effective the mitten works</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not a bath taking kind of girl anyhow).</li>
            <li> so honestly it was probably closer to 30...)</li>
            <li> Love love love this!!</li>
            <li> they truly want you to love this product and are excited for you to get the incredible results that you will get after using this product....</li>
            <li> I have been a sun worshiper most of my life, and this is helping smooth my skin and make it beautiful.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome and has greatly improved my dry, Denver-Winter, itchy skin.</li>
            <li> This mitt is incredible and work exactly like the the website said.</li>
            <li> I am a researcher when it comes to skin...always trying to find what&#x27;s new and best.</li>
            <li> i couldn&#x27;t stop touching my smooth skin the rest of the night, lol.</li>
            <li> WOW was I amazed at how great it worked and how great my skin felt after.</li>
            <li> The Baiden Mitten is an awesome tool for anyone who wants better looking skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent customer service and very soft skin.</li>
            <li> It was obviously VERY easy for me to over-do it...</li>
            <li> &quot; it has by far been the best investment to treat the appearance of the stretchmarks on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main</li>
            <li> this mitten is an most amazing product.  </li>
            <li> It is by far the best skin product I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> My skin felt very moist afterwards(no need for lotion, even though I used coconut oil), it was an incredible feeling.</li>
            <li> I am honestly convinced this glove is magical.</li>
            <li> I think it important to point out that this actually isn&#x27;t a good idea to use on your face.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best exfoliators on the market.</li>
            <li> Just like everyone else has said, when that top layer starts rolling off you&#x27;re kind of grossed out, but fascinated by how well it&#x27;s working.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wonderful soft skin awaits you</li>
            <li> I always thought I had pretty good skin (not a sun person since I am so fair)</li>
            <li> It provided a very smooth surface for a flawless tan and my skin felt rejuvenating and soft!  </li>
            <li> I love, love, love my mitten!</li>
            <li> received this product complimentary in exchange for an honest, and fair review.</li>
            <li> My feet are always the hardest to get entirely clean which takes forEVER to get good results with just a wash cloth and</li>
            <li> Over the years I have used many products to exfoliate, this is by far the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This worked perfectly and my skin feels as though I used a moisturizing soap or lotion, but it&#x27;s my bare skin!</li>
            <li> that I can FINALLY say that I am the proud owner of my very own Baiden Mitten</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and thought this was too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> This mit is truly effective and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The seller is also very attentive and sends you emails advising the user on proper ways to use and get best results with the baiden mitt.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because the mitten has given me dramatically softer, shiner, firmer, more beautiful skin, and more shallow wrinkles, I would say the Baiden mitten is a must-buy for every woman (and man that cares about their skin looking awesome!!!).</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect by this product.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed that when I used lighter pressure that there was more pilling.  </li>
            <li> If I should see more impressive results in the future, I will edit my review.</li>
            <li> this is not)should not be priced more than twenty bucks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with fantastic instructions, so read them and dont be a ding dong!</li>
            <li> However after multiple uses I can definitively say this is THE BEST exfoliator mitt on the market and</li>
            <li> I have suffered from a skin condition called keratosis pilaris for many years now</li>
            <li> I love this mitten.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for anyone who tans regularly!</li>
            <li> I may give it one more week.</li>
            <li> Note: If you do not body brush, you may have better results.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels after I use it.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> After reading such wonderful reviews I couldn&#x27;t resist.</li>
            <li> My  skin felt do smooth and soft after, it was wonderful.</li>
            <li> I tried a fourth time and used some tips and advice that the seller gave me and the results were great!</li>
            <li> The skin tone is way more even</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is definitely the best skin polisher that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I used the Baiden Mitten once and my spray Tan looks better than it ever has.</li>
            <li> so you&#x27;d expect a lot more.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the Exfoliation Mitt for one reason.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to squeeze out the water.</li>
            <li> Make sure to be hydrated by drinking lots of water.</li>

            <li> Noticed that my self tan looks much better.</li>

            <li> My skin has never looked or felt better.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my skin.  </li>
            <li> I received this product free to test and give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a lot better at exfoliating than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with it and the money was well-spent</li>
            <li> Husband and I love the results on my skin.</li>

            <li> I decided to splurge and get one and make sure my tan goes on right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the tan is fabulous, too!</li>
            <li> In addition to the product there was a link for an ebook with more information and testimonials.  </li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product!!!</li>
            <li> because how could they look so much better</li>
            <li> I love, love ,love this.</li>
            <li> I can not say the price was attractive, I think it is WAY too much for what you get</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I also use coconut oil and shea butter to moisturize and it penetrates better now.</li>
            <li> I will never be without one of these... :)</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did--</li>

            <li> Absolutely love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The baiden mitten is so, so, so much better.</li>
            <li> This seller gives great tips on how to use it and she really cares if it works for you.</li>
            <li> Many will find this level unsuitable for any part of their body.&lt;br /&gt;b)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to see skin &amp;#34;peel off&amp;#34; as advertised, but it does leave my skin nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> love having this anti aging weapon in my arsenal:)</li>
            <li> My wash cloth removes more than this.</li>
            <li> I stay in the bath for, the better it works.</li>
            <li> Works great fast shipping</li>
            <li> Better than any body scrub.</li>
            <li> I was glad to see the results in front of me.</li>
            <li> I was as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!...</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> Be sure to strictly adhere to the instructions until you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> And to me $50 is nothing for silky sexy skin.</li>
            <li> I just use more body lotion to fight the dryness.  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of beauty products, and this one is in my top five all time favorites.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> and then his skin nourisher, and that way the moisturizer can absorb the skin better.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So as much as I&#x27;d love to keep recommending it...</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s for sure, and</li>
            <li> and I immediately purchased it after reading most of the reviews.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use lotion for several days and it allows perfect self tanner application.  </li>
            <li> i bought this having read the excellent reviews and obviously missing the not so good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure you follow instructions for optimal results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I took the chance</li>
            <li> - I am now in love with this thing and tell everyone about it.  </li>
            <li> this isn&#x27;t advertised more...</li>
            <li> I positively love my Baiden Mitten.</li>
            <li> most seemed to be written by distributors</li>
            <li> &#x27;s some tips on how to use it and achieve all of those gross skin rolls (that are so wonderful to see go!)&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s beyond phenomenal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, I like the Baiden Mitten better.</li>
            <li> and I am so pleased and think to myself,</li>
            <li> I love my Clarisonic which I have used for 7 years since my daughter was born.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the way the company makes sure you know how to use and take care of your mitt.  </li>
            <li> The more you use it the more it works</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really pleased with the results I&#x27;m having.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Then they followed up to make sure that I got it.</li>
            <li> It should be priced a lot better than that.</li>
            <li> I just wish they can include better instructions to help with specifically strechmarks.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> i ordered 2 more to give as gifts.  </li>
            <li> I was so impressed with how smooth and soft my skin was after using the Baiden Mitten.</li>
            <li> And after using it for a longer period of time I even noticed more results.</li>
            <li> and I am in love with this product.  </li>
            <li> So many things I&#x27;ve bought, ordered and tried, to no avail.</li>
            <li> Love this product and seller follow up</li>
            <li> I got just okay</li>
            <li> Victoria Winnard is the perfect example of what a person SHOULD do to promote their business and how a person should present themselves to let you know that they believe in their product.  </li>
            <li> One of those products that you discover online, use it, and it becomes something on the \\&quot;Favorite</li>
            <li> One of these days, I am going to create holiday gift baskets for my friends with all my favorite things and this will be in it.  </li>
            <li> (the coconut oil would be in the C&#x27;s Favorite Things Basket too -</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need Oprah money for these products, but they are still fabulous!)</li>
            <li> LOVE this thing.</li>
            <li> I am sure the more I use it, I will see better results on my arms.</li>
            <li> I can get the skin to roll off my face, but that may be because I exfoliate my face a lot more than my body.  </li>
            <li> Skin is visibly fresher and more youthful looking.</li>
            <li> but it has helped maintain a lovely smoothness.</li>
            <li> Because of the Baiden mitten, I&#x27;m more confident not wearing nylons</li>
            <li> I really think this is a great product</li>
            <li> I think more people would buy it if it were cheaper.  </li>
            <li> BUT.......I wish the manufacturers would drop the price so more people could buy it.</li>
            <li> I think I will like like it more as time goes on.</li>
            <li> I get that healthy glow all day.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mitten about three weeks ago and have been more than pleased with what it has done for my skin.</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> I really do love this product</li>
            <li> This mitten is fantastic!</li>
            <li> more frequently.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
            <li> I love that you can roll it up and throw it in your gym bag, unlike electrical defoliators.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> would recommend it. :)</li>
            <li> I would love if they made a face mitt-</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt better.  </li>
            <li> I love it on my face</li>
            <li> the baiden mitten is more of a cloth feeling material--made from bamboo fibers.</li>
            <li> i love to use it on my face--</li>
            <li> feels so smooth after using!</li>
            <li> skin and transforming it to smooth, nice looking skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I assume the more you use it, the better your skin feels.  </li>
            <li> enjoyed the relaxation of the procedure.</li>
            <li> and I love</li>
            <li> And, my skin feels so-o-o-o smooth!  </li>
            <li> A fantastic product!</li>
            <li> and then I followed up with my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> on getting the most out of your Baiden Mitten:&lt;br /&gt;*Do not shower before using the Baiden Mitten.</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t even begin to say how much I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love even more that it is safe to use on my face and most of all my lips.  </li>

            <li> I was always embarrassed for my husband touching my butt</li>

            <li> And yes, I use it on my face (gently in some places) and it is amazing (just use caution!)  </li>
            <li> A sugar or salt scrub are much, much, much easier to use and just as effective!</li>
            <li> The Baiden Mitten has changed my skin - best investment I have made in a long time.  </li>
            <li> and it is good to know I am supporting a family owned business.</li>
            <li> but so worth it!!</li>
            <li> Best purchase I have made in a long time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to continue using it and see how my skin improves!  </li>
            <li> Anyhow, the Baiden Mitten works fine, but it does not work better than the $3 loofah from the drug store.</li>
            <li> great product it works great on my skin gets of all the dead skin and leaves you feeling smooth</li>
            <li> I completely freaked out when I was able to roll off my own skin with the mitt!</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I emailed the seller and she sent me more detailed instructions.  </li>
            <li> The best $50 I&#x27;ve ever spent on a beauty product.</li>
            <li> Okay - i sound like everyone else</li>
            <li> This is the best $50 I have EVER spent on a product!!!&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> Skin is buttery soft and you feel great after using it.  </li>
            <li> Also is great for getting any old tan residue off.</li>
            <li> I started spray tanning and was looking for a way to get rid of blotchiness and really get a good exfoliation.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome, took my dry cracked heals to a smooth surface.....</li>
            <li> Loved the treatments, loved the dermabrasion, but noticed a couple days after dermabrasion, my skin became really dry and peely.  </li>
            <li> I spend lots of hours outdoors and my skin needed that fantastic help to rejuvenate in easy and effective way , and I was lucky to try this mitten and its works</li>
            <li> I love the Baiden mitten not only because it make my skin feel good but gives my whole body a great massage, which increases circulation.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this and was so excited to get the results everyone seems to be raving about</li>
            <li> All of the reviews you read on it - true!  </li>
            <li> Not painful at all!</li>
            <li> After using this mitt, I know that isn&#x27;t true!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the Baiden Mitten!</li>
            <li> you feel so clean and really able to breathe after using it.</li>
            <li> but this does the trick and is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Firstly, Korean Italy cloths are fairly easy to find, and are monumentally cheaper than the Baiden--you can buy them in any Korean market, on eBay, or even here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m VERY impressed and the baiden mitten is 100% worth the money.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, and easy to keep clean!&lt;br</li>
            <li> use this all over my body &amp; have used it gently on my face &amp; even my lips with great success.  </li>
            <li> Her pores are shrinking tremendously and her complexion is starting to look flawless, excepting the light scars from her breakouts that are still healing.</li>
            <li> I gave this item a 4 star, which could easily turn into a 5.</li>
            <li> Easy to use,  easy to care for..worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I saved myself a ton of cash, and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I was pretty impressed, my skin was SUPER SOFT and silky and it was very refreshing.</li>
            <li> First off, this seller is amazing.</li>
            <li> Though her acne did flare up a bit after the first use, since then, her skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li> The amount of skin that had fallen into the tub by then end of my first exfoliation session was absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li> I use a Clarisonic faithfully every day, so I already have pretty nice complexion.</li>
            <li> and i am completely amazed at the astounding results!</li>
            <li> I will admit that the price kind of deterred me at first</li>
            <li> With the first use my skin is smooth, glowing and drinking in the lotion that used to just sit on top!</li>
            <li> I was completely surprised and thrilled!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every imaginable form of exfoliation, and this is hands down, the BEST.</li>
            <li> otherwise the directions state to soak in a very warm tub, or stay in the shower with the water very warm for at least 15 mins).</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and smooth, my husband and I are both loving the results!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fine....</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Best to purchase two, one for you and one for your significant other.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from it, it just seemed too good to be true.</li>
            <li> When it arrived (quickly!)</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!! :O)</li>
            <li> If it really &amp;#34;detoxifies&amp;#34; your body that would be the cherry on top!  </li>
            <li> I thought it sounded perfect for me since I Mystic Tan weekly and am always looking for a way to exfoliate the old and prep the new.</li>
            <li> My skin is bright, smooth, soft...very soft!  </li>
            <li> My skin has never looked so good nor felt so smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> My skin was better after the first use!</li>
            <li> This product works wonderfully on my legs and arms, but I seem to struggle using it on my sides or breasts which are a little softer</li>
            <li> and you will see the benefits after the very first use!  </li>
            <li> From what I&#x27;ve seen and felt, I really have no doubt whatsoever that the Baiden is a high quality product that does what it says, beautifully.  </li>
            <li> At 63 it is so nice to have something that really adds to making me feel fabulous.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing mitt, my skin feels like a young girls again.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say that this is nothing short of amazing.  </li>
            <li> it was smooth and glowing and felt great and stayed that way for several days.</li>
            <li> and I can see a huge improvement.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve suffered from keratosis pilaris on my arms for years and found this to be a HUGE help..  </li>
            <li> Despite not having the skin roll off, I did see and feel a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I know that exfoliating is important</li>
            <li> My skin did feel smooth when I was done...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using a light weight aloe lotion after I use it and didn&#x27;t experience any redness or any skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> If you do it too light nothing will happen.</li>
            <li> and it keeps them smooth.</li>
            <li> skin feels really smooth.</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt this smooth</li>

            <li> Not only is the product great, but the customer service is as well.  </li>
            <li> You would think being a 49 year-old woman that I would know how important exfoliation was.  </li>

            <li> My skin has never been this soft, never looked this good....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far superior to any of the exfoliating sponges you buy in the supermarkets</li>
            <li> For myself, I&#x27;m wondering if I might need the regular versus Lite, but was still incredibly impressed by how much &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; came out of my pores on my cheeks and nose.</li>
            <li> Definitely provides a good polish&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t doubt the reviews I read, but I wasn&#x27;t sure how easy it would be and the results on the first use.  </li>
            <li> I love exfoliation..used it right away..</li>
            <li> My skin felt so smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> I soaked in the tub and used long strokes using a good amount of pressure but didn&#x27;t get any better results than I would with a sugar scrub.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to read the detailed instructions, when followed it works exactly the way you want</li>
            <li> I do like this, it does a good job of shedding the skin, not an unbelievable job, but a good one.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend buying one of your own.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product was right for me, I have psoriasis (not really bad but</li>
            <li> put lotion on immediately after rinsing off my skin with cool water and my skin has stayed smooth and silky for five days so</li>
            <li> I generally take good care of myself..</li>
            <li> well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Still I was excited to try it.  </li>
            <li> Oh make sure to rinse it in hot water before each use.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Followed exact directions and was pleased with results.  </li>
            <li> but it DEFINITELY is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> The bath worked better for me on this than a hot shower.</li>
            <li> Had it shipped to my house because she was so excited to try it.</li>
            <li> this is ten times better than any of those and the more I use it the better the results.</li>
            <li> It is well worth it!</li>
            <li> Yes, it did take a while, but man was it worth it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the patience and the $50!</li>
            <li> The original names are &amp;#34;Turkish exfoliating gloves&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Korean cloths&amp;#34; which have been around for centuries...</li>
            <li> It was worth every penny!</li>
            <li> But I do love to look forward to using it after a steamy hot, relaxing bath.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price!  </li>
            <li> Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Just after the first use I feel more relaxed and cleaner.</li>
            <li> well worth the money!</li>
            <li> This is a unique product-</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used it and when I saw the skin peeling it was a bit overwhelming.....</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li> Worth the investment!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li> I had to clean out the tub</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll feel really clean.</li>
            <li> , I can honestly say that I am a total Baiden convert and won&#x27;t hesitate to gift this to friends in search of a better way to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too abrasive which I like and has helped the dry skin on my legs greatly.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, i love it so much</li>
            <li> As with many reviewers I experienced the dead skin rolls but the real bonus was how nice and fresh my skin felt afterwards.</li>
            <li> I realize why there are so many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I trusted the positive reviews on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the mitt one time so far and I&#x27;mvery pleased!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel ridiculously soft, and It&#x27;s fascinating watching the skin roll right off of you.</li>
            <li> I suppose that one side effect of all the exfoliation is if you want to keep all that newly discovered skin fresh and healthy you had better break out the sunscreen, Chapstick and Lubriderm ....</li>
            <li> My skin feels amazing, and if this weather ever warms up enough for me to bare any amount of skin, I&#x27;m sure it will look better too :)</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a special technique to achieving results with this mitt.  </li>
            <li> i am throwing away my loofas, special wash clothes, exfoliating creams and a dermabrasion machine.  </li>
            <li> i paid 50 use for a piece of cloth - theres nothing special about it.</li>
            <li> have a lot of blackheads/ingrowns that cover large areas of my skin &amp; this clears most of them away.</li>
            <li> I am excited to use the mitten again in a couple days (the seller said to use it once a week) because apparently the more you use it the more radiant</li>
            <li> I rub till my skin is bright red and nothing.  </li>
            <li> but so far, this thing is amazing.  </li>
            <li> To be fair, I am basing this review on one use of the Baiden Mitten, after following directions.</li>
            <li> Really helped my pores and blackheads and my legs have never looked better.</li>
            <li> I had to put a fair amount of pressure before I saw results, maybe everyone is different</li>
            <li> but you get a full page of instructions on how to get it to work, and you need these instructions.</li>
            <li> This is true whether you are using a Baiden mitt or a Korean Italy</li>
            <li> This is true whether you are using a Baiden mitt or a Korean Italy</li>
            <li> ALL of the pictures on the internet are true to this product.</li>
            <li> Someone actually asked me if I had had a laser treatment on my face because my skin looked so good.</li>
            <li> Ok, it costs too much</li>
            <li> Then, they provided me with step by step instructions on how to use the mitt, what to expect, what not to expect, how to care for the mitt, and what I needed to do after using the mitt to ensure that I got the full benefits of the mitt.  </li>
            <li> They were so genuinely concerned with making sure I understood the science behind the mitt and getting the full benefits that this incredible mitt has to offer.....</li>
            <li> ( REMEMBER not to rinse during the process, only after you&#x27;re done, otherwise it wouldn&#x27;t work as good)</li>
            <li> It exfoliates the body and face very well, better then any scrubs I tried</li>
            <li> and he has been loving how soft my skin is.</li>
            <li> Take good care of it and it should last a while.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so much smoother, softer and more even now -</li>
            <li> but I am getting good exfoliation, although not the miraculous entire body skin rolls like some people have reported.  </li>
            <li> Should have put more stock in the reviewers which basically said that it was highly overrated!  </li>
            <li> They were only fair...</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li> mitten is true to its claim for what it can do for the skin.</li>
            <li> but it looked so clean and felt super</li>
            <li> My skin is softer and more supple, and I really notice the difference in my face.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this mitten.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant about purchasing this product due to the cost, but after reading so many glowing reviews I decided to splurge &amp; I am so happy I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first took a very warm shower for about 10 mins, then I did a steam ( I have access to a private steam,</li>
            <li> In the process, it doesn&#x27;t look nice when you have these rolls of dead skin on you, and have to keep scrubbing, but once you&#x27;re done, the skin feels heavenly smooth!!</li>
            <li> The first time it does work, but as promised, it indeed works more thoroughly over time~ in 2 yrs, I will certainly be buying another one!</li>
            <li> After using this mitten, I now know why my lotions never &#x27;worked&#x27; - I was rubbing lotion over dead skin and what good does that do!?</li>
            <li> I think my technique was good, but maybe I could work on it a little more.</li>
            <li> my new \\&quot;loofa\\&quot; is here to stay! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> My older/wider thigh stretchmarks have improved smoothnessa lot, but not as quickly as the hips.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A fantastic natural product that makes your skin lovely....</li>
            <li> I definitely will recommend this product, and communication with seller has been exceptional.</li>
            <li> mitten has revolutionized my understanding of my skin and how to maximize smooth and soft and healthy glowing</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I then take a quick shower to rinse off and wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;-After</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve only used it once, I need some more time with my Baiden Mitten before I write more about it.</li>
            <li> I personally had no problems and Ilove, love, love my mitten....</li>
            <li> It does an awesome job at removing dead skin and making the skin soo much smoother.</li>
            <li> A fantastic natural product that makes your skin lovely....</li>
            <li> I have had excellent results from using this product, I use it almost daily to do a quick energize and weekly or bi-weekly for a deep exfoliation.</li>
            <li> but the customer follow-up was super.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and smooth and has never felt better.</li>
            <li> Sunspots,scars and stretchmarks are quickly fading</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s way and periodically receive e-mails to make sure I&#x27;m still satified with the product, I&#x27;m able to ask questions and get a quick response back, and they give hints/tips on usage.  </li>
            <li> Quite impressed at how well such simple cloth can exfoliate.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> And I have the most even tan of my life...and its more of a healthy glow; not freckled orange mess.  </li>
            <li> I love this mitten and highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love it and highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Very glad I finally ordered!</li>
            <li> which is very much improved (almost gone!)</li>
            <li> Make the water as hot as you can tolerate comfortably.  </li>
            <li> Make the water as hot as you can tolerate comfortably.  </li>
            <li> These people selling the &amp;#34;baiden mitten&amp;#34; pretty much bought the cheap versions of it, have created their own personal embroidery on it and are selling them for more than triple the price..</li>
            <li> I take a very hot shower without soap or anything &amp; after 15 minutes</li>
            <li> own a magnifying mirror that magnify s 20 times and has a light to really help you feel self conscious.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it it did make my skin smooth but didn&#x27;t come off peeling like the pictures you see online.</li>
            <li> My skin has not looked or felt this good in so long</li>
            <li> My tips: don&#x27;t scrub all willy nilly; use a good amount of pressure and make long even strokes.</li>
            <li> ( just wash it with a mild body wash, squeeze the water really good, and let it air dry)</li>
            <li> My skin has never been so smooth, soft and clean!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t honestly expect the mitten to do much to my skin other than prep it for a nice layer of tanner.  </li>
            <li> This is my new top gift.</li>
            <li> One of my New Years resolutions was to start taking better care of my skin, so I&#x27;m looking at this as an investment in my skin.</li>
            <li> This thing has to be dark magic, my skin looks and feels AMAZING</li>
            <li> The skin on my face now feel like &#x27;skin&#x27; and even the super tough places, i.e., feet, feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> I am not sorry!  </li>
            <li> I overall feel better!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> and when I saw the first rolls of dirt when I applied the mitten to my skin I was excited.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal!!</li>
            <li> So excited about this product, I might just toss most of my other exfoliants :)</li>
            <li> It does exactly what they say it does!</li>
            <li> If you want great results make sure no soap prior to using it and water is very hot so the dead skin will come off easy..</li>
            <li> So even though I soaked I believed i need to get squeaky clean first..</li>
            <li> After reading a million reviews and full feature articles about the Baiden Mitten on Refinery29, I finally got on top of purchasing one, and it is so worth the money!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s to last for two years or more, so I consider it a worthy investment!</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s simple and simply amazing.</li>
            <li> I finally got to use my Baiden, it really is amazing.</li>
            <li> and it really makes my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> As someone who already exfoliates regularly and uses products containing glycolic acid the Baiden Mitten wasn&#x27;t as amazing as everyone made it out to be.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the detailed guide.</li>
            <li> really get in there like the Korean Cloths since its gentle.&lt;br /&gt;-Only available on Amazon and the official site.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to see those rolls of dead skin come off.</li>
            <li> Even one that might be rare or exceptional(which</li>
            <li> I can say, is worth every penny and more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thank it was well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product is worth every penny..</li>
            <li> The more water I drink, the more lotion I use, the more coconut oil I use topically and internally, the dryer I get.  </li>
            <li> but I read review after review that it was worth the price.  </li>
            <li> It it Def worth the money...</li>
            <li> The mitten is a bit pricey, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> This is definately worth money.</li>
            <li> but well worth the effort.</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling smooth and feeling healthy.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey for what it is, but I think it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> I have a scar on my stomach and it almost completely vanished. :)</li>
            <li> I know have soft smooth skin I am comfortable in.</li>
            <li> Given that you have to soak until you are pruned, it isn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Personally, I&#x27;ve never had rolls of skin stripping off my body when using it, like others have said, but nonetheless it&#x27;s a nice product?</li>
            <li> Top that off with how SOFT my skin was after each treatment</li>
            <li> I know it is pricey, but with all of the use you will get out of it, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I use it weekly, and my skin looks and feels glowing, healthy and alive.</li>
            <li> Best purchase I have made in a long, long time.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Never had such a great exfoliation without a professional being involved.  </li>
            <li> I love how soft my skin feels after I use it.</li>
            <li> It is a well made product and worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> I go and get spray tans frequently in the summer and know matter how many exfoliants I purchased at the store</li>
            <li> am nearly 40 and love mine.  </li>
            <li> The mitten is worth the price.  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s worth it to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be discouraged by the price, it is worth ever dime.</li>
            <li> - so it is worth the price in that sense.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> and so far I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I hope to purchase another soon worth every penny of the price.</li>
            <li> The Baiden Mitten is one of those tools every individual should have handy.</li>
            <li> small investment is worth it for a life of beautiful skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I HAD to let everyone know that this purchase is so worth it.</li>
            <li> 100% worth the price</li>
            <li> I have been using it in the shower and had success on my sides- between the legs.</li>
            <li> Great for exfoliating, especially if you get spray tans frequently.</li>
            <li> Well worth the splurge.</li>
            <li> You do tend to get what you pay for, and in my opinion, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Well worth the $.</li>
            <li> I have tried the cheaper versions of this product and had some success but not to this extent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> ) Step into warm shower and wash with [[ASIN:B00EV1D79A Hibiclens Antimicrobial Skin Liquid Soap, 32 Fluid Ounce]], then rinse completely to ensure a clean and oil free surface to work</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited when I first discovered the Baiden Mitten, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this will pay for itself many times over in the amount of other treatments/procedures</li>
            <li> I take a quick shower first to get rid of and oil and dirt on my body</li>
            <li> Using this mitt makes your skin soft and silky and very clean.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this mitten to anyone who wants smoother, prettier skin - it&#x27;s well worth the price!</li>
            <li> You have to prep and do it just right and do it a lot to get the ball rolling so to speak.</li>
            <li> Took a minute to get it right</li>
            <li> Turns out I was doing everything right.</li>
            <li> but maybe I just haven&#x27;t quite figured out the right amount of pressure to use or how moist to keep my skin before a treatment.  </li>
            <li> comes right off.</li>
            <li> I stood up and put the Mitten on my right hand.  </li>
            <li> I have only used it twice so far and have had amazing results!  </li>
            <li> consistently (I hang mine in my shower to dry---and the visual of it is a nice reminder each time</li>
            <li> highly recommend to everyone to have it for your fabulous results.</li>
            <li> Baby soft, clean skin!  </li>
            <li> Amazing how much dead skin it  easily removed.</li>
            <li> The bath salts have worked great for me in the past</li>
            <li> The skin on my entire body is a lot shinier and more healthy-looking, and feels more alive.</li>
            <li> I was amazed of all the dead skin that came off, but most importantly my skin feels so smooth and looks rosy and healthier.  </li>
            <li> By the time I realized what was happening, the hot water had ran out and my bath was only slightly warm, instead of hot, like they advise, and I by no means was sweating like the product suggests.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend this product to anyone who wants healthy, soft skin!</li>
            <li> dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, while I have seen amazing results with dry skin, I am more excited to see what results I will achieve long term in regards to scaring, stretch marks and cellulite with this mitt.  </li>
            <li> I understood the concept behind the product and if it did work as good as stated it would be justified on spending the money for some good, long term skin care.</li>
            <li> I used it the day I received it, right after a hot shower.</li>
            <li> the Baiden mitten took it right off after the first use.</li>
            <li> At first I&#x27;m sure I didn&#x27;t do it right because no dead skin was coming off much.</li>
            <li> I thought I wouldn&#x27;t have much, being young and having very tight skin,but I did and it was awesome!</li>
            <li> Bonus, my skin feels amazing and my dry skin is diminishing.</li>
            <li> Its okay so far, not peeling no where as much as i would like to be.</li>
            <li> If your nail person just starts scrubbing on your dry feet, some comes off, but they don&#x27;t look nice at all.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking this would make a great Christmas present for female family members.</li>
            <li> With this product, the brand matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, make sure you soak in clean water for a while (don&#x27;t shampoo/condition/soap up, etc), step out of the water, and don&#x27;t towel dry before you start scrubbing.</li>
            <li> My skin has completely changed thanks to this magic mitten.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t because it&#x27;s irritated my skin so much that my nominally mild acne has worsened and the pores on portions of my body are getting clogged...</li>
            <li> /&gt;One thing that had vexed me was that I use an epilator to pull the hair out of my legs, but I could spend an hour and pull out every last hair and my legs would still not be smooth, so I&#x27;d have to follow up with shaving if I wanted a truly smooth leg.  </li>
            <li> The but put by 3M was just as good and much less.</li>
            <li> The key for the product to work effectively is very moist, warm skin.</li>
            <li> The top layer of dead cells is swept off as you rub and your skin breaths better</li>
            <li> Tons of gray rolled up skin fell from my body even though I had showered earlier that day, so it was great to see that all of that gross stuff was leaving my body.</li>
            <li> only problem I had was it wasn&#x27;t as easy as I expected and took me several times to understand the best way to use it is when you&#x27;re hot and sweaty..</li>
            <li> It still doesn&#x27;t look like much, but it certainly was well worth it!  </li>
            <li> I expected better results with no streaks after using this thing, but no!</li>
            <li> My skin is really smooth and soft!  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;The Baiden Mitten, a ‘Course Woven Cloth’, that left their skin “as Smooth as the Finest Silk”, was developed for the most powerful Ladies of Sultan Osman’s Harem.&amp;#34;  </li>

            <li> Following the helpful directions makes it so easy to use, my skin is silky smooth and feels especially soft.</li>
            <li> I was overwhelmed with the amount of dead grimy skin that came off what I thought was my clean body!!!  </li>
            <li> I was a little nervous because of the high price, but it really is a great product.</li>
            <li> It molded pretty quickly and I made sure to always hang dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying my Baiden Mitten very much and feel, finally, there is hope for my skin!</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend the product and this seller -- they&#x27;ve sent helpful tips on how to use the mitten and really want to make it a fabulous experience.</li>
            <li> just love knowing that my skin is all fresh and smooth with all dead layers removed.</li>
            <li> This worked the first time I used it and my skin just glowed.  </li>
            <li> When you first buy it you receive a lengthy email with the history and directions, it does take some prep.</li>
            <li> After the first use, the dryness seemed to diaappear.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to try anything to relieve some pain and minimize their appearance.</li>
            <li> I washed using Hibiclens in the shower, then took a hot bath for about 20 minutes before having a go with the moistened and wrung out mitt.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful, but too expensive.</li>
            <li> This is doing exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure after using the mitten on a regular basis</li>
            <li> Exfoliates really well!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it promises.  </li>
            <li> I have only exfoliated 2 times, and I am really pleased.  </li>
            <li> I can definitely see that this might well help with cellulite because many massage techniques to remove cellulite include pressure, rubbing in an area, etc.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in the softness in my skin the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and it worked for me the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Summer is coming and this is going to get me ready to put shorts on and show off my legs!  </li>
            <li> but it works exactly the way it says it will.</li>
            <li> I do think the price is pretty steep</li>
            <li> I just received my mitten and used it for the first time today.</li>
            <li> My skin is sooo soft and smooth</li>
            <li> The only thing I need more info on is why my face doesn&#x27;t peel when I use the Mitten on it.</li>
            <li> Like to keep the outside dirt-free and my mind in the gutter, always :)</li>
            <li> I have been an avid user of microdermabrasion cloths for years...</li>
            <li> The first time I used the mitten</li>
            <li> my skin felt cleaner, and softer after the first use.</li>
            <li> I do like the exfoliation I get from this mitten and how soft and smooth my skin is afterwards.  </li>
            <li> You must follow directions exactly in order to get results, so read the directions.</li>
            <li> What is left is smooth as a baby!</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions exactly</li>
            <li> /&gt;- The Korean Italy cloths can be found in a variety of different configurations, including a mitt, but the one I recommend also happens to be the cheapest and most ubiquitous:</li>

            <li> This product really delivers!</li>
            <li> It took forever to get the whole process done, but it was worth it,</li>
            <li> would just like to say that you should probably do this on a day off because the first time took me an hour.</li>
            <li> Only used this once as you aren&#x27;t suppose to use more than once a week.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me the first time either because I tried to rush the process.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely adore my Baiden Mitten!</li>
            <li> Thank you SO MUCH!</li>
            <li> Really works!</li>
            <li> I followed the directions/tips exactly</li>
            <li> and my skin has never felt so soft and smooth in my life.  </li>
            <li> This thing is magic and there is not cheaper item that will produce the same results.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you this was the first time trying both</li>
            <li> (*barf*)</li>
            <li> It puts my Clairsonic to shame, but I only use the Baiden on my face about once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not paid to write this!  :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a product that provided such immediate and healthy results.</li>
            <li> First, when I first ordered the mitt - they contacted me to let me know exactly what the mitt was all about</li>
            <li> at first, you might even get grossed out at what you are seeing</li>
            <li> you have to soak in a hot tub for 15-20 minutes, but when you do- the skin rolls off.</li>
            <li> This mitten seemed to work the first time.  </li>
            <li> At first when I saw the mitt, I was like &amp;#34;this is it?!&amp;#34</li>
            <li> A product that works exactly as promised, if used as directed.</li>
            <li> This really works!</li>
            <li> BUT!, the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> My skin definitely looked better.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s it, and my skin is soft and as smooth as glass.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll be interested to see if it reduces stretch marks as it promises.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be investing in more mittens.</li>
            <li> I like it because it makes my skin so soft and leaves it smooth.  </li>
            <li> sure that your body has heated up enough in the water.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing/gross how much skin you will exfoliate off your body!  </li>
            <li> but I would advise them to be patient and make sure they are following directions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed that this product does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> (This is my first review ever so bear with me)  </li>
            <li> So much to say about this product!</li>
            <li> Soak your body in hot/very warm water for about 10-15 minutes, no soap or anything on the body before exfoliation, wet the cloth and use pressure etc.</li>
            <li> Most times these are just claims that you hear on your local cable ads -- not to be believed--</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> I have used my Baiden Mitten for the first time and could not believe how softer my skin was with just the first use.  </li>
            <li> This worked exactly as advertised for me.</li>
            <li> Works exactly like</li>
            <li> One of my favorite u tubers, SugarPuffandFluff, from Sweden did a simple review of this mitten vs another cheaper version.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This thing really works!  </li>
            <li> I have used the mitt now for two weeks exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> It really worked for me!</li>
            <li> the first time i used it</li>
            <li> I found that using it on my body while I&#x27;m actually taking a shower works better than waiting until after my shower, except for my face.  </li>
            <li> but it definitely feels better to the touch</li>
            <li> My skin is now smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> and it feels like I&#x27;m actually getting into the top layers of the skin with it,</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s also really invigorating!</li>
            <li> The end result, after only one application, was astonishing.  </li>
            <li> I looked all over the Internet and found that on many different tanning forums people were saying the Baiden Mitten was a must.</li>
            <li> I will explain why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars after I rave about it first.  </li>
            <li> Used it for the first time yesterday.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an unbelievable product and everyone should own one!</li>
            <li> My skin is so much softer!</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time six days ago</li>
            <li> and I had to go to make an emergency dermatologist visit because not only does it appear that I have \\&quot;rug burn\\&quot; alllllllllll over my face, but the top layer of skin is basically gone in some areas of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really works well!</li>
            <li> Make sure you definitely follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> After a 90 degree NYC day, I went home and soaked in a hot tub for 10 minutes</li>
            <li> (I couldn&#x27;t stand any longer because it was so hot that day) and then used my mitten for the first time.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect with this mit!....</li>
            <li> soaking for about 15 minutes in a nice hot bath, I wet my Baiden Mitten and wrung it out.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stop feeling my skin - it was so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Opinion is entirely my own.n getting the most out of your Baiden</li>
            <li> I works really well!</li>
            <li> She has since ordered several more Baiden Mittens for all the girls in our family ( including inlaws).</li>
            <li> however it became evident that by adjusting the pressure to suit my skin type I would get a noticeable benefit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for almost a year now and it still works as well as when I first bought it.</li>
            <li> At first I was hesitant to spend this much on an exfoliating tool but it truly is worth the price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had mine a month, but after the two years&#x27; expiration date comes up on my Mitten, I will surely be buying another.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> Works exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I read the instructions well first.</li>
            <li> I live in Montana and am very fair skinned, so I wanted to buy some good self-tanner before I take a trip to the Virgin Islands and blind everyone with my white legs.  </li>
            <li> While the price may seem high, but the fact that you don&#x27;t have to purchase any exfoliating product makes up for it quickly.</li>
            <li> Easily took off many layers of dead skin, plus when used on the face</li>
            <li> I am SO happy to not experience dry skin even the next day!</li>
            <li> I have slightly mature skin, am fair complexioned, and have always suffered with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I can only imagine that with continued use, I will start to see even more positive results.  </li>
            <li> The second time though I wasn&#x27;t so impressed and felt like it didn&#x27;t really do anything, and the same with the third time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how much dead skin came off after the first use!</li>
            <li> Unique product that smoothes skin completely.  </li>
            <li> No complaints wish I would have purchased sooner well worth the money, it feels like you have new skin after using the mitten!</li>
            <li> I had a soft and fresh feeling right after first use...</li>
            <li> Really helps keep my arms soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I peel the skin off from neck to toe using as much pressure as I feel is necessary (more and for extended duration on stretchmarks).</li>
            <li> More than I&#x27;ve ever spent on a shower product, and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> So why or WHY I ask myself have I not been enjoying its benefits as much as I could have the last 2 years.</li>
            <li> I think it is because I take mostly showers and as a busy, busy mother</li>
            <li> This mitten is so good that I am not sure exactly how to describe it.  </li>
            <li> but the customer service was outstanding and very helpful with tips on how to properly use.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and it is well worth the price</li>
            <li> It is not a miracle cure but was completely worth the purchase price (even though that is high) when regarding the smoothness of my skin and the improvement in the stretchmarks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Yeah the price is bit high but worth it.</li>
            <li> At first I thought $50 for a bath mit was a little steep, but oh is it ever so much more than that!</li>
            <li> I thought the price was a little steep at first, but I absolutely love this!</li>
            <li> super soft and like it can breathe!</li>
            <li> I personally follow up my scrub with a light layer of coconut oil right before bed and use a lotion in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I personally follow up my scrub with a light layer of coconut oil right before bed and use a lotion in the morning.  </li>
            <li> After reading all the positive comments about the Baiden Mitten, I decided I wanted to try one.  </li>
            <li> This thing works exactly as promised and took an amazing amount of dead skin on my first use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (you want to be &amp;#34;sweaty&amp;#34;) and use straight strokes, not circles.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I throw pretty much anything at it</li>
            <li> You really notice a difference after your first use.</li>
            <li> Just soak in a hot shower or bath before hand, and then take a real shower afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just soak in a hot shower or bath before hand, and then take a real shower afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The reviews that say your skin becomes as soft as baby skin, it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li> Clearly some of the reviewers have never exfoliated - as it happens I use a body puff for light exfoliation with each shower and apparently that is quite adequate for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I got a detailed, honestly concerned for my satisfaction of this product email back,  in that email, she explained some other options that may work for me.</li>
            <li> Finally a product who&#x27;s marketing claims are 100% true!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use lotion after exfoliating with the Baiden Mitten and my skin is super soft.</li>
            <li> and my arms feel super soft.</li>
            <li> I applied slightly more pressure on my legs and arms and saw a lot of old-looking, dry skin come off.</li>
            <li> Afterward, my skin felt super soft and looked radiant.</li>
            <li> I rarely mention cost, but I want you to know that your purchase goes to support Turkish workers at a better than average wage with benefits.  </li>
            <li> But when I used the Baiden Mitten prior to my first spray tan last summer, I got the best results I had ever gotten and the spray tan lasted twice as long and looked so natural.</li>
            <li> My skin is super soft now.  </li>
            <li> It does nothing more than what my dry brushing or salt scrubs do.</li>
            <li> but then when you have sensitive skin that replenishes too quickly (that&#x27;s what psoriasis is)</li>
            <li> This is a super product that helps keep my skin soft and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> easy on your face and sensitive parts the first few times, just to be safe.</li>
            <li> I will certainly give it another try for a month and post any updates.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m certain it is just an adjustment in my technique that needs changing.</li>
            <li> and now I cannot live without it!!</li>
            <li> By the time the next morning came around my skin had returned to  its normal color, but still felt as soft and amazing as it had the night before.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to know that the Korean Italy cloths are available in varying levels of coarseness, and the color of the cloth typically denotes the level of coarseness:&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have dark scars and with regular use of the mitten they have lighten them more than chemical peels have!!</li>
            <li> but I can certainly rate it highly for now!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin from taking antihistamines for severe allergies most of my life.  </li>
            <li> It is so amazingly smooth and my fine lines are starting to fade (yeah!), but I&#x27;ve yet to see one tiny rolled up piece of skin come off my face when I use the Mitten.</li>
            <li> mitten is a bit hard to use, because it requires some manual labor and exertion for good results.</li>
            <li> This thing is tiring it is hard to get a good grab on your skin.</li>
            <li> My skin feels much smoother now, and I think with regular use I can achieve the smooth skin I have always trained.</li>
            <li> It is amazing how much dead skin you carry around yuk.</li>
            <li> If you follow the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions this mitt provides AMAZING results - takes some effort to get the hang of it and get the dead skin rolling off</li>
            <li> none of them really got the skin smooth enough.</li>
            <li> But it really made a difference to the skin appearance immediately..</li>
            <li> Really helped with my acne.</li>
            <li> my daughter raved about the mitten so much that I had to try it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> And it makes my skin feel Very bumpy.</li>
            <li> skin is sooooo soft too, definitely worth the investment</li>
            <li> That was a bit too much.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this thing to work.</li>
            <li> I really was hoping this would work.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, you need to really soak in the water before you use it.  </li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve received it and have seen my skin peel off and become so much smoother</li>
            <li> I was astonished at how much skin came off, even with gentle strokes.</li>
            <li> Very invigorating.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very helpful</li>
            <li> but I am really hopeful since it has lived up to</li>
            <li> They send you instructions which are very helpful.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t seen much in the way of results.</li>
            <li> Really lightweight.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than the bath gloves I have from The Body Shop, but this product is many times more expensive for only a marginal improvement.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t see a drastic improvement in my keratosis pilaris on the backs of my arms, which I was really hoping for.</li>
            <li> I used it on my whole body</li>
            <li> so see how much pressure works for you..</li>
            <li> This really is a miracle product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey but really does the job.</li>
            <li> It is way too much of a hassle.</li>
            <li> bought the mitten because I was worried about some premature wrinkles (on my forehead, around my nose and eyes) and some leathery-looking skin on my shoulders from being out in the sun too much without sunscreen, and scrubbing with the mitten</li>
            <li> Exfoliates very well and</li>
            <li> there was SO MUCH.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> The company is very helpful, providing lots of tips.  </li>
            <li> It is quite unusual to get that level of customer service these days.  </li>
            <li> As it turns out, they all came straight from Korea.</li>
            <li> This configuration is not as cheap as the smaller pocket that accepts the wash</li>
            <li> This configuration is not as cheap as the smaller pocket that accepts the wash</li>
            <li> Thanks Victoria</li>
            <li> Really like this mitten.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like having a pedi-egg for your whole body.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and absolutely nothing was removed.</li>
            <li> , money well spent I think:)</li>
            <li> Skin feels much softer.  </li>
            <li> I was absolutely amazed when I used it</li>
            <li> I cannot wait to continue to use it and really begin to see the effects.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Carla Marie from Z100 for re-sharing your post about it because otherwise I never would have found this product.  </li>
            <li> I also find that it really helps me with my clogged pores on my face.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with imitations, I&#x27;ve tried them and the Baiden is the real thing.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so much softer.  </li>
            <li> But, wow, the benefits and the glowing skin are so well worth it....</li>
            <li> but my skin is still very irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really works if you follow instructions.  </li>
            <li> it cost too much to so ineffective.</li>
            <li> but this thing really works and i had a lot of cynicism</li>
            <li> This mitten needs more research and buyers need to be careful with their investments.  </li>
            <li> but so far I think it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not working very well.  </li>
            <li> Absolute beauty supply staple.  </li>
            <li> And it should go without saying, but I&#x27;ll say it - the exfoliation smoothness lasts much longer than a shave.  </li>
            <li> but now I see that these are probably real customers.</li>
            <li> tips that I found very helpful:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be gentle when exfoliating your face, and don&#x27;t put too much pressure.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s an ongoing struggle trying to find products that help and really do as they say.</li>
            <li> I was blown away after the second use (the first time I didn&#x27;t use it correctly, but after paying better attention to the instructions and following them exactly)</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft (I rarely use moisturizer, and when I do just coconut) on my body after showering.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I paid so much</li>
            <li> The pocket also reshaped after one gentle use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need as much lotion after use either.</li>
            <li> This product absolutely works if you use it as described.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive/adult acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> The instructions and follow up by the seller have been very helpful.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so much softer and smoother now.</li>
            <li> Even though I saw the pictures, I was still amazed how much came off on me.  </li>
            <li> Im there)you really will make a difference in your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There is a bit of a learning curve and I still haven&#x27;t really mastered it</li>
            <li> My legs are now much smoother and the ingrown hairs are improving.  </li>
            <li> and my skin responded really well -</li>
            <li> It is very flexible when it is damp &amp; fits my hand nicely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You really have to see it to believe it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about six months and my skin is much, much smoother.</li>
            <li> Really like the product.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m for real.</li>
            <li> I really like the packaging, too.</li>
            <li> and it works really well.</li>
            <li> My skin felt sooo smooth, especially after putting on coconut oil after I was done.  </li>
            <li> Eventually I&#x27;ll be able to scrub harder.</li>
            <li> felt the intense feeling of \\&quot;ohhhhh</li>
            <li> This ensures that your skin is really moist.</li>
            <li> The usage tips and seller follow-up are greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> but the seller is very committed to providing education, tips etc.</li>
            <li> Skin is much smoother, even without lotion.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin smooth and younger looking.</li>
            <li> and I can really tell the difference.</li>
            <li> The instructions that were sent to my email address were very informative also.  </li>
            <li> My skin had never felt so smooth in my entire life.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li> The Baiden Mitten keeps my skin soft and fully exfoliated so that the lotion can be fully absorbed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the hunt for a product to make my skin as smooth as possible, I was intrigued.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Her skin improved very noticeable.</li>
            <li> so much healthier.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it gently on my face and neck every time I shower, and once a week I do my whole body after soaking in a bath.</li>
            <li> Speaking personally, this is an important feature, as both the cloth and the mitt MUST capture lots of DNA (aka, dead skin) in its crevices, so I would most definitely want to be able to wash it.</li>
            <li> It does what it says it will in getting rid of dead skin,  and does so rather effectively.</li>
            <li> smell after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;-Still effective after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;-Comes with handy dandy directions and tips.&lt;br /&gt;-Comes with a coupon.&lt;br /&gt;-60</li>
            <li> as effective after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t take enough time for me and a nice, long hot bath.</li>
            <li> Using this is *extremely* gross and *extremely* satisfying, and my skin afterwards is soft as a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li> It also took me several tries of using it on my face before I got a good exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> Is it worth the cost when you think of how much you would pay for professional exfoliating - YES.  </li>
            <li> I own several high-tech facial cleaners, etc., and they do not work as well as this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it about 2 times so far and love the results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once and did in fact feel nice results for several days after, so</li>
            <li> Well worth the money with better results than a single spa treatment and will last much, much longer!</li>
            <li> Works exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quickly and was followed by additional email instructions to ensure proper use.</li>
            <li> After a quick hot shower, I tried the mitten and was amazed when my skin actually started sloughing off.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t disappointed at all, it&#x27;s super awesome!  </li>
            <li> The area around my lips that was starting to show signs of aging is beginning to be much more smooth, as well as the fine lines from the corner of my lips down seem to be disappearing and the sagging jaw line is actually tightening.</li>
            <li> I felt like a new woman after that bath and getting rid of all the yucky stuff still on my skin even after a hot shower.</li>
            <li> It also seems very durable and well-made, so the length of time I&#x27;ll have it for definitely makes it worth the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve long believed in exfoliation and have used such a skin care regime regularly for many years, using the &amp;#34;bath glove&amp;#34; found in most any store, and micro dermabrasion by an aesthetician on occasion.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first, but she was very enthusiastic about the mitten&#x27;s positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> It also does a better job than any other product of removing sunless tans.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure it will last several years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not any better than other exfoliating gloves I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Not exactly making the situation better.</li>
            <li> , I draw a very hot bath that I can barely tolerate getting in to.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was such a breath of fresh air!  </li>
            <li> I figured it was safe to move to other parts of my body.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this mitten for anyone looking for smoother skin, improved appearance of stretchmarks, or just an actually effective way to slough of dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> My skin stays super soft with a little love from this mitten.</li>
            <li> It made my skin tender, especially in the region with the stretch marks at first, but the resulting fresh-feeling skin was worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, make sure to buy a Baiden name brand mitten (this exact product) and not a cheap knockoff.</li>
            <li> Only reason I gave this product 4 stars is because I just used the mitten once and after a couple of weeks, I find my skin dryer than before as if my skin feels more bare and unprotected.  </li>
            <li> , you have nothing to loose and some lovely soft skin to gain !</li>
            <li> You do have to be very gentle if you have sensitive skin like I do.</li>
            <li> It may seem a bit pricy at first, but if you consider buying exfoliates in a bottle, then using them every day, this mitten will last for years, where as a bottle of exfoliate will only last a few months at best.  </li>
            <li> Wow, this thing really works!  </li>
            <li> Also, I soak in a hot shower and then do my arms and torso, but I&#x27;ve found that that&#x27;s not quite enough hot steamy water for my legs to be ready for exfoliating, so if I&#x27;ve got time I&#x27;ll draw a bath and sit in that to do my legs.</li>
            <li> I had dark sun spots on my face, and most noticably on my chest.  </li>
            <li> Do not fall for these cheap imitations - I have use a few of them myself and can tell you that they do not exfoliate any better than a regular loofah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do not fall for these cheap imitations - I have use a few of them myself and can tell you that they do not exfoliate any better than a regular loofah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really follow the directions as well as I wanted to because while I was filling the tub with hot water, I didn&#x27;t realize that the drain plug was not all the way down and therefore was letting a ton of water out of my huge garden tub.  </li>
            <li> I am naturally pale and have very sensitive skin but the Baiden Mitten works amazingly.</li>
            <li> The first time, following the instructions, which are comprehensive and easy to follow, I only used it lightly - probably too lightly, so the second time I scrubbed harder</li>
            <li> Normally, my self tans come out fine sometimes a minor streak or two that I can fix.</li>
            <li> Better than any other I have ever purchased!</li>
            <li> After about 3 tries I finally found the right combo of techniques and my skin looks much better for it.  </li>
            <li> It has also helped smooth my lips and make my eyes look no so dry.</li>
            <li> On the areas with stretchmarks I run the mitten back and forth following alongthe indentation lines that had formed on my hips and thighs, finding this to be the most effective.&lt;br /&gt;[Initially</li>
            <li> What I do next is soak in a hot bath as hot as you can take it.</li>
            <li> The mitten even smoothed out my lips, which have always been chapped, and I think they are even plumper than before--which says a lot as they have been getting thinner and thinner as I get older.</li>
            <li> You really need to get that top layer of dead skin hydrated for it to roll off correctly.</li>
            <li> Blue is the most coarse, for heavy-duty sloughing on the tougher parts of your body, like arms and legs.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, if you wear lotions or creams, you might actually want to take a quick shower with soap BEFORE SOAKING IN THE TUB, to wash the lotion off.  </li>
            <li> Since there are so many different configurations of the KI cloth, I&#x27;ve also spotted KI pockets that are larger in size, for you to insert your hand into, like the Baiden.  </li>

            <li> I am super prone to ingrown hairs on my legs and arms especially.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use it again the very next day because im sure that there were spots that I missed but decided to follow protocol and wait until the next week.</li>
            <li> Really does take off te dead skin. :-)</li>
            <li> My face feels as brand-new-baby-like-butter-soft as my body does and the expensive moisturizers and lotions that I pay top dollar for literally absorb into my face and body and are able to do their job.</li>
            <li> I seem to have had better results the first time I used it, with a small amount of pencil eraser sized rolls on the floor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After following the instructions to soak in a very hot tub for 10 to 15 minutes I started exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> When exfoliating, be sure to soak in a tub of hot water for at least 1/2 hr (until your fingers and toes are pruned) before exfoliating, or your skin might not slough off as much as you&#x27;d like.</li>

            <li> After using it for the first time I could not believe how much dead skin came rolling off and how soft and smooth my skin was after and still is!</li>
            <li> more using harsh chemicals trying to fight dry skin, sun damage and fine lines.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to everyone...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product -</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve seen some that are sold here on Amazon for $8 or $9 and as high as $20, depending on the configuration and quantity...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Baiden mitt.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I read about it in an xoJane review, and I had high expectations.</li>
            <li> It works just like everyone says, and I recommend this product highly-</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend the mitten.</li>
            <li> The Baiden came highly recommended</li>
            <li> I operate a Mobile Spray Tan business, and I highly recommend my clients to get this mitten.</li>
            <li> I truely HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Baiden Mitten everyone.  </li>
            <li> and I was really, really surprised when the next day I noticed that my shoulders were very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> waited a little more than a week to treat again.  </li>
            <li> WOW!!  </li>
            <li> Wow, what a difference!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;- When laundering the cloth, although it&#x27;s okay to throw it into any load, keep in mind that fabric softener might neutralize a little bit of its coarseness.  </li>

            <li> My skin has never been this soft!!</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft!!  </li>
            <li> I use it once a week or up to every other day and its still going strong after almost a year of use...</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly for two reasons, I have been experiencing more and more ingrown hairs on my legs lately, and because my face has become extremely rough this winter.  </li>
            <li> I have keretosis pilaris and I feel like it&#x27;s really helping me shed that unwanted skin that just won&#x27;t shed naturally.</li>
            <li> Great for a fake tanning preparation too.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin so soft, really does what it claims.</li>
            <li> Thinking that if my body was drier, the mitten could get better traction and pick-up all those dead skin cells eagerly waiting to be sloughed away.    </li>
            <li> I bought a cheap one first and wasted $10 USD on a subpar product.</li>
            <li> Just like with the Baiden mitten, you should be able to roll strings of dead skin off of your skin surface as you do this.</li>
            <li> Just like with the Baiden mitten, you should be able to roll strings of dead skin off of your skin surface as you do this.</li>
            <li> My legs are quite stubborn so hopefully after a few more mitten treatments, they will start to cooperate.</li>
            <li> It removes layers and layers of dead skin revealing polished healthy skin that glows.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s still well worth the money, as the products will last up to 2 years</li>
            <li> but I am sure that will fade in a few hours.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for the few strechmarks I have, and use it every week and every week my strechmarks are blending into my skin tone even more.</li>
            <li> I purchased a few more to give as gifts to my sister and sister in law.  </li>
            <li> It always felt to me like I was putting on moisturizer and lotions on over top of dead skin.</li>
            <li> ; True to the old adage, &#x27;quality not quantity&#x27;, this mitten will no doubt be the last exfoliation product I will ever need or buy.</li>
            <li> Its rare that a product like this actually lives up to the hype -</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to using it once a week, and will apply body lotion as I normally do after showering.</li>
            <li> worth every penny and will last me 2 yrs.</li>
            <li> I was told that the Epsom salts would help to soften the dead skin layer so the mitt would work better.  </li>
            <li> After I was done completely I rinsed my body and the mitten and applied extra virgin coconut oil to my body and sweet almond oil to my face.</li>
            <li> the people behind this product truly know what providing superior customer service is all about.  </li>
            <li> This secret was just too good to keep to my self.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of body brushing, but this goes to a whole new level of regeneration, circulation, soft glowing skin.  </li>
            <li> I found out there were other mittens made the same and are just as good, so do your homework prior to purchasing this.  </li>
            <li> Instructions state to use plain water (soaps and oils will make your body to slippery and the Baiden will not be able to grip the skin).</li>
            <li> I do this for about 5 minutes all over my arm and hand, then I move to my right arm, my chest, my neck, face, back, legs, belly, thighs, then my bum.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Before I got this mitten I watched a YouTube video about how o properly use this and what you should/should not do to get results, because if you&#x27;re not doing it right, like waxing, the results can hurt or be unsatisfactory.</li>
            <li> Gross, right?</li>
            <li> Left and right.</li>
            <li> My super dry &amp;#34;bartender&amp;#34; hands and my whole body were sooooo soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> I also have very pliable skin as in its not very firm.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how long the mitt will last, but I am quite satisfied with its results so far.</li>
            <li> I think this product actually works, however I&#x27;m sure you could get it at a much cheaper price, this is definitely not worth $50.</li>
            <li> In my opinion it&#x27;s high for a mitten, they should sell it for no more then $20, then more people would buy it.</li>
            <li> Check out this youtube video of how to use your new mitten:  </li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t new marks.  </li>
            <li> This is my new weekly exfoliating regimen.</li>
            <li> I feel like weight has been lifted off my body and feel like a new person.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this thing.</li>
            <li> My wife purchased this item for herself and now can&#x27;t live without one.</li>
            <li> I was able to remove all of the old dead skin cells every day, which made my skin look new and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> My super dry hand are improved, everything.</li>
            <li> It will likely replace my aesthetician ...except that I so enjoy the facial experience.</li>
            <li> I used it much more gently on my face and found my skin to be slightly brighter the following day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough to use on the whole body.</li>
            <li> , this Baiden mitten really does something no other product I&#x27;ve tried does.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do not be fooled no other mitten is like the Baiden Mitten this product really works.</li>
            <li> First of all, the fact that you can actually SEE the dead skin coming off of your body is not only amazing, but the way your body feels after is another.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to anyone that loves the feeling of having silky soft skin.</li>
            <li> They are both at the point where they are very conscious about caring for their skin</li>
            <li> I confirmed with my husband, who was shocked too, that yes, my stretch marks had been much more noticeable then before my first use!  </li>
            <li> It never did what it claimed which was lift the top light surface of dead skin, rolling it up in little balls, even after soaking for 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I used this for the first time over the weekend and my skin feels very soft and I definitely notice a difference in the way my skin looks.</li>
            <li> After seeing some of the videos and &amp;#34;satisfied customers,&amp;#34; I thought this would be one of my answers to beautiful skin, but it&#x27;s a disappointment........</li>
            <li> Pain (Many people who have been affected by stretchmarks have constant pain/sensitivity associated with what are essentially tears in the skin, I am definitely one of those individuals.</li>
            <li> With the consistent use of this product and proper moisturizers I see that I&#x27;m improving the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> At first i bought a cheaper mittin claiming it gave the same results as baiden mittin..</li>
            <li> It is pricey, but if it lasts as long as claimed, it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> her skin is so soft!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know exactly why this is so different, but boy, it worked.  </li>
            <li> I was worried that I was going to throw away 50 dollars to the trash, but I was happily surprised that it works!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I don&#x27;t think  i had done it correctly since I used an exfoliating scrub 2 days prior receiving this.</li>
            <li> The website is not slick but don&#x27;t let that throw you off.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I bought the exact same thing off ebay for £5.99.</li>
            <li> My skin is softer than ever before, and has a healthy glow to it now after just a few uses!</li>
            <li> It needs to be hot for it too work properly.  </li>
            <li> I have less fine lines on my forehead</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> , it seems to get a lot more skin off than the Korean cloths (but I&#x27;m not exactly sure about this since its been a while since I have used the Korean cloths.</li>
            <li> I have been able to stop using other products by simply using this&lt;br /&gt;Mitten!!!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Baby soft skin!  </li>
            <li> My skin is so soft!</li>
            <li> Baiden Mitten- has a unique woven design that separates it from other mitts on the market.</li>
            <li> I have used it twice so far and each time it has worked like a charm!  </li>
            <li> I just got it in the mail yesterday and used it for the first time last night.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Its insanely soft!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of shocking how much skin comes off, but in a good way.</li>
            <li> A shave would keep the legs smooth for a day and by the next day there would be some roughness (clearly since there was still many layers of dry dead skin).  </li>
            <li> and this is the ONLY thing that will work to get the old tan off!!!!  </li>
            <li> Yes, the pulled out hairs would last much longer VISIBLY, but to have the smooth touchable legs - that meant a second step, or live with a certain rough bumpiness - like the epilation sort of roughed up the skin when pulling out the hairs, raised up bumps where the hair follicles</li>
            <li> This item is a little bit pricey, but after your first use, you will realize that it was worth every penny..</li>
            <li> Her skin is as soft as a new born baby.</li>
            <li> My cousin recommended the baiden mitten and I was skeptical at first, but it&#x27;s really amazing.  </li>
            <li> I looked for a long time to find something to help smooth my skin, shrink my pores and improve the overall appearance of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered with psoriasis for years, and after having scaly skin for so long, I didn&#x27;t think it was possible for it to feel smooth ever again.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would spend again, but overall it&#x27;s a nice addition to my beauty routine.</li>
            <li> This product is worth every single penny.  </li>
            <li> Worth every single penny.</li>
            <li> Learn how to use it (long soak or end of shower, damp not wet skin, long stokes not circles) and you will be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I did not give it a full 5 stars because the price is too extreme.  </li>
            <li> nothing happened at first, but I pressed harder and after a few more scrubs...</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 33), my pores are less visible and the texture of my skin is completely different and better.  </li>
            <li> I prefer to take a hot shower and let my skin get soft, then turn the water off, damp the mitten in the hot water and start scrubbing in the up and down motion.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, follow directions, and you&#x27;ll have smooth, soft skin like you&#x27;ve never experienced!</li>
            <li> I have the Clarisonic Mia and Classic but since receiving this they have barely been picked up.</li>
            <li> It really does roll away the top layer of dead, dry skin.</li>
            <li> This over priced rag, I mean, \\&quot;mitten\\&quot; will probably be the most useful to someone who has never ever exfoliated their skin in their lives, and are generally ignorant of such beauty rituals.</li>
            <li> My dead, dry skin rolled off easily after a hot shower.</li>
            <li> my original post, a few people commented that they&#x27;d tried the Korean Italy cloth and found it far too harsh for their skin, and several did not feel the KI cloths were suitable for exfoliating the face.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember how I actually stumbled on this little gem, but my skin is so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a slight change on my arms and a significant change on my legs.</li>
            <li> This is a little gross, but I really love using it under my armpits.  </li>
            <li> I was not scrubbing at all hard, nor was I using it more than suggested by the user information included with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been spray tanning (which this helps with tremendously), but the mitten is now getting a brown tint due to exfoliating the tanner.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that using small up &amp; down movements with a little force works the best.  </li>
            <li> Those pictures with huge bits of dead skin coming off?</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin and thus exfoliating scrubs don&#x27;t work very well for me, but I had no issues with this causing any lasting irritation or skin damage.</li>
            <li> I am genuinely surprised at how much dead skin was on my Baiden mitt,  my skin feels smooth and rejuvenated.  </li>
            <li> The dead skin rolled off me as promised and my skin feels baby smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Although I had apprehensions about buying such an expensive mitt, I did want to try it and do everything she had done to get that great tan.  </li>
            <li> ITS CLEARLY OVERPRICED.&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li> so the price seems worth it if indeed it lasts the two or more years they say it will as during that time I would have spent at least $300.00 on scrubs compared to $50.00 on this.</li>
            <li> My skin feels silky soft and elastic after I use it.  </li>
            <li> so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Anywho, so far, this is a bust.</li>
            <li> It does make your t skin so soft.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and I&#x27;m not even having to moisturize 5x a day like I used to.</li>
            <li> Your tan will last much longer now.  </li>
            <li> I also really appreciate the personal customer service of the seller.</li>
            <li> It has helped clear her skin and WOW</li>
            <li> I felt baby skin soft.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money</li>
            <li> When I get my WOW moment I will let you know.</li>
            <li> But I think they do look naturally plumber....)</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and I&#x27;m already beginning to see the fading of some impurities on my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is amazingly soft now.</li>
            <li> And the craziest thing is that my youngest is already 6 years old.  </li>
            <li> I know everyone says they&#x27;re surprised by the amount of skin that comes off, but holy cats, I had no idea</li>
            <li> My Korean mom used to call it &amp;#34;shining&amp;#34; her skin, and she swore it was the reason her skin was so soft.</li>
            <li> My Korean mom used to call it &amp;#34;shining&amp;#34; her skin, and she swore it was the reason her skin was so soft.</li>
            <li> Skin feels really soft after use.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I simply did not need much exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> within second the mit was removing a ton of dead old skin:)</li>
            <li> I am a middle aged guy who is trying to keep a younger look about me and take care of myself a bit more.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I&#x27;m surprised at how soft my skin is</li>
            <li> old, nothing compares to the difference I&#x27;ve seen since purchasing and using the Baiden Mitten.</li>
            <li> My skin is literally glowing and SO SOFT.</li>
            <li> and then gave me a complete history about the mitt.  </li>
            <li> or a detox pore brush if u have sensitive</li>
            <li> I was surprised by this product.</li>
            <li> I am completely done, I spritz myself with rosewater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Then I&#x27;m amazed at how soft my skin is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : slough off old skin.</li>
            <li> The seller contacted me several times and seemed very concerned with everything being correct and to my liking.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Skin isn&#x27;t as soft as the Korean Italy</li>
            <li> Fast forward 2 years to a month ago, and low and behold</li>
            <li> My skin is so sensitive (yet oily)</li>
            <li> Used it on my 51 year old face, and bam...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the mitten for almost a year and keep it in my shower to use frequently.  </li>
            <li> I am 35 years old and a natural redhead</li>
            <li> I used sensitive skin lotion and cleansers, nothing was working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so far I like it.  </li>
            <li> My knees and elbows are so soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on my legs and arms and it is definitely an intense exfoliator, above any I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> and so far I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I will never waste my time or money on those again.  </li>
            <li> so they can feel how soft they are!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also when the tan starts to naturally exfoliate I use the mitten to even it out so it doesn&#x27;t look so splotchy...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice now and my skin is so soft</li>
            <li> i surprised .</li>
            <li> In my experience you do not need to stay in the shower under hot water for too long.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have had some rashes using scrubs.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> If you want to be all soft and feeling refreshed, this is the product you want to use.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin slightly sensitive if I do it</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt so soft in my life and even my husband commented on how soft my skin was.</li>
            <li> It does say to be weary of the amount of pressure you use in sensitive skin areas, but does not explicitly state a duration of time for use or how to use on your face....</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> This is a low-tech device requiring no batteries and made from natural fibers.</li>
            <li> completely \\&quot;shed.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right before the wedding we all decided to do spray-on tanning.  </li>
            <li> I am totally investing in the whole package now.</li>
            <li> Those with sensitive skin would be advised to ease into a routine.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;It has left my skin softer and much cleaner than the every day cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I am into health and this would really be a bonus especially to get rid of toxins in my body!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> your face for last, once you get the hang of using the mitten on your body, and get a feel for how much pressure you should use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> your face for last, once you get the hang of using the mitten on your body, and get a feel for how much pressure you should use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Each mitt lasts me about 8 months (I use it about once a week, and I replace my mitts before they wear out completely).</li>
            <li> it did not work very well and where it did, my skin became very red (which it warned about in the directions)</li>
            <li> So far it is working well.  </li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t ever been so soft.  </li>
            <li> My husband notices how soft it is, too.  </li>
            <li> After each use, their skin is silky soft.</li>
            <li> (haha it sounds so gross</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t surprised.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s baby soft in areas where were so course and bumpy.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a year now, and my overall skin quality has improved so much.</li>
            <li> The results you get from this are so far beyond what you get from a loofah or a scrub, once you try this</li>
            <li> My skin was so soft after just one use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now may 20th and the mitt is coming apart at the seams, and I haven&#x27;t used it that much, was away for 5weeks during this time, and no one else is at my home,</li>
            <li> It feels baby soft.</li>
            <li> There is a creepy yet awesome satisfaction in seeing all the rolls of dead skin that accumulate on the mitt, skin and shower floor.</li>
            <li> second time I used it, I didn&#x27;t exfoliate before, so a lot more dead skin rolled off.</li>
            <li> I have only had the opportunity to use this mitt once and hope to become more proficient removing dead skin.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good but very expensive.</li>
            <li> While the exfoliation causes super sensitivity initially in the stretchmarks, along with temporary raised red bumps along the lines in my case, in the long term my scars do not hurt as much or often as they did before I started use of the mitten.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that first phase of dry old wrinkled skin)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a pretty obsessive about exfoliation; I used to dry brush every morning, use a clarisonic on my face, and exfoliating gloves in the shower.</li>
            <li> It never fails that every time I do the scrub, I think I&#x27;m a beast until I dry off.</li>
            <li> I was dubious about spending $50 on such a simple little product, but I have keratosis pilaris on my arms and dry, itchy skin all over and after seeing so many bloggers rave about it, I decided it would be worth a try since I could always return it.</li>
            <li> Since going through menopause, I developed little bumps on my skin and this mitten has really made it so much smoother!  </li>
            <li> When you first use your mitten and start rubbing make sure your skin in slightly wet but not too wet, there needs to be some friction to make the skin roll..if you start off too wet it wont work.</li>
            <li> I can only say to those who are curious give it a shot, you have nothing to loose and some lovely soft skin to gain !</li>
            <li> I tried to contact Baiden Mitten directly to ask about this, but when you click on the contact link on the main web page, there is no actual way to contact.  </li>
            <li> I was using like sandpaper, quick up and down motions.  </li>
            <li> They were excited to get new ones in their Christmas stockings this past Christmas.</li>
            <li> You have to soak in a HOT bath for a while to get your skin loose.</li>
            <li> Seriously, the Sahara Dessert has more moisture than I do.  </li>
            <li> Then once the tub is all drained I clean it off all the dead skin from the bottom of the tub (and trust me there will be a lot).</li>
            <li> My skin seriously looks and feels much better.</li>
            <li> The second time I used it, I didn&#x27;t see quite the same results as I did the first time.</li>
            <li> I tried it the first time and the next day, ran errands with no makeup, but had total confidence in my appearance because of the mitten.</li>
            <li> After the first use I noticed my skin was softer, but after a few week my skin has become much softer and lighter.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t get sucked into things that aren&#x27;t mainstream because I feel that I can&#x27;t always be sure the company or product is trusted, which is why I tend to stick to shopping at big beauty chains like Sephora and Ulta for my beauty supplies/tools.</li>
            <li> Stretch marks started to fade in appearance, small wrinkles at the corners of my eyes diminished and the overall look of my skin got better.</li>
            <li> I bought this product mainly for my Keratosis Pilaris that I have in the back of my arms and thighs</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also the most skeptical person on the planet - when I first read about the Mitten,</li>
            <li> Skin was very smooth after first usage, but a little dryer than usual.  </li>
            <li> I have some cellulite on the back of my legs (who doesn&#x27;t?), some serious abdominal scars from having my gallbladder removed, and some light stretch marks from getting tall very fast.</li>
            <li> I highly doubt the material used to create this product was so pricey that it could only be profitable to the seller to charge $50.00.</li>
            <li> I definitely thought the price was rather high going into it</li>
            <li> All in all I LOVE this product, but since its so expensive I will only recommend it to people who really want an intense exfoliating treatment.</li>
            <li> I searched high and low online -</li>
            <li> If you have trouble with stretchmarks, cellulite or dry skin, you will love this.</li>
            <li> (I would definitely suggest doing it in the tub so that you can easily wipe up the dead skin when done.)</li>
            <li> Pink is mild coarseness, and what I&#x27;ve used on my face personally to exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;d)</li>
            <li> actually replied to the seller&#x27;s email asking me if I&#x27;d received my mitten and explained that I received a huge gigantic ouchie mess of face from the mitten.</li>
            <li> results the first couple of tries, but</li>
            <li> I sat in a hot bath for 10 minutes with the shower curtain closed, exhaust fan off.</li>
            <li> My skin has always been dull and now it is FULL OF LIFE!</li>
            <li> Yellow comes with one side in mild coarseness, the other is medium.&lt;br /&gt;ii)</li>
            <li> I live in Minnesota and it is the middle of winter.</li>
            <li> I bought a new razor and only used each razor head a few times, I made exfoliation scrubs, which were effective but messy and too time consuming to do as often as needed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been really helpful for my dry skin</li>
            <li> I have seen my skin become healthier, less dry, and altogether better, especially my arms and face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with KP and dry skin my whole life, so</li>
            <li> as long as one spends about 15 minutes in an enclosed space with the buildup of hot steam, the warmer/hot (not scalding) water was essential in my case.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would imagine that just about any Korean who might stumble upon this product might have the exact same thought process as I did.  </li>
            <li> I would imagine that just about any Korean who might stumble upon this product might have the exact same thought process as I did.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but it really works, unlike so many product promises.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> [take a hot steamy shower] long enough?</li>
            <li> I use the mitt in a saltwater bath once a week for a deep exfoliation treatment the rest of the week I gently use this and the facial one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to sound like an infomercial, but every layer of dead skin that I exfoliated, layers of younger looking skin appeared.  </li>
            <li> I do use fake tanners so this comes in handy when you need to prep or slough off old tan.</li>
            <li> My young adult daughters have been using Baiden Mittens for several years now.</li>
            <li> I was initially put off by the $50 price tag of what I considered to be one very pricey loofa, but I thought what the heck, I&#x27;ll try it since it has a money back guarantee.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the mitten once so far, but WOW</li>
            <li> with all of it&#x27;s good reviews on Amazon, I thought it was a total fake.</li>
            <li> Skin began to literally roll right off my leg, and fall down into the tub.</li>
            <li> Love seeing those gross little rolls of dead skin, and it&#x27;s really improving the bumps on my arms.</li>
            <li> The next morning the bumps were almost completely gone!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re called Korean Italy cloths, for some strange reason, and as I read on further about how the Baiden would roll off strings of dead skin after a soak in a hot tub, I already knew that the Korean cloths did that as well--very effectively, in fact, and for a helluva lot less money--so, I sent my Baiden back without even trying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is supposed to last about two years, so if you break it down you really aren&#x27;t paying all that much for the type of results you will get.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned that I wasn&#x27;t using it properly, but after some tweaking of technique I was able to get the visible dead skin rolls, but only from my underarm area while everywhere else stayed the same.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this mitten for the very elderly or (maybe some) disabled folks, or just anyone who isn&#x27;t physically fit enough to rub their body pretty hard.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the material has changed, but the fabric of my new mitten feels much thinner and less durable.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but definitely worth</li>
            <li> I was a little unsure if it was worth the price</li>
            <li> This is basically a Turkish Hammam bath mitt, purchasable in Turkey for less than $5 and surely in America for less than $10.</li>
            <li> Then jumped into a tub of very hot *plain water for 25 minutes.     </li>
            <li> , because no other exfoliation has proven effective, I admit I was beyond skeptical when I ordered this product.  </li>
            <li> noticed very little skin came off my face, but I didn&#x27;t really soak my face and I use a gentle exfoliating scrub throughout the week</li>
            <li> The back of my arms are usually bumpy, but are now smooth after one use.</li>
            <li> If this were much cheaper, I wouldn&#x27;t mind, but this not worth anything near the price.</li>
            <li> After dousing the Baiden Mitten in warm/hot water wring it out then using forward/backward or side/side motions (essential to see results, circular motions are completely ineffective)</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft, but it probably would anyway if I turned off the water in the shower and used my gloves for the same length of time.     </li>
            <li> Maybe I will look around and see if there is some specific instructions for technique because so far it has been a time, money and effort waster at my house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used it three times.  </li>
            <li> My whole life my shoulder area has been slightly rough and bumpy.  </li>
            <li> Just had a professional facial at</li>
            <li> I towel-dried my skin (after not carefully reading the instructions)</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it did actually help with those things.</li>
            <li> Trick is to scrub with a deodorant soap first face and all then soak in hot bath for at least ten minutes then scrub with baiden,</li>
            <li> second reason to consider the Korean Italy cloth is that it is completely machine washable, and lasts for YEARS.  </li>
            <li> I exfoliated my face as well as legs, arms, stomach, and back and didn&#x27;t see too much result from my face, but it&#x27;s only been one exfoliation, so maybe next time.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft &amp; silky and I&#x27;ve only been using it three weeks.</li>
            <li> It has helped almost completely rid me of  my ingrown hair problem after only a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> It will blow you away - its like going to a European masseuse and getting a complete body detoxing massage -</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll get the same results with a loofa from body shop or like the early comment</li>
            <li> So, the question remains why did they ban a simple review, and why is there no contact info on the companies direct web site.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the mitten twice so far, as I&#x27;m using it once weekly to get my skin used to it.</li>
            <li> My arms were sort of crepey from sun exposure and now are starting to look like my 22 year old daughter&#x27;s arms</li>
            <li> your skin REALLY soft and minimizes facial wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I would by several for my 50-something year old friends.</li>
            <li> This mitt never did anything it claimed for me, not even after giving it a second chance once we moved to a home with soft water-</li>
            <li> I have keratosis pilaris and this is the only product that allows me to have soft skin once again.  </li>
            <li> I did have a pretty dark spray tan that I was trying to remove so the skin rolling off</li>
            <li> I am in complete utter amazement of the after results.</li>
            <li> I had wonderfully SOFT skin for the first few weeks and was raving about this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I dont know how you can go wrong purchasing and using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My skin was pink for a few hours after exfoliating, and I was glad I didn&#x27;t have to leave the house until the next morning.</li>
            <li> After a soak like that, just about anything remotely abrasive will easily remove dead skin.</li>
            <li> I had this dry patch of skin on my face that nothing was helping and this has fixed the problem completely.  </li>
            <li> Love this, it did not roll the dead skin off anywhere on my body except my chest but none the less</li>
            <li> It is a little bit of a workout for me to rub my skin with the mitten so hard and fast, even though I am young (24) and relatively fit.</li>
            <li> I mean, I knew it was an important step in skin care</li>
            <li> purpose of my informal trial run was to identify any positive or negative results on the portions of my skin affected by stretchmarks; I should note that I have very light/fair skin, but I&#x27;d recommend anyone who&#x27;s looking for improved skin tone and texture to try the product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Long-term use faded the newer/thinner stretchmarks on my hips from purple to the silver/grey, making them largely less noticeable than they first were.</li>
            <li> The purple discoloration of the wider/larger thigh stretchmarks is still visible but to a drastically less degree than to when I first</li>
            <li> NO DRY SKIN!</li>
            <li> the whole bottom of my tub was filled with dead skin when i used it!!!!</li>
            <li> It is so smooth on my skin that it&#x27;s hard to believe it&#x27;s doing the same job as the scrubs.</li>
            <li> No matter how much I scrubbed with a facial sponge, or what kind of expensive exfoliating lotions and cleansers I used my face would always be extremely flaky.  </li>
            <li> it today for the 1st time, long steamy shower, do not dry off, wet the Mitten with hot water and wring out.</li>
            <li> Have no dry patches on my elbows, knuckles or knees.</li>
            <li> I was told once that I produce a lot of skin cells ( I get flakes not dry skin)</li>
            <li> So, upshot is, few weeks of use only, but definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on this product, and the first couple of times I did struggle with it–only getting little rolls of skin here and there.</li>
            <li> Hi, I purchased my first Baiden Mitten a little over a year ago and started using it immediately when it came in.</li>
            <li> #34;chicken skin&amp;#34;) on the backs of my arms; however, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the Baiden Mitt not only exfoliated as well as any glove/device/scrub I&#x27;d used in the past, but was absolutely pain-free and didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling &amp;#34;raw&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; as I&#x27;d become accustomed to with all those other treatments.  </li>
            <li> Not quite what i expected for the money spent... maybe im just not using it right ubt i havent got it to work like mentioned in the packaging.</li>
            <li> I still have a little bit of flaking in my trouble spots, like the bridge of my nose, but I am now confident these will disappear with regular use of the mitten.  </li>
            <li> only treated half of my body the first time.  </li>
            <li> since I know the Baiden mitten works due to my experiences with the ORIGINAL less pricier version, it gets 3 stars.</li>
            <li> No matter how hard I tried, it did not work for me like other people and I read many reviews, instructions etc. and followed them.</li>
            <li> This helps my self-tanner last much longer than any other mitt.</li>
            <li> I stood up after that and started scrubbing in long pressured motions and wow is all I can say.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions, and my dead skin did not roll off, and my skin was no more smooth than it normally is.</li>
            <li> First time I noticed the rolls of dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> I was astonished how much dead skin came off the FIRST time I used it.</li>
            <li> after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;-Shrinks when it is under hot water.&lt;br /&gt;-Can slip off hand when using.&lt;br /&gt;-Can</li>
            <li> I was amazed at the amount of debris that was pulled out of my skin the first few times.</li>
            <li> , I think that if the company would cut the price in half they would make up for the cut in price by the pure volume in sells...</li>
            <li> If you have moderately dry skin it helps but for severely dry skin not so much.</li>
            <li> Make sure that there are no bath salts, lotions, creams, or anything else but plain water that you soak in, or the dead skin will not peel off properly.</li>
            <li> Make sure that there are no bath salts, lotions, creams, or anything else but plain water that you soak in, or the dead skin will not peel off properly.</li>
            <li> Now before using your mitten wash it in plain soapy hot water.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It takes probably about a half hour to completely do my whole</li>
            <li> my skin feels so soft afterwards and i no longer have itchy dry skin in the winter.  </li>
            <li> Yes, they are young, but their skin gets dry.</li>
            <li> I think it works the same as Dr. Lancer&#x27;s Method for skincare, where you use his skin polisher first to get the dead skin off your face, then use his cleanser</li>
            <li> But I guess it is encouraging to see a company stand behind their product so strongly.</li>
            <li> I guess I have to mandatorily use the mitten every single week as instructed, but my busy schedule doesn&#x27;t always allow room for pampering.  </li>
            <li> that came off the first time I used it, and the next few times I had the same results.  </li>
            <li> few hours later my skin was HOT, red, buuuuuuuuuuuurning and I</li>
            <li> Even in the dead of winter up here in New England, my skin feels as soft as a baby&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> But, really the exfoliating gloves found at your local retailer could do the job just as well for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> Turkish cloth looks exactly the same (same size, same colour) and I was amazed with how much dead skin came off, especially because I exfoliate regularly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will be buying this product for as long as I live or as long as they keep making it (which I hope they do for decades to come!)</li>
            <li> I followed the directions to the letter - soaked in a plain bath for 30 minutes, lightly toweled off, rubbed the mitt across back and forth and then up and down (and not in a circle).  </li>
            <li> and I use pure coconut oil everyday..</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to order because of the cost, and it didn&#x27;t look like there was much to it.  </li>
            <li> I have super pale fair skin and dirt on me sticks to my dead skin and makes me look dirty.</li>
            <li> I was walking around with such a layer of dead, dull skin hiding my baby soft smooth skin</li>
            <li> And my skin is very resilient, I would never ever consider it &#x27;sensitive&#x27; or &#x27;thin&#x27; or &#x27;mature&#x27; skin that I would take caution with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit strange &amp;#34;rolling your dead skin off&amp;#34; but my new skin underneath is soft and</li>
            <li> B0009MHJE4 African Shea Butter Cream (100% Pure &amp; Raw, Gold) 8 Oz.]</li>
            <li> I did see a few dead skin rolls mainly on the stomach area and definitely arms but not so much the legs.</li>
            <li> Conversely, though, if you are looking to make your cloth just a tad less rough and scratchy (say, for facial exfoliating), then go ahead and try the softener.e in mild coarseness, the other is medium.&lt;br /&gt;ii)</li>
            <li> and my skin didn&#x27;t come off in rolls, but the second time I left my skin wet and had a huge mess in my bathtub from all the rolls of dead skin</li>
            <li> The key is long straight strokes with a firm even pressure.</li>
            <li> I DO have a VERY high pain tolerance, but I also expected a slight stinging as the instructions state it could feel &#x27;red or tingly&#x27; from the exfoliation...</li>
            <li> I bought my first and only mitten 2 years ago at least.</li>
            <li> Used only once, probably didn&#x27;t soak in bath long enough</li>
            <li> after the first couple of tries passed, I felt like it got easier and easier to rub off all the dead skin.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m already seeing improvement after a few sessions - particularly in my arms.</li>
            <li> It make take a few tries before you see the peeling, but read the directions they provide and really try to follow the tips and it&#x27;ll happen!</li>
            <li> In regards to my skin; this is a &#x27;WORK ONE TIME TO REMOVE DEAD SKIN&#x27; mitten and the price is way too high.  </li>
            <li> It was hard to keep from perspiring since I was in the bathroom of hot steam.</li>
            <li> The dry bumps on the back of my upper arms are gone.</li>
            <li> I found it hard to get the right balance between getting rid of the dry skin without abraded patches.  </li>
            <li> So far not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually out of breath when I&#x27;m finished, I really work it.  </li>
            <li> You do have to follow the instructions of showering or soaking in hot water for at least 15 mins and then start scrubbing.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and can&#x27;t believe the results after a few uses will never be with out!</li>
            <li> I followed instructions and soaked in a hot bath for at least 15 minutes</li>
            <li> As far as my legs, I have yet to see any dead skin come off; in fact, I&#x27;m starting to get these &amp;#34;stretch mark&amp;#34; like welts on the inner part of both legs and ankles.  </li>
            <li> Starting at my feet, I used medium pressure and long vertical strokes to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I asked my dermatologist and he said that the skin peeling the ad describes would only occur if you are not a frequent bather.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet to see if it will help with my cellulite</li>
            <li> Now both the epilation and the exfoliation go hand in hand for long lasting smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind it because it doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> if you use this mitten before getting a spray tan your tan will be even and last a really long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t soak in the tub as the instructions say to, but I simply use the mitten at the end of my shower on one part of my body, rotating areas each time I shower, so that I don&#x27;t take too long</li>
            <li> My skin gets a little red and tingly after I use it (and while there are warnings not to overdo the rubbing action)</li>
            <li> Do each other then enjoy each other&#x27;s soft skin, if you aren&#x27;t too tired.  </li>
            <li> These mitts last a long time, in my experience!  </li>
            <li> This mitten peals those dead skin cells off and reveals the new skin underneath.</li>
            <li> I have been blessed in life with extra dry skin.  </li>
            <li> it completely removes my black heads but it doesnt make me peel a lot on my legs or stomach.</li>
            <li> After doing a lot of reading/researching on the net, I really couldn&#x27;t find any logically negative reviews on the mitten.</li>
            <li> I personally didn&#x27;t find that it did what it claimed to do, which is to exfoliate my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m using it once a week and softly, each week increasing the pressure slightly.</li>
            <li> I exfoliate my face and neck on a regular basis and was really surprised that I still had dead skin come off with this in spite of that.  </li>
            <li> and I was completely amazed at how much dead skin (yeah, gross!)</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when I first opened the package and saw a pretty simple looking mitten</li>
            <li> I use retin A and the mitten was not too harsh, which surprised me!</li>
            <li> - just last night - after spending the past four days moving from one house to another - I soaked in my new tub for 20 minutes and then used the mitten.  </li>
            <li> I then lightly towel dried and started using the mitten in firm up and down</li>
            <li> And this mitt will last you a very long time!</li>
            <li> The first time i used long motions up and down and all i got was some small results on the back of my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I ordered it and began using it frequently, trying different methods and looking at the positive feedback to determine what I could have been doing wrong.</li>
            <li> When I got the mitten [sooner than I expected] all I did was take a steamy hot shower for about a half hour, no soap [per instructions], put the mitten on following directions- the bottom of the tub was covered in dead skin.</li>
            <li> It may irritate your skin if you scrub hard, so be gentle when scrubbing.</li>
            <li> You just get it wet and run it over wet skin with no other products?</li>
            <li> It takes of all the dead skin, and makes my fake tan more even, and last longer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-Skin is suuuuper soft afterwards&lt;br /&gt;-Available in asian grocers (usually Korean),Asian beauty supply stores, Ebay, and Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;-Can</li>
            <li> I can clearly see the dead skin removed.</li>
            <li> Eventually you will see grey rolls of skin fall off.</li>
            <li> The dead skin rolls off leaving your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> Dragging the rolled cloth across your skin, scrub your skin in long strokes.</li>
            <li> Dragging the rolled cloth across your skin, scrub your skin in long strokes.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see results long term.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a decades long user of bufpuf for body and face, and I still use it for thorough soap cleansing, but there is no doubt, the bufpuf never exfoliated ANYTHING</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve bought a whole cabinet full of useless crap to help my skin that amounts to a lot more money than this.</li>
            <li> rough on skin, and can actually tear it at times.&lt;br /&gt;-Smells</li>
            <li> use.&lt;br /&gt;-The cloth is tiny, so its harder to reach in some areas.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I wish I did long ago.</li>
            <li> but I can only say to those who are curious give it a shot</li>
            <li> So drink plenty of water and prevent yourself from heat exhaustion from that 15 min long steamy bath.</li>
            <li> Wow, tons of dead skin just shedding off of me...</li>
            <li> I will be buying this for a long time.</li>
            <li> The second time I went up-down vigorously and left-right vigorously on wet skin and it happened on my body and face.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve lived without this for so long.</li>
            <li> I rubbed the cloth on my skin and was immediately surprised by the amount of dead skin coming off.  </li>
            <li> I had a minor break out</li>
            <li> Have yet to see long term</li>
            <li> Next rub that same body part briskly in an up &amp; down motion.</li>
            <li> , I start scrubbing in a back and forth motion up and down my left arm until the rolls start.  </li>
            <li> you should &#x27;not see large rolls of skin come off your face as you would other areas of your body, but you should still feel small balls of skin&#x27;.</li>
            <li> First, the seller (koole?) said hard water can shield your skin and make it harder to exfoliate!</li>
            <li> After using the mitten, I use plain old petroleum jelly on my skin - as recommended in a youtube video I found by PinUpPassion - who told me the dos and don&#x27;ts for the Baiden Mitten - skin feels so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then pat yourself dry but not completely.</li>
            <li> I have taken 6 soaking baths, up to 45 minutes each, and have barely gotten any skin off, much less see rolls.  </li>
            <li> glad to report that I was WRONG!</li>
            <li> As long as these are made I will always have one of these mits!</li>
            <li> do other people exfoliate their back?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m contemplating going back to buy the other.  </li>
            <li> My PCP had me see a dermatologist this spring because my skin was so dry.  </li>
            <li> I will notice a improvement to my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always battling dry, itchy, peeling skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had really dry skin and have tried every lotion, potion, and loofa out there.</li>
            <li> From dry brushing to sugar and salt scrubs</li>
            <li> the dry skin just rolls off</li>
            <li> One tip - just hang it to dry.</li>
            <li> This exfoliating mitten is said to improve dry skin, wrinkles, scars, cellulite, stretch marks and blackheads, while firming your skin and minimizing pores.  </li>
            <li> My sister told me about the mitten because I have painfully dry skin, I look like a reptile in the winter months.  </li>
            <li> Was amazed at how much dead skin actually came off after my initial use.</li>
            <li> where all the dead stuff is (it does claim to slough your skin in such a way that you can actually see it rolling off...</li>
            <li> I had to tell him that no, it is not a new treatment or moisturizer -- it&#x27;s my mitten.</li>
            <li> The only factor that may bring my rating down is how long the mitt lasts.</li>
            <li> price is less than any exfoliating scrubs I&#x27;ve ever bought and it last for a long time.</li>
            <li> WOW it was amazing and disgusting at the same time.  </li>
            <li> was dark brown and looked quite gross.  </li>
            <li> My skin&#x27;s never felt so clean and so dirty at the same time!!!  </li>
            <li> you want deep, dramatic, real exfoliation, you need the Baiden Mitten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you want deep, dramatic, real exfoliation, you need the Baiden Mitten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I scrubbed up and down and not circular and did this over the same area and all over my body without rinsing in between.</li>
            <li> It took me a little while to figure out that my skin needed to be partially dry/damp, NOT wet, in order for the mitten to work, but once I got that figured out</li>
            <li> I switched the Mitten to my other hand, because my right arm was tired, and needed a break.</li>
            <li> will be continuing use weekly for the next few months to see if there are any long term benefits to using it on stretch marks, and will update with my results in that time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I only paid half price for it, so I figured what the heck might as well.</li>
            <li> Although, I have been debating purchasing this mitt for 2 years after I saw it on YouTube and decided to go for it when I was not satisfied with my skin care routine (I&#x27;ve tried store bought exfoliating products and they were never gritty enough, and home-made ones like sugar, water, and lemon worked</li>
            <li> /&gt;There may be other products out there that are the same for less money, but if you want to be 100% satisfied you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second mitt, and I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two and half years.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical when buying this because to pay that much money for a mitt sounds crazy but with all the positive reviews I thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> I also had a little dry skin on the back of my arms, all gone ,</li>
            <li> What you end up with is peeled rolls of all that dried skin weighing you down and making you look old and</li>
            <li> I tend to have very dry skin which requires that I use a lot of lotion.  </li>
            <li> when I did this for the first several weeks it was painful on the stretchmarks because my sensitive skin was not used to the product.</li>
            <li> I had no dark places in those spots where you usually get darker (the knees,elbows and feet).</li>
            <li> I usually take a hot bath or shower for 15/20 minutes, scrub with this and then get back in the shower to rinse of the residue left behind and do all my other business.</li>
            <li> Conversely, though, if you are looking to make your cloth just a tad less rough and scratchy (say, for facial exfoliating), then go ahead and try the softener.</li>
            <li> it was a little red as well.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t peeled after I got a little red.</li>
            <li> The second time, I had little or no results.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other methods I&#x27;ve used, this just glides over my skin and removes the dry skin.</li>
            <li> The 2nd, 3rd and 4th times removed little, if any, dead skin.  </li>
            <li> A back and forth motion is essential to achieve these results, circular motions do nothing, and you have to scrub hard.</li>
            <li> I used it hard enough to make my skin go red</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth what you spend, doesn&#x27;t irritate even my baby sensitive, rash prone, eczema so bad it would bleed since i was</li>
            <li> Only hope it will last for at least a year.</li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t used the mitten on my face again, nor the Lite version as I haven&#x27;t yet gotten it, but the customer service was at least well done as she even offered some natural remedies for my freak-face condition.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to get this mitt to work for 2 months, and all I get is red skin, I&#x27;ve haven&#x27;t seen anymore than a few flakes come off as of yet, and I can get that with a cheapie $.99 loofah at the dollar store.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent thousands of dollars on spas and this does everything I need.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely do not recommend purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> ) Rinse off dead skin then go about regular shower routine (hair, bodywash, shaving, ect.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The mitten molded to my hand after it was wet.</li>
            <li> The material just seems too rough for that.     </li>
            <li> The third time I felt like it removed a lot of dead cells.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a few weeks, but the stretch marks I&#x27;ve had on my hips since puberty are now practically invisible.</li>
            <li> Results not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> If you try the KI cloth and don&#x27;t like it, you&#x27;re only out a few bucks, and can still move on to the Baiden without feeling you&#x27;ve been ripped off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> that is, a pocket, into which you insert a folded, wet but wrung-out wash cloth, to give it some substance to hold onto.  </li>

            <li> The process of getting moist but not too wet is a bit cumbersome.  </li>
            <li> Product as described, works as expected.</li>
            <li> While I do agree the mitten seems quite expensive, trust me when I say it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I thought there wasn&#x27;t much to it - just a thin glove.</li>
            <li> It is expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> Dead skin was removed from my body upon the initial use.  </li>
            <li> I never NEVER leave comments or reviews on my purchases just because I never really remember to do it, but after using this mitten I KNEW I had to share my experience ..</li>
            <li> and I still couldn&#x27;t believe how poorly I was really exfoliated.</li>
            <li> The Green and Red ones are both rougher than the Baiden mitten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I soaked in the tub and didn&#x27;t use soap or lotion prior to using the mitten as suggested in the directions but no sloughing of dead skin occurred.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it several times now and the dead skin CONTINUES to roll up on my body.</li>
            <li> At $25 per year, that&#x27;s roughly .65</li>
            <li> Should it be constantly wet during the exfoliation process?  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not dripping wet &amp; then start using my mitt.  </li>
            <li> Using this mitten everyday will give you lasting results.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a month following the directions that was included and have seen no results of dead skin being removed.  </li>
            <li> Yes it literally does take the dead skin off, especially the arms.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be too wet when you use the mitten.  </li>
            <li> in patches over my body) and was curious to see how I would feel after using it.</li>
            <li> You just get the baiden mitten wet, and start rubbing it over your face and body.</li>
            <li> No &amp;#34;rolls&amp;#34; of dead skin, only spots where I rubbed my skin off.  </li>
            <li> the amount of dead skin that came off my body was so gross.  </li>
            <li> I literally cannot find one person who regrets their purchase.</li>
            <li> started with my upper arm and immediately rolls of dead skin started to ball up and fall off.</li>
            <li> Normal exfoliaters, whether it is a scrub or loofah style item has never cut thru the dead skin that I would try and use my hands to remove in the past.</li>
            <li> I loved it for use on my body, and it made my face cry tears of insane red blistery mitten-sadness.....  </li>
            <li> Instead of rubbing fast up and down your skin, you need to apply pressure as you slowly pull the mitt up and down your skin.  </li>
            <li> You want your skin to be as plain as possible, unless you want a rash!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a major corporation, it&#x27;s an old family secret.</li>
            <li> The mitt has a rough surface, but isn&#x27;t scratchy like the other products I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I use Lush&#x27;s Dream Cream after exfoliating, and it is seriously dreamy.</li>
            <li> I then guided my 13 year old son on how to use it because he had a few small blemishes on his forehead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Baiden Mitten for the last two month, and I&#x27;m not totally satisfied with it&#x27;s performance on my skin.  </li>
            <li> As of now, let me begin by stating that this mitten is extremely over priced.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no reason at all why a woven rag should cost $50.00!</li>
            <li> Not sure about blackheads and such.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical when the mitt arrived.</li>
            <li> I have noticed the tan on my shoulders is lasting longer than usual</li>
            <li> It truly does exfoliate your skin, unlike the other products out there.  </li>
            <li> Money well spent!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s other promises.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> If you find any other colors, the packaging should indicate how course it</li>
            <li> If you find any other colors, the packaging should indicate how course it</li>
            <li> The Baiden Mitten works but you need to prepare for an uncomfortable first use.</li>
            <li> A guy&#x27;s analogy: it was like taking a clay bar to your car to remove all of the debris and contaminants you couldn&#x27;t see combined with a wax job where you finish, you push your rag across the hood and it glides effortlessly to the other side.</li>
            <li> After years of skin disorders and having to use endless bottles of moisturizers...</li>
            <li> Careful, it will remove your tan too!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my mitten every other day for about two weeks</li>
            <li> The difference between these two is that one is gentler than the other.</li>
            <li> have never used it on my face, but I am going to now after having read some of the other reviews.</li>
            <li> A few scar that I had have long since faded once I used the mitten.</li>
            <li> I was a bit dubious as this thing is pretty expensive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning on buying these for the other women in my family</li>
            <li> i have tried other things and nothing</li>
            <li> IT WORKS and you shouldn&#x27;t need any other exfoliation product.</li>
            <li> I was developing those nasty white bumps on the back of my thighs and top of buttocks area.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use any other exfoliation on any part of me but</li>
            <li> not sure if you can still get your money back after trying it.</li>
            <li> The skin didn&#x27;t roll off as other have mentioned</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually a little gross to see how much dead skin comes off.  </li>
            <li> yeah, it&#x27;s a little gross as the rolls of dead skin comes off</li>
            <li> I follow the instructions very carefully</li>
            <li> This canvas mitt is a complete waste of my hard earned money.  </li>
            <li> You can bet I have dry, dead skin.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t know how much dry dead skin you have until you try this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a plethora of imitation exfoliating mittens and towels.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a plethora of imitation exfoliating mittens and towels.</li>
            <li> Initially the fabric had been a little stiff.</li>
            <li> All of these have lightened, softened or (dark brown spots) disappeared due to my use of the Baiden Mitten.  </li>
            <li> it did get rid of some dry skin, but not all, so then I was half dry and half raw</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting a little role off (skin) but not much.</li>
            <li> I had been exfoliating weekly with a Moroccan mitt previous to my purchase of this mitten, this mitten puts that and every other one I have used to shame.</li>
            <li> Maybe I was just rubbing too hard the last time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought myself one 3 years ago, and I religiously use it once a week to sluff off my fading spray tan or just polish my skin if it&#x27;s looking dull.</li>
            <li> Lower back - and I wasn&#x27;t event trying that hard.</li>
            <li> the help of a family member to get to the hard to reach places on your back with the mitten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the help of a family member to get to the hard to reach places on your back with the mitten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I believe I wasn&#x27;t scrubbing hard enough.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s quite expensive and you need to soak for 10-15 minutes in the bath for it to really work well.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the price for what it does.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how it will stand up in the long term.</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical because none of the reviews seemed real or legit.</li>
            <li> Does the job but not worth $50.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not worth it.</li>
            <li> Def not worth the cost in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe I wasted my money on this rough mitten.</li>
            <li> far worse than I&#x27;ve ever experienced.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found the consistency of the Baiden Mitten to be not too rough, which, in my humble opinion, didn&#x27;t exfoliate well.    </li>
            <li> My skin is so dry, that I see little flakes on black clothing and socks and bedding!</li>
            <li> I was initially skeptical due to the high price, but suffering with stretch marks on my thighs and hips</li>
            <li> She instructed me to use deliberate up and down motions with pressure.  </li>
            <li> I think I got it down now</li>
            <li> I got in the shower for like 5 minutes and started to brush up and down...</li>
            <li> Up and down.</li>
            <li> I have used other methods of exfoliation before-- but have never got the results I get with the mitten!  </li>
            <li> I tend to have dry skin and small bumps that are caused by ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> The other gloves I have will be too harsh to use it on my face.</li>
            <li> If you can find a plaid one, that comes with heavy coarseness on one side, and medium on the other.</li>
            <li> If you can find a plaid one, that comes with heavy coarseness on one side, and medium on the other.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to scrub any raw spots into your skin and fallow the directions closely.</li>
            <li> Your skin should be just slightly damp</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, we aren&#x27;t talking giant slabs of skin but enough that you can see your progress.</li>
            <li> I even use less body lotion.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t think of it before I ordered the mitten, but once I received it, I immediately remembered the Korean cloths for sloughing that we had used when I grew up (I&#x27;m half Korean).</li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t leave reviews</li>
            <li> My cousin has reduced the appearance of a surgical scar and hers still works after having it a year and a half.</li>
            <li> I have previously used the Korean bath mitts but the baiden mitten outperforms them.</li>
            <li> but i didn&#x27;t see any changes not even a slight change ......</li>
            <li> and none of them work even half as well as the baiden mitten does.</li>
            <li> I guess I noticed a slight difference in the feel of my skin afterwards, but</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to be working as well as my previous one either.</li>
            <li> I hate wearing lotion because I hate feeling sticky or waiting for it to dry, so this is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about paying so much money for what looked like a loofa glove, but I have to admit, that after a few uses, my skin has never been softer.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone who suffers from bad flatulence, this is better than Beano!!</li>
            <li> I know that sounds painful, but it is not painful at all to use.  </li>
            <li> and it was just a mess.</li>
            <li> This mitt does what it says, takes off dead skin, just use up and down strokes, or side to side.</li>
            <li> I no longer have dry patches or dull skin.</li>
            <li> I have had it a few months now and can get it to work about half the time.</li>
            <li> I use it once a week - there is less dead skin removed now</li>
            <li> and I exfoliate my face as well; so perhaps I did not see dramatic results due to the fact that I already maintain my skin fairly regularly.</li>
            <li> and I recommend it to anyone who needs a little exfoliation without harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> The little bit I have used this I like it.</li>
            <li> and it does soften up a little with additional use.</li>
            <li> But when I was done, dabbed a little tea tree oil on my skin.</li>
            <li> After two uses on my arms my little bumps disappeared.</li>
            <li> It was a little pricey, but I do notice a difference.  </li>
            <li> I can see a little difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> my skin has never been smoother and all the little bumps are gradually going away.</li>
            <li> I can not believe they charge $50.00 for this little piece of cloth.</li>
            <li> or so I turn off the water after getting the mitt damp, towel off just a little</li>
            <li> I had a grouping of 3 small raised burn scars, the smallest scar is gone the other 2</li>
            <li> I scrubbed very hard, and after I exited the shower there were red, raised bumps along the areas affected by stretchmarks.</li>
            <li> I have been having a little trouble with KP  </li>
            <li> I have tried other exfoliation gloves in the past but they pale in comparison.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to press too hard</li>
            <li> Amazing and Disgusting!  </li>
            <li> It was amazing and disgusting all rolled into one.</li>
            <li> I also have two ugly scars / calluses on my knee that r sooo soft and have lighten up Big Time!!</li>
            <li> bathed for 30 minutes then used the mitten and the amount of dead skin the mitten removed covered the bottom of my bathtub!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> All the dead skin was gone...</li>
            <li> Now, the skin on my face looks a bit tighter, but the dead skin never rolls off.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t care if you are 20 or 90, we all have dead skin that needs to come off in order for us to have the skin</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Those bumps faded in a few days after each exfoliation, and now do not appear when I exfoliate.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not get the rolls of dead skin</li>
            <li> I watched the dead skin peel away.</li>
            <li> Waste of money compaired to baiden..</li>
            <li> so I use it at night, but it goes away in a few hours.  </li>
            <li> The dead skin seems to come off in layers as she scrubs.  </li>
            <li> I shower or take a bath everyday</li>
            <li> After a few uses though, man I was on a roll.</li>
            <li> and it did not work, but I&#x27;m not giving up hope because I was told it could take a few times.</li>
            <li> I never knew I could rub that much dead skin off my body in one sitting.</li>
            <li> I bought this mitt after reading a few dozen of the reviews.</li>
            <li> I hated the slimy feeling of most lotions anyway.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are impatient to get them for the sake of getting started asap with your tan, consider ordering here on Amazon, where you can find quicker shipping times, including a few that qualify for Amazon Prime</li>

            <li> I took a 15 min.soak just like suggested and literally saw the dead skin peel off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and use it about once a week</li>
            <li> Loofas get smelly and weaken and brushes can be to harsh for my skin</li>
            <li> Your dead skin and gunk will roll off your body with each exfoliation.</li>
            <li> Used it 2x and can&#x27;t believe how much dead skin came off.  </li>
            <li> It removes all the dead skin and the tan buildup.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s kind of shocking.</li>
            <li> it sloughs off dead skin cells like you would not believe....</li>
            <li> few months after purchasing the Baiden, I have changed my mind.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is a waste of money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I waited until after I&#x27;d used it a few times to write this review</li>
            <li> The dead skin was peeling away from my body, arms and legs.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> its greedy and shameful tbh... dont waste your money....</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get rolls of dead skin cells...</li>
            <li> The mitten will slip around and not pick up the dead skin</li>
            <li> a lot the dead skin and grime off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a lot of the dead skin off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dead skin was literally &amp;#34;rolling&amp;#34; off.</li>
            <li> Its basically a piece of canvas and does not exfoliate at all.. what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Had to use it a few times to get the hang of it</li>
            <li> (This is a twice a week routine) after that I scrub with the mitten and all the dead skin/dirt</li>
            <li> My dead skin did just roll off.</li>
            <li> This product increases the peeling effect helping you roll away dead skin and let the body breath and detox.</li>
            <li> If you follow the step-by-step instructions that are included with the mitten (firmly using up-and-down and side-to-side motions) there is no way that this wouldn&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li> All dead skin was removed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> dried off</li>
            <li> I would have returned it, but I misplaced my paperwork.</li>
            <li> Like others, I did not see the dead skin rolling off.</li>
            <li> use it 2 - 3 times a week while in the shower and there is a MAJOR difference in all the ugly little age spots/freckles on my hands and face and while the cellulite on my thighs isn&#x27;t gone, it is definitely smoother.  </li>
            <li> Right now I&#x27;m frustrated and don&#x27;t know what to do; I may have to see a dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> My first use shocked me at the amount of dead skin it exfoliated.  </li>
            <li> just a small one for a few fingers-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s all dead skin that comes off or if it&#x27;s some soap build up too....</li>

            <li> I purchased the maiden mitt after reading tons of reviews, but was still a little skeptical that i wouldn&#x27;t see those &amp;#34;amazing results.&amp;#34; I ordered it anyway because of the money back guarantee and boy was</li>
            <li> I get sweaty and honestly start smelling bad while using the mitten and take a cold shower after.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the amount of crap that came off of my body after my very first use.</li>
            <li> So much so that it left a disgusting mess in the bottom of my shower.  </li>
            <li> There is very little redness when I&#x27;m done and my skin looks healthier than ever.</li>
            <li> First of all the price is stupid crazy high.</li>
            <li> So by that time I was frustrated and ready to get the process over with</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I don&#x27;t have access to a bathtub in my tiny apartment.  </li>
            <li> I started slowly on my arms and when I saw the dead skin roll (like a snowball)</li>
            <li> not sure if i am fully sold on this product will have to continue using and see.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure about the scars and cellulite claims</li>
            <li> [if I have the time and am not feeling lazy].</li>
            <li> Not sure how or when that happened.  </li>
            <li> Lotion makes the skin too slick to slough off, so you need to eliminate it before attempting to exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure how or when that happened.  </li>
            <li> Lotion makes the skin too slick to slough off, so you need to eliminate it before attempting to exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Could not believe how much dead skin came off....dramatic improvements!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the years are starting to show</li>
            <li> No more cracked skin, flakes, rashes.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but I figured with a money back guarantee what did I have to lose?  </li>
            <li> I am seeing the small lines around my eyes and mouth disappearing.</li>
            <li> unbelievable.</li>
            <li> UNBELIEVABLE.</li>
            <li> Sorry guys those Korean cloths and what-not are not quite the same</li>
            <li> i couldn&#x27;t believe how much dead skin rolled off!  </li>
            <li> This thing is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I have scrubbed 2x with the Baiden Mitten in the past 2 weeks and my skin is a lot softer.  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but I had to for this product.</li>
            <li> My Faux tan application is no better after using it than it was before I paid the whopping $50 bucks.  </li>
            <li> I  am not sure what i was drinking when I ordered this.</li>
            <li> - you will not believe all the dead skin this thing gets off!  </li>
            <li> Not one &amp;#34;roll&amp;#34; of dead skin sloughed off!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had the same result.  </li>
            <li> Those are dead on!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a couple minutes no more skin balled up so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll presume that those were simply due to poor care, but regardless, lack of washability would be a deal-breaker for me, personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have a few scars from having chicken pox as a child that are actually starting to look faded.</li>
            <li> I was afraid of rubbing too hard and making my skin raw because the cloth does feel very rough when wet.  </li>
            <li> so I am very pale and tend to not get out in the sun often.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping it would work :(</li>
            <li> (I hate those bumps so much!).</li>
            <li> With all the expensive lotions and creams I have bought for dry skin, nothing worked like this mit did....</li>
            <li> As I looked in the mirror the very next day, after my first use, I was shocked to see that my stretch marks from my four children were so diminished that I stood there wondering if they were ever really as bad as I&#x27;d once thought they were...</li>
            <li> I could hardly tell that I had worked out so</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t worry that your pressing too hard.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t hard at all for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> be hard to</li>
            <li> I have hard water, that&#x27;s a start.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have to scrub hard and it does not hurt at all.</li>
            <li> Actually, it&#x27;s hard when i use on my skin face.</li>
            <li> , In my late 40&#x27;s--haven&#x27;t used on my face yet, but will let you know.</li>
            <li> Also, you have to soak for at least 15 minutes before using.   </li>
            <li> Try to stay in that bath at least 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even read negative reviews on the Baiden by some that said it became moldy.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d be lying if I said it didn&#x27;t--at least for a moment--</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d be lying if I said it didn&#x27;t--at least for a moment--</li>
            <li> These people will take your money, spam your email address, and then force Amazon to remove negative reviews.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry you spent the money.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too late to return it.ng</li>
            <li> I should have returned it, but lost track of time and it was too late for me to do so.</li>
            <li> I just knew this wouldn&#x27;t work for me or at least not as well as it supposedly did for others.</li>
            <li> Disappointing, especially at this price.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these for my daughter, who suffers from teenage acne, and one of the Lite versions for myself, a 50-year-old woman.</li>
            <li> With all of the nasty chemicals that can fill scrubs, I want to use something as natural as possible.</li>
            <li> Dead skin came off of areas I never would have thought, including under my neck and behind my ears</li>
            <li> No more!  </li>
            <li> The seller is very anxious and committed to help you make her product work</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed with the lack of quality for the price, it was supposed to last 2 years, tried to return it, but the seller only has a 1 months return policy, so buyer beware</li>
            <li> Those little bumps from frigid temperatures and dryness are completely gone.</li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> it was less expensive</li>
            <li> i was very skeptical, but after soaking for a half hour in the tub, the dead skin just rolled off with this mitten.</li>
            <li> I think it was a little too expensive.</li>
            <li> Helps to keep from having those ugly knees and such when using sunless tanners.</li>
            <li> Those ugly bumps on the back my arms... GONE!</li>
            <li> Totally not a good look on me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I am one of the few that the mitten doesn&#x27;t work on.</li>
            <li> can hardly wait to use it again!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it - I was disgusted by how skin rolled up.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;m doing it wrong</li>
            <li> Smartest investment I&#x27;ve made lately!</li>
            <li> My skin is so dry, it flakes terribly even with lotions made for really dry skin.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for those who wanted to know - it didn&#x27;t actually hurt that badly when I was scrubbing, which is the scary part.</li>
            <li> The dead skin this mitten rolls off was shocking - on my face, back, legs, arms - it was unreal.</li>
            <li> Alas, the Baiden has conflicting reviews as to whether it&#x27;s machine washable (although I did read one review from a person who said that they used a touch of laundry soap on it from time to time).</li>
            <li> The Baiden Mitten story on the package is the this is a beauty secret from the Ottoman Empire, or what we now call the country of Turkey, in their communal baths where they have cleansing rituals.  </li>
            <li> this is awfully thin, how can it work like they say?&amp;#34</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re tired of what I call &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; (you know ...</li>
            <li> However, I was confused.</li>
            <li> My acne and blackheads have seriously decreased.</li>
            <li> This &#x27;Biden mitten&#x27; lists false statements.  </li>
            <li> [...]&lt;br /&gt;Actually I was shocked to find that USA U Tube banned a stupid Mitten review in the first place.  </li>
            <li> And those annoying bumps on the backs of my arms are long gone, which was an added bonus for me.</li>
            <li> I was shocked (and a bit horrified) by the amount of dead skin etc.</li>
            <li> - you&#x27;ll be disgusted but your skin will feel so soft.</li>
            <li> You should have seen all the crap come off my skin - and this was even after soaping down with a washcloth and soap -</li>
            <li> Sadly, this mitten does nothing for me.  </li>
            <li> and you cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so expensive</li>
            <li> And this is an expensive product</li>
            <li> Now before using the Baiden Mitten I was skeptical, about it.</li>
            <li> I must say that I was skeptical before getting this</li>
            <li> (I felt guilty)</li>
            <li> Expensive lesson to learn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m caught between wanting to tell EVERYONE about the baiden mitten and a selfish desire to keep it all for myself.</li>
            <li> but none nearly so expensive as the $50 Baiden.</li>
            <li> is the price, soooo expensive</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s expensive,  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no longer having to buy scrubs that are expensive and some are laden with chemicals</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to purchase this mitten because of the price.</li>
            <li> but once you do you will be addicted!</li>
            <li> It may be a bit expensive</li>
            <li> Too expensive.</li>
            <li> I was worried about rubbing my tan off, silly, I know.</li>
            <li> I did not experience this unfortunately</li>
            <li> but I am wondering why it is so expensive.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re skeptical, don&#x27;t be.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical and thought there is no way these bumps will go away.</li>
            <li> Well, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> such a horrible experience and my skin is still recovering.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> way too expensive.</li>
            <li> It slid all over my hand and was difficult to use as described.</li>
            <li> Very expensive for no remarkable result.</li>
            <li> It was actually shocking as thought my other products were thoroughly exfoliating me, but they were not.</li>
            <li> However it did help the chicken skin on my arms a lot.</li>
            <li> I so desperately hoped for.</li>
            <li> The amount of dead skin that rolls off is shocking.  </li>
            <li> Terrible waste of money!</li>
            <li> Yes, my technique was wrong!  </li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s scary!  </li>
            <li> This is because I am sweating in the water (Weird, huh!  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical!</li>
            <li> It is a bit shocking at how much dead skin a person has to get rid of!</li>
            <li> Meets my expectation every time without fail!</li>
            <li> It is shocking how much dead dirty skin comes off!  </li>

            <li> My stretch marks don&#x27;t even appear as bad as they did before.  </li>
            <li> Aside from that, I have nothing bad to say.  </li>
            <li> It irritated my skin so badly.</li>
            <li> well, maybe it wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought it was.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with ingrown hairs, and they are painful at times.</li>
            <li> Shocked</li>
            <li> I was shocked to see the rolls of skin all over my body, from head to toe.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be shocked at the results.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed :(</li>
            <li> This time I didn&#x27;t notice any pilling and I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> But man this mitt exfoliates like crazy!</li>

            <li> Sadly, this mitten does nothing for me.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the difference between using a shower and tub, but unfortunately I don&#x27;t have access to a bathtub in my tiny apartment.  I have been trying to get this mitt to work for 2 months, and all I get is red skin, I&#x27;ve haven&#x27;t seen anymore than a few flakes come off as of yet, and I can get that with a cheapie $.99 loofah at the dollar store.  I&#x27;ve gone through the directions, followed them to a T, and still...  Really disappointed :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the product once since purchasing it but it&#x27;s been five days since I used it and the results are still amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I bathed for 30 minutes then used the mitten and the amount of dead skin the mitten removed covered the bottom of my bathtub!&lt;br /&gt;I put lotion on immediately after rinsing off my skin with cool water and my skin has stayed smooth and silky for five days so far.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to use it again in two days!</li>
            <li> Used only once, probably didn&#x27;t soak in bath long enough but I am amazed how nice my skin feels.  Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything. Nothing special. Bummed because I wanted this to work.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best beauty investments I have made..I generally take good care of myself..But it really made a difference to the skin appearance immediately..All the dead skin was gone...I would highly recommend it to everyone...</li>
            <li> This worked the first time I used it and my skin just glowed.  Love this product.  Great customer service and lots of good instruction from the seller.</li>
            <li> Great product! Works exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quickly and was followed by additional email instructions to ensure proper use.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect by this product.  I know that exfoliating is important so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only treated half of my body the first time.  I did notice the pilling so I knew it was working.  My skin did feel smooth when I was done... it was a little red as well. I think I need to work on my pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited a little more than a week to treat again.  This time I didn&#x27;t notice any pilling and I was disappointed.  I talked with support and was told that your skin goes through cycles and that sometimes the results may not be as noticeable.  Again, I think I might have rubbed too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, last night I tried it again... and the results were great!!  I also noticed that when I used lighter pressure that there was more pilling.  Maybe I was just rubbing too hard the last time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to use it in conjunction with another product that I found on Amazon, Epsom Salt Sore Muscle Rescue.  I am an athlete and my muscles take a beating.  The bath salts have worked great for me in the past so I decided to use them together.  I soaked about 20 minutes int he Sore Muscle Rescue after using the Baiden Mitten. I slept so well last night and woke up refreshed.  I could hardly tell that I had worked out so hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely continue to use this product and I recommend it to anyone who needs a little exfoliation without harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Baiden Mitten for the last two month, and I&#x27;m not totally satisfied with it&#x27;s performance on my skin.  My torso and thighs respond well to it; however, I have yet to see any exfoliation from my face and legs.  Now, the skin on my face looks a bit tighter, but the dead skin never rolls off.  As far as my legs, I have yet to see any dead skin come off; in fact, I&#x27;m starting to get these &amp;#34;stretch mark&amp;#34; like welts on the inner part of both legs and ankles.  Right now I&#x27;m frustrated and don&#x27;t know what to do; I may have to see a dermatologist.  After seeing some of the videos and &amp;#34;satisfied customers,&amp;#34; I thought this would be one of my answers to beautiful skin, but it&#x27;s a disappointment........back to the drawing board 😔</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t doubt the reviews I read, but I wasn&#x27;t sure how easy it would be and the results on the first use.  My skin after one use feels AMAZING!!!  I&#x27;ve spent thousands of dollars on spas and this does everything I need.  My skin is bright, smooth, soft...very soft!  My stretch marks don&#x27;t even appear as bad as they did before.  I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after a few weeks.  I&#x27;m using a light weight aloe lotion after I use it and didn&#x27;t experience any redness or any skin irritation.  This is my new top gift.</li>
            <li> To be fair, I am basing this review on one use of the Baiden Mitten, after following directions. If I should see more impressive results in the future, I will edit my review. As of now, let me begin by stating that this mitten is extremely over priced. I exfoliate with shower gels such as Caress exfoliating body washes and I exfoliate my face as well; so perhaps I did not see dramatic results due to the fact that I already maintain my skin fairly regularly. This over priced rag, I mean, \\&quot;mitten\\&quot; will probably be the most useful to someone who has never ever exfoliated their skin in their lives, and are generally ignorant of such beauty rituals. And in such a case, a loofah sponge for $2.99 and a back brush, would do the job just as well. There is absolutely no reason at all why a woven rag should cost $50.00! Even one that might be rare or exceptional(which this is not)should not be priced more than twenty bucks. I highly doubt the material used to create this product was so pricey that it could only be profitable to the seller to charge $50.00. Furthermore, my self tanner was streakier than ever after using this product. Normally, my self tans come out fine sometimes a minor streak or two that I can fix. I expected better results with no streaks after using this thing, but no! Streaky results! I absolutely do not recommend purchasing this product. If you have never exfoliated your skin before in your life, then start doing so, but it shouldn&#x27;t be necessary to use a fifty dollar bath rag unless you have skin like a reptile!</li>
            <li> Really helped with my acne. I hope it will work on my stretchmarks.</li>
            <li> This does work. When you first buy it you receive a lengthy email with the history and directions, it does take some prep. You have to soak in a HOT bath for a while to get your skin loose. Then pat yourself dry but not completely. Your skin should be just slightly damp and then you scrub with pressure. If you do it too light nothing will happen. Eventually you will see grey rolls of skin fall off. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, we aren&#x27;t talking giant slabs of skin but enough that you can see your progress. Be careful not to press too hard or you can give your self the equivalent of a razor burn (which I did). I like this but it&#x27;s a lot of effort and I don&#x27;t always have the 1 hr or so to commit to this. However it did help the chicken skin on my arms a lot. I follow up with Amalactin and it keeps them smooth.</li>
            <li> I always thought I had pretty good skin (not a sun person since I am so fair) -and I saw this and thought, wow, this will be a good way to exfoliate before I use my self tanner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used it today for the 1st time, long steamy shower, do not dry off, wet the Mitten with hot water and wring out. Then start exfoliating. I started slowly on my arms and when I saw the dead skin roll (like a snowball) I was shocked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care if you are 20 or 90, we all have dead skin that needs to come off in order for us to have the skin we want!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say, is worth every penny and more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, In my late 40&#x27;s--haven&#x27;t used on my face yet, but will let you know.</li>
            <li> Love the Baiden Mitt!! My skin has never been so smooth, soft and clean! Really helped my pores and blackheads and my legs have never looked better. Great product &amp; great customer service.</li>
            <li> my daughter raved about the mitten so much that I had to try it.  I am not sorry!  My PCP had me see a dermatologist this spring because my skin was so dry.  After the first use, the dryness seemed to diaappear.  This happened when I used lotion, but only temporarily.  It has been days and my skin is wonderful!</li>
            <li> First of all the price is stupid crazy high. So con for that. Because let&#x27;s be real.&lt;br /&gt; But man this mitt exfoliates like crazy! Not sure about blackheads and such. But on my body it does an awesome job. Even if the skin doesnt come off it still is doing something, i can feel the difference. Made my self tanner go on flawless. My shaving is even better.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels really smooth. I am very happy with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with fantastic instructions, so read them and dont be a ding dong! ;) this is one of those tools you must understand and follow the directions to get the max benefits! Lotions or oils  will hinder the mitts ability to work, but again read the info and you cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical when the mitt arrived. However after multiple uses I can definitively say this is THE BEST exfoliator mitt on the market and well worth the money! This helps my self-tanner last much longer than any other mitt. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks now And it is simply amazing! I have suffered from a skin condition called keratosis pilaris for many years now And it makes my skin feel Very bumpy. This mitten has helped dramatically with the texture and quality of my skin. My skin feels much smoother now, and I think with regular use I can achieve the smooth skin I have always trained. I highly recommend this product and it is well worth the price</li>
            <li> This canvas mitt is a complete waste of my hard earned money.  It never did what it claimed which was lift the top light surface of dead skin, rolling it up in little balls, even after soaking for 30 minutes.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The little bit I have used this I like it. I have noticed the tan on my shoulders is lasting longer than usual and I haven&#x27;t peeled after I got a little red.</li>
            <li> I love this mitten.  It truly does exfoliate your skin, unlike the other products out there.  My skin feels silky soft and elastic after I use it.  It also does a better job than any other product of removing sunless tans.  Perfect for anyone who tans regularly!</li>
            <li> Its okay so far, not peeling no where as much as i would like to be. some areas there is no peeling at all. not sure if i am fully sold on this product will have to continue using and see.</li>
            <li> I had been exfoliating weekly with a Moroccan mitt previous to my purchase of this mitten, this mitten puts that and every other one I have used to shame. I was initially skeptical due to the high price, but suffering with stretch marks on my thighs and hips I&#x27;m willing to try anything to relieve some pain and minimize their appearance. I washed using Hibiclens in the shower, then took a hot bath for about 20 minutes before having a go with the moistened and wrung out mitt. I completely freaked out when I was able to roll off my own skin with the mitt! A back and forth motion is essential to achieve these results, circular motions do nothing, and you have to scrub hard. It made my skin tender, especially in the region with the stretch marks at first, but the resulting fresh-feeling skin was worth it. I followed my bath with Bio-Oil to moisturize. My skin has never felt this smooth and I&#x27;m looking forward to trying it on my face, so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;I will be continuing use weekly for the next few months to see if there are any long term benefits to using it on stretch marks, and will update with my results in that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trial Run - Once weekly / June 26th - September 17th 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The purpose of my informal trial run was to identify any positive or negative results on the portions of my skin affected by stretchmarks; I should note that I have very light/fair skin, but I&#x27;d recommend anyone who&#x27;s looking for improved skin tone and texture to try the product.&lt;br /&gt;While this mitten has not been a \\&quot;miracle cure,\\&quot; it has by far been the best investment to treat the appearance of the stretchmarks on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main skin Improvements:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) Skin texture (I initially had deep skin indents along the discolored lines of the marks, and this product is the most effective at smoothing out the texture of those lines working best on my newer/thinner hip stretchmarks. My older/wider thigh stretchmarks have improved smoothnessa lot, but not as quickly as the hips.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) Discoloration (Long-term use faded the newer/thinner stretchmarks on my hips from purple to the silver/grey, making them largely less noticeable than they first were. The purple discoloration of the wider/larger thigh stretchmarks is still visible but to a drastically less degree than to when I first started.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.) Pain (Many people who have been affected by stretchmarks have constant pain/sensitivity associated with what are essentially tears in the skin, I am definitely one of those individuals. While the exfoliation causes super sensitivity initially in the stretchmarks, along with temporary raised red bumps along the lines in my case, in the long term my scars do not hurt as much or often as they did before I started use of the mitten.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Process:&lt;br /&gt;[I should note that both soaking in the bathtub and shower are just as effective a prep for the mitten as long as one spends about 15 minutes in an enclosed space with the buildup of hot steam, the warmer/hot (not scalding) water was essential in my case.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) Step into warm shower and wash with [[ASIN:B00EV1D79A Hibiclens Antimicrobial Skin Liquid Soap, 32 Fluid Ounce]], then rinse completely to ensure a clean and oil free surface to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) Either shower or bathe in hot water allowing the bathroom or shower stall to fill up with unventilated steam for about 15 minutes, usually while taking the time to relax, terrify others in the house with my singing, or pretending to drown my floating plastic bath duck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.) After dousing the Baiden Mitten in warm/hot water wring it out then using forward/backward or side/side motions (essential to see results, circular motions are completely ineffective) I peel the skin off from neck to toe using as much pressure as I feel is necessary (more and for extended duration on stretchmarks). On the areas with stretchmarks I run the mitten back and forth following alongthe indentation lines that had formed on my hips and thighs, finding this to be the most effective.&lt;br /&gt;[Initially when I did this for the first several weeks it was painful on the stretchmarks because my sensitive skin was not used to the product. I scrubbed very hard, and after I exited the shower there were red, raised bumps along the areas affected by stretchmarks. Those bumps faded in a few days after each exfoliation, and now do not appear when I exfoliate.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.) Rinse off dead skin then go about regular shower routine (hair, bodywash, shaving, ect.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.) Use [[ASIN:B004AI97MA Bio-oil 4.2oz]] as a moisturizer on my body. (I should note that I also use [[ASIN:B0009MHJE4 African Shea Butter Cream (100% Pure &amp; Raw, Gold) 8 Oz.]] on my stretchmarks regularly to moisturize.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, this is the best and most effective exfoliating mitt I have ever used. With the consistent use of this product and proper moisturizers I see that I&#x27;m improving the texture of my skin. It is not a miracle cure but was completely worth the purchase price (even though that is high) when regarding the smoothness of my skin and the improvement in the stretchmarks.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this mitten for anyone looking for smoother skin, improved appearance of stretchmarks, or just an actually effective way to slough of dead skin cells. I hope my rant has been of some help to those considering purchase.</li>
            <li> i was very skeptical, but after soaking for a half hour in the tub, the dead skin just rolled off with this mitten. you feel so clean and really able to breathe after using it. skin is sooooo soft too, definitely worth the investment</li>
            <li> It does well to exfoliate but it&#x27;s quite expensive and you need to soak for 10-15 minutes in the bath for it to really work well. There are probably cheaper items that can be bought to receive the same outcome.</li>
            <li> More than I&#x27;ve ever spent on a shower product, and worth every penny. I&#x27;m not exaggerating when I say I didn&#x27;t know my legs could feel like this. I use Lush&#x27;s Dream Cream after exfoliating, and it is seriously dreamy. The level of &amp;#34;customer service&amp;#34; though is a lot... especially when they started calling me. That was a bit too much. But I guess it is encouraging to see a company stand behind their product so strongly.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this thing to work. After exercising, I body brushed (which I&#x27;ve been doing for the last 8 months). Then jumped into a tub of very hot *plain water for 25 minutes.     I dipped the Baiden mitten in hot water and wrung it out the best I could. . The mitten molded to my hand after it was wet. Starting at my feet, I used medium pressure and long vertical strokes to exfoliate. I did not get the rolls of dead skin I so desperately hoped for. The mitten felt like the $4 gloves I&#x27;ve purchasing been from Wal-Mart for the last 9 years.    It was hard to keep from perspiring since I was in the bathroom of hot steam. So, I got out of the tub. Wrung out the mitten again, turned up the air conditioner and exfoliated in the hallway. Thinking that if my body was drier, the mitten could get better traction and pick-up all those dead skin cells eagerly waiting to be sloughed away.    This didn&#x27;t work either. I exfoliated for about 10-15 minutes. Hitting my feet, legs, arms, chest, torso, and back (what I could reach). I did not exfoliate my face. The material just seems too rough for that.     Anywho, so far, this is a bust. My skin feels soft, but it probably would anyway if I turned off the water in the shower and used my gloves for the same length of time.     This will probably be back in the mail. I may give it one more week. I think my technique was good, but maybe I could work on it a little more. I really was hoping this would work.    * Instructions state to use plain water (soaps and oils will make your body to slippery and the Baiden will not be able to grip the skin). Also, you have to soak for at least 15 minutes before using.   Note: If you do not body brush, you may have better results. But, really the exfoliating gloves found at your local retailer could do the job just as well for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful, but too expensive. It helps exfoliate my skin and I have to admint it will feel like baby&#x27;s bottom. The other gloves I have will be too harsh to use it on my face. This is doing exactly what I wanted. The packaging is fantastic, delivery is prompt.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels after I use it.  After one try I could feel the difference and now I can even see the difference. I love this product.  I thank it was well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Have only used once and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.  I&#x27;m sure after using the mitten on a regular basis I will notice a improvement to my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Exfoliates really well!</li>
            <li> After reading such wonderful reviews I couldn&#x27;t resist. I watched the dead skin peel away. My  skin felt do smooth and soft after, it was wonderful. Follow up emails with helpful tips and information are above and beyond. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited when I first discovered the Baiden Mitten, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. I already had a $25 gift card from Amazon so I only paid half price for it, so I figured what the heck might as well. The first time I used it I was pretty impressed, my skin was SUPER SOFT and silky and it was very refreshing. The second time though I wasn&#x27;t so impressed and felt like it didn&#x27;t really do anything, and the same with the third time. I tried a fourth time and used some tips and advice that the seller gave me and the results were great! I&#x27;m really starting to see a difference in my skin. The skin tone is way more even and I have a few scars from having chicken pox as a child that are actually starting to look faded. I would recommend this to anybody, no matter what problems you have with your skin or what results you want, you&#x27;ll be pretty happy with this mitten!!</li>
            <li> At first i bought a cheaper mittin claiming it gave the same results as baiden mittin..Waste of money compaired to baiden..The results are amazing..This product is worth every penny..</li>
            <li> Unique product that smoothes skin completely.  Love this!!!</li>
            <li> My skin is a lot smoother since using this. Helps to keep from having those ugly knees and such when using sunless tanners.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it promises.  I have only exfoliated 2 times, and I am really pleased.  It does make your t skin so soft.  It is pricey, but if it lasts as long as claimed, it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice to buy something that does what it claims.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. My skin was better after the first use! I&#x27;m looking forward to using it often!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin from taking antihistamines for severe allergies most of my life.  I&#x27;ve tried several exfoliating scrubs over the years, but they were to abrasive. I found it hard to get the right balance between getting rid of the dry skin without abraded patches.  The Baiden Mitten is perfect for me! It is so smooth on my skin that it&#x27;s hard to believe it&#x27;s doing the same job as the scrubs. BUT IT DOES!  Plus when I put lotion on after I use it there is no stinging.  My face is red for a short time so I use it at night, but it goes away in a few hours.  I also use it on my arms and legs when I bathe.&lt;br /&gt;The price is less than any exfoliating scrubs I&#x27;ve ever bought and it last for a long time. I love this mitten and highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have been blessed in life with extra dry skin.  Seriously, the Sahara Dessert has more moisture than I do.  The more water I drink, the more lotion I use, the more coconut oil I use topically and internally, the dryer I get.  It&#x27;s a curse.  Seriously.  I look ashy and lazy, but in truth I moisturize daily and drink over 100 oz of water a day just because it is hot, and I am thirsty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, because no other exfoliation has proven effective, I admit I was beyond skeptical when I ordered this product.  However, I have been impressed with how it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, you need to really soak in the water before you use it.  I liken it to a pedicure.  If your nail person just starts scrubbing on your dry feet, some comes off, but they don&#x27;t look nice at all.  However, if she soaks your feet 20 minutes before she takes a pumice stone to your feet, the results are amazing.  The dead skin seems to come off in layers as she scrubs.  This works like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mitt itself feels like a cross between really coarse canvass and sand paper.  I know that sounds painful, but it is not painful at all to use.  It is highly effective to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a special technique to achieving results with this mitt.  Instead of rubbing fast up and down your skin, you need to apply pressure as you slowly pull the mitt up and down your skin.  What you end up with is peeled rolls of all that dried skin weighing you down and making you look old and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, while I have seen amazing results with dry skin, I am more excited to see what results I will achieve long term in regards to scaring, stretch marks and cellulite with this mitt.  I can definitely see that this might well help with cellulite because many massage techniques to remove cellulite include pressure, rubbing in an area, etc.  Simply using this mitt on your skin properly does that, so I think it will be a dual product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely the best skin polisher that I have ever used.  I personally follow up my scrub with a light layer of coconut oil right before bed and use a lotion in the morning.  My skin literally glows the day following exfoliating my skin.  I think this is the best invention since sliced bread!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*******Disclaimer:  I received product in exchange for review.

            <li> This exfoliating mitt got rid of my back acne, scaly elbows, and ingrown hair on my legs. Amazing how much dead skin it  easily removed. Money well spent!</li>
            <li> Terrible waste of money!</li>
            <li> Excellent exfoliator!  Excellent company!  I highly recommend this product - it leaves your skin feeling amazing!</li>
            <li> I read a bazillion reviews of this product and research online before deciding to spend the money for this mitten.  It&#x27;s so expensive but I read review after review that it was worth the price.  Now that I&#x27;ve received it and have seen my skin peel off and become so much smoother I realize why there are so many positive reviews.  It made my face glow.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Use it all the time.</li>
            <li> I spray Tan Alot and after 3 days my tan would crack and freckle. I used the Baiden Mitten once and my spray Tan looks better than it ever has. My skin is so soft and I&#x27;m not even having to moisturize 5x a day like I used to. It it Def worth the money... Your tan will last much longer now.  A+++++</li>
            <li> Please keep in stock! A fantastic natural product that makes your skin lovely....at any age.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this and was so excited to get the results everyone seems to be raving about but this didn&#x27;t impress me.  I soaked in the tub and used long strokes using a good amount of pressure but didn&#x27;t get any better results than I would with a sugar scrub.  And this is an expensive product so you&#x27;d expect a lot more.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the Exfoliation Mitt for one reason.  My skin does feel smoother than if I had not used the Microdermabrasion Tool.</li>
            <li> I thought I WAS exfoliating until I bought this product! You will not believe the difference it makes, the benefits will amaze you. Following the helpful directions makes it so easy to use, my skin is silky smooth and feels especially soft. The mitten is a bit pricey, but well worth it. I definitely will recommend this product, and communication with seller has been exceptional.</li>
            <li> This product is great- not only can it be used on the body, it also can be used on the face.  The company is interactive and gives you many helpful tips in order to maximize the efficiency of the product! It&#x27;s to last for two years or more, so I consider it a worthy investment!</li>
            <li> I never thought anything could get my skin this silky smooth but this does the trick and is so easy to use.  I&#x27;m glad I trusted the positive reviews on Amazon.  I was a little skeptical when I first opened the package and saw a pretty simple looking mitten however I read the instructions and tried it out.  WOW!!  Yes it&#x27;s simple and simply amazing.</li>
            <li> I am a self tanner, and to have a great looking self tan you must exfoliate your skin. The Baiden Mitten is an awesome tool for anyone who wants better looking skin. Now before using the Baiden Mitten I was skeptical, about it. Still I was excited to try it.  Now before using your mitten wash it in plain soapy hot water. Then rinse it. Make sure to squeeze out the water. Oh make sure to rinse it in hot water before each use.  Make sure to be hydrated by drinking lots of water. Water helps to aid in pushing out toxins in your skin.  What I do next is soak in a hot bath as hot as you can take it. Try to stay in that bath at least 20 minutes. Oh wouldn&#x27;t suggest putting any sorts of oils or bubble bath in the water. After soaking stand up in the tub. Get off some the excess water. Put your mitten on, and start with a side ways motion until your arm or body part is fully done. Next rub that same body part briskly in an up &amp; down motion. First time I noticed the rolls of dead skin cells. It was actually shocking as thought my other products were thoroughly exfoliating me, but they were not. I do use the Baiden Mitten once a week from my head to toes. Since I have been using this product my skin looks, and feels better. Have no dry patches on my elbows, knuckles or knees. Those ugly bumps on the back my arms... GONE! Noticed that my self tan looks much better. The application is even, and no streaks! My skin looks better,and feels amazing. I even use less body lotion. Have to say I am 100% happy with the Baiden Mitten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary in exchange for an honest, and fair review.</li>
            <li> Best exfoliation I&#x27;ve ever had! I noticed a difference in the softness in my skin the first time I used it. The seller proactively sent two emails which provided tips for the best exfoliation. I followed the instructions and it worked for me the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for over 2 months, I have tried it in the shower and bath, I don&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin.  I asked my dermatologist and he said that the skin peeling the ad describes would only occur if you are not a frequent bather.  I shower or take a bath everyday so I probably would not see it. He did say that it should improve the circulation in my skin if nothing else.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly. Once a week doesn&#x27;t come soon enough. Love this product. My skin has never looked or felt better.</li>
            <li> I was astonished at how much skin came off, even with gentle strokes. And it feels great!  Very invigorating.  I also really appreciate the personal customer service of the seller.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on this product, and the first couple of times I did struggle with it–only getting little rolls of skin here and there. After a few uses though, man I was on a roll. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and it does soften up a little with additional use. Initially the fabric had been a little stiff. I have fairly sensitive skin and thus exfoliating scrubs don&#x27;t work very well for me, but I had no issues with this causing any lasting irritation or skin damage. The key is long straight strokes with a firm even pressure. This product works wonderfully on my legs and arms, but I seem to struggle using it on my sides or breasts which are a little softer which was a touch disappointing because these are also the areas where I have stretch marks and it would have been nice to see the stretch marks on my bosom disappear so I cannot comment on it&#x27;s effectiveness in this area.</li>
            <li> I have taken 6 soaking baths, up to 45 minutes each, and have barely gotten any skin off, much less see rolls.  Maybe I will look around and see if there is some specific instructions for technique because so far it has been a time, money and effort waster at my house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I emailed the seller and she sent me more detailed instructions.  Yes, my technique was wrong!  I was using like sandpaper, quick up and down motions.  She instructed me to use deliberate up and down motions with pressure.  The skin rolled off just like promised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> Great product. No complaints wish I would have purchased sooner well worth the money, it feels like you have new skin after using the mitten! Highly recommend to anyone that loves the feeling of having silky soft skin.</li>
            <li> I have not used this since I bought it for my daughter, but she raves about it! It has helped clear her skin and WOW her skin is so soft!</li>
            <li> i am the ultimate consumer and buy lots of everything.  this mitten is an most amazing product.  i am throwing away my loofas, special wash clothes, exfoliating creams and a dermabrasion machine.  i just placed an order for another mitt.</li>
            <li> This thing is a-maz-za-zing!  All of the reviews you read on it - true!  The first time I used it - I was disgusted by how skin rolled up. Egghhh! But when I was done, dabbed a little tea tree oil on my skin. I felt baby skin soft.  I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my skin.  I literally threw away ALL of the body scrubs that I had in my shower! Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Package arrived on time. Great product! I have had very good results. The Baiden Mitten has made a difference in the appearance and feel of my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the mitten once and it did not work, but I&#x27;m not giving up hope because I was told it could take a few times.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money</li>
            <li> Was amazed at how much dead skin actually came off after my initial use. Followed exact directions and was pleased with results.  The customer service was exceptional!!</li>
            <li> Great product I&#x27;ve recommended it to everyone I know and have bought some for gifts. I especially like the advice from Victoria it&#x27;s very helpful</li>
            <li> I finally got to use my Baiden, it really is amazing. I&#x27;m not getting paid to write this nor anything. I am genuinely surprised at how much dead skin was on my Baiden mitt,  my skin feels smooth and rejuvenated.  I heard about this while listening to z100, when Carla Marie said you have to have this, I kid you not I ran to my ipad and ordered 2.  A little pricey but definitely worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You for your amazing product.  I will spread the word.</li>
            <li> Works as described.  Very glad I finally ordered!</li>
            <li> The Baiden Mitten is an awesome exfoliation tool! I have tried other exfoliation gloves in the past but they pale in comparison. This is definately worth money. It is supposed to last about two years, so if you break it down you really aren&#x27;t paying all that much for the type of results you will get.  This mitten peals those dead skin cells off and reveals the new skin underneath. It is perfect for getting ready for using self tanning. It&#x27;s kind of shocking how much skin comes off, but in a good way. Summer is coming and this is going to get me ready to put shorts on and show off my legs!  After I use it it feels like I have lotion on my skin is so smooth but it is just my skin! Then I apply lotion and my legs look and feel awesome! I haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet to see if it will help with my cellulite but I am really hopeful since it has lived up to it&#x27;s other promises.  This will take a bit of practice but well worth the effort. They send you instructions which are very helpful. Take the time to read and follow them and I am sure you will love this product as much as I do.  I would recommend giving the Baiden Mitten a try. You will be glad you did!   Check out this youtube video of how to use your new mitten:  https://youtu.be/-kPT0z32iit   *I received this product free to test and give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a lot better at exfoliating than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;m pleased with it and the money was well-spent and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used it three times.  The third time I felt like it removed a lot of dead cells.  I will continue to work with this ...once a week as per the instructions.  When I get my WOW moment I will let you know.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying my Baiden Mitten very much and feel, finally, there is hope for my skin! At 63 it is so nice to have something that really adds to making me feel fabulous.Truly. After using it two times there is such a difference in my skin and I can&#x27;t wait to use it again! The skin on my face now feel like &#x27;skin&#x27; and even the super tough places, i.e., feet, feel wonderful. Gone is the itchy, alligator scaled skin on my legs. My super dry hand are improved, everything. The mitten even smoothed out my lips, which have always been chapped, and I think they are even plumper than before--which says a lot as they have been getting thinner and thinner as I get older. (Is that my imagination? But I think they do look naturally plumber....) I even think the mitten has helped with my energy levels and metabolism...using it makes me feel invigorated. I&#x27;m envious of those women who have known about this fantastic beauty aid and have been using it for years...but I&#x27;m on the journey now and thrilled.</li>
            <li> At first I&#x27;m sure I didn&#x27;t do it right because no dead skin was coming off much. I think I got it down now and it really makes my skin smooth. Husband and I love the results on my skin.</li>
            <li> I think this product actually works, however I&#x27;m sure you could get it at a much cheaper price, this is definitely not worth $50.</li>
            <li> No matter how hard I tried, it did not work for me like other people and I read many reviews, instructions etc. and followed them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it 4 times now, carefully following the instructions.  I really haven&#x27;t seen much in the way of results.</li>
            <li> Really lightweight.  Love it</li>
            <li> As someone who already exfoliates regularly and uses products containing glycolic acid the Baiden Mitten wasn&#x27;t as amazing as everyone made it out to be. It&#x27;s better than the bath gloves I have from The Body Shop, but this product is many times more expensive for only a marginal improvement. I was concerned that I wasn&#x27;t using it properly, but after some tweaking of technique I was able to get the visible dead skin rolls, but only from my underarm area while everywhere else stayed the same. I also didn&#x27;t see a drastic improvement in my keratosis pilaris on the backs of my arms, which I was really hoping for. I&#x27;m planning to keep my Baiden Mitten, but I wouldn&#x27;t see the benefit necessary for me to shell out the money again when this one wears out.</li>
            <li> I live in Montana and am very fair skinned, so I wanted to buy some good self-tanner before I take a trip to the Virgin Islands and blind everyone with my white legs.  After doing some research on self-tanners, I found several people who recommended using a baiden mitten before tanning.  I decided to splurge and get one and make sure my tan goes on right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, I am really impressed.  I didn&#x27;t honestly expect the mitten to do much to my skin other than prep it for a nice layer of tanner.  I used it on my whole body and I was really, really surprised when the next day I noticed that my shoulders were very soft and smooth.  My whole life my shoulder area has been slightly rough and bumpy.  No more!  And I&#x27;ve always used a loofah and bath brush on my back and shoulders.  I don&#x27;t know exactly why this is so different, but boy, it worked.  I&#x27;ll use it forever now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the tan is fabulous, too!</li>
            <li> Very, very happy! I am still amazed by how well this works! Better than any other I have ever purchased! Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice, but see a big difference in my skin.  My skin is so dry, it flakes terribly even with lotions made for really dry skin.  My skin doesn&#x27;t flake now even without the lotion.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but it works exactly the way it says it will. The dead skin rolls off leaving your skin so soft. After two uses on my arms my little bumps disappeared. I do think the price is pretty steep but it works!</li>
            <li> I just received my mitten and used it for the first time today. I must say that I was skeptical before getting this but now I am a mitten lover!! When you first use your mitten and start rubbing make sure your skin in slightly wet but not too wet, there needs to be some friction to make the skin roll..if you start off too wet it wont work. When the skin starts to roll off just keep going, resist rinsing off the mitten. I had to put a fair amount of pressure before I saw results, maybe everyone is different so see how much pressure works for you..reddening of the skin is supposed to happen so don&#x27;t worry that your pressing too hard. Wow, what a difference!! My skin is sooo soft and smooth, I can&#x27;t wait to see what it looks like in a month!! If your debating getting this DON&#x27;T every woman and man should have this mitten!!</li>
            <li> Follow the instructions from the Kooee seller follow-up emails and you will not be disappointed~ this product exceeded my expectations~ and I&#x27;m am over the moon with the results! The first time it does work, but as promised, it indeed works more thoroughly over time~ in 2 yrs, I will certainly be buying another one! Just had a professional facial at&lt;br /&gt;A luxury spa &amp; resort~ the esthetician said my skin was \\&quot;lovely\\&quot; &amp; she had NO skin product recommendations from the multiple skin line products they sell! It was an amazing feeling!!!</li>
            <li> After reading all the positive comments about the Baiden Mitten, I decided I wanted to try one.  It arrived promptly and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After following the instructions to soak in a very hot tub for 10 to 15 minutes I started exfoliating.  I didn&#x27;t think it was doing much until I looked at all the dead skin on the floor.  Wow, this thing really works!  I can&#x27;t wait until a week is up so I can do it again.  In addition to the product there was a link for an ebook with more information and testimonials.  I haven&#x27;t finished reading it yet but I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking this would make a great Christmas present for female family members.</li>
            <li> This product got some good reviews so I decided to give it a try.  It was a little pricey, but I do notice a difference.  My skin, especially my face, is noticeably smoother.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time over the weekend and my skin feels very soft and I definitely notice a difference in the way my skin looks.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product!!! I was a little unsure if it was worth the price but it DEFINITELY is worth every penny! I am naturally pale and have very sensitive skin but the Baiden Mitten works amazingly. My dead, dry skin rolled off easily after a hot shower. My skin feels so soft and I&#x27;m already beginning to see the fading of some impurities on my skin. I overall feel better! Furthermore, the Baiden Mitten exfoliated my skin so well that I had the most even airbrush tan ever! Before the Baiden Mitten, I used all kinds of sugar scrubs and such but I don&#x27;t need any of that now!! I don&#x27;t even use lotion after exfoliating with the Baiden Mitten and my skin is super soft. This really is a miracle product. Let me also add that their customer service and friendly e-mails/instructions are excellent. It is so nice to see a company that really cares about it&#x27;s product and their customers. &amp;#60;3 Thank you, Baiden Mitten!</li>
            <li> Great exfoliation mitt, lots of helpful instructions and follow up from seller.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how much dead skin came off after the first use! It left my skin feeling smooth and feeling healthy.</li>
            <li> The bath worked better for me on this than a hot shower. You really need to get that top layer of dead skin hydrated for it to roll off correctly. My skin is amazingly soft now. Upper arm bumps totally gone after just one use!</li>
            <li> Using the Baiden Mitten was the most incredible experience!  I never knew I could rub that much dead skin off my body in one sitting. As I looked in the mirror the very next day, after my first use, I was shocked to see that my stretch marks from my four children were so diminished that I stood there wondering if they were ever really as bad as I&#x27;d once thought they were...because how could they look so much better then I&#x27;d ever remembered them looking?  While I love my children, I don&#x27;t wear my stretch marks proudly.  I wear them under my clothing, away from public view.  But I could actually see that a bikini might not be off limits this summer.  And the craziest thing is that my youngest is already 6 years old.  These aren&#x27;t new marks.  I confirmed with my husband, who was shocked too, that yes, my stretch marks had been much more noticeable then before my first use!  The only thing I need more info on is why my face doesn&#x27;t peel when I use the Mitten on it. It is so amazingly smooth and my fine lines are starting to fade (yeah!), but I&#x27;ve yet to see one tiny rolled up piece of skin come off my face when I use the Mitten. Thank you for bringing me a product I never knew existed!  I&#x27;ve already had one friend order one while she was staying with me for a visit!  Had it shipped to my house because she was so excited to try it.</li>
            <li> I love, love ,love this. It works flawlessly. The trick is to use it in the shower and just step out of the water when you rub it against your skin. Idk how I&#x27;ve lived without it. Update: I&#x27;ve Owned this for 3 years, it still works perfect.</li>
            <li> I bought this mitt after reading a few dozen of the reviews. I can not say the price was attractive, I think it is WAY too much for what you get but this thing works like a dream. I love it. Normal exfoliaters, whether it is a scrub or loofah style item has never cut thru the dead skin that I would try and use my hands to remove in the past. There is a creepy yet awesome satisfaction in seeing all the rolls of dead skin that accumulate on the mitt, skin and shower floor. I have super pale fair skin and dirt on me sticks to my dead skin and makes me look dirty. Totally not a good look on me. Like to keep the outside dirt-free and my mind in the gutter, always :)</li>
            <li> This is the BEST exfoliation product I have ever used. I have been an avid user of microdermabrasion cloths for years...this is ten times better than any of those and the more I use it the better the results. When I bought it I thought, 50 bucks are you kidding me (I felt guilty)....I can&#x27;t believe the amount of skin that comes off when I use this. It is amazing how much dead skin you carry around yuk. I also use coconut oil and shea butter to moisturize and it penetrates better now. also if you have pore bumps from years of shaving this will do the trick... I will never be without one of these... :)</li>
            <li> I love the product! It&#x27;s a bit pricey but really does the job. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and very satisfied. Only hope it will last for at least a year.</li>
            <li> Here is the thing, it may work but you get a full page of instructions on how to get it to work, and you need these instructions. You have to prep and do it just right and do it a lot to get the ball rolling so to speak. It is way too much of a hassle. Expensive lesson to learn. A sugar or salt scrub are much, much, much easier to use and just as effective!</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, make sure to buy a Baiden name brand mitten (this exact product) and not a cheap knockoff. I bought a cheap one first and wasted $10 USD on a subpar product. With this product, the brand matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, make sure you soak in clean water for a while (don&#x27;t shampoo/condition/soap up, etc), step out of the water, and don&#x27;t towel dry before you start scrubbing. The first time I used the mitten I towel-dried my skin (after not carefully reading the instructions) and my skin didn&#x27;t come off in rolls, but the second time I left my skin wet and had a huge mess in my bathtub from all the rolls of dead skin (but it was a good thing!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mitten is a bit hard to use, because it requires some manual labor and exertion for good results. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this mitten for the very elderly or (maybe some) disabled folks, or just anyone who isn&#x27;t physically fit enough to rub their body pretty hard. It is a little bit of a workout for me to rub my skin with the mitten so hard and fast, even though I am young (24) and relatively fit. I get sweaty and honestly start smelling bad while using the mitten and take a cold shower after. Maybe it will get easier with time, I don&#x27;t know. But I don&#x27;t mind having a good reason to sweat. It&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all those disclaimers in there, I have to say the RESULTS are OUTSTANDING! The skin on my entire body is a lot shinier and more healthy-looking, and feels more alive. After you scrub with the mitten, your legs look and feel like you have lotion on 24/7, so I never wear lotion anymore. I hated the slimy feeling of most lotions anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the mitten because I was worried about some premature wrinkles (on my forehead, around my nose and eyes) and some leathery-looking skin on my shoulders from being out in the sun too much without sunscreen, and scrubbing with the mitten has made it all a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure about the scars and cellulite claims but I have only used it twice. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it did actually help with those things. I have some cellulite on the back of my legs (who doesn&#x27;t?), some serious abdominal scars from having my gallbladder removed, and some light stretch marks from getting tall very fast. I will update if I feel like it helps long-term with those problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the mitten has given me dramatically softer, shiner, firmer, more beautiful skin, and more shallow wrinkles, I would say the Baiden mitten is a must-buy for every woman (and man that cares about their skin looking awesome!!!).</li>
            <li> 7/24/15- I don&#x27;t think this mitten works at all. I did research. I watched videos on you tube. I have been following the instructions and nothing has happened yet. So far not worth the money. I will give it one last shot and will update review. I was really hoping it would work :(</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  Exfoliates very well and the customer follow up is amazing!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard about the Baiden Mitten for a while now, and finally decided to take the plunge despite the cheaper alternatives out there. I am so glad I did--I know everyone says they&#x27;re surprised by the amount of skin that comes off, but holy cats, I had no idea there was SO MUCH. It&#x27;s a bit pricey for what it is, but I think it&#x27;s worth it and I would (and probably will) buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love love love this!! Took a minute to get it right but awesome! Trick is to scrub with a deodorant soap first face and all then soak in hot bath for at least ten minutes then scrub with baiden, all the impurities just roll off I actually love doing this after a work out. It is a process but so worth it!! I can already see luminosity in my skin!!!</li>
            <li> I was worried that I was going to throw away 50 dollars to the trash, but I was happily surprised that it works! I highly recommend it! my skin felt cleaner, and softer after the first use.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing mitt, my skin feels like a young girls again. It is starting to help with my circulation which is great since I an bed ridded,</li>
            <li> This mitten does what it says it will do.  I found out there were other mittens made the same and are just as good, so do your homework prior to purchasing this.  I don&#x27;t regret buying this one, I just could have saved a lot of money. I do like the exfoliation I get from this mitten and how soft and smooth my skin is afterwards.  You must follow directions exactly in order to get results, so read the directions.</li>
            <li> Love this!  I tried it out with the directions provided and it worked like a charm!  I used this followed up by a self tanner for my upcoming vacation and my tan never looked so even.</li>
            <li> I have just received the Baiden mitten and have used it twice. It is by far the best skin product I have ever purchased. The dead skin rolled off me as promised and my skin feels baby smooth and soft. The follow up emails from the company giving me tips on how to use it and properly care for also impress me.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it 2 - 3 times a week while in the shower and there is a MAJOR difference in all the ugly little age spots/freckles on my hands and face and while the cellulite on my thighs isn&#x27;t gone, it is definitely smoother.  The only area I don&#x27;t use it on is under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently using Keri lotion after my shower but does anyone know if there is a different product to use after exfoliating?</li>
            <li> The best $50 I&#x27;ve ever spent on a beauty product. It&#x27;s only been a few weeks, but the stretch marks I&#x27;ve had on my hips since puberty are now practically invisible. Eliminates blackheads. Great for ingrown hairs and cellulite. Delivery was fast. Customer service was amazing. I&#x27;m caught between wanting to tell EVERYONE about the baiden mitten and a selfish desire to keep it all for myself. I&#x27;ve always been a pretty obsessive about exfoliation; I used to dry brush every morning, use a clarisonic on my face, and exfoliating gloves in the shower. The baiden mitten is so, so, so much better.</li>
            <li> THis product is awesome. Just don&#x27;t over do it! This seller gives great tips on how to use it and she really cares if it works for you.</li>
            <li> This mitt is fantastic. Learn how to use it (long soak or end of shower, damp not wet skin, long stokes not circles) and you will be pleased with the results. As with many reviewers I experienced the dead skin rolls but the real bonus was how nice and fresh my skin felt afterwards. The texture is improved and lotions just glide on and absorb well. I have been having a little trouble with KP  which is very much improved (almost gone!) after five or so uses. I suppose that one side effect of all the exfoliation is if you want to keep all that newly discovered skin fresh and healthy you had better break out the sunscreen, Chapstick and Lubriderm ....</li>
            <li> Only reason I am giving this product 4 stars is because for me personally, I don&#x27;t think it works as well as it should even though I&#x27;ve followed all the directions and take care of it properly. I use it about once a week [if I have the time and am not feeling lazy]. I usually take a hot bath or shower for 15/20 minutes, scrub with this and then get back in the shower to rinse of the residue left behind and do all my other business. I have indeed noticed an improvement in the texture of my skin, especially on chest and the backs of my arms. It has also helped smooth my lips and make my eyes look no so dry.</li>
            <li> Results not what I expected.  Also leaves skin feeling irritated</li>
            <li> I recently stumbled onto the baiden mitten after reading about it in a review for self tanner.  At first I thought $50 for a bath mit was a little steep, but oh is it ever so much more than that! I have only used it twice so far and have had amazing results!  The amount of dead skin that rolls off is shocking.  What is left is smooth as a baby! I followed the instructions exactly and it worked like a charm.  The company is very helpful, providing lots of tips.  It is quite unusual to get that level of customer service these days.  They have been great! I have never seen a similar product.  I&#x27;m sure this will pay for itself many times over in the amount of other treatments/procedures I won&#x27;t be needing from  my dermatologist!  I have recommended it to all of my friends and family.  It is well worth it!</li>
            <li> I originally bought my Baiden mitten after reading an excellent and popular review for a self-tanning product, in which the author said she used the Baiden to slough before doing her tanning.  Although I had apprehensions about buying such an expensive mitt, I did want to try it and do everything she had done to get that great tan.  I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t think of it before I ordered the mitten, but once I received it, I immediately remembered the Korean cloths for sloughing that we had used when I grew up (I&#x27;m half Korean). They&#x27;re called Korean Italy cloths, for some strange reason, and as I read on further about how the Baiden would roll off strings of dead skin after a soak in a hot tub, I already knew that the Korean cloths did that as well--very effectively, in fact, and for a helluva lot less money--so, I sent my Baiden back without even trying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s important to point out that I don&#x27;t at all dispute the excellent exfoliating abilities of the Baiden mitten.  From what I&#x27;ve seen and felt, I really have no doubt whatsoever that the Baiden is a high quality product that does what it says, beautifully.  Having said that, though, here&#x27;s why you might want to consider trying one of these Korean cloths yourself before (or in lieu of) trying the Baiden mitt:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, Korean Italy cloths are fairly easy to find, and are monumentally cheaper than the Baiden--you can buy them in any Korean market, on eBay, or even here on Amazon.  I bought mine on eBay for $1.15 ea. + free shipping, but I&#x27;ve seen some that are sold here on Amazon for $8 or $9 and as high as $20, depending on the configuration and quantity...but none nearly so expensive as the $50 Baiden. If you try the KI cloth and don&#x27;t like it, you&#x27;re only out a few bucks, and can still move on to the Baiden without feeling you&#x27;ve been ripped off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cheapest Korean Italy cloths I&#x27;ve found were the ones I bought from eBay; however, it should be noted that every one of my shipments from eBay (I ordered several different variations, from several different vendors) took a couple of weeks to receive. As it turns out, they all came straight from Korea. If you are impatient to get them for the sake of getting started asap with your tan, consider ordering here on Amazon, where you can find quicker shipping times, including a few that qualify for Amazon Prime shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A second reason to consider the Korean Italy cloth is that it is completely machine washable, and lasts for YEARS.  Speaking personally, this is an important feature, as both the cloth and the mitt MUST capture lots of DNA (aka, dead skin) in its crevices, so I would most definitely want to be able to wash it. Alas, the Baiden has conflicting reviews as to whether it&#x27;s machine washable (although I did read one review from a person who said that they used a touch of laundry soap on it from time to time). I&#x27;ve even read negative reviews on the Baiden by some that said it became moldy.  I&#x27;ll presume that those were simply due to poor care, but regardless, lack of washability would be a deal-breaker for me, personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my original post, a few people commented that they&#x27;d tried the Korean Italy cloth and found it far too harsh for their skin, and several did not feel the KI cloths were suitable for exfoliating the face.  It&#x27;s important to know that the Korean Italy cloths are available in varying levels of coarseness, and the color of the cloth typically denotes the level of coarseness:&lt;br /&gt;a) Blue is the most coarse, for heavy-duty sloughing on the tougher parts of your body, like arms and legs.  Many will find this level unsuitable for any part of their body.&lt;br /&gt;b) Green is medium, and what I most commonly use.&lt;br /&gt;c) Pink is mild coarseness, and what I&#x27;ve used on my face personally to exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;d) Occasionally you&#x27;ll find a red one, which is medium coarseness.&lt;br /&gt;e) There are a few two-sided colors as well:&lt;br /&gt;i) Yellow comes with one side in mild coarseness, the other is medium.&lt;br /&gt;ii) If you can find a plaid one, that comes with heavy coarseness on one side, and medium on the other. So if you buy a yellow and a plaid, you&#x27;ve got every grade of coarseness in two cloths, for about $2.30.&lt;br /&gt;f) If you find any other colors, the packaging should indicate how course it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to close my review with some exfoliating tips, but before I did that I wanted to add that I am not affiliated with any Korean Italy cloth company whatsoever.  I would imagine that just about any Korean who might stumble upon this product might have the exact same thought process as I did.  I will say, though, that I had put up a review a year or two ago about the Baiden mitten that received a lot of likes and comments, but I discovered today (3/24/15) that it&#x27;s not up anymore.  Not sure how or when that happened.  I supposed it&#x27;s possible I might&#x27;ve accidentally deleted it myself, as I do check my reviews from time to time and even edit or update...but I&#x27;d be lying if I said it didn&#x27;t--at least for a moment--make me go, &amp;#34;Hmmmm....&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**********&lt;br /&gt;Tips For Using The Cloth:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Koreans have been using these cloths for years to exfoliate. My Korean mom used to call it &amp;#34;shining&amp;#34; her skin, and she swore it was the reason her skin was so soft. Some exfoliating tips, and tips for using the cloth:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- When exfoliating, be sure to soak in a tub of hot water for at least 1/2 hr (until your fingers and toes are pruned) before exfoliating, or your skin might not slough off as much as you&#x27;d like. This is true whether you are using a Baiden mitt or a Korean Italy cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Make sure that there are no bath salts, lotions, creams, or anything else but plain water that you soak in, or the dead skin will not peel off properly. Make the water as hot as you can tolerate comfortably.  Additionally, if you wear lotions or creams, you might actually want to take a quick shower with soap BEFORE SOAKING IN THE TUB, to wash the lotion off.  Lotion makes the skin too slick to slough off, so you need to eliminate it before attempting to exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The Korean Italy cloths can be found in a variety of different configurations, including a mitt, but the one I recommend also happens to be the cheapest and most ubiquitous: that is, a pocket, into which you insert a folded, wet but wrung-out wash cloth, to give it some substance to hold onto.  Dragging the rolled cloth across your skin, scrub your skin in long strokes. Just like with the Baiden mitten, you should be able to roll strings of dead skin off of your skin surface as you do this. This is what the KI pocket looks like:  [[ASIN:B00LGLOKLM Korean Exfoliating Bath Washcloth [4 pcs] (Green) by TeChef Home]]  Since there are so many different configurations of the KI cloth, I&#x27;ve also spotted KI pockets that are larger in size, for you to insert your hand into, like the Baiden.  This configuration is not as cheap as the smaller pocket that accepts the wash cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- When laundering the cloth, although it&#x27;s okay to throw it into any load, keep in mind that fabric softener might neutralize a little bit of its coarseness.  I recommend washing without the use of any softener.  Conversely, though, if you are looking to make your cloth just a tad less rough and scratchy (say, for facial exfoliating), then go ahead and try the softener.e in mild coarseness, the other is medium.&lt;br /&gt;ii) If you can find a plaid one, that comes with heavy coarseness on one side, and medium on the other. So if you buy a yellow and a plaid, you&#x27;ve got every grade of coarseness in two cloths, for about $2.30.&lt;br /&gt;f) If you find any other colors, the packaging should indicate how course it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to close my review with some exfoliating tips, but before I did that I wanted to add that I am not affiliated with any Korean Italy cloth company whatsoever.  I would imagine that just about any Korean who might stumble upon this product might have the exact same thought process as I did.  I will say, though, that I had put up a review a year or two ago about the Baiden mitten that received a lot of likes and comments, but I discovered today (3/24/15) that it&#x27;s not up anymore.  Not sure how or when that happened.  I supposed it&#x27;s possible I might&#x27;ve accidentally deleted it myself, as I do check my reviews from time to time and even edit or update...but I&#x27;d be lying if I said it didn&#x27;t--at least for a moment--make me go, &amp;#34;Hmmmm....&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**********&lt;br /&gt;Tips For Using The Cloth:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Koreans have been using these cloths for years to exfoliate. My Korean mom used to call it &amp;#34;shining&amp;#34; her skin, and she swore it was the reason her skin was so soft. Some exfoliating tips, and tips for using the cloth:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- When exfoliating, be sure to soak in a tub of hot water for at least 1/2 hr (until your fingers and toes are pruned) before exfoliating, or your skin might not slough off as much as you&#x27;d like. This is true whether you are using a Baiden mitt or a Korean Italy cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Make sure that there are no bath salts, lotions, creams, or anything else but plain water that you soak in, or the dead skin will not peel off properly. Make the water as hot as you can tolerate comfortably.  Additionally, if you wear lotions or creams, you might actually want to take a quick shower with soap BEFORE SOAKING IN THE TUB, to wash the lotion off.  Lotion makes the skin too slick to slough off, so you need to eliminate it before attempting to exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The Korean Italy cloths can be found in a variety of different configurations, including a mitt, but the one I recommend also happens to be the cheapest and most ubiquitous: that is, a pocket, into which you insert a folded, wet but wrung-out wash cloth, to give it some substance to hold onto.  Dragging the rolled cloth across your skin, scrub your skin in long strokes. Just like with the Baiden mitten, you should be able to roll strings of dead skin off of your skin surface as you do this.

            <li> over priced and over hyped :(</li>
            <li> Great customer service and a nice product. I haven&#x27;t been able to see skin &amp;#34;peel off&amp;#34; as advertised, but it does leave my skin nice and smooth. Not sure if I would spend again, but overall it&#x27;s a nice addition to my beauty routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the mitt one time so far and I&#x27;mvery pleased! It performed just as was promised....i couldn&#x27;t stop touching my smooth skin the rest of the night, lol. I can&#x27;t wait to see the effect after using for a while. love having this anti aging weapon in my arsenal:)</li>
            <li> The best thing ever my skin feels like silk and you can see the dirt rolling off this product deserve a 10 star</li>
            <li> This product really delivers! Easily took off many layers of dead skin, plus when used on the face (yes it&#x27;s safe!) my expression lines dissapeared!</li>
            <li> I read a review on refinery 29 and decided to purchase on a whim. I have used the mitten twice, and it is AMAZING!!! I would highly recommend buying one of your own. I&#x27;ve already told all of my friends/coworkers.</li>
            <li> I took a 15 min.soak just like suggested and literally saw the dead skin peel off. I thought I wouldn&#x27;t have much, being young and having very tight skin,but I did and it was awesome! It took forever to get the whole process done, but it was worth it, would just like to say that you should probably do this on a day off because the first time took me an hour. My skin felt very moist afterwards(no need for lotion, even though I used coconut oil), it was an incredible feeling. I exfoliated my face as well as legs, arms, stomach, and back and didn&#x27;t see too much result from my face, but it&#x27;s only been one exfoliation, so maybe next time. Overall I&#x27;m VERY impressed and the baiden mitten is 100% worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical when buying this because to pay that much money for a mitt sounds crazy but with all the positive reviews I thought I would give it a try. It works well beyond my initial expectation. I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and use it about once a week and it doesn&#x27;t show any signs of wear. I&#x27;m pretty sure it will last several years. I also recommended it to my sister who bought one about a week ago and has used it once and absolutely loved it. Needless to say, I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> My skin is soft &amp; silky and I&#x27;ve only been using it three weeks. Excellent product</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!!! Could not believe how much dead skin came off....dramatic improvements!</li>
            <li> It takes some getting used to, but it works. I have a problem with ingrown hairs, and they are painful at times. The Baiden Mitten works but you need to prepare for an uncomfortable first use. Aside from that, I have nothing bad to say.  It does what it says it will in getting rid of dead skin,  and does so rather effectively.</li>
            <li> Used only once but i already see and feel a difference!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome, took my dry cracked heals to a smooth surface.....heard about it on the Elvis Duran show... Thanks Victoria</li>
            <li> Fully lived up to its reputation! Best purchase I have made in a long time! My skin has improved so much, its amazing. Thank you Baiden mitten!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not any better than other exfoliating gloves I&#x27;ve tried. Definitely not worth the price for what it does.</li>
            <li> Only used this once as you aren&#x27;t suppose to use more than once a week. But... I love it already! It&#x27;s amazing and I regularly exfoliated before, but this is entirely different! I can&#x27;t wait to see results long term.</li>
            <li> This mitt is incredible and work exactly like the the website said. I was astonished how much dead skin came off the FIRST time I used it. I highly recommend the Baiden mitt.</li>
            <li> This product WORKS for me and I totally support it. I will recommend to friends who have similar needs. Thanks for the detailed guide. Nevertheless, the post sales service is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked on this product. I was told once that I produce a lot of skin cells ( I get flakes not dry skin) I also have very pliable skin as in its not very firm. Its always been that way I&#x27;m only in my 20&#x27;s and even at my skinniest (100pounds)I had visible cellulite. I started using this about a year or so ago and I can tell a big difference in the visibility of the cellulite on my legs. My skin stays super soft with a little love from this mitten. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever used an exfoliator that works so well. Loofas get smelly and weaken and brushes can be to harsh for my skin but this thing works great. I use it once a week or up to every other day and its still going strong after almost a year of use... I would recommend this to everyone. Just be careful not to scrub any raw spots into your skin and fallow the directions closely.</li>
            <li> I have tried lotions and potions, procedures and creams and massage. NOTHING has worked like the Baiden. My skin has completely changed thanks to this magic mitten.</li>
            <li> ALL of the pictures on the internet are true to this product. Your dead skin and gunk will roll off your body with each exfoliation. I&#x27;ve gotten great results after a hot 10 minute shower rather than a soak in the bath, but one day when I have access to a nice tub, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be incredible.</li>
            <li> They spend a lot of effort teaching you how to use this correctly. It wasn&#x27;t hard at all for me.&lt;br /&gt;It works fabulously.</li>
            <li> Works great! Never had my skin this smooth!! A great purchase!</li>
            <li> Really like this mitten. Great for skin.  Skin feels really soft after use.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It works great.  The people who reported problems probably weren&#x27;t following the directions properly.  It didn&#x27;t work for me the first time either because I tried to rush the process.  The second time was great.  Someone actually asked me if I had had a laser treatment on my face because my skin looked so good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like having a pedi-egg for your whole body.</li>
            <li> I love the Baiden mitten not only because it make my skin feel good but gives my whole body a great massage, which increases circulation.</li>
            <li> Love this mitten!!!  I was amazed at the skin that just rolled off.  My skin has never been this soft!!</li>
            <li> Works well although $$$. However for tanners great because you&#x27;ll get the most out of your tanning dollars.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore my Baiden Mitten! It makes my skin feel ridiculously soft, and It&#x27;s fascinating watching the skin roll right off of you. It is definitely a life changer.</li>
            <li> Kind of tricky to keep it on.  It did exfoliate a couple of places on my body.  Perhaps I simply did not need much exfoliating.  The process of getting moist but not too wet is a bit cumbersome.  It did not make enough of a difference for me to keep using it.</li>
            <li> Great product and super service!</li>
            <li> Marian&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for my daughter so she could prep her skin before applying her bronzing mousse. She said it was the best things she has ever used.</li>
            <li> This product does not work. I followed the instructions and absolutely nothing was removed. My wash cloth removes more than this. I cannot believe I wasted my money on this rough mitten.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s making my skin smoother, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m doing something wrong, I don&#x27;t get any skin rolling off of me.  I rub till my skin is bright red and nothing.  I will keep trying.  I have KP  (keratosis pilaris) so any type of exfoliating helps.</li>
            <li> I just picked up my mitten 2 days ago and I have used it only once on my chest (a lot of sun damage) AMAZING!! within second the mit was removing a ton of dead old skin:) My chest has a ways to go but I think with continued use I will be very impressed, my skin feels amazing too..can&#x27;t wait for tonight, I&#x27;m gonna use it all over, money well spent I think:)</li>
            <li> i love it and use it once a week it works wonders.plus makes your skin feeling smooth and clean!! best investment ever</li>
            <li> This product simply did not do as advertised. I ordered it and began using it frequently, trying different methods and looking at the positive feedback to determine what I could have been doing wrong. Turns out I was doing everything right. These people will take your money, spam your email address, and then force Amazon to remove negative reviews. Do not buy this product. Go to a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I don&#x27;t think  i had done it correctly since I used an exfoliating scrub 2 days prior receiving this. I couldn&#x27;t wait, so I used it. I did see a few dead skin rolls mainly on the stomach area and definitely arms but not so much the legs. I have a scar on my stomach and it almost completely vanished. :)&lt;br /&gt;The second time I used it, I didn&#x27;t exfoliate before, so a lot more dead skin rolled off. My legs are quite stubborn so hopefully after a few more mitten treatments, they will start to cooperate. But the scar on my stomach is starting to disappear which is great. and my arms feel super soft.</li>
            <li> I got this after seeing a glowing recommendation on refinery29 and I have to say....best. purchase. ever. I have keretosis pilaris and I feel like it&#x27;s really helping me shed that unwanted skin that just won&#x27;t shed naturally. My skin has never been smoother. I notice the longer I stay in the bath for, the better it works. Last night though, I used it in the shower and did 2 rounds and it did a fantastic job. I want to get one for my husband. Thank you SO MUCH!</li>
            <li> Ok, it costs too much but boy do I like it.  Used it 2x and can&#x27;t believe how much dead skin came off.  When it wears out I will buy another one and will buy for a gift for my best friend.  Really works!</li>
            <li> i like that it completely removes my black heads but it doesnt make me peel a lot on my legs or stomach. It leaves my skin feeling softer than before.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Skin feels much softer.  I don&#x27;t really see the dead skin cells rolling off but maybe I just haven&#x27;t quite figured out the right amount of pressure to use or how moist to keep my skin before a treatment.  Will definitely keep using it.</li>
            <li> Works great fast shipping</li>
            <li> Great product and customer service! Better than any body scrub. Instantly saw results!</li>
            <li> I am a middle aged guy who is trying to keep a younger look about me and take care of myself a bit more. Unfortunately, the years are starting to show and I do not like it! After doing a lot of reading/researching on the net, I really couldn&#x27;t find any logically negative reviews on the mitten. I understood the concept behind the product and if it did work as good as stated it would be justified on spending the money for some good, long term skin care. I used it the day I received it, right after a hot shower. I followed the directions/tips exactly and I loved it! I literally scrubbed from my forehead to the bottom of my feet. Yes, it did take a while, but man was it worth it! I rinsed off one more time afterwards and rinsed my shower as well (needless to say there was a lot that came off). I was glad to see the results in front of me. A guy&#x27;s analogy: it was like taking a clay bar to your car to remove all of the debris and contaminants you couldn&#x27;t see combined with a wax job where you finish, you push your rag across the hood and it glides effortlessly to the other side. I was as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!...man, I felt good!! Guy or gal...get you one of these, take care care of it, and reap the benefits.</li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t leave reviews but I heard about this on the z100 Elvis Duran morning show and figured I&#x27;d try it out. I&#x27;ll be honest I was expecting it to be 10 max but I had a gift card so what the heck. Got it delivered this week and I loved it (already started telling my friends about it). If you follow the directions included in the packaging you should have no issues at all. If you&#x27;ve ever gotten a Moroccan bath before you&#x27;ll appreciate an at home alternative that you can do once a week!</li>
            <li> This product does what it says. Follow the simple instructions. It&#x27;s pretty awesome! I highly recommend it. You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> It works! After years of skin disorders and having to use endless bottles of moisturizers...I finally found freedom. This mitt does thee trick. It removes layers and layers of dead skin revealing polished healthy skin that glows. No more cracked skin, flakes, rashes. I know have soft smooth skin I am comfortable in. It&#x27;s invigorating and it&#x27;s a great detox! Feels great! I strongly recommend to anyone. Be sure to strictly adhere to the instructions until you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Product as described, works as expected. Seller communication fantastic!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used my Baiden mitt once but I absolutely LOVE IT!  I was absolutely amazed when I used it and my skin has never felt so soft and smooth in my life.  I also felt like my face had a glow to it that it hasn&#x27;t had before.  I cannot wait to continue to use it and really begin to see the effects.  I highly recommend it.  Thanks Carla Marie from Z100 for re-sharing your post about it because otherwise I never would have found this product.  I cannot recommend it enough!</li>
            <li> After scouring the internet for years For something to help my skin. I am super prone to ingrown hairs on my legs and arms especially. I have tried every type of scrub, cloth, glove out there to get rid of them, the only thing that seemed to helped was manually extracting them but this left my legs with scars. Not exactly making the situation better. Until I came upon the Baiden Mitten. I am honestly convinced this glove is magical. My skin has never been softer in my life. It has helped almost completely rid me of  my ingrown hair problem after only a couple of uses. I also find that it really helps me with my clogged pores on my face. I take a quick shower first to get rid of and oil and dirt on my body ( I find if I don&#x27;t do this the glove doesn&#x27;t work as well) I then soak in a bath with just water for a good 10 minutes and then I start at my feet and work my way all the way up to my neck. Then I get out and drain the water. While I let the tub drain I go to the mirror and scrub my face. Then once the tub is all drained I clean it off all the dead skin from the bottom of the tub (and trust me there will be a lot). While I do agree the mitten seems quite expensive, trust me when I say it is well worth it. It last quite a while. And to me $50 is nothing for silky sexy skin.</li>
            <li> I came upon this item on amazon but did not want to spend the money for it -- it&#x27;s obviously pricey, but after resorting to a kitchen scrub sponge to try and take off the remnants of a spray tan -- and ending up with abrasions -- I relented. BEST DECISION EVER. This thing is magic and there is not cheaper item that will produce the same results. If you&#x27;re hedging because of the price, don&#x27;t. Spring for it and you&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li> Its not all that. I wouldn&#x27;t have paid what i paid. It got to my home the next day even though it was regular shipping</li>
            <li> Its amazing how people take advantage of things. This piece of exfoliator being used in Turkey for centuries in Turkish baths. Its called &amp;#34;kese&amp;#34;. Google it and you will find that it will cost just a couple of dollars. Its a great exfoliator but not supposed the be used on face.. If you want great results make sure no soap prior to using it and water is very hot so the dead skin will come off easy..</li>
            <li> Given that you have to soak until you are pruned, it isn&#x27;t worth the money. After a soak like that, just about anything remotely abrasive will easily remove dead skin. Save yourself a bunch of money and get a loofah.</li>
            <li> Prepare to be AHHHHHmazed by this product.  I purchased this mitten to exfoliate my skin before self tanning.  Let me tell you this was the first time trying both and this mitten offered excellent results for prepping my skin before self tanning.  It provided a very smooth surface for a flawless tan and my skin felt rejuvenating and soft!  Only reason I gave this product 4 stars is because I just used the mitten once and after a couple of weeks, I find my skin dryer than before as if my skin feels more bare and unprotected.  I just use more body lotion to fight the dryness.  I guess I have to mandatorily use the mitten every single week as instructed, but my busy schedule doesn&#x27;t always allow room for pampering.  I will certainly give it another try for a month and post any updates.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so smooth after using the Baiden Mitten.  Also I have noticed a difference with the pores in my face getting smaller.  Using the Mitten once a week is a wonderful treat to give yourself.  You won&#x27;t be sorry you spent the money.  Also, Victoria provides wonderful customer service.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember how I actually stumbled on this little gem, but my skin is so glad I did.  Treat yourself like a princess and get this.  If you self tan, it is a must-use item in your arsenal.  It removes all the dead skin and the tan buildup.  Careful, it will remove your tan too!  I&#x27;m a fan of body brushing, but this goes to a whole new level of regeneration, circulation, soft glowing skin.  I will use this item for the rest of my life, it&#x27;s THAT good.  Don&#x27;t bother with imitations, I&#x27;ve tried them and the Baiden is the real thing.  You will see rolls of skin (*barf*) and you will notice the difference.  Sometimes I&#x27;m surprised at how soft my skin is, it&#x27;s kind of shocking. :)  Talk about feeling clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:  Don&#x27;t use with soap!  Use it after you have washed, get out of the spray of water, sweep off excess water with your hands (you want to be &amp;#34;sweaty&amp;#34;) and use straight strokes, not circles.  I&#x27;m usually out of breath when I&#x27;m finished, I really work it.  And yes, I use it on my face (gently in some places) and it is amazing (just use caution!)  It puts my Clairsonic to shame, but I only use the Baiden on my face about once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not paid to write this!  :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve long believed in exfoliation and have used such a skin care regime regularly for many years, using the &amp;#34;bath glove&amp;#34; found in most any store, and micro dermabrasion by an aesthetician on occasion. While I thought my skin was in good condition for a 63 yr. old, nothing compares to the difference I&#x27;ve seen since purchasing and using the Baiden Mitten. This is an excellent product for the face and whole body. I feel &amp;#34;polished&amp;#34; from head to toe. The area around my lips that was starting to show signs of aging is beginning to be much more smooth, as well as the fine lines from the corner of my lips down seem to be disappearing and the sagging jaw line is actually tightening. I love the Baiden Mitten! It will likely replace my aesthetician ...except that I so enjoy the facial experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of beauty products, and this one is in my top five all time favorites. I read about it in an xoJane review, and I had high expectations. When it arrived (quickly!) I thought there wasn&#x27;t much to it - just a thin glove. But looks are deceiving. My skin is literally glowing and SO SOFT. I&#x27;ve never used a product that provided such immediate and healthy results. The website is not slick but don&#x27;t let that throw you off. It&#x27;s not a major corporation, it&#x27;s an old family secret. And we all benefit. Buy this! There is a 60-day guarantee but you will not be sending this back!</li>
            <li> After reading all the great reviews on Amazon, I decided to splurge and order this mitten.  I am so glad I did.  It makes my skin feel so much softer.  Since going through menopause, I developed little bumps on my skin and this mitten has really made it so much smoother!  I think it works the same as Dr. Lancer&#x27;s Method for skincare, where you use his skin polisher first to get the dead skin off your face, then use his cleanser and then his skin nourisher, and that way the moisturizer can absorb the skin better.  This mitten is fabulouse.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it.  It is expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> My experience with the Baiden Mitt has been incredible...the people behind this product truly know what providing superior customer service is all about.  First, when I first ordered the mitt - they contacted me to let me know exactly what the mitt was all about and then gave me a complete history about the mitt.  Then, they provided me with step by step instructions on how to use the mitt, what to expect, what not to expect, how to care for the mitt, and what I needed to do after using the mitt to ensure that I got the full benefits of the mitt.  They were so genuinely concerned with making sure I understood the science behind the mitt and getting the full benefits that this incredible mitt has to offer.....and I wasn&#x27;t dissapointed!!  This product is phenomenal!!  It will blow you away - its like going to a European masseuse and getting a complete body detoxing massage - but you can do it yourself (and save tons of money!).  The mitt delivers what it promises....it sloughs off dead skin cells like you would not believe....at first, you might even get grossed out at what you are seeing come off of your body - it&#x27;s scary!  But, wow, the benefits and the glowing skin are so well worth it....you have skin like a newborn!  This product is awesome and the people behind this product are exceptional in the customer service (happiness) that they deliver...they truly want you to love this product and are excited for you to get the incredible results that you will get after using this product....and you will see the benefits after the very first use!  Trust me - this product is a keeper!</li>
            <li> UPDATED:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months after purchasing the Baiden, I have changed my mind. I think it important to point out that this actually isn&#x27;t a good idea to use on your face. I had wonderfully SOFT skin for the first few weeks and was raving about this to everyone. Then I started getting blackheads. Lots of them. All over my face and in places I&#x27;d never had them before. My forehead looked visibly like sand paper. I was not scrubbing at all hard, nor was I using it more than suggested by the user information included with it. When I stopped using it, it seemed to subside but my skin is still very irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as much as I&#x27;d love to keep recommending it... I just can&#x27;t because it&#x27;s irritated my skin so much that my nominally mild acne has worsened and the pores on portions of my body are getting clogged... far worse than I&#x27;ve ever experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Baiden is still great for legs and arms. I don&#x27;t recommend going over anywhere else with it though. It irritated my skin so badly. I will use it every now and then on the arms and legs but nowhere else. I won&#x27;t be buying another one, that&#x27;s for sure, and it&#x27;s too late to return it.ng the things we are exposed to in our environment from one day to the next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how long the mitt will last, but I am quite satisfied with its results so far.</li>
            <li> I think this is an amazing product! My skin is so soft and smooth, my husband and I are both loving the results!</li>
            <li> Very bad product. Does not do anything. Save your money and buy something else.</li>
            <li> Heard about this product on the radio and I immediately purchased it after reading most of the reviews.  It really works if you follow instructions.  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Love the Baiden Mitten! The back of my arms are usually bumpy, but are now smooth after one use.</li>
            <li> Amazing tool.  I have to admit, it&#x27;s a bit of work- you have to soak in a hot tub for 15-20 minutes, but when you do- the skin rolls off. I don&#x27;t need to use lotion for several days and it allows perfect self tanner application.  I get small bumps on my upper arms and after the first use- they were gone and have not returned.  My skin is so soft!!  And I&#x27;m only on my 3rd use so can update later, but so far, this thing is amazing.  Well worth the money with better results than a single spa treatment and will last much, much longer!</li>
            <li> i bought this having read the excellent reviews and obviously missing the not so good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still can&#x27;t get over the fact i paid 50 use for a piece of cloth - theres nothing special about it. ITS CLEARLY OVERPRICED.&lt;br /&gt;in my opinion you&#x27;ll get the same results with a loofa from body shop or like the early comment said... a korea made loofa for a fraction of the price. or a detox pore brush if u have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is a waste of money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Grinif-Detox-Microfiber-Hypoallergenic-Cleansing/dp/B00HO2TV0C/ref&#x3D;sr_1_3?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1394238979&amp;sr&#x3D;8-3&amp;keywords&#x3D;detox+pore+brush</li>
            <li> This mitt was a real disappointed. it cost too much to so ineffective. I should have returned it, but lost track of time and it was too late for me to do so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shopping on Amazon ever since Amazon was a thing, and this is the second review I&#x27;ve ever written.  I&#x27;ve been using my mitten every other day for about two weeks and my skin is the softest it&#x27;s been in thirty years.  I&#x27;m considering stockpiling them in case the company ever goes out of business.  Believe the hype-- it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Okay - i sound like everyone else but this thing really works and i had a lot of cynicism - you&#x27;ll be disgusted but your skin will feel so soft. Just get one!</li>
            <li> I looked for a long time to find something to help smooth my skin, shrink my pores and improve the overall appearance of my skin.  I read all the reviews for this mitten and noted the &#x27;60 DAY Money Back Guarantee&#x27;.  Beware...there is no 60 day money back guarantee on the Amazon site.  This &#x27;Biden mitten&#x27; lists false statements.  Dead skin was removed from my body upon the initial use.  This mitten seemed to work the first time.  The 2nd, 3rd and 4th times removed little, if any, dead skin.  I did not see any improvement in the size of my pores (no smaller), no removal of skin imperfections or liver spots and blemishes remained the same.  The skin &#x27;softness&#x27; comes from the &#x27;Olive Oil&#x27;.  This mitten needs more research and buyers need to be careful with their investments.  In regards to my skin; this is a &#x27;WORK ONE TIME TO REMOVE DEAD SKIN&#x27; mitten and the price is way too high.  Thank you for your time.</li>
            <li> This is AMAZING. Results after first use!!! I stay out of the sun and use sunless tanning and this is a must. At first when I saw the mitt, I was like &amp;#34;this is it?!&amp;#34; But omg it works. I just got it so I can&#x27;t wait to see how my skin looks/feels after repeated use. Make sure you follow instructions for optimal results. Try and you&#x27;ll see!</li>
            <li> Using this mitt makes your skin soft and silky and very clean. Personally, I&#x27;ve never had rolls of skin stripping off my body when using it, like others have said, but nonetheless it&#x27;s a nice product? It&#x27;s expensive, but it really works, unlike so many product promises.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> I waited until after I&#x27;d used it a few times to write this review and I can honestly say that this is nothing short of amazing.  I was skeptical, but I figured with a money back guarantee what did I have to lose?  I&#x27;m so glad I took the chance - I am now in love with this thing and tell everyone about it.  I was shocked (and a bit horrified) by the amount of dead skin etc. that came off the first time I used it, and the next few times I had the same results.  Top that off with how SOFT my skin was after each treatment and I am a believer.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this.  One of the best items I&#x27;ve ever purchased on Amazon, and I buy everything here lol.</li>
            <li> I was told about this mitten by a friend. WOW was I amazed at how great it worked and how great my skin felt after. I tend to have dry skin and small bumps that are caused by ingrown hairs. After using it for the first time I could not believe how much dead skin came rolling off and how soft and smooth my skin was after and still is! Did not even have to use lotion after.&lt;br /&gt;I can hardly wait to use it again! Easy to use, and easy to keep clean!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I heard about this product from the Elvis Duran morning show and I am so happy that I decided to give it a shot. This thing works exactly as promised and took an amazing amount of dead skin on my first use.&lt;br /&gt;  I also have psoriasis which causes my skin cells to build up quicker than they shed so I foresee this being a great product to keep that under control.&lt;br /&gt;  I definitely thought the price was rather high going into it but so far I think it&#x27;s well worth the money. The only factor that may bring my rating down is how long the mitt lasts. I just received mine so I&#x27;m not sure how it will stand up in the long term.</li>
            <li> Not quite what i expected for the money spent... maybe im just not using it right ubt i havent got it to work like mentioned in the packaging.</li>
            <li> A product that works exactly as promised, if used as directed.</li>
            <li> Wow! I was surprised by this product. I didn&#x27;t even realize how much I&#x27;ve been missing out by not having this sooner. I felt about 5 pounds lighter after my scrub. My skin felt so smooth and clean. I&#x27;m really happy with it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice.  I can see a little difference in my skin.  I have always taken care of my skin.  Exfoliating every week so I didn&#x27;t have a drastic change as someone else may.  You do have to SCRUB your skin...alot.  Different, but works.</li>
            <li> This really works! I can&#x27;t believe my elbows are so smooth - and after only one use! Can&#x27;t wait to use it on my face- I may not have to pay for Vi Peel from the dermatologist anymore! Shocked this isn&#x27;t advertised more...</li>
            <li> This is a game-changer! All my friends and family are getting one for their next birthday or Christmas! Give it a couple of attempts to see results. It&#x27;s worth the patience and the $50!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the mit only twice now.  The second time I used it, I didn&#x27;t see quite the same results as I did the first time. But, it was only four days later.  I don&#x27;t think the dead skin build up was as much.  BUT!, the first time I used it. WOW it was amazing and disgusting at the same time.  The dead skin was peeling away from my body, arms and legs.  So much so that it left a disgusting mess in the bottom of my shower.  My skin definitely looked better.  I think that I&#x27;m going to enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> does nothing when used over my skin  Have had it for several weeks and feel it is a rip off  Pictures show skin rubbing off but I never saw anything like it happening to me when I used it.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This worked perfectly and my skin feels as though I used a moisturizing soap or lotion, but it&#x27;s my bare skin!</li>
            <li> EVERYBODY!! Should have one of these, I seriously LOVE mine!! My skin has not looked or felt this good in so long I cant even remember it worked so good that even my husband (who knew nothing of my mitten) commented on how soft my skin felt.. He asked what I was doing different because my skin felt silky.. YAY!!! PLUS plus plus!! I am seeing the small lines around my eyes and mouth disappearing. I never NEVER leave comments or reviews on my purchases just because I never really remember to do it, but after using this mitten I KNEW I had to share my experience .. PLEASE do yourself a favor and BUY one of these MITTENS!!!&lt;br /&gt;Seriously the only con/negative I can give about the mitten is the price, soooo expensive, I think that if the company would cut the price in half they would make up for the cut in price by the pure volume in sells... I could not afford the mitten but I splurged, I am SOOOO HAPPY I did . I LOVE IT!! :O)</li>
            <li> I bought the exact same thing off ebay for £5.99. The original names are &amp;#34;Turkish exfoliating gloves&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Korean cloths&amp;#34; which have been around for centuries... These people selling the &amp;#34;baiden mitten&amp;#34; pretty much bought the cheap versions of it, have created their own personal embroidery on it and are selling them for more than triple the price.. its greedy and shameful tbh... dont waste your money....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Turkish cloth looks exactly the same (same size, same colour) and I was amazed with how much dead skin came off, especially because I exfoliate regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So since I know the Baiden mitten works due to my experiences with the ORIGINAL less pricier version, it gets 3 stars. 2 have been knocked of for&lt;br /&gt;greed and dishonesty ofcourse</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not working very well.  I&#x27;m scrubbing and I now have a rash.  I&#x27;m getting a little role off (skin) but not much. It&#x27;s not working.</li>
            <li> I positively love my Baiden Mitten. My skin seriously looks and feels much better. I know it is pricey, but with all of the use you will get out of it, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my mitten for almost a year now and I absolutely love it! I use it weekly, and my skin looks and feels glowing, healthy and alive. I was leery of spending $50 on a mitten, but I figured with a money-back guarantee, I&#x27;d try it. This is the best $50 I have EVER spent on a product!!!&lt;br /&gt;No more using harsh chemicals trying to fight dry skin, sun damage and fine lines. I only use my Baiden and organic coconut oil. That&#x27;s it, and my skin is soft and as smooth as glass. Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> The baiden mitten is awesome!!! My skin is softer than ever before, and has a healthy glow to it now after just a few uses!</li>
            <li> Pretty good but very expensive.</li>
            <li> Absolute beauty supply staple.  This mitt is wonderful!  I know it&#x27;s expensive,  but you get what you pay for and more!  I cannot belive how effective it was!  My skin has never looked or felt better!</li>
            <li> Love this, it did not roll the dead skin off anywhere on my body except my chest but none the less my skin has never been smoother and all the little bumps are gradually going away. It works and that&#x27;s what matters. I&#x27;m no longer having to buy scrubs that are expensive and some are laden with chemicals so the price seems worth it if indeed it lasts the two or more years they say it will as during that time I would have spent at least $300.00 on scrubs compared to $50.00 on this. I would recommend trying this for yourself, give it 4 or 5 trys and see if you notice a difference in your skin.</li>
            <li> The dead skin this mitten rolls off was shocking - on my face, back, legs, arms - it was unreal. I had no idea I was walking around with such a layer of dead, dull skin hiding my baby soft smooth skin underneath.&lt;br /&gt;This mitten has revolutionized my understanding of my skin and how to maximize smooth and soft and healthy glowing skin.&lt;br /&gt;One thing that had vexed me was that I use an epilator to pull the hair out of my legs, but I could spend an hour and pull out every last hair and my legs would still not be smooth, so I&#x27;d have to follow up with shaving if I wanted a truly smooth leg.  Yes, the pulled out hairs would last much longer VISIBLY, but to have the smooth touchable legs - that meant a second step, or live with a certain rough bumpiness - like the epilation sort of roughed up the skin when pulling out the hairs, raised up bumps where the hair follicles were.&lt;br /&gt;Now that I exfoliate with the Baiden mitten, I no longer feel ANY of that bumpy texture after epilation. And it should go without saying, but I&#x27;ll say it - the exfoliation smoothness lasts much longer than a shave.  A shave would keep the legs smooth for a day and by the next day there would be some roughness (clearly since there was still many layers of dry dead skin).  Now both the epilation and the exfoliation go hand in hand for long lasting smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;I just love knowing that my skin is all fresh and smooth with all dead layers removed. I&#x27;ve never known a product could even do this.  I&#x27;ve been a decades long user of bufpuf for body and face, and I still use it for thorough soap cleansing, but there is no doubt, the bufpuf never exfoliated ANYTHING, this Baiden mitten really does something no other product I&#x27;ve tried does.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be interested to see if it reduces stretch marks as it promises. I&#x27;ve only been using about 2 or 3 weeks now so time will tell.</li>
            <li> unbelievable. I just knew this wouldn&#x27;t work for me or at least not as well as it supposedly did for others. glad to report that I was WRONG! I was so skeptical because none of the reviews seemed real or legit. most seemed to be written by distributors but now I see that these are probably real customers. I couldn&#x27;t believe the amount of crap that came off of my body after my very first use. UNBELIEVABLE. I wanted to use it again the very next day because im sure that there were spots that I missed but decided to follow protocol and wait until the next week. I will definitely be investing in more mittens. Sorry guys those Korean cloths and what-not are not quite the same and u cant use them on your face like u can with the baiden mitten. yeah its pricey but I don&#x27;t want to be without it now that I see what it has done to my skin. the customer service(kooee?) is also amazing.</li>
            <li> I love exfoliation..used it right away..I didn&#x27;t get rolls of dead skin cells...but I exfoliate often and I use pure coconut oil everyday.. So even though I soaked I believed i need to get squeaky clean first..The face worked amazing... I&#x27;m in the skin biz and I very excited to use this more...It makes sense..</li>
            <li> This has worked miracles on my belly stretchmarks.  I did not give it a full 5 stars because the price is too extreme.  I wish that I could afford to buy them and give them out as gifts because I really do think that it is a wonderful product.  I like it because it makes my skin so soft and leaves it smooth.  I hate wearing lotion because I hate feeling sticky or waiting for it to dry, so this is perfect for me.  I use it weekly and it has drastically improved my appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s some tips on how to use it and achieve all of those gross skin rolls (that are so wonderful to see go!)&lt;br /&gt;-First, I draw a very hot bath that I can barely tolerate getting in to.&lt;br /&gt;-I put 2 cups of epsom salt and 1 cup of baking soda in the tub.&lt;br /&gt;-I soak for about 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;-Then, I start scrubbing in a back and forth motion up and down my left arm until the rolls start.  I do this for about 5 minutes all over my arm and hand, then I move to my right arm, my chest, my neck, face, back, legs, belly, thighs, then my bum.&lt;br /&gt;-It takes probably about a half hour to completely do my whole body.&lt;br /&gt;-I then take a quick shower to rinse off and wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;-After I am completely done, I spritz myself with rosewater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some tips that I found very helpful:&lt;br /&gt;-Do not shave/exfoliate that same day, unless you want a rash!&lt;br /&gt;-Do not use any type of soap/shower gel/ scrub/shampoo/conditioner in your bath water before using the baiden.  You want your skin to be as plain as possible, unless you want a rash!  The mitten will slip around and not pick up the dead skin and you will not get the rolls.&lt;br /&gt;-Make sure that your body has heated up enough in the water.  It needs to be hot for it too work properly.  A way for me to know when I have heated up enough, is I start to feel thirsty.  This is because I am sweating in the water (Weird, huh!  But it&#x27;s true!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review helps somebody!  It really is a great product and I recommend itto everyone I know (but they are all too cheap to buy one lol).  I wish the company would lower the price to $25 or even $35 so I could give this away to my friends and family as gifts.  If you have trouble with stretchmarks, cellulite or dry skin, you will love this.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to purchase this mitten because of the price. But, I am glad I did, it&#x27;s a great product and does what it says. In the process, it doesn&#x27;t look nice when you have these rolls of dead skin on you, and have to keep scrubbing, but once you&#x27;re done, the skin feels heavenly smooth!! I prefer to take a hot shower and let my skin get soft, then turn the water off, damp the mitten in the hot water and start scrubbing in the up and down motion. ( REMEMBER not to rinse during the process, only after you&#x27;re done, otherwise it wouldn&#x27;t work as good) I use the back side for the body and front side for the face. Be gentle when exfoliating your face, and don&#x27;t put too much pressure. I would not call it a microdermabrasion mitten, but an awesome exfoliating mitten!! It exfoliates the body and face very well, better then any scrubs I tried and I have sensitive skin. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the product is the price. In my opinion it&#x27;s high for a mitten, they should sell it for no more then $20, then more people would buy it. However, it&#x27;s still well worth the money, as the products will last up to 2 years ( just wash it with a mild body wash, squeeze the water really good, and let it air dry)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s freaking amazing! You do have to follow the instructions of showering or soaking in hot water for at least 15 mins and then start scrubbing. The stuff that rolls off of you will both fascinate and disgust you! It never fails that every time I do the scrub, I think I&#x27;m a beast until I dry off. Then I&#x27;m amazed at how soft my skin is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, you need this in your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.s. This has helped with the KP on the backs of my arms</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the mitten!!  I use it once every week!  I have used other methods of exfoliation before-- but have never got the results I get with the mitten!  I love it and highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> It is not an understatement when I say that if used properly, you will see and feel immediate results. I tried it the first time and the next day, ran errands with no makeup, but had total confidence in my appearance because of the mitten. I then guided my 13 year old son on how to use it because he had a few small blemishes on his forehead. The next morning, they were noticeably smaller.  I only wish I had this sooner and my daughter could have used it. The price reflects the excellent quality and the helpful emails from the company are outstanding. If you buy one beauty product this year, buy this one!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving a 5 star mostly for customer service, which is exquisite. I wrote to Victoria a few times, and she responded to my questions in a very timely manner. Since I&#x27;ve only used it once, I need some more time with my Baiden Mitten before I write more about it. So far, it does what I expected: slough off old skin. I applied slightly more pressure on my legs and arms and saw a lot of old-looking, dry skin come off. I used it much more gently on my face and found my skin to be slightly brighter the following day.</li>
            <li> My cousin recommended the baiden mitten and I was skeptical at first, but it&#x27;s really amazing.  I had this dry patch of skin on my face that nothing was helping and this has fixed the problem completely.  I have less fine lines on my forehead (I&#x27;m 33), my pores are less visible and the texture of my skin is completely different and better.  It&#x27;s amazing/gross how much skin you will exfoliate off your body!  Hoping this will help with stretch marks too! My cousin has reduced the appearance of a surgical scar and hers still works after having it a year and a half.</li>
            <li> It works just like everyone says, and I recommend this product highly- I had been exfoliating quite a lot, I have eczema prone skin and a job that does terrible things to my hands... my skin looked ashen and awful. I&#x27;m always battling dry, itchy, peeling skin and it&#x27;s an ongoing struggle trying to find products that help and really do as they say. The seller contacted me several times and seemed very concerned with everything being correct and to my liking. One of the best sellers I have done business with to date! When I got the mitten [sooner than I expected] all I did was take a steamy hot shower for about a half hour, no soap [per instructions], put the mitten on following directions- the bottom of the tub was covered in dead skin. It was incredible. I was watching it happen and I still couldn&#x27;t believe how poorly I was really exfoliated. My skin has never been this soft, never looked this good.... I&#x27;m telling you it&#x27;s beyond phenomenal. And I&#x27;ve bought a whole cabinet full of useless crap to help my skin that amounts to a lot more money than this. Absolutely worth what you spend, doesn&#x27;t irritate even my baby sensitive, rash prone, eczema so bad it would bleed since i was 3 skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people here are saying it doesn&#x27;t work but I would advise them to be patient and make sure they are following directions. Did you let your skin soften [take a hot steamy shower] long enough? are you using an up/down motion? Before I got this mitten I watched a YouTube video about how o properly use this and what you should/should not do to get results, because if you&#x27;re not doing it right, like waxing, the results can hurt or be unsatisfactory. I personally had no problems and Ilove, love, love my mitten....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it. Use it. Be amazed. Enough said....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed that this product does exactly what it claims to do. Best purchase I have made in a long, long time. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I read about Baiden Mittens in an article on Refinery29. I thought it sounded perfect for me since I Mystic Tan weekly and am always looking for a way to exfoliate the old and prep the new. It was worth every penny! Customer Service is terrific, Upon ordering, you&#x27;ll be contacted with instructions on what to expect and how to use. You&#x27;ll get instructions with the product as well. I now use this weekly to prep for my spray tan. The best part, the exfoliation is painless. Unlike other methods I&#x27;ve used, this just glides over my skin and removes the dry skin. There is very little redness when I&#x27;m done and my skin looks healthier than ever.</li>
            <li> Does the job but not worth $50.  I like it but won&#x27;t buy again.  The but put by 3M was just as good and much less.</li>
            <li> (This is my first review ever so bear with me)  WOW! So much to say about this product! I am a fan of exfoliating products, and I use them quite regularly. I have used the Korean Italy Cloths and the Baiden Mitten, so this would be a comparison. With both of these cloths/mitts, the prep is the same. Soak your body in hot/very warm water for about 10-15 minutes, no soap or anything on the body before exfoliation, wet the cloth and use pressure etc. The difference between these two is that one is gentler than the other. They are NOT made out of the same material. I felt the Baiden Mitten and one of my mitts. The Green and Red ones are both rougher than the Baiden mitten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS OF THE BAIDEN MITTEN&lt;br /&gt;-Gentle&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;-Gets a lot the dead skin and grime off.&lt;br /&gt;-Lasts long&lt;br /&gt;-Easier to use&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t shrink.&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t smell after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;-Still effective after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;-Comes with handy dandy directions and tips.&lt;br /&gt;-Comes with a coupon.&lt;br /&gt;-60 day warranty!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS OF THE BAIDEN MITTEN&lt;br /&gt;-Price&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t really get in there like the Korean Cloths since its gentle.&lt;br /&gt;-Only available on Amazon and the official site.&lt;br /&gt;-Skin isn&#x27;t as soft as the Korean Italy Cloths.&lt;br /&gt;-Can&#x27;t throw it in the washer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS OF THE ITALY CLOTHS&lt;br /&gt;-Suuuper cheap.&lt;br /&gt;-Effective&lt;br /&gt;-Gets a lot of the dead skin off.&lt;br /&gt;-Skin is suuuuper soft afterwards&lt;br /&gt;-Available in asian grocers (usually Korean),Asian beauty supply stores, Ebay, and Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;-Can throw them in the washer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS OF THE ITALY CLOTHS.&lt;br /&gt;-Super rough on skin, and can actually tear it at times.&lt;br /&gt;-Smells after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;-Shrinks when it is under hot water.&lt;br /&gt;-Can slip off hand when using.&lt;br /&gt;-Can be hard to use.&lt;br /&gt;-The cloth is tiny, so its harder to reach in some areas.&lt;br /&gt;-Isn&#x27;t as effective after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I like the Baiden Mitten better. I can use it on my faceAND my body with no issues, it seems to get a lot more skin off than the Korean cloths (but I&#x27;m not exactly sure about this since its been a while since I have used the Korean cloths. I&#x27;ll update my review later with results), and its easier to use. All in all I LOVE this product, but since its so expensive I will only recommend it to people who really want an intense exfoliating treatment.</li>
            <li> I bought my first and only mitten 2 years ago at least. I was blown away after the second use (the first time I didn&#x27;t use it correctly, but after paying better attention to the instructions and following them exactly) it was AMAZING how well it worked. Fast forward 2 years to a month ago, and low and behold I came across my much-forgotten mitten. I started to use it again, and now I use it once a week. Well let me tell you. My skin is so soft (I rarely use moisturizer, and when I do just coconut) on my body after showering. All the bumps are gone, but one month later, not just that, the cellulite is dramatically diminishing. I look in the mirror and I am so pleased and think to myself, well, maybe it wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought it was. I find myself actually looking forward to my next vacation at the beach :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I will never stop using my mitten, and I came to Amazon today to see about ordering another one for my husband because I have been raving about it to him and he has been loving how soft my skin is. I had to tell him that no, it is not a new treatment or moisturizer -- it&#x27;s my mitten. So why or WHY I ask myself have I not been enjoying its benefits as much as I could have the last 2 years. How could I have forgotten it? I think it is because I take mostly showers and as a busy, busy mother I don&#x27;t take enough time for me and a nice, long hot bath. That is about to change. NOW I have discovered that it works after a shower too! But I do love to look forward to using it after a steamy hot, relaxing bath. I now plan to set aside a night a week for a bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never used it on my face, but I am going to now after having read some of the other reviews. I use a Clarisonic faithfully every day, so I already have pretty nice complexion. I love my Clarisonic which I have used for 7 years since my daughter was born. I will try out the mitten on my face. I didn&#x27;t know I could use it on my face and so never have, but will definitely give ita whirl.</li>
            <li> If you follow the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions this mitt provides AMAZING results - takes some effort to get the hang of it and get the dead skin rolling off but once you do you will be addicted!</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Most times these are just claims that you hear on your local cable ads -- not to be believed-- but the Baiden mitten is all it says it is! Great customer support too!</li>
            <li> It does what it says!  Never had such a great exfoliation without a professional being involved.  Can&#x27;t believe I paid so much and I hope it lasts forever.</li>
            <li> Using this is *extremely* gross and *extremely* satisfying, and my skin afterwards is soft as a baby&#x27;s butt. My tips: don&#x27;t scrub all willy nilly; use a good amount of pressure and make long even strokes. Works best if you put your hand in the mitt and then place your hand perpendicular on whatever limb you&#x27;re exfoliating because that&#x27;s the direction of the weave on the mitt. Also, I soak in a hot shower and then do my arms and torso, but I&#x27;ve found that that&#x27;s not quite enough hot steamy water for my legs to be ready for exfoliating, so if I&#x27;ve got time I&#x27;ll draw a bath and sit in that to do my legs. Use a good moisturizer after!</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;m doing it wrong but it&#x27;s just okay. Nothing great, but it gets the job done</li>
            <li> I have just received the mitt and I&#x27;m blown away!  It works so well, my skin looks a feels great with just one use.  I absolutely love the way the company makes sure you know how to use and take care of your mitt.  It may be a bit expensive but I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Awesome . It does exactly what it says. The more you use it the more it works</li>
            <li> I had watched tutorials on youtube about the Baiden Mitt and decided to purchase it.  I love it!  It is shocking how much dead dirty skin comes off!  Skin is buttery soft and you feel great after using it.  Take good care of it and it should last a while.  I&#x27;m sold and will always have a mitt hanging in the shower!</li>
            <li> I have used my Baiden Mitten for the first time and could not believe how softer my skin was with just the first use.  My elbows and knees are the worst and they feel softer already.  Cannot wait to see how much more my skin will improve with continue use!</li>
            <li> Wife loves her&#x27;s. I also have one for men which is also wonderful. Does a great job.</li>
            <li> This worked exactly as advertised for me. Amazing.</li>
            <li> Really does take off te dead skin. :-)</li>
            <li> Works exactly like the reviews say! Easy to use, follow directions, and you&#x27;ll have smooth, soft skin like you&#x27;ve never experienced! I&#x27;ve tried every imaginable form of exfoliation, and this is hands down, the BEST. Great customer service too!</li>
            <li> Too expensive. The pocket also reshaped after one gentle use.</li>
            <li> great product it works great on my skin gets of all the dead skin and leaves you feeling smooth i would tell friends to buy this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the mitten in July and I&#x27;m really pleased with the results I&#x27;m having. I was a little nervous because of the high price, but it really is a great product. I follow the instructions very carefully and when I saw the first rolls of dirt when I applied the mitten to my skin I was excited. After the first use I noticed my skin was softer, but after a few week my skin has become much softer and lighter. A few scar that I had have long since faded once I used the mitten. My skin is clearing up nicely too since I&#x27;ve been exfoliating with it and people are noticing and complimenting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m defiantly going to keep using it!</li>
            <li> I used this on Monday and I had just exfoliated with a loofah on Saturday. I can&#x27;t believe all the skin that came off. I used it all over, including my face. My skin feels great and I look forward to using it again!</li>
            <li> I love it. It really removes the dead skin you didn&#x27;t even know you had. Yeah the price is bit high but worth it.</li>
            <li> The Baiden Mitten has changed my skin - best investment I have made in a long time.  My skin is so much smoother, softer and more even now - even works on my face.  Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price!  My skin feels amazing every time I use.  I am even going ti ochar a 2nd one for my daughter because it helps with her excema patches</li>
            <li> Do not purchase this product!!.  One of my favorite u tubers, SugarPuffandFluff, from Sweden did a simple review of this mitten vs another cheaper version.  Anyway USA Utube BANNED the video from being shown in the USA.  There are millions of utubers that review and help us find a  duplicate or a cheaper version of all sorts of things.  Here is her video that shows how utube banned her Baiden Mitten review.  She did not bash the Baiden Mitten, she was just giving an alternative version.  I tried to contact Baiden Mitten directly to ask about this, but when you click on the contact link on the main web page, there is no actual way to contact.  So, I will try to get the word out this way. [...]&lt;br /&gt;Actually I was shocked to find that USA U Tube banned a stupid Mitten review in the first place.  So, the question remains why did they ban a simple review, and why is there no contact info on the companies direct web site.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best exfoliators on the market. I have been a sun worshiper most of my life, and this is helping smooth my skin and make it beautiful. I love how soft my skin feels after I use it. I don&#x27;t need as much lotion after use either. Well worth the money, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is the real deal!! Ever since I&#x27;ve started wiping with the Beta Mitten my farts haven&#x27;t smelled at ALL!  Even my family has noticed!  This thing really works!  I would recommend to anyone who suffers from bad flatulence, this is better than Beano!! I will buy this item again and again!</li>
            <li> I had this product sitting in my cabinet for months before I tried it. I wish I had tried it sooner. This product absolutely works if you use it as described. I first took a very warm shower for about 10 mins, then I did a steam ( I have access to a private steam, otherwise the directions state to soak in a very warm tub, or stay in the shower with the water very warm for at least 15 mins). The key for the product to work effectively is very moist, warm skin. I scrubbed up and down and not circular and did this over the same area and all over my body without rinsing in between. Also, I did not put any soap or cleanser on the mitten prior to use. I was shocked to see the rolls of skin all over my body, from head to toe. It was incredible. Afterward, my skin felt super soft and looked radiant. This is my new weekly exfoliating regimen.</li>
            <li> I AM CRAZY about this Baiden Mitten!!!!! I love it and now I cannot live without it!! First off, this seller is amazing. They emailed me immediately with instructions and additional tips. Then they followed up to make sure that I got it. The mitten is great, I have been hesitant to purchase but I wish I did long ago. I have very sensitive/adult acne prone skin. My skin is so sensitive (yet oily) but I can&#x27;t use any products to address my problems, PLUS I don&#x27;t want toxic chemicals and preservatives on my skin. This is my perfect solution. This type of exfoliation is perfect for my type of skin. My skin is basically healed. Thank you Baiden Mitten.</li>
            <li> Sometimes.  If you follow the directions to the tee this mitten is great.  But if you don&#x27;t it doesn&#x27;t work well at all ~ and for the money I think it should work all the time.  I have had it a few months now and can get it to work about half the time.😕</li>
            <li> Amazing and Disgusting!  I was a bit dubious as this thing is pretty expensive but I reviewed the documents the seller sent me and got myself in the tub where I soaked for maybe 10 minutes.  I did put a bit of epsom salt in there and some baking soda which I do weekly to reduce toxins.  No soap or bubbles, though.  I stood up after that and started scrubbing in long pressured motions and wow is all I can say.  It does everything it says it will do and then some.  I had to clean out the tub after so I would definitely not use it outside of the tub or a shower.  I do look like I have a bit of a sunburn now as I am very fair skinned but I am sure that will fade in a few hours.  I can&#x27;t wait to use it again next week!</li>
            <li> I have used the mitt now for two weeks exactly as described. I see nothing. I purchased it because a friend raved about hers. Very expensive for no remarkable result.</li>
            <li> It works! Plus the most excellent customer service I have ever encountered with any product I have ever bought!</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved it! After just one use, my skin felt amazing!</li>
            <li> I can not believe they charge $50.00 for this little piece of cloth. It should be priced a lot better than that.</li>
            <li> The Baiden Mitten story on the package is the this is a beauty secret from the Ottoman Empire, or what we now call the country of Turkey, in their communal baths where they have cleansing rituals.  &amp;#34;The Baiden Mitten, a ‘Course Woven Cloth’, that left their skin “as Smooth as the Finest Silk”, was developed for the most powerful Ladies of Sultan Osman’s Harem.&amp;#34;  It is made from a tree fiber which is woven in a way to resemble the texture of skin.  It is supposed to be good for up to two years use.  I personally didn&#x27;t find that it did what it claimed to do, which is to exfoliate my dry skin.  I found the consistency of the Baiden Mitten to be not too rough, which, in my humble opinion, didn&#x27;t exfoliate well.    I rarely mention cost, but I want you to know that your purchase goes to support Turkish workers at a better than average wage with benefits.  Plus, you get a 60-day money back guarantee should you not be happy with your purchase.    I’m a product review blogger and I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> Excellent customer service and a great product!!</li>
            <li> It does an awesome job at removing dead skin and making the skin soo much smoother.I LOVE it! I bought it for the few strechmarks I have, and use it every week and every week my strechmarks are blending into my skin tone even more. Im very happy I gave it a shot and tried something that actually seems to be helping. I just wish they can include better instructions to help with specifically strechmarks. But the mitten itself is great!</li>
            <li> THE BEST PRODUCT AND CUSTOMER SERVICE. EVER!!!  I gave up after one try.  I did get a bit of sloughing, but wasn&#x27;t impressed at first. I received emails from this vendor, asking me my thoughts. After I explained my issue, I honestly didn&#x27;t expect to get any response. Was I wrong!!  I got a detailed, honestly concerned for my satisfaction of this product email back,  in that email, she explained some other options that may work for me. I tried it again that same night. I was overwhelmed with the amount of dead grimy skin that came off what I thought was my clean body!!!  Amazing!  Baby soft, clean skin!  Used it on my 51 year old face, and bam...blackheads instantly gone!  I will not be without this product!!  Smartest investment I&#x27;ve made lately!</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading an article that mentioned it.  I was hopeful that it would help improve my skin and it has exceeded my expectations.  I exfoliate my face and neck on a regular basis and was really surprised that I still had dead skin come off with this in spite of that.  It has also helped with that crepe neck look we all seem to get as we age.  The instructions and follow up by the seller have been very helpful.  I&#x27;m planning on buying these for the other women in my family was happy to see that they also have a men&#x27;s version.  It is a well made product and worth every penny.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Please keep in stock! A fantastic natural product that makes your skin lovely....at any age.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it claims to do. My skin is so much softer and smoother now. I just wish it came with a handle for use on my back.</li>
            <li> Love it. My skin is bright and radiant and super smooth without lotion. I was worried about rubbing my tan off, silly, I know. But it actually looks deeper.&lt;br /&gt;Go easy on your face and sensitive parts the first few times, just to be safe.</li>
            <li> i had high expectations. maybe that was the problem. just buy a loofah that costs a fraction of a dollar rather than a mitten that costs $40+, because between the two, i don&#x27;t notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical! I usually don&#x27;t get sucked into things that aren&#x27;t mainstream because I feel that I can&#x27;t always be sure the company or product is trusted, which is why I tend to stick to shopping at big beauty chains like Sephora and Ulta for my beauty supplies/tools. Although, I have been debating purchasing this mitt for 2 years after I saw it on YouTube and decided to go for it when I was not satisfied with my skin care routine (I&#x27;ve tried store bought exfoliating products and they were never gritty enough, and home-made ones like sugar, water, and lemon worked ok but I wanted great results). I AM SO HAPPY with this products. I got in the shower for like 5 minutes and started to brush up and down...nothing happened at first, but I pressed harder and after a few more scrubs...A TON OF SKIN CAME OFF AND CONTINUED TO COME OFF!!! It really worked for me! Thank you Baiden Mitten!</li>
            <li> Everyone MUST try this mitten. It is amazing. NOTHING ELSE OUT THERE LIKE IT!!!!  Order it now!!!  I have been able to stop using other products by simply using this&lt;br /&gt;Mitten!!!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order this product but I can only say to those who are curious give it a shot, you have nothing to loose and some lovely soft skin to gain !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the mitten for almost a year and keep it in my shower to use frequently.  I&#x27;ve  noticed my face looking smoother and the wrinkles around my eyes diminishing.  After using the mitten, I use plain old petroleum jelly on my skin - as recommended in a youtube video I found by PinUpPassion - who told me the dos and don&#x27;ts for the Baiden Mitten - skin feels so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also - just last night - after spending the past four days moving from one house to another - I soaked in my new tub for 20 minutes and then used the mitten.  You should have seen all the crap come off my skin - and this was even after soaping down with a washcloth and soap - I felt like a new woman after that bath and getting rid of all the yucky stuff still on my skin even after a hot shower. GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> i looked at this product for awhile before purchasing because it was a bit pricey.  i have tried other things and nothing worked well, so i finally just ordered it last fall.  the first time i used it i couldn&#x27;t believe how much dead skin rolled off!  I&#x27;ve never had anything work like this.  my skin feels so soft afterwards and i no longer have itchy dry skin in the winter.  i even use it on my face and it works great.  i liked it so much i ordered 2 more to give as gifts.  sometimes i even just use it as a skin massage in the shower.  the videos from the website on how to use it correctly definitely help</li>
            <li> Hi, I purchased my first Baiden Mitten a little over a year ago and started using it immediately when it came in. I am 35 years old and a natural redhead so I am very pale and tend to not get out in the sun often. I go and get spray tans frequently in the summer and know matter how many exfoliants I purchased at the store none of them really got the skin smooth enough. But when I used the Baiden Mitten prior to my first spray tan last summer, I got the best results I had ever gotten and the spray tan lasted twice as long and looked so natural. I had no dark places in those spots where you usually get darker (the knees,elbows and feet). I was so impressed with how smooth and soft my skin was after using the Baiden Mitten. And after using it for a longer period of time I even noticed more results. Stretch marks started to fade in appearance, small wrinkles at the corners of my eyes diminished and the overall look of my skin got better. I couldn&#x27;t imagine using anything else to exfoliate my skin and I tell all my friends about it.Thank you Baiden Mitten!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Baiden Mitten for over a year now and I am in love with this product.  I have been using a skin care system that makes your face peel every day and the mitten is the only thing that saved me.  I was able to remove all of the old dead skin cells every day, which made my skin look new and refreshed.  You will be thrilled with your results as I was. I purchased a few more to give as gifts to my sister and sister in law.  This secret was just too good to keep to my self.  It may seem a bit pricy at first, but if you consider buying exfoliates in a bottle, then using them every day, this mitten will last for years, where as a bottle of exfoliate will only last a few months at best.  This is a very good value for your investment.</li>
            <li> I am rather disappointed with the Baiden Mitten. In some of the photos I saw skin just sloughing off of legs when using the mitten. I live in Minnesota and it is the middle of winter. You can bet I have dry, dead skin. But, when I used the mitten nothing happened...I soaked in the tub and didn&#x27;t use soap or lotion prior to using the mitten as suggested in the directions but no sloughing of dead skin occurred. I have tried it a couple of times to no avail.</li>
            <li> If you follow the directions, this works miracles for your skin!</li>
            <li> This thing is unbelievable. So many things I&#x27;ve bought, ordered and tried, to no avail. I have slightly mature skin, am fair complexioned, and have always suffered with dry skin. It always felt to me like I was putting on moisturizer and lotions on over top of dead skin. Well, I WAS. HELLO. When it came in the mail I thought, &amp;#34;Well this is awfully thin, how can it work like they say?&amp;#34; True to the old adage, &#x27;quality not quantity&#x27;, this mitten will no doubt be the last exfoliation product I will ever need or buy. I&#x27;ve used it several times now and the dead skin CONTINUES to roll up on my body. I use it on my face too, though not as vigorously as on my body. My face feels as brand-new-baby-like-butter-soft as my body does and the expensive moisturizers and lotions that I pay top dollar for literally absorb into my face and body and are able to do their job. The seller is incredibly connected to the product and to the ones who purchase it. Very kind and punctual on replies. I know $50 seems like a lot, it did to me too, but IT WORKS and you shouldn&#x27;t need any other exfoliation product. Also, its guaranteed for 2 years. At $25 per year, that&#x27;s roughly .65 (CENTS) per day, so wait no longer!</li>
            <li> Amazing !  Love this product and seller follow up</li>
            <li> It works find but not as good as advertised. If you have moderately dry skin it helps but for severely dry skin not so much.</li>
            <li> Love this!  I got just okay results the first couple of tries, but after the first couple of tries passed, I felt like it got easier and easier to rub off all the dead skin.  Even though I saw the pictures, I was still amazed how much came off on me.  It took a few weeks to really feel the results, but my skin definitely feels softer and smoother because of the mitten.  Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I dont know how you can go wrong purchasing and using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I am nearly 40 and love mine.  I bought one for my mother-  she loves hers.&lt;br /&gt;By making a concentrated effort to use the Baiden Mitten consistently (I hang mine in my shower to dry---and the visual of it is a nice reminder each time Im there)you really will make a difference in your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I am a \\&quot;reforming\\&quot; sun worshipper -- who still lives and plays in FL.  I had dark sun spots on my face, and most noticably on my chest.  I also have surgery scars.  All of these have lightened, softened or (dark brown spots) disappeared due to my use of the Baiden Mitten.  And I have the most even tan of my life...and its more of a healthy glow; not freckled orange mess.  I love this mitten!~</li>
            <li> This mitten is so good that I am not sure exactly how to describe it.  It is EVERYTHING that was promised.  The mitten is worth the price.  What is extraordinary in my mind and to my way of thinking, the customer service is beyond compare!!!  Victoria Winnard is the perfect example of what a person SHOULD do to promote their business and how a person should present themselves to let you know that they believe in their product.  Not to mention, she is funny!!!  I HIGHLY recommend the mitten for all of the fulfilled promises.</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly for two reasons, I have been experiencing more and more ingrown hairs on my legs lately, and because my face has become extremely rough this winter.  No matter how much I scrubbed with a facial sponge, or what kind of expensive exfoliating lotions and cleansers I used my face would always be extremely flaky.  With the ingrown hairs nothing seemed to make a difference.  I bought a new razor and only used each razor head a few times, I made exfoliation scrubs, which were effective but messy and too time consuming to do as often as needed.  I used sensitive skin lotion and cleansers, nothing was working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using my mitten for a week or two now and so far I like it.  There is a bit of a learning curve and I still haven&#x27;t really mastered it but I am getting good exfoliation, although not the miraculous entire body skin rolls like some people have reported.  Everyone&#x27;s skin is different and so it takes a while to figure out what works best for you, how much pressure, how often to use it, etc.  I found that using it on my body while I&#x27;m actually taking a shower works better than waiting until after my shower, except for my face.  It also took me several tries of using it on my face before I got a good exfoliation.  I was afraid of rubbing too hard and making my skin raw because the cloth does feel very rough when wet.  After about 3 tries I finally found the right combo of techniques and my skin looks much better for it.  I still have a little bit of flaking in my trouble spots, like the bridge of my nose, but I am now confident these will disappear with regular use of the mitten.  My legs are now much smoother and the ingrown hairs are improving.  I don&#x27;t know if my skin LOOKS vastly different but it definitely feels better to the touch and that&#x27;s worth it to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy I bought the Baiden mitten and plan on buying it again whenever this one needs replacing.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome and has greatly improved my dry, Denver-Winter, itchy skin.</li>
            <li> Amazing! I&#x27;ve always had really dry skin and have tried every lotion, potion, and loofa out there. This truly works just as it says. Dead skin was literally &amp;#34;rolling&amp;#34; off. You don&#x27;t know how much dry dead skin you have until you try this. My skin is now smooth and soft. The dry bumps on the back of my upper arms are gone. Even a dermatologist could not tell me out to get rid of those. My knees and elbows are so soft. I highly recommend this mitten. You&#x27;ll be shocked at the results.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny! This mitt will change your life. Do not accept substitutes as there is nothing like this on the market that compares. Finally a product who&#x27;s marketing claims are 100% true!</li>
            <li> Its basically a piece of canvas and does not exfoliate at all.. what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> One of those products that you discover online, use it, and it becomes something on the \\&quot;Favorite Things\\&quot; list.  One of these days, I am going to create holiday gift baskets for my friends with all my favorite things and this will be in it.  I&#x27;ve used it on my legs and arms and it is definitely an intense exfoliator, above any I&#x27;ve used (and I&#x27;ve tried them all). My skin gets a little red and tingly after I use it (and while there are warnings not to overdo the rubbing action) I don&#x27;t mind it because it doesn&#x27;t last long and it feels like I&#x27;m actually getting into the top layers of the skin with it, where all the dead stuff is (it does claim to slough your skin in such a way that you can actually see it rolling off...I did not experience this unfortunately but I still feel like I am getting great results)  I&#x27;ll use this glove after a tub soak and slather coconut oil on when I get out.  Great skin exfoliating/softening combo!  (the coconut oil would be in the C&#x27;s Favorite Things Basket too - I don&#x27;t need Oprah money for these products, but they are still fabulous!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the mitten twice so far, as I&#x27;m using it once weekly to get my skin used to it. The first time, following the instructions, which are comprehensive and easy to follow, I only used it lightly - probably too lightly, so the second time I scrubbed harder and my skin responded really well - it was smooth and glowing and felt great and stayed that way for several days. It&#x27;s far superior to any of the exfoliating sponges you buy in the supermarkets and I&#x27;ll be making it a regular part of my routine.</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about this product.  I seem to have had better results the first time I used it, with a small amount of pencil eraser sized rolls on the floor.  The second time, I had little or no results.  Should the mitt be used while still in the bath?  Should it be constantly wet during the exfoliation process?  Such questions linger though I did read the instructions.</li>
            <li> This is amazing!!!!! I thought the price was a little steep at first, but I absolutely love this! It makes my skin glow and it&#x27;s also really invigorating! I have keratosis on my arms and this helps diminish the look of it a lot. I recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> Just after the first use I feel more relaxed and cleaner. This is an amazing investment and works great. I look forward to my weekly session with the mitt.</li>
            <li> LOVE this thing. I was dubious about spending $50 on such a simple little product, but I have keratosis pilaris on my arms and dry, itchy skin all over and after seeing so many bloggers rave about it, I decided it would be worth a try since I could always return it. It&#x27;s awesome. Love seeing those gross little rolls of dead skin, and it&#x27;s really improving the bumps on my arms. It also seems very durable and well-made, so the length of time I&#x27;ll have it for definitely makes it worth the price! Recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought this product mainly for my Keratosis Pilaris that I have in the back of my arms and thighs (I hate those bumps so much!). I have used this product twice and so far I can&#x27;t complain. I have noticed a slight change on my arms and a significant change on my legs. Also I have noticed an overall softness to my skin after I use this product. I am sure the more I use it, I will see better results on my arms. It is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Works just as described! Very good exfoliator.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant about purchasing this product due to the cost, but after reading so many glowing reviews I decided to splurge &amp; I am so happy I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The closest thing I&#x27;ve used to exfoliate my skin is a buff puff or those scratchy cloths that you get at the grocery store.  I will never waste my time or money on those again.  The mitt has a rough surface, but isn&#x27;t scratchy like the other products I&#x27;ve used.  It is very flexible when it is damp &amp; fits my hand nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company has sent me a few emails making sure that I knew how to use my mitt &amp; making sure that I was happy with it.  If you follow the directions it works wonderfully.  I take a very hot shower without soap or anything &amp; after 15 minutes or so I turn off the water after getting the mitt damp, towel off just a little so I&#x27;m not dripping wet &amp; then start using my mitt.  I&#x27;ve found that using small up &amp; down movements with a little force works the best.  Just like everyone else has said, when that top layer starts rolling off you&#x27;re kind of grossed out, but fascinated by how well it&#x27;s working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this all over my body &amp; have used it gently on my face &amp; even my lips with great success.  After I&#x27;m done I soap off &amp; then use coconut oil to moisturize if necessary.  Then the rest of the night I go around making my family touch my arms so they can feel how soft they are!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There may be other products out there that are the same for less money, but if you want to be 100% satisfied you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product!</li>
            <li> I have scrubbed 2x with the Baiden Mitten in the past 2 weeks and my skin is a lot softer.  I can only imagine that with continued use, I will start to see even more positive results.  This is a little gross, but I really love using it under my armpits.  Even after scrubbing with a loofa, I felt like I still had deoderant residue always under my arms, but the Baiden Mitten &amp;#34;got in there&amp;#34; and removed the buildup.</li>
            <li> I received this mitt three days ago and boy do I see the difference in my skin!!  My arms were sort of crepey from sun exposure and now are starting to look like my 22 year old daughter&#x27;s arms and that was after one use.  I&#x27;m having a problem getting the skin to roll off my legs, but the mitt leaves the skin looking silky smooth and also feels that way, too.  I can get the skin to roll off my face, but that may be because I exfoliate my face a lot more than my body.  Some say it&#x27;s a pricey item, but the Dermanew microdermabrasion cream costs $40 and lasts maybe two months.  This mitt (if taken care of) can last for two years.  Sounds like a deal to me!</li>
            <li> After years of loofah-ing I can honestly say that I was just wasting my time. First of all, the fact that you can actually SEE the dead skin coming off of your body is not only amazing, but the way your body feels after is another. I feel like weight has been lifted off my body and feel like a new person. Even my boyfriend complimented my skin! Perfect for before shaving and helps spray tans stay on for wayyyy longer. Awesome awesome product. I&#x27;ve bought one for my mother, boss and girlfriends because every woman (&amp;men too) deserves to have this beautiful of skin!</li>
            <li> Wow! What an incredible product! I bought myself one 3 years ago, and I religiously use it once a week to sluff off my fading spray tan or just polish my skin if it&#x27;s looking dull. It works like a magic mitten! You really have to see it to believe it. I just bought one as a gift for a friend and I tell anyone I can about it. Their incredible customer service and quality promise is something so rare these days. Don&#x27;t be discouraged by the price, it is worth ever dime. I can&#x27;t imagine ever having to replace it because it is so well made. I will use this for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> My daughter brought the mitten to my attention as preparation for self-tanning.  I was a bit skeptical at first, but she was very enthusiastic about the mitten&#x27;s positive reviews.  Well, it is truly amazing!  After a quick hot shower, I tried the mitten and was amazed when my skin actually started sloughing off.  The end result, after only one application, was astonishing.  Baby soft skin!  I highly recommend the mitten.</li>
            <li> I have dark scars and with regular use of the mitten they have lighten them more than chemical peels have!! I love this product!! I also have two ugly scars / calluses on my knee that r sooo soft and have lighten up Big Time!! I have purchased two, one for me one for my sis...Don&#x27;t let the price scare u, this mitten is built to last!!</li>
            <li> I have had excellent results from using this product, I use it almost daily to do a quick energize and weekly or bi-weekly for a deep exfoliation. My skin is so soft! I am very fair so I spray tan, and if you use this mitten before getting a spray tan your tan will be even and last a really long time. Also when the tan starts to naturally exfoliate I use the mitten to even it out so it doesn&#x27;t look so splotchy... all in all I think its a great product.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed in this purchase. I started spray tanning and was looking for a way to get rid of blotchiness and really get a good exfoliation. I looked all over the Internet and found that on many different tanning forums people were saying the Baiden Mitten was a must. I would have to agree. I can try and exfoliate with pumice sponges and sea salt, but it never compares to the Baiden Mitten. It is a bit shocking at how much dead skin a person has to get rid of! This item is a little bit pricey, but after your first use, you will realize that it was worth every penny..</li>
            <li> Using this mitten everyday will give you lasting results. Skin is visibly fresher and more youthful looking. Perfect product for the women that wears makeup to work everyday. It&#x27;s gentle enough to use on the whole body.</li>
            <li> The Baiden mitten is a fantastic ex-foliator. I&#x27;ve been using it for about six months and my skin is much, much smoother. I was amazed at the amount of debris that was pulled out of my skin the first few times. I use it once a week - there is less dead skin removed now but it has helped maintain a lovely smoothness. Because of the Baiden mitten, I&#x27;m more confident not wearing nylons and my husband has noticed too &lt;smile&gt;. I would recommend this mitten to anyone who wants smoother, prettier skin - it&#x27;s well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I followed the directions, and my dead skin did not roll off, and my skin was no more smooth than it normally is. Perhaps that is because I already exfoliate with a loofah.  Anyhow, the Baiden Mitten works fine, but it does not work better than the $3 loofah from the drug store. If this were much cheaper, I wouldn&#x27;t mind, but this not worth anything near the price.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but I had to for this product. I will explain why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars after I rave about it first.  Used it for the first time yesterday.  I was amazed of all the dead skin that came off, but most importantly my skin feels so smooth and looks rosy and healthier.  I really think this is a great product but I am wondering why it is so expensive.  I think more people would buy it if it were cheaper.  Is it worth the cost when you think of how much you would pay for professional exfoliating - YES.  And it is supposed to last for 2 yrs - so it is worth the price in that sense. Yet, it can&#x27;t cost a lot to make.  But it is made in Turkey.&lt;br /&gt;  Would I recommend this - YES, BUT.......I wish the manufacturers would drop the price so more people could buy it.</li>
            <li> Really like the product.  Had to use it a few times to get the hang of it but the customer service was outstanding and very helpful with tips on how to properly use.  I think I will like like it more as time goes on.</li>
            <li> I just got the mitten in yesterday and I am just blown away. I used it ALL over me and am in LOVE with this product! My feet are always the hardest to get entirely clean which takes forEVER to get good results with just a wash cloth and this thing just did it with in seconds! My face is smooth and NO DRY SKIN! I am SO happy to not experience dry skin even the next day! They say diamonds are a girl&#x27;s best friend but I think this is a girl&#x27;s best friend! I will be buying this product for as long as I live or as long as they keep making it (which I hope they do for decades to come!)</li>
            <li> Everything was there, presentation and all. only problem I had was it wasn&#x27;t as easy as I expected and took me several times to understand the best way to use it is when you&#x27;re hot and sweaty.. So drink plenty of water and prevent yourself from heat exhaustion from that 15 min long steamy bath.</li>
            <li> I received my mitten on the July 23. I&#x27;ve used it twice now and my skin is so soft and I can see a huge improvement. For my face, I use just the mitten and vitamin c serum. I scrub my face with the glove at night. I put nothing on it and go to bed. In the morning, I put the vitamin c serum on my face I get that healthy glow all day. For my body, I lather kojie San soap and leave on for 20 minutes. Then I rinse off and soak in the tub for another 20 minutes. (This is a twice a week routine) after that I scrub with the mitten and all the dead skin/dirt comes right off. My complexion has improved(I&#x27;m brown skinned) only after 2 usage. I love this stuff. I&#x27;ll stick to it. I don&#x27;t mind the price. It&#x27;s worth it. I&#x27;ll definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I actually bought another after my husband kept swiping mine.  I have tried a lot of OTC products.  This one&lt;br /&gt;makes your skin REALLY soft and minimizes facial wrinkles.  I know like this sounds like I&#x27;m a shill for the&lt;br /&gt;product but I&#x27;m for real.</li>
            <li> I purchased the maiden mitt after reading tons of reviews, but was still a little skeptical that i wouldn&#x27;t see those &amp;#34;amazing results.&amp;#34; I ordered it anyway because of the money back guarantee and boy was i surprised . My dead skin did just roll off. My super dry &amp;#34;bartender&amp;#34; hands and my whole body were sooooo soft afterwards. I couldn&#x27;t believe what was left in the bottom of the bathtub. Yuck!! I can&#x27;t wait to keep using it and see how much better my skin gets! Honestly this thing could replace a myriad of skin care products. well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Its rare that a product like this actually lives up to the hype - and I&#x27;d heard a lot of hype from friends - but the Baiden Mitten did just that. It&#x27;s been really helpful for my dry skin and I&#x27;m already seeing improvement after a few sessions - particularly in my arms. So excited about this product, I might just toss most of my other exfoliants :)</li>
            <li> This works well if you want to spend a lot of time.  I used a couple times but you need to be in shape.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mitten about three weeks ago and have been more than pleased with what it has done for my skin. I decided to use it several times before writing  a review because the first time, one sees only a small part of its total effect on the skin. I have now used it a total of 6 times and will continue using it once or twice a week. I have seen my skin become healthier, less dry, and altogether better, especially my arms and face. I use the mitten after my shower, and follow it with a light oil. I was particularly impressed with the emails I received from the company after I purchased the mitt, because they went into detail about the best ways to use this product. I really like the packaging, too. It had excellent directions as well. but the customer follow-up was super. I think I will probably purchase this mitt for Christmas for my daughters. They are both at the point where they are very conscious about caring for their skin and I think they are going to love this!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Mitten for about a month now and so far I am satisfied with the product. It&#x27;s the only thing I use to exfoliate my face and body with and it works really well. I can clearly see the dead skin removed. In my experience you do not need to stay in the shower under hot water for too long. My showers are only 5-15 minutes and it&#x27;s enough to get the exfoliating process going.</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t get the skin rolls I&#x27;ve noticed a smoother feeling after using this mitt. I&#x27;m definitely happy I purchased it and look forward to seeing results after continued use!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a college student who heard about the Baiden Mitten from reddit.  I&#x27;ve struggled with KP and dry skin my whole life, so when I found out the Baiden Mitten existed, I decided to try it based off of all the reviews I read.  I wasn&#x27;t disappointed at all, it&#x27;s super awesome!  It took me a little while to figure out that my skin needed to be partially dry/damp, NOT wet, in order for the mitten to work, but once I got that figured out it worked like a charm!  My skin felt sooo smooth, especially after putting on coconut oil after I was done.  I&#x27;m excited to continue using it and see how my skin improves!  If you&#x27;re skeptical, don&#x27;t be.  It&#x27;s totally worth the price. :)</li>
            <li> Excellent for skin exfoliation. I have previously used the Korean bath mitts but the baiden mitten outperforms them. I hope to purchase another soon worth every penny of the price.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and great for exfoliation.  I have sensitive skin and have had some rashes using scrubs.  Also I try to avoid nanobeads which seem to be in everything these days.  So I recommend the Baiden mitten.  I don&#x27;t get rashes from it and it works.</li>
            <li> does as it says....really great!</li>
            <li> This mitt does what it says, takes off dead skin, just use up and down strokes, or side to side.</li>
            <li> I have used this mit ONE time and i am completely amazed at the astounding results! I was developing those nasty white bumps on the back of my thighs and top of buttocks area. I sat in a hot bath for 10 minutes with the shower curtain closed, exhaust fan off. After 10 minutes i began to scrub. Wow, tons of dead skin just shedding off of me...everywhere. I was skeptical and thought there is no way these bumps will go away. Well, I was wrong. The next morning the bumps were almost completely gone! Bonus, my skin feels amazing and my dry skin is diminishing. As long as these are made I will always have one of these mits!</li>
            <li> This is the second one I buy and I love it&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use any other exfoliation on any part of me but this one&lt;br /&gt;Is definetly a must have</li>
            <li> I have used this for a month following the directions that was included and have seen no results of dead skin being removed.  I would like to return it for a refund, but there was no address or contact information that was included to do so.</li>
            <li> Skin was very smooth after first usage, but a little dryer than usual.  I am looking forward to using it once a week, and will apply body lotion as I normally do after showering.</li>
            <li> I liked the mitten so well I purchased one for my daughter! It&#x27;s an unbelievable product and everyone should own one!</li>
            <li> I love it! I have sensitive skin so I&#x27;m using it once a week and softly, each week increasing the pressure slightly. My skin is so much softer! Feels great! I really do love this product and I&#x27;ve already recommended it to my friends. You do have to be very gentle if you have sensitive skin like I do. Eventually I&#x27;ll be able to scrub harder. The seller is also very attentive and sends you emails advising the user on proper ways to use and get best results with the baiden mitt. If you want to be all soft and feeling refreshed, this is the product you want to use. I&#x27;m a happy costumer.</li>
            <li> This mitten is fantastic! My skin is so soft and smooth and has never felt better.</li>
            <li> The Baiden Mitten is one of those tools every individual should have handy. I have always been a big fan of exfoliation and Microdermabrasion. From dry brushing to sugar and salt scrubs I have used it all. I have the Clarisonic Mia and Classic but since receiving this they have barely been picked up.Do not be fooled no other mitten is like the Baiden Mitten this product really works. I use the mitt in a saltwater bath once a week for a deep exfoliation treatment the rest of the week I gently use this and the facial one. My skin has changed after just over a months use with this product. Sunspots,scars and stretchmarks are quickly fading and i&#x27;m thrilled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Baiden Mitten- has a unique woven design that separates it from other mitts on the market. This product increases the peeling effect helping you roll away dead skin and let the body breath and detox. I use this product immediately before my beauty cremes and lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small investment is worth it for a life of beautiful skin.&lt;br /&gt;I own a magnifying mirror that magnify s 20 times and has a light to really help you feel self conscious. When looking in my mirror  now my skin is close to flawless, if you are on the fence about this  product leap over the fence and buy it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, although it seems a bit overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions provided and got great results so far. Amazing exfoliation. I have been using it twice a week, but I think I will reduce it to once a week. It leaves my skin slightly sensitive if I do it more frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because someone mentioned that it reduced the appearance of their keratosis pilaris hyper-pigmentation scars. I have the same problem, with persistent year-round keratosis. I hope that with regular exfoliation and the use of glycolic/lactic acid lotion afterwards, it will help me control my keratosis. I will update in a month or two and report back on whether it has helped with this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do other people exfoliate their back? It&#x27;s the only place I can&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and can&#x27;t believe the results after a few uses will never be with out! My skin is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
            <li> Horrible.  It molded pretty quickly and I made sure to always hang dry.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought the Baiden Mitten after reading a really great review on prepping for a self-tanning product. The Baiden came highly recommended so I decided to give it a try. I will admit that the price kind of deterred me at first but after I read that it would last at least 2 years, I realized I would get my moneys worth out of it. I used it for the first time six days ago and I was completely amazed at how much dead skin (yeah, gross!) came rolling off of my body. If you follow the step-by-step instructions that are included with the mitten (firmly using up-and-down and side-to-side motions) there is no way that this wouldn&#x27;t work for you. My skin has never felt so soft in my life and even my husband commented on how soft my skin was. After using this mitten, I now know why my lotions never &#x27;worked&#x27; - I was rubbing lotion over dead skin and what good does that do!? You only need to use this mitten once a week and I can&#x27;t wait to use it again tomorrow! I&#x27;m so happy I bought this product. I never write reviews on Amazon but I HAD to let everyone know that this purchase is so worth it. Your skin will thank you.</li>
            <li> Excellent customer service and very soft skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it two stars because, well, because of the instructions to put it simply. I loved it for use on my body, and it made my face cry tears of insane red blistery mitten-sadness.....  And here is why.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this to be used on my body, but as WELL as on my face as the product explicitly states that it \\&quot;removes blackheads\\&quot; etc. and is intended for use on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I THOROUGHLY read through the instructions, as well as the emails I received before I even got the product. It does say to be weary of the amount of pressure you use in sensitive skin areas, but does not explicitly state a duration of time for use or how to use on your face.... so I went at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Info: I exfoliate REGULARLY, I am not a newbie. And my skin is very resilient, I would never ever consider it &#x27;sensitive&#x27; or &#x27;thin&#x27; or &#x27;mature&#x27; skin that I would take caution with. In fact, I throw pretty much anything at it and it&#x27;s fine....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The email instructions state you should &#x27;not see large rolls of skin come off your face as you would other areas of your body, but you should still feel small balls of skin&#x27;. And I didn&#x27;t, so I kept rubbing... And then I thought, you know, this isn&#x27;t working at all. I don&#x27;t have any skin \\&quot;balls\\&quot; coming off my face at all....&lt;br /&gt;So then I tried it on my body, and it DID work. I thought eh maybe it was just my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah. No.&lt;br /&gt;A few hours later my skin was HOT, red, buuuuuuuuuuuurning and I felt the intense feeling of \\&quot;ohhhhh ***** what happened here\\&quot; .... I woke up this morning and I had to go to make an emergency dermatologist visit because not only does it appear that I have \\&quot;rug burn\\&quot; alllllllllll over my face, but the top layer of skin is basically gone in some areas of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s just say the derm looked at me, said \\&quot;Oh wow. Well, we can fix this\\&quot; and I left with a prescription to help heal it, maybe in a week she said. Yaaaaaaay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while it worked good on my body, I have to say that I would be PETRIFIED to use it on my face EVER again. Maybe it&#x27;s my skin, maybe it was the length of time I exfoliated for, but all I know is that my face BURNS and HURTS and it&#x27;s all because of a mitten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***EDITED TO YPDATE******&lt;br /&gt;I actually replied to the seller&#x27;s email asking me if I&#x27;d received my mitten and explained that I received a huge gigantic ouchie mess of face from the mitten. She offered apologies and sent me a \\&quot;lite\\&quot; version to use on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I haven&#x27;t used the mitten on my face again, nor the Lite version as I haven&#x27;t yet gotten it, but the customer service was at least well done as she even offered some natural remedies for my freak-face condition. (which healed in just over 5 days)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But with that being said, I am still scared of trying it again on my face.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for those who wanted to know - it didn&#x27;t actually hurt that badly when I was scrubbing, which is the scary part. It was obviously VERY easy for me to over-do it... Granted I DO have a VERY high pain tolerance, but I also expected a slight stinging as the instructions state it could feel &#x27;red or tingly&#x27; from the exfoliation...</li>
            <li> This product is truly amazing. It really does roll away the top layer of dead, dry skin. Wonderful soft skin awaits you</li>
            <li> This is a low-tech device requiring no batteries and made from natural fibers. I own several high-tech facial cleaners, etc., and they do not work as well as this. The Baiden Mitten &amp;#34;polishes&amp;#34; your skin, making it brighter and giving it a glow. It also seems to be removing some of the sun damage-type freckles on my arms and legs. This is great for summer. The recommendation in the directions says to soak in a tub for 15 or so minutes before buffing. I have gotten my best results after taking a hot yoga class or doing laps at the pool. This ensures that your skin is really moist. The top layer of dead cells is swept off as you rub and your skin breaths better and you&#x27;ll feel really clean. You can use it on body and face. I am about to send one to my mother for Mother&#x27;s Day and another to my sister in June for her birthday. I love that you can roll it up and throw it in your gym bag, unlike electrical defoliators. A+ for convenience and performance.</li>
            <li> Clearly some of the reviewers have never exfoliated - as it happens I use a body puff for light exfoliation with each shower and apparently that is quite adequate for my skin.  Should have put more stock in the reviewers which basically said that it was highly overrated!  My Faux tan application is no better after using it than it was before I paid the whopping $50 bucks.  Definitely not worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been telling all of my friends about this... I LOVE it. I will be buying this for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have only had the opportunity to use this mitt once and hope to become more proficient removing dead skin.  The customer service was the best I&#x27;ve ever had with any purchase.  The usage tips and seller follow-up are greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li> It really works well! I had a burn mark that was drying up and the Baiden mitten took it right off after the first use. It may irritate your skin if you scrub hard, so be gentle when scrubbing.</li>
            <li> Amazing. Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of blackheads/ingrowns that cover large areas of my skin &amp; this clears most of them away. So good. And so gratifying to use. 100% worth the price</li>
            <li> My skin is so dry, that I see little flakes on black clothing and socks and bedding! Gross, right? I&#x27;ve used Le&#x27;edge scraper and Philisophys exfoliating bath wash... They were only fair... After I read all the rave reviews and the information by the seller, I was convinced to buy. First, the seller (koole?) said hard water can shield your skin and make it harder to exfoliate! Bingo! I have hard water, that&#x27;s a start. I have noticed a great result on my face already, with one use! I also had a little dry skin on the back of my arms, all gone , one application... This mit is truly effective and easy to use. Just follow the instructions. The seller is very anxious and committed to help you make her product work and it will!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for me, i used this product for three times but i didn&#x27;t see any changes not even a slight change ......</li>
            <li> I really like this product. This product works great. My skin is smoother than ever.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it. :)</li>
            <li> This thing does not work. I&#x27;ve followed the directions to a T multiple times &amp; nothing happens. Disappointing, especially at this price.</li>
            <li> Meets my expectation every time without fail! Make sure you definitely follow the instructions. Up and down. Left and right. No circles. Would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This thing has to be dark magic, my skin looks and feels AMAZING</li>
            <li> Its amazing tool for your skin care, really amazing! I spend lots of hours outdoors and my skin needed that fantastic help to rejuvenate in easy and effective way , and I was lucky to try this mitten and its works so well! I had a soft and fresh feeling right after first use...highly recommend to everyone to have it for your fabulous results.</li>
            <li> This is a unique product- it dies take some invest by to understand the process  but the seller is very committed to providing education, tips etc. I have been using it in the shower and had success on my sides- between the legs. Lower back - and I wasn&#x27;t event trying that hard. I would love if they made a face mitt- just a small one for a few fingers- this does wonders on my face- no skin roll off but the touchable difference is obvious!</li>
            <li> About a year before my daughter&#x27;s wedding, I started regular appointments at a laser cosmetic salon in my area.  Loved the treatments, loved the dermabrasion, but noticed a couple days after dermabrasion, my skin became really dry and peely.  It would take a week anyways for my skin to completely \\&quot;shed.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right before the wedding we all decided to do spray-on tanning.  The woman doing it recommended a Baiden mitten.  I figured, hey, an exfoliater is an exfoliater.  NOPE!  I bought two, one for myself and one for my daughter.  I was blown away.  I am fair-skinned and have to watch my products and procedures.  This was such a breath of fresh air!  I use it EVERY day in the shower on my face and body.  I will admit to Friday nights in the tub and exfoliating afterwards.  My skin has never felt better.  Loved my esthetician, but haven&#x27;t seen her in quite a loooong time.  And my bank account is loving it, too.  This product is worth every single penny.  These mitts last a long time, in my experience!  Love my Baiden!</li>
            <li> I operate a Mobile Spray Tan business, and I highly recommend my clients to get this mitten. It preps the skin perfectly for a spray tan or over the counter product tan. Yes it literally does take the dead skin off, especially the arms. I love it on my face it feels like a 150 dollar facial ( I no longer get facials now because of this mitt) Also is great for getting any old tan residue off. I truely HIGHLY recommend this product. I gave one to my sister and Mother and they both too loved it. Ive had mine for 8 months and its still looking good, I use it (1) a week.</li>
            <li> When I traveled to Istanbul, I remembered reading about the Turkish baths where they exfoliate the heck out of you.  I never worked up the guts to try it out, but now that I have discovered the Baiden mitten I have no reason to.  It&#x27;s actually a little gross to see how much dead skin comes off.  But it&#x27;s incredibly invigorating and refreshing afterwards.  My skin is super soft now.  Great for a fake tanning preparation too.</li>
            <li> the dry skin just rolls off its like magic !</li>
            <li> Having grown up using the traditional Korean scrub gloves and making regular visits to the spa for a professional scrub down, I was prepared for another painful and disappointing exfoliation experience to manage the keratosis pilaris (aka &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34;) on the backs of my arms; however, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the Baiden Mitt not only exfoliated as well as any glove/device/scrub I&#x27;d used in the past, but was absolutely pain-free and didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling &amp;#34;raw&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; as I&#x27;d become accustomed to with all those other treatments.  I can even use it on my face, albeit with a gentler touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve been using this mitt for almost two months, I can honestly say that I am a total Baiden convert and won&#x27;t hesitate to gift this to friends in search of a better way to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> the baiden mitten is more of a cloth feeling material--made from bamboo fibers. the whole bottom of my tub was filled with dead skin when i used it!!!! you don&#x27;t have to scrub hard and it does not hurt at all. i love to use it on my face--feels so smooth after using! i feel as though it is not the same as some of the cheaper options. worth every penny and will last me 2 yrs. it is a great size and washes easily!!!!</li>
            <li> You need to soak about 20 minutes so that the Biden can exfoliate well. It works quite well and I recommend it for removing your &amp;#34;alligator&amp;#34; skin and transforming it to smooth, nice looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;If it was less expensive I would by several for my 50-something year old friends. Swimsuit time.</li>
            <li> The owner of a spray tan business told me about this product, and it is EXCELLENT! Great for exfoliating, especially if you get spray tans frequently. While the price may seem high, but the fact that you don&#x27;t have to purchase any exfoliating product makes up for it quickly. One tip - just hang it to dry. Do not wash it in a washing machine! This is one of those products that after you purchase it - you&#x27;ll know that you&#x27;ll never go without one again. It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> I use it for one time a week. A bit hurt on my skin but it&#x27;s fine. Actually, it&#x27;s hard when i use on my skin face.</li>
            <li> I use this all over my body, even my face. Won&#x27;t ever be without it !! At night, my creams are more effective and by day my makeup is flawless. I love it !!</li>
            <li> If you read the history upon which this product is based, you learn this treatment was performed by slave-like 3rd parties.  After trying to do this to yourself, you know why.  It is a lot of work.  I imagine toned arms will also be a result.  Best to purchase two, one for you and one for your significant other.  Do each other then enjoy each other&#x27;s soft skin, if you aren&#x27;t too tired.  Don&#x27;t be too wet when you use the mitten.  Think glistening with sweat moist.  It does work.  It was delivered when promised.  I think it was a little too expensive.</li>
            <li> This mitten is the best. It takes of all the dead skin, and makes my fake tan more even, and last longer.  It has dramatically improved my skin and has lasted perfectly for over a year.</li>
            <li> When i saw various reviews saying that this product didn&#x27;t work, i thought they were not using it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, i ordered one and i can&#x27;t seem to get the results it talks about. I used it twice. Both times i soaked in the bath like it said. The first time i used long motions up and down and all i got was some small results on the back of my shoulders. The second time i did the motion in one direction. I used it hard enough to make my skin go red but thats it. At almost $50, this product is going back.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!  Bought another one the next day for my son.  Makes your skin so soft, really does what it claims.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to order because of the cost, and it didn&#x27;t look like there was much to it.  But I read all of the good reviews and thought I&#x27;d take a chance....I&#x27;m glad I did!  It still doesn&#x27;t look like much, but it certainly was well worth it!  I&#x27;ve only used it about 2 times so far and love the results.  I assume the more you use it, the better your skin feels.  Skin is much smoother, even without lotion.  Not only is the product great, but the customer service is as well.  I received e-mails as my product was on it&#x27;s way and periodically receive e-mails to make sure I&#x27;m still satified with the product, I&#x27;m able to ask questions and get a quick response back, and they give hints/tips on usage.  The only thing is that I wish I had known there was a &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; colored mit prior to ordering mine.  I&#x27;ve been spray tanning (which this helps with tremendously), but the mitten is now getting a brown tint due to exfoliating the tanner.  I&#x27;m contemplating going back to buy the other.  Would recommend this product to anyone who wants healthy, soft skin!</li>
            <li> You would think being a 49 year-old woman that I would know how important exfoliation was.  I mean, I knew it was an important step in skin care but I never fully realized it until I used the Baiden glove.  I don&#x27;t want to sound like an infomercial, but every layer of dead skin that I exfoliated, layers of younger looking skin appeared.  The reviews that say your skin becomes as soft as baby skin, it&#x27;s true.  The reviews that say your makeup goes on like butter, it&#x27;s true.  How often do I leave raving reviews?  Not often.......until now.  Worth every single penny.</li>
            <li> luv this mitt, best exfoliation ever, first use baby skin revealed itself once again.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this thing.</li>
            <li> I love the Baiden Mitten!!!!  I do a spray tan a lot and this is the ONLY thing that will work to get the old tan off!!!!  I have used it twice so far and each time it has worked like a charm!  My skin is really smooth and soft!  Great service and great instructions were provided!  This is a must have regardless if you selftan or not!</li>
            <li> Love it! Leaves skin smooth and younger looking.</li>
            <li> After reading a million reviews and full feature articles about the Baiden Mitten on Refinery29, I finally got on top of purchasing one, and it is so worth the money! After a 90 degree NYC day, I went home and soaked in a hot tub for 10 minutes (I couldn&#x27;t stand any longer because it was so hot that day) and then used my mitten for the first time. It was disgusting and wonderful at the same time. Tons of gray rolled up skin fell from my body even though I had showered earlier that day, so it was great to see that all of that gross stuff was leaving my body. I am totally investing in the whole package now. Body scrub, face mitten, I want it all!</li>
            <li> The Best body exfoliation I have ever come across. Well worth the splurge. You can use on your face too but I don&#x27;t do it often. The first time I tried it it did make my skin smooth but didn&#x27;t come off peeling like the pictures you see online. The second time I went up-down vigorously and left-right vigorously on wet skin and it happened on my body and face. Could. Not. Believe it. It was amazing and disgusting all rolled into one. I do use fake tanners so this comes in handy when you need to prep or slough off old tan. And this mitt will last you a very long time! Buy it! It make take a few tries before you see the peeling, but read the directions they provide and really try to follow the tips and it&#x27;ll happen!</li>
            <li> This mitt never did anything it claimed for me, not even after giving it a second chance once we moved to a home with soft water- as the seller indicated that could be the problem.</li>
            <li> AMAZING product!  My skin&#x27;s never felt so clean and so dirty at the same time!!!  Afterwards, my skin has never been so smooth.  HIGHLY recommend the product and this seller -- they&#x27;ve sent helpful tips on how to use the mitten and really want to make it a fabulous experience.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these for my daughter, who suffers from teenage acne, and one of the Lite versions for myself, a 50-year-old woman. My daughter has used hers now for three weeks and I can really tell the difference. Though her acne did flare up a bit after the first use, since then, her skin looks amazing. Her pores are shrinking tremendously and her complexion is starting to look flawless, excepting the light scars from her breakouts that are still healing. For myself, I&#x27;m wondering if I might need the regular versus Lite, but was still incredibly impressed by how much &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; came out of my pores on my cheeks and nose. Really surprising. So, upshot is, few weeks of use only, but definitely worth every penny. Oh, and my daughter has been using hers on her body and says that her skin has never been softer.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised! Quite impressed at how well such simple cloth can exfoliate. Those with sensitive skin would be advised to ease into a routine. Definitely provides a good polish&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This is actually my wife&#x27;s purchase but I get to enjoy the results. Noticeably smoother skin. She has me &amp;#34;do her back&amp;#34; and, yeah, it&#x27;s a little gross as the rolls of dead skin comes off but her skin is softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> My #1 exfoliation product! I am a researcher when it comes to skin...always trying to find what&#x27;s new and best. I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve lived without this for so long. I&#x27;ve never been happier about a purchase!!! With the first use my skin is smooth, glowing and drinking in the lotion that used to just sit on top! Those little bumps from frigid temperatures and dryness are completely gone. I&#x27;m getting a mitten for all the women in my immediate family (10 on both sides) and girlfriends for gifts! If you&#x27;re tired of what I call &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; (you know ...that first phase of dry old wrinkled skin) then this is the best solution ever!  It does exactly what they say it does! To reiterate.... My #1 exfoliation product!</li>
            <li> I received my Baiden Mitt in a timely manner.  I found the mitt to be very effective enjoyed the relaxation of the procedure. I would recommend the mitt to anyone wishing to extend their skin care.  My first use shocked me at the amount of dead skin it exfoliated.  The instructions that were sent to my email address were very informative also.  Thank you Baiden.</li>
            <li> What an amazing product!! You really notice a difference after your first use.</li>
            <li> I have used only twice and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;It has left my skin softer and much cleaner than the every day cleaning.  All dead skin was removed.&lt;br /&gt;The mitten is true to its claim for what it can do for the skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect with this mit!....This is the first time I have used it and when I saw the skin peeling it was a bit overwhelming.....Not painful at all!......And, my skin feels so-o-o-o smooth!  I was completely surprised and thrilled!  With all the expensive lotions and creams I have bought for dry skin, nothing worked like this mit did....If it really &amp;#34;detoxifies&amp;#34; your body that would be the cherry on top!  I am into health and this would really be a bonus especially to get rid of toxins in my body!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, thank  you!  A fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I have gotten no results from this very expensive mitt. I  am not sure what i was drinking when I ordered this. It does nothing more than what my dry brushing or salt scrubs do. Save your $49 dollars and go have a nice spa experience. I do tire of companies taking advantage of women.</li>
            <li> When it comes to exfoliation, the Baiden Mitten has been referred to as the BEST exfoliation method time and time again. This exfoliating mitten is said to improve dry skin, wrinkles, scars, cellulite, stretch marks and blackheads, while firming your skin and minimizing pores.  I have wanted to try a Baiden Mitten for myself for over a year, but the steep price tag held me back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I can FINALLY say that I am the proud owner of my very own Baiden Mitten, I want to share my experience with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After soaking for about 15 minutes in a nice hot bath, I wet my Baiden Mitten and wrung it out. I stood up and put the Mitten on my right hand.  Without drying my skin I began rubbing the Baiden Mitten in a back-and-forth motion on my legs. Skin began to literally roll right off my leg, and fall down into the tub. Whoa! I kept rubbing, back-and-forth and then in an up-and-down motion. I continued until I had finished both my legs.  I switched the Mitten to my other hand, because my right arm was tired, and needed a break. I continued with my left hand and rubbed the rest of my body, back-and-forth and up-and-down. The amount of skin that had fallen into the tub by then end of my first exfoliation session was absolutely amazing.  I rinsed off and then had to use several tissues to pick up all my skin that had gathered in the hair catcher in the tub&#x27;s drain. It was disgusting, yet wonderful all at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dried off and then I followed up with my favorite moisturizer. My skin had never felt so smooth in my entire life. I couldn&#x27;t stop feeling my skin - it was so smooth and soft. My skin was pink for a few hours after exfoliating, and I was glad I didn&#x27;t have to leave the house until the next morning. By the time the next morning came around my skin had returned to  its normal color, but still felt as soft and amazing as it had the night before. I can&#x27;t wait until next week when I get to use the Baiden Mitten again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips on getting the most out of your Baiden Mitten:&lt;br /&gt;*Do not shower before using the Baiden Mitten. The use of soaps or cleansers can impede exfoliation. Just soak in a hot shower or bath before hand, and then take a real shower afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;*Rub in back-and-forth and in up-and-down motions. Not circular.&lt;br /&gt;*Save your face for last, once you get the hang of using the mitten on your body, and get a feel for how much pressure you should use.&lt;br /&gt;*Enlist the help of a family member to get to the hard to reach places on your back with the mitten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a plethora of imitation exfoliating mittens and towels. Do not fall for these cheap imitations - I have use a few of them myself and can tell you that they do not exfoliate any better than a regular loofah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want deep, dramatic, real exfoliation, you need the Baiden Mitten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for sharing my honest and unbiased review.

Opinion is entirely my own.</li>
            <li> Skin has never felt better! I works really well!</li>
            <li> This thing is tiring it is hard to get a good grab on your skin. Now I will admit that you will see dead skin but not as much as you should with the scrubbing that you are doing. For me I think I will stick with the scrub gloves that you get at Walmart.  Now I have figure out what to do with this 50 dollar glove I just bought.</li>
            <li> Baiden mitten is a bit pricey,  but it does what it says. Works wonders on my face..</li>
            <li> I have suffered with psoriasis for years, and after having scaly skin for so long, I didn&#x27;t think it was possible for it to feel smooth ever again. After using this mitt, I know that isn&#x27;t true! I have never felt better about my skin. I&#x27;m on my second mitt, and I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two and half years. I would recommend this to everyone. *****EDIT**** I am on my third mitt. I love this product. Each mitt lasts me about 8 months (I use it about once a week, and I replace my mitts before they wear out completely).</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about paying so much money for what looked like a loofa glove, but I have to admit, that after a few uses, my skin has never been softer. Even in the dead of winter up here in New England, my skin feels as soft as a baby&#x27;s. And those annoying bumps on the backs of my arms are long gone, which was an added bonus for me. One of my New Years resolutions was to start taking better care of my skin, so I&#x27;m looking at this as an investment in my skin. You do tend to get what you pay for, and in my opinion, it&#x27;s worth it. My skin feels amazing, and if this weather ever warms up enough for me to bare any amount of skin, I&#x27;m sure it will look better too :)</li>
            <li> not sure if you can still get your money back after trying it. it says you can, but i&#x27;ll believe it when i see it. it did not work very well and where it did, my skin became very red (which it warned about in the directions) but then it stayed red way longer than I believe it should and I broke out in hives. NEVER AGAIN. such a horrible experience and my skin is still recovering. it did get rid of some dry skin, but not all, so then I was half dry and half raw and it was just a mess. so glad i didn&#x27;t try this in the summer. that would&#x27;ve been even more of a disaster.</li>
            <li> My wife purchased this item for herself and now can&#x27;t live without one. She has since ordered several more Baiden Mittens for all the girls in our family ( including inlaws). My wife swears by how effective the mitten works and I must agree. Her skin is as soft as a new born baby.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have used many products to exfoliate, this is by far the best I have ever used. I am sixty and have wrinkles around my mouth. I have noticed those diminishing.. Also the overall texture of my skin is smother and softer. I have found I do not need so use lotions or oils daily. This is a wonderful product because it works on ALL parts of the body and the clutter of multiple products in the bathroom is gone.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product was right for me, I have psoriasis (not really bad but in patches over my body) and was curious to see how I would feel after using it. I started cautiously however it became evident that by adjusting the pressure to suit my skin type I would get a noticeable benefit. The skin didn&#x27;t roll off as other have mentioned but then when you have sensitive skin that replenishes too quickly (that&#x27;s what psoriasis is) I wasn&#x27;t expecting that. I am very happy with how my skin felt after using the mitten, enough to buy another for myself and more for family and friends. I can only say to those who are curious give it a shot, you have nothing to loose and some lovely soft skin to gain !</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I love my baiden mitten! I believe in exfoliating and have tried several different scrubs, gloves, brushes, etc....and none of them work even half as well as the baiden mitten does. I use it in the shower or after a bath. I find it works best after your skin has had some time to soak/soften. So after a bath, or at the end of a shower is perfect. You just get the baiden mitten wet, and start rubbing it over your face and body. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s all dead skin that comes off or if it&#x27;s some soap build up too....but either way, you&#x27;ll be amazed and the amount of stuff that the begins to roll off! After using the baiden mitten I&#x27;m always amazed at how my skin feels....super soft and like it can breathe! That&#x27;s honestly the best way I can describe what this does for your skin....it will let it breathe! Now I don&#x27;t use anything else to exfoliate except the baiden mitten and I&#x27;m never without it. It goes on business trips and vacations with me. They say a baiden mitten should last about 2 years. I&#x27;ve had mine for almost a year now and it still works as well as when I first bought it. And whenever it does wear out, I&#x27;ll definitely purchase another! Definitely worth the money. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I found out about this from a review for a self-tanning product.  At first I was hesitant to spend this much on an exfoliating tool but it truly is worth the price.  Be sure to read the detailed instructions, when followed it works exactly the way you want - you will not believe all the dead skin this thing gets off!  I use mine in the shower instead of the bath and my skin has never been softer or smoother.  Dries quickly.  Very nice product and it is good to know I am supporting a family owned business.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me! I really wanted it to work. I followed the directions to the letter - soaked in a plain bath for 30 minutes, lightly toweled off, rubbed the mitt across back and forth and then up and down (and not in a circle).  Not one &amp;#34;roll&amp;#34; of dead skin sloughed off!  The only thing I managed to do was put holes in my skin that later scabbed over. So, I decided to wait a week and try again.  This time I soaked in a bath with Epsom salts for 30 minutes.  I was told that the Epsom salts would help to soften the dead skin layer so the mitt would work better.  Unfortunately, I had the same result.  No &amp;#34;rolls&amp;#34; of dead skin, only spots where I rubbed my skin off.  I sent the mitt back.</li>
            <li> So far it is working well.  It&#x27;s not too abrasive which I like and has helped the dry skin on my legs greatly.</li>
            <li> I use my Baiden Mitten in the shower.  I tend to have very dry skin which requires that I use a lot of lotion.  The Baiden Mitten keeps my skin soft and fully exfoliated so that the lotion can be fully absorbed.  My skin has never looked so good nor felt so smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even begin to say how much I love this product.  I have keratosis pilaris and this is the only product that allows me to have soft skin once again.  I love even more that it is safe to use on my face and most of all my lips.  My skin hasn&#x27;t ever been so soft.  My husband notices how soft it is, too.  I highly recommend the Baiden Mitten everyone.  Your skin will thank you!</li>
            <li> My young adult daughters have been using Baiden Mittens for several years now. After each use, their skin is silky soft. Yes, they are young, but their skin gets dry. There is a noticable change for the better when they use their Biden Mittens. They were excited to get new ones in their Christmas stockings this past Christmas. These are effective, non-toxic tools to use to get great results.</li>
            <li> This is the most fantastic thing ever! Beats any loofah or exfoliator out there.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical. My sister told me about the mitten because I have painfully dry skin, I look like a reptile in the winter months.  I read the reviews and thought this was too good to be true.  It&#x27;s AMAZING!  I use it once a week as directed and the amount of dead skin that came off my body was so gross.  It made me gag, but IT WORKED!  It&#x27;s easy to use and to clean.  My skin is silky smooth with NO LOTION!  I&#x27;ve recommended this product to so many people it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> I gave this item a 4 star, which could easily turn into a 5. I just got it in the mail yesterday and used it for the first time last night. I didn&#x27;t really follow the directions as well as I wanted to because while I was filling the tub with hot water, I didn&#x27;t realize that the drain plug was not all the way down and therefore was letting a ton of water out of my huge garden tub.  By the time I realized what was happening, the hot water had ran out and my bath was only slightly warm, instead of hot, like they advise, and I by no means was sweating like the product suggests.  So by that time I was frustrated and ready to get the process over with (I&#x27;m not a bath taking kind of girl anyhow). I rubbed the cloth on my skin and was immediately surprised by the amount of dead skin coming off.  I did have a pretty dark spray tan that I was trying to remove so the skin rolling off was dark brown and looked quite gross.  I guess I noticed a slight difference in the feel of my skin afterwards, but nothing amazing just yet.  I do believe I will get the results this product promises if I just use it correctly next time.  I was initially put off by the $50 price tag of what I considered to be one very pricey loofa, but I thought what the heck, I&#x27;ll try it since it has a money back guarantee.  So I did and I&#x27;m pretty sure my new \\&quot;loofa\\&quot; is here to stay! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I was looking up a self-tanner and a reviewer on that talked about using the Baiden Mitten before self-tanning and how great the results were.&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;m always on the hunt for a product to make my skin as smooth as possible, I was intrigued. However, I was confused. A mitten? You just get it wet and run it over wet skin with no other products? How could that possibly work!?&lt;br /&gt;Well, it DOES. Above and beyond expectations. Those pictures with huge bits of dead skin coming off? Those are dead on! Every week when I use mine, I&#x27;m (happily) disgusted at all of the nasty skin rolls and balls coming off me. (I would definitely suggest doing it in the tub so that you can easily wipe up the dead skin when done.) I&#x27;ve only had mine a month, but after the two years&#x27; expiration date comes up on my Mitten, I will surely be buying another.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve spent copious amounts of cash on scrubs, loofahs, and sponges that did nowhere near what the Mitten did in one use.&lt;br /&gt;I also like that you&#x27;re using nothing but the Mitten. With all of the nasty chemicals that can fill scrubs, I want to use something as natural as possible. With just soaking my skin in water, I know I&#x27;m not putting my skin at any risk with the Mitten.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I&#x27;m also the most skeptical person on the planet - when I first read about the Mitten, with all of it&#x27;s good reviews on Amazon, I thought it was a total fake. I searched high and low online - I literally cannot find one person who regrets their purchase. That sold me! And now I&#x27;m another faithful customer who will proudly hand over the price of the Mitten - because it works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the mitten once so far, but WOW it is amazing. I followed instructions and soaked in a hot bath for at least 15 minutes (I was watching Netflix so honestly it was probably closer to 30...) I then lightly towel dried and started using the mitten in firm up and down strokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started with my upper arm and immediately rolls of dead skin started to ball up and fall off. I had to step back into the tub to catch all the rolls that were falling off. It didn&#x27;t hurt at all, though my skin felt puckered and turned bright red- but it looked so clean and felt super soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple minutes no more skin balled up so I figured it was safe to move to other parts of my body. Dead skin came off of areas I never would have thought, including under my neck and behind my ears (haha it sounds so gross but it&#x27;s better off than on!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed very little skin came off my face, but I didn&#x27;t really soak my face and I use a gentle exfoliating scrub throughout the week so I wasn&#x27;t surprised. After I was done completely I rinsed my body and the mitten and applied extra virgin coconut oil to my body and sweet almond oil to my face. I felt like I was in a spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been 5 days since using the mitten and I can definitely still feel the difference. My skin is softer and more supple, and I really notice the difference in my face. I had a minor break out but it was all the impurities coming to the surface. And they disappeared after about a day without me having to pop them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also a book you can download about the best ways to use the mitten but I haven&#x27;t done so yet. The seller is amazing and sent me a detailed email describing how to best use the mitten and those are the instructions that I followed. I am excited to use the mitten again in a couple days (the seller said to use it once a week) because apparently the more you use it the more radiant your skin becomes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review if there is a major change in my results, but for now I am really loving it- as you can tell by my super long testimony!major change in my results, but for now I am really loving it- as you can tell by my super long testimony!</li>
            <li> way too expensive. returned it</li>
            <li> Wow! I don&#x27;t even know the words to describe the feeling of using this Baiden product. I am in complete utter amazement of the after results. My skin has always been dull and now it is FULL OF LIFE! It&#x27;s baby soft in areas where were so course and bumpy. Let&#x27;s just say this. I was always embarrassed for my husband touching my butt but NOT anymore!!! :) thank you to the sellers of this product! It&#x27;s life changing.</li>
            <li> I got my mitten on date promised.  I wish I had taken before and after pictures.  My skin is so smooth and soft.  Especially my knees and elbows.  I had a grouping of 3 small raised burn scars, the smallest scar is gone the other 2 are flatter, smaller and lighter and this is after only 1 use.&lt;br /&gt;A coupon was included.  I&#x27;m thinking gifts for my sisters and daughter.</li>
            <li> This is basically a Turkish Hammam bath mitt, purchasable in Turkey for less than $5 and surely in America for less than $10. Shop around!</li>
            <li> Worked great for me! Just follow the instructions that come with your Baiden Mitten, which are very simple and you will get results.</li>
            <li> This mitt is an effective gentle way to exfoliate. It makes my skin glow and so smooth to the touch. Well worth the $. great customer service. They want to make sure you are happy with your purchase.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this mitten. I tried it four times following the instructions to a T. I even exchanged emails with Victoria, the seller. She was very nice and helpful. Unfortunately I am one of the few that the mitten doesn&#x27;t work on. I will be returning it tomorrow.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to all my clients. It is an amazing exfoliant and leaves skin glowing! Worth the investment! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product that works very well for me. I don&#x27;t soak in the tub as the instructions say to, but I simply use the mitten at the end of my shower on one part of my body, rotating areas each time I shower, so that I don&#x27;t take too long but I do get exfoliated! It&#x27;s great to see those rolls of dead skin come off.</li>
            <li> Great!  This product was a referral to me by a friend of mine.  I&#x27;ve only used it once and did in fact feel nice results for several days after, so I imagine that after using it awhile I&#x27;ll start to SEE the results as well.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s basically a fancy mitten for exfoliating your skin. Have yet to see long term but I can certainly rate it highly for now!</li>
            <li> I had a baiden mitten before and I absolutely loved it, I used it for 2 years and had to buy a replacement. I don&#x27;t know if the material has changed, but the fabric of my new mitten feels much thinner and less durable. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be working as well as my previous one either.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as described. Keeps the skin smooth. With regular use this product lightens scars and eliminates ingrown hairs. Love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my daughter, and she uses it every day. Her skin improved very noticeable.</li>
            <li> It works. It&#x27;s a bit strange &amp;#34;rolling your dead skin off&amp;#34; but my new skin underneath is soft and so much healthier.&lt;br /&gt;It does take a bit to figure out but as someone with fair skin, I use this once week and my skin has never looked better.&lt;br /&gt;Ps. I have tried the cheaper versions of this product and had some success but not to this extent.&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, i love it so much&lt;br /&gt;I plan to buy 4 as a gifts to my sisters,&lt;br /&gt;Go ahead and buy it , you will love it more</li>
            <li> This did not work as described at all. I read the instructions well first. I would have returned it, but I misplaced my paperwork. Def not worth the cost in my opinion. It slid all over my hand and was difficult to use as described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love. Wish I found it sooner. Easy to use,  easy to care for..worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Amazing customer service and mitten works amazing also!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the Baiden Mitten! I have been using it for about a year now, and my overall skin quality has improved so much. My acne and blackheads have seriously decreased. Self tanner goes on more evenly and lasts longer. My cellulite and stretch marks have faded. I no longer have dry patches or dull skin. My skin just glows! I found this product while looking into at-home microdermabrasion machines, and I&#x27;m so glad that I got this instead! I saved myself a ton of cash, and it&#x27;s easy to use. I use it gently on my face and neck every time I shower, and once a week I do my whole body after soaking in a bath. The results you get from this are so far beyond what you get from a loofah or a scrub, once you try this you will throw everything else away! Don&#x27;t think, just buy it! It&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li> This is a super product that helps keep my skin soft and rejuvenated. I&#x27;ve purchased one for each girl in my family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve suffered from keratosis pilaris on my arms for years and found this to be a HUGE help..  Really helps keep my arms soft and smooth. My daughter uses before she gets a spray tan as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definite part of my beauty arsenal.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Baiden mitten! I bought it on a whim, thinking \\&quot;why not\\&quot;? I didn&#x27;t expect much from it, it just seemed too good to be true. I followed the directions (very important to do so, or you won&#x27;t get the killer results)! My skin was so soft after just one use. I got the best results I&#x27;ve ever had with my spray tan when I prepped my skin with my Baiden mitten. I use retin A and the mitten was not too harsh, which surprised me! I love, love, love my mitten!</li>
            <li> Like others, I did not see the dead skin rolling off. But I&#x27;m certain it is just an adjustment in my technique that needs changing. Despite not having the skin roll off, I did see and feel a huge difference in my skin. Its insanely soft!  UPDATE! Couldn&#x27;t believe it when I saw the skin rolling off. I believe I wasn&#x27;t scrubbing hard enough. It actually does it!</li>
            <li> I do like this, it does a good job of shedding the skin, not an unbelievable job, but a good one. what more can you ask for. I am happy.  UPDATE... RECEIVED THIS FEBUARY 10th   It&#x27;s now may 20th and the mitt is coming apart at the seams, and I haven&#x27;t used it that much, was away for 5weeks during this time, and no one else is at my home, so. no, it wasn&#x27;t used while I was gone. VERY disappointed with the lack of quality for the price, it was supposed to last 2 years, tried to return it, but the seller only has a 1 months return policy, so buyer beware</li>
            <li> Best investment I ever made for my skin! It feels baby soft. Excellent for keratosis pilaris!!!</li>
