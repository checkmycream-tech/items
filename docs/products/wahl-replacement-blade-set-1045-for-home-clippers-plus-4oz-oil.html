            <li> It&#x27;s sharp.  </li>
            <li> The blade is really sharp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll remember it the next time it gets dull.</li>
            <li> I put a little of the oil on them, and attached them to the clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This package already comes with a little tube of oil.</li>

            <li> Sorry the blade is not as sharp as I expected.</li>
            <li> No more hair</li>
            <li> I never realized how dull my blades had become until I decided to replace them.  </li>
            <li> The blades to the clipper were getting dull.</li>
            <li> We bought this when my husband&#x27;s clippers were getting dull.  </li>
            <li> His hair is thick like a sheep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this set to replace the broken plate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed though because the blade oil leaked all over the inside of the package by the time it arrived.</li>
            <li> PULLING now I&#x27;m actually cutting again!</li>

            <li> Wahl Replacement Blade Set #1045 For Home. Everything received as expected and on time. Perfect fit. First use much sharper. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Decent blade. Works like it should</li>
            <li> Product came quickly. Was everything it said &amp; made our old reliable clipper work like new.</li>
            <li> Wow! I should have ordered this several years ago.  I never realized how dull my blades had become until I decided to replace them.  The replacements work great and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li> Whal is the brand to trust.  Been shaving with Whal for over 2 decades!</li>
            <li> Perfect fit - easy to install</li>
            <li> Good replacement blade and blade oil.  I am glad that I placed the order.  I have two standard poodles and a maltipoo so blades are a necessity.Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have a dog that we call &amp;#34;the fluffy dog.&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t know that &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; covers it. His hair is thick like a sheep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, we shave him in the summer. This past summer we really had a hard time getting him shaved. The clippers kept jamming up with hair; the motor got really hot. We thought about buying new clippers (or sheep shears). We ordered these replacement blades instead. I put a little of the oil on them, and attached them to the clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They worked like new, and shaved through his fur much easier than the last time.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Wahl 9590.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002R85GMU Wahl 9590 210 Pro  Complete Clipper]]&lt;br /&gt;It does not fit. There is more metal on the bottom. I had to dremel it out to make it fit. But once it fit, works great.</li>
            <li> I just opened this package of replacement blades, which I ordered from two months ago, and found that they are not compatible with the Wahl clippers for which I asked Amazon for replacement blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon should not list this product as search results for replacement blades for Wahl model CMCO; they will not work.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my son and he is very satisfied</li>
            <li> The blades to the clipper were getting dull. Instead of having them sharpened, I decided to order the replacement blades. Very satisfied, it was easy to put in the new blades. They also included 4 oz oil. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The replacement blades for my Wahl hair clippers were easy to install.  Directions were clear and easy to follow.   The blades worked very well and made my old clippers seem like new.</li>
            <li> The replacement blade was good...it works well</li>
            <li> Shipped on time arrival and works well with existing Clipper.  I am completely satisfied with this replacement blade set and oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharp.  It&#x27;s as advertised. It works great!</li>
            <li> Perfect fit, great price. Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;You might want to add some model numbers. Mine wasn&#x27;t on the list of models it fit, but I rolled the dice and it fit.</li>
            <li> This was just what my old set of clippers needed! No more hair PULLING now I&#x27;m actually cutting again! YEAH!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say about this product. It replaces the old blades and the clippers work like new again. If you have one of the Wahl clippers this fits, get one of these sets.</li>
            <li> Sorry the blade is not as sharp as I expected. Shaving the dogs myself I found the replacement not as good as the original was.</li>
            <li> The package arrived on time, as described.  replacing the blades was very easy.  The replacement blades have the clippers working like new.  We liked the clippers because they are well constructed ... heavy material ... not flimsy like most clipper kits.  I will buy another set in 5 years.</li>
            <li> The blades were not sharp.</li>
            <li> Product worked perfectly - much better than the Remington shaver I bought previously.  Exactly what I needed.  The blades were sharp enough to cut thru my horses hair.  Very easy to change out the blades.</li>
            <li> Got my blades wet and they started to rust. Decided to try and order this before I called Wahl themselves about the clippers. So glad I did. The alignment was a bit tricky but I got it and it had worked great ever since!</li>
            <li> A complete set for getting your clipper back to full cutting shape. It wasn&#x27;t cutting well before the kit, now it cuts like new!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re blades, at this price if it were just the blades it would be a good price, but they throw in the oil and the screws so it is even better.  Don&#x27;t know how well they will sharpen, seems to be decent steel.</li>
            <li> This is great to beable to get extra blades and extra sizes. I&#x27;m able to keep my dog nicely groomed, and having different sizes helps</li>
            <li> Item was as shown. Works great!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. High quality cutters!</li>
            <li> the combo pack with the oil and new blades is just what my old wahl needed.  good as new! only issue I&#x27;ve had is lining up the blades with the screws.  takes a few times to get them exactly &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; but not SO flat that you cut yourself on the teeth.</li>
            <li> It was a item to replace my old blade, fits perfect on the whal cut machine, i can recomend it.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Fit on our Wahl and worked.</li>
            <li> The Wahl replacement blade made a big difference in the way our clipper cuts hair. Definitely worth the money. My husband&#x27;s hair looks more uniformly cut now.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I ordered. It fit easily on to my Wahl clippers and works perfectly now. I would highly recommend this replacement blade.</li>
            <li> Have had my Wahl clipper for years,after dropping it several times I broke a couple of teeth off the blade. For 12 bucks I got a new trimmer again.</li>
            <li> It is a good replacement, it&#x27;s worth the cost....</li>
            <li> An exact replacement for the 2000 series clippers.</li>
            <li> The price was right... The items are exactly what I needed thanks</li>
            <li> My husband decided to grow a Duck Dynasty beard... I said no. It started to tickle his ears and that&#x27;s when he had me order the replacement blades for his clippers. They fit perfectly and we&#x27;ve said goodbye to the DD beard.</li>
            <li> my wahl has been with me for over 6 years and continues working like a champ. Since 4 yeas ago I live in the caribbean and the humidity has done its labor by adding rust to my previous blades, I replaced them and now its up and shining again.</li>
            <li> An excellent package deal to make your hair clipper work a long time. Consider buying the &amp;#34;Wahl Clini Clip&amp;#34; cleaber and disinfectant spray and you are set like a professional.</li>
            <li> My clippers do not work well with this blade. They will not cut on the high adjustment so I must use the close or low setting. They do not cut as well as the original set that came with my clippers. I ordered another set through Wahl and they look the same. It is apparently the correct blade for my clipper,l they just don&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly, I have a new razor again. Cuts like I just purchased it. I&#x27;ll remember it the next time it gets dull.</li>
            <li> The replacement blades for my Wahl hair clippers were easy to install. Directions were clear and easy to follow. The blades worked very well and made my old clippers seem like new.</li>
            <li> Between 2-3 stars.  After about 10 uses (weekly) of very short hair and thin strand hair, I don&#x27;t think it is sharp enough or as sharp as the original&#x27;s after about a year and a half of use.</li>
            <li> We bought this when my husband&#x27;s clippers were getting dull.  We initially thought we would have to replace the clippers but they area like new!  Very easy to replace the blades - if you can use a screwdriver you can do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is a nice help too - wish they would have included some when we bought the clippers.</li>
            <li> I was looking for the replacement screws but there weren&#x27;t any.  The seller did a partial refund, though.  They really need to update their picture and description if they are not going to include everything.</li>
            <li> Great price for all of the items included. Exactly the correct blade set. I won&#x27;t need another one for quite some time!</li>
            <li> We needed a new blade for our home clippers and this one is perfect. I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have a fairly old Wahl trimmer and wasn&#x27;t sure they even made parts for it any more. This blade set fits perfect, and after some fiddling and research online I finally got the blades aligned properly so they would cut and not pull my hair (ouch!). The included instructions do not make clear how to align the blades, so I hope you either have experience with installing these or you have some time to watch the multitude of (fairly crappy quality) videos on YouTube to help you.</li>
            <li> I spank my monkey with the included lube.</li>
            <li> This package already comes with a little tube of oil. Unless you&#x27;re a professional barber, you don&#x27;t need the 4oz bottle of oil.  This was my mistake. I could have saved a few bucks by getting just the blades...I still have oil left from when I bought the clippers almost 10 years ago!!!</li>
            <li> Save money  and time to go barber shop</li>
            <li> The blades work great. I&#x27;m a little disappointed though because the blade oil leaked all over the inside of the package by the time it arrived.</li>
            <li> Included all parts. Installed easily. Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, made my Wahl clippers like new again.  Blades very sharp and first class kit all the way.  Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The replacement blade I ordered came on time. Ordering and shipping were easy. The blade came as a set with oil and screws/back piece. Awesome!</li>
            <li> My main reason for this kit was for the screws that I had dropped down the sink when cleaning my clippers. Word of advice when changing the blades remember how it came apart, I didn&#x27;t pay attention and had to look at pictures and play with it a little to get the blades back right. The oil works good just after every use clean the clippers and apply a thin coat to protect from rust. As far as sharpness of the blades, I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the cut from the original set so I would assume there just as good.</li>
            <li> So my clippers fell on the floor and two of the teeth chipped off. I bought this set to replace the broken plate. It was easy to install and it is also very nice that it comes with a bottle of lubricant. Would surely recommend.</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp. Quick delivery</li>
            <li> Worked just fine, I bought this kit and my old clippers came back to life. The blade is really sharp.</li>
            <li> It does what it is made for.</li>
            <li> Easy to replace. Works great.wish I could have gotten the blade only. Didn&#x27;t need everything else.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and was the perfect fit for my clippers. Huge bottle of oil along with oil that came with the blades.</li>
