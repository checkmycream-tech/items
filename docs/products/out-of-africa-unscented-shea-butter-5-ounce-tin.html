            <li> Although, a tiny bit does go a long way if you let it melt on your skin per directions.</li>
            <li> I also will occasionally rub it into the ends of my dry hair as a stay in conditioner.</li>

            <li> Works well to alleviate dry skin.</li>
            <li> However, if you are used to French milled 100% Shea butter (over twice the price), you will find this one is crumbly and slightly rancid smelling in comparison.</li>
            <li> little of this goes a long way in repairing &amp;#34;winter hands&amp;#34;, so you can expect this little tin will last through several winters.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> does keep your skin hydrated when dry</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  I have very dry skin and also exzema.  This has calmed my exzema and my skin is so soft and smooth.  I would recommend this highly especially if you have sensative skin.</li>
            <li> I first tried this product last yr when my supermarket carries several natural food and natural products.  Once used up I could not find it again.  So glad amazon carries this brand.&lt;br /&gt;It is solid, you need to scrape a little amount.  I combine a small amount with almond and emu oil, and apply everywhere.  Works great, can even apply with regular moisture lotion.  love this!</li>
            <li> The amount was more than I expected but it&#x27;s definitely what I wanted! Great product.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Food-grade&amp;#34; means it&#x27;s totally lacking in processing, and you can eat it, if you so choose.  I tasted a small bit - it&#x27;s not cheap, so eating it seems wasteful to me, and I won&#x27;t be making a habit of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little of this goes a long way in repairing &amp;#34;winter hands&amp;#34;, so you can expect this little tin will last through several winters.  If you have dry, shredding winter hands - as anyone in areas that experience rough, dry winters will have - you will appreciate this stuff immensely.</li>
            <li> One star because real unrefined shea butter has an natural shea odor. this stuff smell and feels like a wax.</li>
            <li> Super hydrating, minimal scent, good price.  Package arrived in good condition, I will order again!</li>
            <li> Great product. Works well to alleviate dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and am allergic to fragrances, so this was the stuff to try. So far, it has been fairly helpful. But if your eczema is wide-spread, it&#x27;s expensive.  Although, a tiny bit does go a long way if you let it melt on your skin per directions. I&#x27;ll need to use it for a while longer to see if it really does the job.</li>
            <li> From what I know of shea butter, when it&#x27;s unrefined it has a greyish color and pungent odor.  However, this product is white and waxy and completely unscented.  While it does seem to moisturize well enough (why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1), it&#x27;s not likely that it has any of the other benefits of unrefined shea butter.  From now on I&#x27;m sticking with Alaffia - I&#x27;ve been using their products for years and know that they&#x27;re high quality, unlike this brand, who&#x27;s ingredient list seem to be questionable.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST stuff.  Even my kids like it.  You warm it in your hands before applying.  100% shea butter works magic on skin.  I love that it is unscented so that the males in my house will use it too.  Perfect for eczema, chapped lips, or a luxurious body butter.</li>
            <li> Good product.  These people make a good body wash that&#x27;s hard to find locally.  Lavender.  Out of the mail box.  No check-out lines.  Hard too beat.</li>
            <li> This is my third time buying this Shea Butter.  I use it in a mix that I make for after bath that includes Vitamin E oil, Avocado Oil, Jojoba Oil, 1/2 Stick Wolfra Cocoa Butter, Coconut Oil and a bit of vanilla essential oil.  It smells yummy and makes my skin very soft.  The Shea butter is def. the base and all of the other oils are the supporting characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make my after bath oil - I melt the shea butter and cocoa butter in a porcelain dish over a coffee cup warmer that I bought on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love Out of Africa products.  This is a good shea butter. Cheaper than Locitaine brand, but nevertheless just as good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is raw 100% Shea butter, as described, and a good price for it. However, if you are used to French milled 100% Shea butter (over twice the price), you will find this one is crumbly and slightly rancid smelling in comparison.</li>
            <li> Wonderful moisturizer. Melt a tad in your hand and it soaks in, unlike petroleum products. Will buy again and again....</li>
            <li> I just love this product.....it is a fantastic moisturizer. It&#x27;s heavy so it&#x27;s perfect for before bed...I love the way it makes my skin look and feel. I highly recommend it. I only use it on my face . If your not familiar with unrefined Shea Butter, note that it is a rather thick paste....you scoop up a small amount on your finger rub it between your hands so it softens and then apply it to your face...it&#x27;s worth the small amount of extra effort. I also will occasionally rub it into the ends of my dry hair as a stay in conditioner. I prefer this particular Shea butter product because it is unrefined, organic and unscented....the purest form for my sensitive skin....</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY thing that has helped my one year old son&#x27;s eczema. Not a fan of it being in an aluminum container, but I appreciate that it has a score of 0 on the hazard scale of Skin Deep&#x27;s database www.ewg.org/skindeep. I&#x27;m so excited that it&#x27;s non toxic and actually helps keep his skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Added the lavender oil to it so it has a pleasant fragrance on my skin.  Very easy to apply and is absorbed nicely.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shea butter for years and it works like magic.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it for anyone. Enjoy!</li>
