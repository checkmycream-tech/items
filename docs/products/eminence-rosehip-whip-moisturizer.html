            <li>Eminence is the best skincare line I&#x27;ve found...and I have used too many to count!</li>
            <li>Although my skin would be happy with either one.  </li>

            <li>Great company.</li>
            <li>I use some of the masks, scrubs and serums and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li>It is a great moisturizer though.</li>
            <li>I added on a jar when I ordered a food processor– it was a great deal and fulfilled by Amazon.</li>

            <li>Very nice moisturizer...</li>
            <li>amazing product!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s been great for my skin and surprisingly has not caused break-outs.</li>
            <li>My skin was never as good as when I used this product.</li>
            <li>I was delighted to find it on line and the Vit C from the roses</li>
            <li>All Eminence products are great quality, but this one is just phenomenal.</li>
            <li>Have never had a Hungarian product and I am very pleased with product.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>Should have known better!</li>
            <li>It feels amazing on the skin, very hydrating and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>Non-greasy, effective moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>The brand is organic which is a great bonus, and a good value even for a bit of a higher price.</li>
            <li>It is hands-down the best for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t go for the cheapest deal, it&#x27;s probably too good to be true.</li>
            <li>When I needed a refill, I did more research about the line and realized that the Rosehip Moisturizer was probably a better choice.  </li>
            <li>**!!!!!  :-)   </li>
            <li>I really love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Wish I could afford more.</li>
            <li>love the feeling on your face after applying this cream.</li>
            <li>Eminence are the best facial products out there.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this moisturizer for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>I currently use Rosehip oil at night and it is wonderful.</li>
            <li>I have used Eminence products for years and love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I tested on my ear to make sure it wasn&#x27;t tampered anymore, it was ok.  </li>
            <li>gives my skin a lovely healthy tone.</li>
            <li>It is without a doubt one of the best products I have found in recent years.</li>
            <li>Happy, clear, moisturizer combination skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this creme under the impression that it would be a great daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I started using the Rosehip Whip Moisturizer last year and saw a great improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>It is light and non greasy.</li>
            <li>This product makes my face smooth, feel moisturized</li>
            <li>I knew it was Genuine eminence product.</li>
            <li>It is an amazing product if you get the real thing.</li>
            <li>The real product is very nice, this is not the real product.</li>
            <li>conclusion was that this product is NOT from the original manufacturer and is a knock off.  </li>
            <li>If you can afford it, try their higher priced line that they sell in glass containers, those products (if you can believe it) are even better.</li>
            <li>However, when I tried to order another jar from Amazon, it was completely different than the product I loved.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for sensitive somewhat dry skin.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer goes on and soaks in quickly preventing any type of shine or oily feeling.</li>
            <li>Super for oily/acne-prone skin.  </li>
            <li>They are very gentle, go a long way and smell so good</li>
            <li>I tried everything keep my skin healthy including all of the \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; lines of all of the fancy department store brands.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty cool.  </li>
            <li>But when I received it this time it didn&#x27;t smell right (like roses)</li>
            <li>I should have returned it right away but didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Rosehip whip moisturizer is very light, soft fragrance, left face smooth and silky!</li>
            <li>Very light and a nice delicate scent.</li>
            <li>I bought the Gingko moisturizer for my husband and he has commented that his face and neck feel better after just a short period of time.</li>
            <li>My experience with this cream has been the same as many mentioned before me....</li>
            <li>I hope that Eminence can figure out the problem soon because this was a phenomenal moisturizer, especially for problem skin, and I can&#x27;t seem to find another that worked as well.</li>
            <li>I use it daily before bed with the stone crop mist all year long for moisturized, great looking skin.</li>
            <li>My face is also acne prone, I do find myself with more small pimples than I had on the T zone, so I try to keep it mostly on my cheeks and neck area.</li>
            <li>Would ultimately love to try entire line and visit factory!  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;greasy, heavy, odor was unpleasant - whereas the true Rosehip Whip Moisturizer is light, airy, and has a delightful rose</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for years, and it typically has a luscious rose smell and whipped texture.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s strong smelling) and totally different texture.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for only a few days, and already my skin is greatly improved.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this does not cause any breakouts and leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>I can really feel the difference.  </li>
            <li>Pricing is reasonable.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Eminence products!</li>
            <li>Their reviews indicated that the product was not the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>feels fresh and soft</li>
            <li>Really suits my oily skin.</li>
            <li>I was very dissapointed when it was delivered to me though.</li>
            <li>This is very orange in comparison an very &amp;#34;cream sicle&amp;#34; scented.</li>
            <li>I love the way these products smell, and I think I will be a lifelong customer.</li>
            <li>she said that she loves it and really likes the smell.</li>
            <li>And it seems to help my face with lines, unlike most other products.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this whole line.​</li>
            <li>Please make sure you check where the product is coming from, as I&#x27;ve ordered this through Amazon several times before and have gotten the real deal, this time it was obviously not a legitimate Eminence product</li>
            <li>Waited weeks for this product that I have bought from my spa, only to finally receive it and have the top not sealed</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for people who want to use pure products and have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>After a really long time I have finally found a moisturizing that works like magic.</li>
            <li>Also, I live in an area that we experience all types of temperatures throughout the year...</li>
            <li>we live in the desert so its important to moisturize daily and this has definitely helped her skin stay moist.</li>
            <li>My face dries out like the desert whenever it touches water and is very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I used it on my (very sensitive) face</li>
            <li>I have rosacea, and my skin is very, very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>it was very old product.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for sending the product I ordered exactly as described and in a such a speedy manner.</li>
            <li>guess the old adage - you get what you pay for!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So, while I am very pleased with the real, legitimate product (and others from the line), I would caution purchasers to be wary of the source and to know what to expect from the product.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly, will try other Eminence products.</li>
            <li>My skin stays moist and clear.  </li>
            <li>While on my honeymoon several years ago, I saw the Eminence line of products at the spa of a very high-end boutique hotel.  </li>
            <li>It fixed my skin almost overnight.  </li>
            <li>I have adult acne &amp; sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Because this was fulfilled by Amazon, I received a prompt return label and when they asked me if I wanted a return or an exchange, I said, &amp;#34;return please.&amp;#34;  I will not waste my time with knock off products.  </li>
            <li>For those of you with truly sensitive skin, you know the pain and hassle of a &amp;#34;reaction&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I live in a high desert area with low humidity which brings challenges to keeping skin moisturized.  </li>
            <li>It lasts a long time - you can water it down easily to make it last even longer.</li>
            <li>Previously, I had purchased this product from the online retailer linked directly from the Eminence site, and felt certain I was receiving the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>In fact, for several years I was put on a daily antibiotic to calm my dry, red skin.  </li>
            <li>I have mild to moderate rosacea, while I do believe my small bumps are clearing, this has done nothing for the daily redness.  </li>
            <li>, I rub a little warm water into my palm and rub the moisturizer into it to thin it out.  </li>

            <li> Previously, I had purchased this product from the online retailer linked directly from the Eminence site, and felt certain I was receiving the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> In fact, for several years I was put on a daily antibiotic to calm my dry, red skin.  </li>
            <li> I have mild to moderate rosacea, while I do believe my small bumps are clearing, this has done nothing for the daily redness.  </li>
            <li> , I rub a little warm water into my palm and rub the moisturizer into it to thin it out.  </li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised that the packaging looked the same as the previous ones I had purchased from my Spa.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usually got a very creamy consistency, this one came looking like a diluted lotion.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product through a local spa for a long time.  </li>
            <li> They must not check their returns because the safety seal was loosely set back on the container, and the box had obviously been opened.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised that they had the little moisturizer scooper/spoon like the ones I had purchased from my Spa.  </li>
            <li> And then I touched it... not thick like the creams I purchased in the past...</li>
            <li> When my skin is really dry</li>
            <li> I had really dry skin with a touch of rosy cheek like rosacea.</li>
            <li> and I firmly believe this product was tampered with, is old or is just an imitation.</li>
            <li> WOW... if you&#x27;re going to do a knock off, at least get the color and smell right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Within a few days I stopped my antibiotics and my skin was no longer red or irritated.  </li>
            <li> When the cream arrived, it was Orange...not pink.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not rosehip lotion, like I said from smell, texture, and seal not sealed, be careful, Amazon is changing.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> That the product was orange (it should be pink) and smelled like rosehip Lubriderm, should have had me returning it immediately.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if the product had been tampered with, or it was old, dried out, and oxidized.</li>
            <li> It is what I expected!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the problem is, but the Rosehip on Amazon and at my spa has definitely changed.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to all skin products and I have not experienced any problems with any of the Eminence.</li>
            <li> (It was orange, smelled sour, and was thicker than before.)</li>
            <li> This, and other items, were sealed tightly and had no appearance of dryness or consistency issues.</li>
            <li> I opened it up and it was upside down</li>
            <li> The smell, texture and taste were nothing like the previous one.  </li>
            <li> and I ended up with half of it in the lid.</li>
            <li> What a mess.</li>
            <li> (cold thru hot)</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT TRUE EMINENCE.</li>
            <li> My product also was not true Eminence - or else</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for anyone with troubled or sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re avoiding parabens and other creepy chemicals look no further.</li>
            <li> It goes on a little thick but dries well.  </li>
            <li> In the past, my skin has been prone to rosacea.  </li>
            <li> Thus, when my recent Amazon item arrived, the differences were startling and matched the experiences of others who have commented here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have owned this in the past.</li>
            <li> My skin has settled into an even tone – no more rosacea.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount does wonders.</li>
            <li> No more rosacea; no more antibiotics!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite thick, so I often use a little fruit tea on my hands before rubbing it in to thin it out a bit.</li>
            <li> and as I have been using it my skin has broken out in pimples.  </li>
            <li> The seal had been broken.</li>
            <li> I actually thin it out with a bit of water, has helped diminish redness of my skin.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this cream and will continue my search for a daily moisturizer that will help with acne blemishes.</li>
            <li> and they said a lot of scammers cut it with random stuff.  </li>
            <li> I have crazy skin allergies, so bad that I can&#x27;t get a patch test done because I&#x27;m too allergic to figure out what I&#x27;m allergic to, and this product works on my skin.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I forgot a moisturizer and was miserable, so I purchased the Stone Crop moisturizer to get me through my trip.  </li>

            <li> Shipped quickly, will try other Eminence products. Rosehip whip moisturizer is very light, soft fragrance, left face smooth and silky! Definitely will purchase again!</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer.  My face dries out like the desert whenever it touches water and is very sensitive.  In the past, my skin has been prone to rosacea.  In fact, for several years I was put on a daily antibiotic to calm my dry, red skin.  I tried everything keep my skin healthy including all of the \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; lines of all of the fancy department store brands.  Nothing worked.  While on my honeymoon several years ago, I saw the Eminence line of products at the spa of a very high-end boutique hotel.  I forgot a moisturizer and was miserable, so I purchased the Stone Crop moisturizer to get me through my trip.  It fixed my skin almost overnight.  Within a few days I stopped my antibiotics and my skin was no longer red or irritated.  When I needed a refill, I did more research about the line and realized that the Rosehip Moisturizer was probably a better choice.  Although my skin would be happy with either one.  I&#x27;ve been using the same container of the Rosehip since..gulp...2008.  I probably use it a couple of times and week and it lasts forever.  When my skin is really dry and I want to slather it on, I rub a little warm water into my palm and rub the moisturizer into it to thin it out.  I&#x27;m finally buying another jar because it probably expired!  My skin doesn&#x27;t know it though.  Great stuff.  No more rosacea; no more antibiotics!</li>
            <li> Thank you for sending the product I ordered exactly as described and in a such a speedy manner. The price was also GREAT! It was truly a pleasure doing business with your company, and I have added your site to my favorites. EXCELLENT! Best wishes always. Thanks again. 5 *****!!!!!  :-)   Victor</li>
            <li> It is what I expected!</li>
            <li> I have been using Eminence Rosehip Whip Moisturizer for over five years.  I can really feel the difference.  I try not to run out before I can order the next one.  Pricing is reasonable.</li>
            <li> Great company. Every product is a winner</li>
            <li> When I ordered this moisturizer from Amazon/International Skin Care, the product that arrived was not sealed, and a wholly different color and scent. I am not sure if the product had been tampered with, or it was old, dried out, and oxidized. Either way, I was not about to use it.  Previously, I had purchased this product from the online retailer linked directly from the Eminence site, and felt certain I was receiving the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34;. This, and other items, were sealed tightly and had no appearance of dryness or consistency issues. Thus, when my recent Amazon item arrived, the differences were startling and matched the experiences of others who have commented here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, while I am very pleased with the real, legitimate product (and others from the line), I would caution purchasers to be wary of the source and to know what to expect from the product.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne &amp; sensitive skin.  Eminence is the answer!  This moisturizer is AWESOME!  I switch between it &amp; another eminence moisturizer depending on the time of year &amp; weather conditions.  I would recommend this for anyone with troubled or sensitive skin.  The moisturizer goes on and soaks in quickly preventing any type of shine or oily feeling.</li>
            <li> I really love this moisturizer. It is perfect for sensitive somewhat dry skin. It&#x27;s quite thick, so I often use a little fruit tea on my hands before rubbing it in to thin it out a bit. But it&#x27;s been great for my skin and surprisingly has not caused break-outs.</li>
            <li> I have been using Eminence products for over a year now. I had really dry skin with a touch of rosy cheek like rosacea. The girl I see for facials turned me on to the brand. They are very gentle, go a long way and smell so good you would almost want to eat them! I use some of the masks, scrubs and serums and my skin looks great. I bought the Gingko moisturizer for my husband and he has commented that his face and neck feel better after just a short period of time. I highly recommend the Eminence products!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews prior and was hoping that the ones with the one stars were just outliers.  Their reviews indicated that the product was not the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my Rosehip Whip Moisturizer today... opened the box eagerly.  Pleasantly surprised that the packaging looked the same as the previous ones I had purchased from my Spa.  Pleasantly surprised that they had the little moisturizer scooper/spoon like the ones I had purchased from my Spa.  Then I saw the actual bottle... the color of the cream inside was ORANGE.  Yep.  ORANGE.  I then opened it and smelled it.  Smelled like citrus.  And then I touched it... not thick like the creams I purchased in the past... it was runny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My conclusion was that this product is NOT from the original manufacturer and is a knock off.  WOW... if you&#x27;re going to do a knock off, at least get the color and smell right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this was fulfilled by Amazon, I received a prompt return label and when they asked me if I wanted a return or an exchange, I said, &amp;#34;return please.&amp;#34;  I will not waste my time with knock off products.  Back to the Spa for me!</li>
            <li> Great product line! My skin was never as good as when I used this product. Wish I could afford more. Highly recommend this whole line.​</li>
            <li> Very light and a nice delicate scent. Love it!</li>
            <li> Just received it and it arrived on time with no problems. Thanks</li>
            <li> love the feeling on your face after applying this cream. feels fresh and soft</li>
            <li> They must not check their returns because the safety seal was loosely set back on the container, and the box had obviously been opened. I bought the eminence rose-hip whip moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product through a local spa for a long time.  It&#x27;s usually got a very creamy consistency, this one came looking like a diluted lotion.  I used it on my (very sensitive) face and it destroyed it.  Went to the spa today and showed them and they said a lot of scammers cut it with random stuff.  DON&#x27;T BUY FROM THIS SELLER, they are just looking to make a buck and your skin will be well, messed up.  The real product is very nice, this is not the real product.</li>
            <li> The only moisturizer that works with my skin! amazing product!</li>
            <li> Eminence are the best facial products out there.  I am very sensitive to all skin products and I have not experienced any problems with any of the Eminence.</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for years and love it.  But when I received it this time it didn&#x27;t smell right (like roses) and as I have been using it my skin has broken out in pimples.  I should have returned it right away but didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I bought this creme under the impression that it would be a great daily moisturizer. I currently use Rosehip oil at night and it is wonderful. I thought this might have been similar for daytime use. I read all of the reviews and did plenty of research. My experience with this cream has been the same as many mentioned before me....I was hoping for a different result. When the cream arrived, it was Orange...not pink. It smelt of citrus, not roses. It also broke my face out like never before. I am very disappointed with this cream and will continue my search for a daily moisturizer that will help with acne blemishes.</li>
            <li> I started using the Rosehip Whip Moisturizer last year and saw a great improvement in my skin. I couldn&#x27;t get enough of this moisturizer! However, when I tried to order another jar from Amazon, it was completely different than the product I loved. The smell, texture and taste were nothing like the previous one.  (It was orange, smelled sour, and was thicker than before.) I thought that I had a defective product so I returned it. I went back to the spa where I bought the moisturizer and it seemed like the same defective product. I&#x27;m not sure what the problem is, but the Rosehip on Amazon and at my spa has definitely changed. I hope that Eminence can figure out the problem soon because this was a phenomenal moisturizer, especially for problem skin, and I can&#x27;t seem to find another that worked as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for years, and it typically has a luscious rose smell and whipped texture.  I just received this and it is the consistency of body lotion and has no smell (not to mention the lid was tampered with).  Please make sure you check where the product is coming from, as I&#x27;ve ordered this through Amazon several times before and have gotten the real deal, this time it was obviously not a legitimate Eminence product and I promptly returned it for refund.</li>
            <li> After a really long time I have finally found a moisturizing that works like magic. It is light and non greasy. Really suits my oily skin. I use it for the face and it works great! Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have crazy skin allergies, so bad that I can&#x27;t get a patch test done because I&#x27;m too allergic to figure out what I&#x27;m allergic to, and this product works on my skin. It saves my life every winter. I use it daily before bed with the stone crop mist all year long for moisturized, great looking skin. It lasts a long time - you can water it down easily to make it last even longer. All Eminence products are great quality, but this one is just phenomenal. The brand is organic which is a great bonus, and a good value even for a bit of a higher price. If you can afford it, try their higher priced line that they sell in glass containers, those products (if you can believe it) are even better.</li>
            <li> I have used Eminence products for years and love this moisturizer. It feels amazing on the skin, very hydrating and smells wonderful. I use it morning and night.</li>
            <li> excellent product at 1/2 price I pay from salon!</li>
            <li> Waited weeks for this product that I have bought from my spa, only to finally receive it and have the top not sealed and it&#x27;s a completely different smell (if any one has used this they know the smell im talking about it&#x27;s strong smelling) and totally different texture.  I tested on my ear to make sure it wasn&#x27;t tampered anymore, it was ok.  Didn&#x27;t use though, it&#x27;s not rosehip lotion, like I said from smell, texture, and seal not sealed, be careful, Amazon is changing. Oh I gave 1 star b/c I did get the refund since it was almost 50$</li>
            <li> Happy, clear, moisturizer combination skin. Eminence is the best skincare line I&#x27;ve found...and I have used too many to count! If you&#x27;re avoiding parabens and other creepy chemicals look no further.</li>
            <li> I have owned this in the past. I was very dissapointed when it was delivered to me though. The box was labled incorrectly. I opened it up and it was upside down and I ended up with half of it in the lid. What a mess. It is a great moisturizer though.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it. Best moisturizer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This product makes my face smooth, feel moisturized and it does help my oily/dry combo skin type that I have. Also, I live in an area that we experience all types of temperatures throughout the year... (cold thru hot)</li>
            <li> Non-greasy, effective moisturizer.  My skin stays moist and clear.  I highly recommend for people who want to use pure products and have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this moisturizer before and purchased it from the spa I worked at- I knew it was Genuine eminence product. THIS IS NOT TRUE EMINENCE. The color, texture and scent are COMPLETELY different. This is very orange in comparison an very &amp;#34;cream sicle&amp;#34; scented. The texture is way thicker than the one I purchased through the spa. UGH. I refuse to put anythig that is not organic on my face and I firmly believe this product was tampered with, is old or is just an imitation. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Super for oily/acne-prone skin.  Very nice moisturizer...hydrating!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Eminence Rosehip Whip for about 8 years now. It is hands-down the best for sensitive skin. My skin has settled into an even tone – no more rosacea. This product has repaired years of allergic reactions, breakouts and basic drugstore trauma. I added on a jar when I ordered a food processor– it was a great deal and fulfilled by Amazon. What arrived was a cream in nice packaging with a dirty applicator. That the product was orange (it should be pink) and smelled like rosehip Lubriderm, should have had me returning it immediately. The seal had been broken. I chalked it up to an oxidized product. My skin said otherwise. For those of you with truly sensitive skin, you know the pain and hassle of a &amp;#34;reaction&amp;#34;. Buy this product from an authorized distributor and you will be happy. It is an amazing product if you get the real thing. Worth every penny. Don&#x27;t go for the cheapest deal, it&#x27;s probably too good to be true.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of months now and there has been no improvement at all. It did NOT moisturize and soothe irritated my skin. It did NOT improve my rosacea and acne on my skin. This was a waste of money. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea, and my skin is very, very sensitive.  I have been using this product for only a few days, and already my skin is greatly improved.  I also ordered the exfoliting masqe, and the hydration masqe.  I love the way these products smell, and I think I will be a lifelong customer.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, but had to order it from a specialty shop in Canada each time I ran out.  I was delighted to find it on line and the Vit C from the roses gives my skin a lovely healthy tone.</li>
            <li> I live in a high desert area with low humidity which brings challenges to keeping skin moisturized.  This product does a great job of keeping my face dewy.  I have mild to moderate rosacea, while I do believe my small bumps are clearing, this has done nothing for the daily redness.  My face is also acne prone, I do find myself with more small pimples than I had on the T zone, so I try to keep it mostly on my cheeks and neck area.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount does wonders. Happy with ingredients, scent and emulsion.  I actually thin it out with a bit of water, has helped diminish redness of my skin. Use at night and scent is relaxing.  Have never had a Hungarian product and I am very pleased with product.  Would ultimately love to try entire line and visit factory!  It is without a doubt one of the best products I have found in recent years.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty cool.  It goes on a little thick but dries well.  And it seems to help my face with lines, unlike most other products.  It has a lot of the vitamins in it needed to repair the skin on your face.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I use this every night. I have sensitive skin and this does not cause any breakouts and leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> she said that she loves it and really likes the smell. we live in the desert so its important to moisturize daily and this has definitely helped her skin stay moist.</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews before purchasing!  My product also was not true Eminence - or else it was very old product.  It was&lt;br /&gt;greasy, heavy, odor was unpleasant - whereas the true Rosehip Whip Moisturizer is light, airy, and has a delightful rose fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I guess the old adage - you get what you pay for!  Should have known better!</li>
