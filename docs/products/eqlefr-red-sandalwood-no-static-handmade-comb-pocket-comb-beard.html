            <li>but it is  perfectly functioning comb.</li>
            <li>this comb is great and is perfect carrying size.</li>
            <li>My beard is beautiful.</li>
            <li>Great brush.</li>
            <li>This is a great comb.</li>
            <li>Great quality and speedy delivery.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for beards, but it can be used for the stuff on top.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Feels great in your hand, it really truly is a beautiful comb.</li>
            <li>feels nice, looks nice.</li>
            <li>Works well, looks good, and combs fine.  </li>
            <li>Either way, it&#x27;s way better than a cheap plastic comb!</li>
            <li>Love it fits perfect in my back pocket</li>
            <li>I go.. love it</li>
            <li>This is a great little comb, perfect for my beard, smells great, works great, and has no static.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok comb, but nothing special</li>
            <li>It fits nicely in my pocket, and it doesn&#x27;t pull out much hair.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice firm comb with a good feel in hand.</li>
            <li>First, the good: It is a solid piece of wood.</li>
            <li>I then bought a high-quality plastic pocket comb (by a certain company that rhymes with Rent) and I wish I had bought that first!</li>
            <li>It fits well for travel and is very sturdy!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s not worth my time to return it, and it is functional (although funny-looking) and the wood bits don&#x27;t seem to be catching my hairs, so</li>
            <li>Very Reasonable Price, Would highly recommend to any of my bearded brothers.</li>
            <li>Very well made.  </li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift for my husband, he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>so I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I might have liked a little bit of a tighter tooth but it works well enough</li>
            <li>I had to clean the dead larvae out of the teeth and it had a smell for a bit</li>
            <li>Great product, well made, you will not be disappointed</li>
            <li>It came wrapped in a clear piece of plastic covered in red Chinese writing, not in the sealed blue wrapper they display.  </li>

            <li> so I highly recommend this product</li>

            <li> It came wrapped in a clear piece of plastic covered in red Chinese writing, not in the sealed blue wrapper they display.  </li>
            <li> but it is very well made from Red Sandalwood, not cheap plastic!</li>
            <li> For the price paid, if I were to order again, I would choose another handmade brand for the few extra dollars.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not real sandalwood - it smells nothing like sandalwood.</li>
            <li> This is not a real comb, chinese knock off, please dont waste your money</li>
            <li> The depth of the teeth are not consistent, and there are wood bits stuck between the teeth on the dense side.</li>
            <li> I received this comb with a number of other beard care items.</li>
            <li> 3 days after purchased, it broke in half.</li>
            <li> There is no static cling when I brush my beard</li>
            <li> Just disappointed I paid $10 for such a poorly made item.  </li>
            <li> The bad: It&#x27;s poorly made.</li>

            <li> Comb just arrived in the mail.  First, the good: It is a solid piece of wood. It is functional, so I will continue using it.  The bad: It&#x27;s poorly made. The depth of the teeth are not consistent, and there are wood bits stuck between the teeth on the dense side. It came wrapped in a clear piece of plastic covered in red Chinese writing, not in the sealed blue wrapper they display.  For the price paid, if I were to order again, I would choose another handmade brand for the few extra dollars. However, it&#x27;s not worth my time to return it, and it is functional (although funny-looking) and the wood bits don&#x27;t seem to be catching my hairs, so I&#x27;ll keep using it. Either way, it&#x27;s way better than a cheap plastic comb! Just disappointed I paid $10 for such a poorly made item.  Update: 3 days after purchased, it broke in half. I then bought a high-quality plastic pocket comb (by a certain company that rhymes with Rent) and I wish I had bought that first!</li>
            <li> I had to clean the dead larvae out of the teeth and it had a smell for a bit but it is  perfectly functioning comb.</li>

            <li> this comb is great and is perfect carrying size. It fits well for travel and is very sturdy!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this beard comb, I know it&#x27;s just a comb but it is very well made from Red Sandalwood, not cheap plastic! It has different sized teeth on each side. Feels great in your hand, it really truly is a beautiful comb.</li>
            <li> Great brush. My beard is beautiful.</li>
            <li> Love it fits perfect in my back pocket</li>
            <li> This is a great little comb, perfect for my beard, smells great, works great, and has no static. Very Reasonable Price, Would highly recommend to any of my bearded brothers.</li>

            <li> This is definitely not real sandalwood - it smells nothing like sandalwood. In fact the Chinese wrapper it comes in says that it is &amp;#34;sanders and mahogany&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is a great comb. It fits nicely in my pocket, and it doesn&#x27;t pull out much hair. It&#x27;s great for beards, but it can be used for the stuff on top.</li>
            <li> Very well made.  I use it every day and would definitely buy from EQLEF again.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband, he absolutely loves it. Great quality and speedy delivery.  Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I received this comb with a number of other beard care items. I love it! It&#x27;s a nice firm comb with a good feel in hand. Definitely worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gif for my bf for his beard and it never leaves his pocket!</li>
            <li> This is not a real comb, chinese knock off, please dont waste your money</li>
