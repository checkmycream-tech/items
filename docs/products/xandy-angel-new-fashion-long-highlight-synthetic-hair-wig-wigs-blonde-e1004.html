            <li>It&#x27;s so beautiful, curly and just perfect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s beautiful.</li>
            <li>Besides that this is a beautiful hair piece and not too costumey.</li>
            <li>Color is beautiful not to shiny but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it, though.</li>
            <li>, my husband said I don&#x27;t even look like myself (it&#x27;s the bangs lol).</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>This is a great wig.</li>
            <li>The reviews look great</li>
            <li>but I loved it .</li>

            <li>People like the color, and the nice curls.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so loving the color</li>
            <li>The curl pattern is great and the bangs are easily pulled to the side which was easy for me.</li>
            <li>The color itself is my favorite quality of this wig..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already received so many compliments.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure I should do more research on combing wig hair before I blame it all on the wig.</li>
            <li>and I love how I look in it.</li>
            <li>as i&#x27;m finger brushing the wig more strands are coming out</li>
            <li>For the price, this wig is fantastic!</li>
            <li>All in all, this is a nice wig, for how cheap it is.</li>
            <li>I love it, love the color, the length, the bangs, and the curls.</li>
            <li>Well,&lt;br /&gt;I think the wig looks better in the picture.</li>
            <li>The wig needs more hair on it bec</li>
            <li>I love this wig.</li>
            <li>Let me just say thing this wig is one of the better wigs I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>just in love with the color</li>
            <li>I love my wig but its not the wig you see in the photo.</li>
            <li>I got it in red and it looks awesome and not insanely cheap/synthetic.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Im seriously in love with this wig.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thankful I didn&#x27;t waist more money on it.</li>
            <li>It may work ok for a Halloween costume.</li>
            <li>but I would say is slightly better than I would expect for the price.</li>
            <li>It looks okay</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d say it would be better  to spend more and get a better wig.</li>
            <li>The length is just right, the shade is a flattering auburn, the waviness is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>This wig looks very natural and beautiful.</li>
            <li>The seller sent me a comb, hair stand and a special spray for it, I thought that was nice of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my absolute fav, but let me tell you that the quality of this wig is amazing, looks so real and has a beautiful color just like the picture.</li>
            <li>It got here pretty quick, about a week and the wig was in great condition.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more Auburn than wine red, but it still beautiful.</li>
            <li>you are looking for a cheap wig I would go with another color in this line and make sure you stick with its title rather than the photo.</li>
            <li>so u really gatta take good care of it bangs</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to put on and the included wig cap works well.  </li>
            <li>no combs to keep wig in place, tangles and knots easily</li>
            <li>i bought this for my sister and she fell in love right when she took it out of the package!</li>
            <li>I would wear a hat to hide the not-so-natural circular hair part, but I think it&#x27;s pretty nice.</li>
            <li>I instantly tried it on and it looked so beautiful</li>
            <li>For costumes it would be fine.</li>
            <li>This is a great buy especially for the price!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s sexy and fun</li>
            <li>I think that it is good for photographing, but not exactly everyday wear.</li>
            <li>After reading all the reviews, I was so excited  to get this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just so excited because of everything I&#x27;ve read about it.</li>
            <li>The red color is beautiful and looked great with my slightly tan skin tone.</li>
            <li>Thankfully soon after that thing came in the mail I found a better, more professional place to order wigs from.</li>
            <li>But other than difficulty combing and the wind showing a bit of wig proof, it&#x27;s beautiful</li>
            <li>I bought this wig after reading all of the great reviews and then could&#x27;ve kicked myself for not realizing that most of the 5 star reviewers have only ever reviewed this wig and are most likely hired reviewers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As for the color, it is darker than the picture shows, but the customer review images will help to see what the true color is.</li>
            <li>I got compliments from all types of people and most of them thought it was my real hair.</li>
            <li>but it looks like it can get tangled quickly.</li>
            <li>The bangs aren&#x27;t the most natural looking; they&#x27;re thick and a bit too perfect.</li>
            <li>But the rest of the hair is pretty natural looking, depending on what kind of lighting that you are in.</li>
            <li>its not long its kind of short.&lt;br /&gt;beautiful</li>
            <li>The color is amazing, the fibers are soft and the over all look of the wig is matte with just enough of a healthy looking shine to make it look real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this wig for fun and for part of a mermaid costume.</li>
            <li>It is however a nice wig, the actual one that is.</li>
            <li>I love how soft it is and just the length of it.</li>
            <li>The hair looks so realistic and healthy, and feels so real</li>
            <li>i noticed i pretty much have a palm sized amount of hair just from finger combing!!</li>
            <li>Out of every material, natural- and unnatural-color, and price, this is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>I love this wig, it feels and looks just like real hair, I even had a hair stylist come up to me and ask if I would be interested in being a hair model for her, and was surprised when I told her I was wearing a wig.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>This was my first wig</li>
            <li>i do not know what wig those pictures are broadcasting because it most definitely is not the one i received.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product, and will buy from x&amp;y angel again :)</li>
            <li>was hoping to be able to wear it out casually in public, but in person it just seems a bit too wiggy to do that.</li>
            <li>Just got it today and was surprised how silky and smooth it is!&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will be ordering from this company again very soon!</li>
            <li>are nice but not ment to last a long time only if u take really good care of It</li>
            <li>I am so in love with this wig and I will definitely buy from this company again!</li>
            <li>because of the price i expected it to be low quality but the reviews and pictures offered suggested that the hair was real good quality for low price.</li>
            <li>The style and color itself is cute and the wig is quite long.</li>
            <li>loved the style, but wig cap was too small, wig slide on head,</li>
            <li>Also it does not shed and can be brushed easily.</li>
            <li>So I decided to buy a wig that was realistic enough to fool my friends and one that&#x27;s easy to manage and this was my first choice.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>(In sunlight, it&#x27;s very shiny.)</li>
            <li>and I really like it</li>
            <li>so much of the hair is falling out that i decided not to use the wig at all.</li>
            <li>The sellers are also very helpful.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really shiny but after brushing and wearing it, it looked just like real</li>
            <li>because that auburn is very lovely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i have nothing i was hoping to use it for a real photoshoot</li>
            <li>It really does feel like really hair.</li>
            <li>The color was really off and shiny.</li>
            <li>that i wouldn&#x27;t know, i&#x27;ll chuck it up to mines being apart of a bad batch i am willing to buy one more hoping this one is of good quality</li>
            <li>I hope this particular wig is never discontinued.</li>
            <li>Coming from china, it got here in decent timing.</li>
            <li>Just a normal brush.</li>
            <li>only thing is she had to trim up the bangs to fit properly around her face but</li>
            <li>just looks like a cheap halloween wig that i will be wearig for halloween only and not out in public</li>
            <li>dark auburn/red colour almost like light burgundy .&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love how I can wear it up, pulled back, or down and canâ€™t tell itâ€™s a wig.</li>
            <li>This wig is super long and thick, beautiful dark red color.</li>
            <li>The wig cap I had bought separately made the wig slip, but the one that came with the wig fits snug on my head, without it being too tight and makes the wig fit much better!&lt;br /&gt;The wig has the same waviness as in the picture and reaches almost to my hips at the longest.</li>
            <li>I got it in the mail, it looked a little more of an auburn color, but it&#x27;s not that big of a deal to me.</li>
            <li>Good for casual nights out.</li>
            <li>I bought this wig so that I could instantly have super long hair, and that&#x27;s what I got.</li>
            <li>Comes with a wig net cap which I did not use since my real hair is short.</li>
            <li>I was going for a natural looking wig that I could wear out occasionally.</li>
            <li>It depends on what you&#x27;re expecting; obviously you&#x27;re not going to get a 100% natural looking wig for fifteen bucks.</li>
            <li>no trouble with it in the back.</li>
            <li>(Im a natural red head)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s short and cheap and a purple red with black mixed in that stands out !!!</li>
            <li>It was long and very soft just like human hair.</li>
            <li>It does say &#x27;Wine Red&#x27; and the wig I received was a dark burgundy color that in no way resembles the pretty lighter red</li>
            <li>I used dry shampoo and a professional leave in conditioner to help keep the wig manageable.</li>

            <li> Also it does not shed and can be brushed easily.</li>
            <li> So I decided to buy a wig that was realistic enough to fool my friends and one that&#x27;s easy to manage and this was my first choice.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> (In sunlight, it&#x27;s very shiny.)</li>
            <li> and I really like it</li>
            <li> so much of the hair is falling out that i decided not to use the wig at all.</li>
            <li> The sellers are also very helpful.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really shiny but after brushing and wearing it, it looked just like real</li>
            <li> because that auburn is very lovely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i have nothing i was hoping to use it for a real photoshoot</li>
            <li> It really does feel like really hair.</li>
            <li> The color was really off and shiny.</li>
            <li> that i wouldn&#x27;t know, i&#x27;ll chuck it up to mines being apart of a bad batch i am willing to buy one more hoping this one is of good quality</li>
            <li> I hope this particular wig is never discontinued.</li>
            <li> Coming from china, it got here in decent timing.</li>
            <li> Just a normal brush.</li>
            <li> only thing is she had to trim up the bangs to fit properly around her face but</li>
            <li> just looks like a cheap halloween wig that i will be wearig for halloween only and not out in public</li>
            <li> dark auburn/red colour almost like light burgundy .&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love how I can wear it up, pulled back, or down and canâ€™t tell itâ€™s a wig.</li>
            <li> This wig is super long and thick, beautiful dark red color.</li>
            <li> The wig cap I had bought separately made the wig slip, but the one that came with the wig fits snug on my head, without it being too tight and makes the wig fit much better!&lt;br /&gt;The wig has the same waviness as in the picture and reaches almost to my hips at the longest.</li>
            <li> I got it in the mail, it looked a little more of an auburn color, but it&#x27;s not that big of a deal to me.</li>
            <li> Good for casual nights out.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig so that I could instantly have super long hair, and that&#x27;s what I got.</li>
            <li> Comes with a wig net cap which I did not use since my real hair is short.</li>
            <li> I was going for a natural looking wig that I could wear out occasionally.</li>
            <li> It depends on what you&#x27;re expecting; obviously you&#x27;re not going to get a 100% natural looking wig for fifteen bucks.</li>
            <li> no trouble with it in the back.</li>
            <li> (Im a natural red head)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s short and cheap and a purple red with black mixed in that stands out !!!</li>
            <li> It was long and very soft just like human hair.</li>
            <li> It does say &#x27;Wine Red&#x27; and the wig I received was a dark burgundy color that in no way resembles the pretty lighter red</li>
            <li> I used dry shampoo and a professional leave in conditioner to help keep the wig manageable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is definitely more a wig for costumes than for casual wear.</li>
            <li> If you wore this out on a regular day everyone would know it was a wig and in this particular color you might end up looking a little trashy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, very long and layered with loose waves.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see it lasting a really long time if its not properly maintained, but if its gone in 3 months, I&#x27;m just going to go get another.</li>
            <li> There were a few little tangles, but I just went through it a couple of times with my fingers, and brushed it lightly for a harder tangle.</li>
            <li> kinda still fake looking color shine hair falls out easily</li>
            <li> It looks EXACTLY like the photos if not BETTER!!</li>
            <li> not to mention it isnt a full wig very thin</li>
            <li> I trimmed about 3-4 inches off of it because it was tangling bad, but it&#x27;s doing better now.</li>
            <li> The wig also does not look like the pictures - it is a weird pinkish red color &amp; very frizzy.</li>
            <li> It is not real hair like you posted</li>
            <li> other</li>
            <li> The color wasn&#x27;t even close, the style I wound up with was long and the bangs are choppy, nothing like the wavy feathered look in the ad picture.</li>
            <li> just adjusting to the dark color</li>
            <li> The material itself is average</li>
            <li> as i try to use the wig brush to lay down the hair neatly</li>
            <li> you would&#x27;ve had to use a black wig cap to hide that it has gaps.</li>
            <li> The bangs are too thick (which i was able to thin out a little bit, but still kinda fake looking), and the part is just a circle which looks odd.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s short, gets frizzy often, and hard to manage!</li>
            <li> Sorry this review is so short, I just wrote four other for the other wigs I ordered.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheaply made.</li>
            <li> After a few uses it got a bit tangled</li>
            <li> This is the first time I actually considered buying a wig because I just hated my hair.</li>
            <li> The bangs were a little weird, but it only took me a couple minutes to trim it the way i wanted it.</li>
            <li> The wig cap is kinda small.</li>
            <li> the wig was really hard to get on because it was too small for my head.</li>
            <li> I can wear it out in the blistering SoCal afternoon heat and the cap don&#x27;t feel heavy, tight, or uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> At least you won&#x27;t be too out of pocket if this wig doesn&#x27;t work for you</li>
            <li> the price is ridiculously good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like, seriously.</li>
            <li> When I open the package, I did not like the item since it was bad quality</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good.</li>
            <li> I received the wig in the wrong color, the bangs were cut unevenly, and instead of wavy it was curly.</li>
            <li> over all i am not happy it makes no sense to return given the price i paid</li>
            <li> and they do offer a return if you are not happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you let it get messy, you&#x27;re gonna have a bad time brushing it.</li>
            <li> I test drove it after I received it and had this happen twice within an hour with very weak wind speeds, my husband pointed it out once and another time I noticed it in a glass door at the store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to comb through</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and it looks so fake is rediculous</li>
            <li> She likes it and the price wasn&#x27;t too bad either.</li>
            <li> so why im disappointed in the color</li>
            <li> HATE</li>
            <li> IT HATE</li>
            <li> IT HATE IT</li>
            <li> I hate the wig and wouldn&#x27;t wish it on anyone.</li>
            <li> When I opened the bag the wig was damp all over &amp; smelled disgusting like mildew.</li>
            <li> This is horribly made and not even close to what I ordered.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The color itself is my favorite quality of this wig.. LOVE IT! It got here within 7 days.. ;) I&#x27;m beyond happy with it! When people can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s not your hair you KNOW it&#x27;s awesome..</li>
            <li> I bought this wig so that I could instantly have super long hair, and that&#x27;s what I got. I was going for a natural looking wig that I could wear out occasionally. The bangs aren&#x27;t the most natural looking; they&#x27;re thick and a bit too perfect. But the rest of the hair is pretty natural looking, depending on what kind of lighting that you are in. (In sunlight, it&#x27;s very shiny.) I trimmed about 3-4 inches off of it because it was tangling bad, but it&#x27;s doing better now. I would wear a hat to hide the not-so-natural circular hair part, but I think it&#x27;s pretty nice. I think that it is good for photographing, but not exactly everyday wear. As for the color, it is darker than the picture shows, but the customer review images will help to see what the true color is. It depends on what you&#x27;re expecting; obviously you&#x27;re not going to get a 100% natural looking wig for fifteen bucks. I&#x27;m happy with it, though.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a deep whine color instead of the auburn red shown. the wig was really hard to get on because it was too small for my head.</li>
            <li> its not long its kind of short.&lt;br /&gt;beautiful dark auburn/red colour almost like light burgundy .&lt;br /&gt;its full and has beautiful curls . not the product in the image but I loved it . will order again as back up (: â™¥</li>
            <li> I love changing my hair but coloring is expensive and damaging to my hair so I decided to try a wig.  There&#x27;s no looking back.  This wig looks very natural and beautiful. I&#x27;ve already received so many compliments. It&#x27;s easy to put on and the included wig cap works well.  It got here pretty quick, about a week and the wig was in great condition. I will definitely order from them again.</li>
            <li> This was my first wig and I really like it, my husband said I don&#x27;t even look like myself (it&#x27;s the bangs lol). It&#x27;s difficult to comb through but I&#x27;m sure I should do more research on combing wig hair before I blame it all on the wig. When it gets any bit a wind blowing through it, you can tell it&#x27;s a wig in the front, no trouble with it in the back. I test drove it after I received it and had this happen twice within an hour with very weak wind speeds, my husband pointed it out once and another time I noticed it in a glass door at the store. But other than difficulty combing and the wind showing a bit of wig proof, it&#x27;s beautiful and I love how I look in it.</li>
            <li> because of the price i expected it to be low quality but the reviews and pictures offered suggested that the hair was real good quality for low price. I took the hair out of the bag it came in and because some of it stuck to the seal those strands already came out of the wig without a problem...i figured wigs shed no big deal. as i&#x27;m finger brushing the wig more strands are coming out i noticed i pretty much have a palm sized amount of hair just from finger combing!! the hair has a shiny look about it something like one you would buy from party city. as i&#x27;m putting the wig on i determine it has an itchy feel about my face. i didnt like that. as i try to use the wig brush to lay down the hair neatly so much of the hair is falling out that i decided not to use the wig at all. not to mention it isnt a full wig very thin you would&#x27;ve had to use a black wig cap to hide that it has gaps. over all i am not happy it makes no sense to return given the price i paid i do not know what wig those pictures are broadcasting because it most definitely is not the one i received. not saying all the wigs from this company are like that i wouldn&#x27;t know, i&#x27;ll chuck it up to mines being apart of a bad batch i am willing to buy one more hoping this one is of good quality</li>
            <li> For the price, this wig is fantastic! The wig I received is the color in the picture, not a cranberry red like explained in another review. The curl pattern is great and the bangs are easily pulled to the side which was easy for me. I didn&#x27;t have to cut them. Very happy with my purchase! The sellers are also very helpful.</li>
            <li> This is a great buy especially for the price! It&#x27;s not cheaply made. I bought it for a Halloween and it will be perfect! Also it does not shed and can be brushed easily.</li>
            <li> I opened the package &amp; found condensation inside the bag the wig came in. When I opened the bag the wig was damp all over &amp; smelled disgusting like mildew. The wig also does not look like the pictures - it is a weird pinkish red color &amp; very frizzy. I tried washing it &amp; it still smells like mildew. I probably won&#x27;t wear it for that reason &amp; will definitely never purchase from seller again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my absolute fav, but let me tell you that the quality of this wig is amazing, looks so real and has a beautiful color just like the picture. My bf loves it! haha</li>
            <li> Out of every material, natural- and unnatural-color, and price, this is my absolute favorite. The length is just right, the shade is a flattering auburn, the waviness is gorgeous. I can wear it out in the blistering SoCal afternoon heat and the cap don&#x27;t feel heavy, tight, or uncomfortable. I hope this particular wig is never discontinued.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful. i got this hoping to get it before homecoming, which it did. Coming from china, it got here in decent timing. I&#x27;ve had it for a couple days now, and received lots of compliments already. People like the color, and the nice curls. The bangs were a little weird, but it only took me a couple minutes to trim it the way i wanted it. It does shed quite a bit, but i think only because I haven&#x27;t been brushing it with a wig brush.. Just a normal brush. it didn&#x27;t lose it&#x27;s curl. If you let it get messy, you&#x27;re gonna have a bad time brushing it. It looks just like the one in the picture, except for the color. But the color is amazing. So no complaints there. All in all, this is a nice wig, for how cheap it is. I don&#x27;t see it lasting a really long time if its not properly maintained, but if its gone in 3 months, I&#x27;m just going to go get another. I love it, love the color, the length, the bangs, and the curls.It&#x27;s really shiny but after brushing and wearing it, it looked just like real hair.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the wait and the money. I definitely recommend this product, and will buy from x&amp;y angel again :)&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the beautiful hair!! Can&#x27;t wait to wear it to homecoming.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews, I was so excited  to get this wig!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping to be able to wear it out casually in public, but in person it just seems a bit too wiggy to do that. For costumes it would be fine. The bangs are too thick (which i was able to thin out a little bit, but still kinda fake looking), and the part is just a circle which looks odd. The style and color itself is cute and the wig is quite long. But it is also unnaturally shiny... you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Well,&lt;br /&gt;I think the wig looks better in the picture. The wig needs more hair on it bec you can see the wig cap underneath. I have not worn it yet but it looks like it can get tangled quickly. The seller sent me a comb, hair stand and a special spray for it, I thought that was nice of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is a 3 out of a 5, but hey it was only $9.</li>
            <li> This wig was beautifu. Although the one i was sent is not the one in the picture. It was long and very soft just like human hair.</li>
            <li> This is horribly made and not even close to what I ordered. It&#x27;s supposed to be longer and a completely different picture was shown when I ordered it... And then the company picture swapped and it looks nothing like that either. It&#x27;s short and cheap and a purple red with black mixed in that stands out !!! It&#x27;s not good.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my sister and she fell in love right when she took it out of the package! it got shipped in about a week or so (coming from china) and the price is ridiculously good.&lt;br /&gt;the only thing is she had to trim up the bangs to fit properly around her face but other then that i give it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I love this wig. Just got it today and was surprised how silky and smooth it is!&lt;br /&gt;Only downfall is that its almost like a purple red (wine red) as stated above...was hoping it was the same color as the&lt;br /&gt;picture because that auburn is very lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I like it... just adjusting to the dark color (Im a natural red head) so why im disappointed in the color</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and it looks so fake is rediculous it&#x27;s not the same color that was shown at all HATE IT HATE IT HATE IT</li>
            <li> I purchased this wig for fun and for part of a mermaid costume. Let me just say thing this wig is one of the better wigs I&#x27;ve ever tried. It&#x27;s soft, very long and layered with loose waves. The red color is beautiful and looked great with my slightly tan skin tone. I got compliments from all types of people and most of them thought it was my real hair. After a few uses it got a bit tangled so I had my coworker trim it (we are hairstylists). Also had to trim and layer the bangs. Besides that this is a beautiful hair piece and not too costumey. I used dry shampoo and a professional leave in conditioner to help keep the wig manageable. Comes with a wig net cap which I did not use since my real hair is short.</li>
            <li> just in love with the color it&#x27;s sexy and fun and I&#x27;m so loving the color lol â€¦ I would recommend it for anyone who can pull it off</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter to see if she&#x27;d like the color.  She likes it and the price wasn&#x27;t too bad either.</li>
            <li> loved the style, but wig cap was too small, wig slide on head, no combs to keep wig in place, tangles and knots easily</li>
            <li> UHG. This wig is perfect. Like, seriously. The color is amazing, the fibers are soft and the over all look of the wig is matte with just enough of a healthy looking shine to make it look real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering from this company again very soon! Sorry this review is so short, I just wrote four other for the other wigs I ordered. lol</li>
            <li> When I open the package, I did not like the item since it was bad quality so I end up throwing it away without using it.</li>
            <li> I love this wig, it feels and looks just like real hair, I even had a hair stylist come up to me and ask if I would be interested in being a hair model for her, and was surprised when I told her I was wearing a wig. I love how I can wear it up, pulled back, or down and canâ€™t tell itâ€™s a wig.</li>
            <li> It is not real hair like you posted i went to wash it now i have nothing i was hoping to use it for a real photoshoot</li>
            <li> I love my wig but its not the wig you see in the photo. They need to change the photo to what it was before, the actual wig. It is however a nice wig, the actual one that is.</li>
            <li> just looks like a cheap halloween wig that i will be wearig for halloween only and not out in public</li>
            <li> This wig is super long and thick, beautiful dark red color. Sheds and tangles a bit but you get what you pay for. Good for casual nights out. Great buy, love it.</li>
            <li> I got it in red and it looks awesome and not insanely cheap/synthetic.</li>
            <li> Color is beautiful not to shiny but kinda still fake looking color shine hair falls out easily so u really gatta take good care of it bangs are nice but not ment to last a long time only if u take really good care of It</li>
            <li> I received the wig in the wrong color, the bangs were cut unevenly, and instead of wavy it was curly.</li>
            <li> It really does feel like really hair. I love it. My family lives it. This is a great wig. You gotta get it.</li>
            <li> Im seriously in love with this wig. It&#x27;s more Auburn than wine red, but it still beautiful. It looks EXACTLY like the photos if not BETTER!! I get so many compliments on it and no one even thinks it is a wig!!!</li>
            <li> The color wasn&#x27;t even close, the style I wound up with was long and the bangs are choppy, nothing like the wavy feathered look in the ad picture. I hate the wig and wouldn&#x27;t wish it on anyone. Thankfully soon after that thing came in the mail I found a better, more professional place to order wigs from. I&#x27;m thankful I didn&#x27;t waist more money on it. It may work ok for a Halloween costume.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I actually considered buying a wig because I just hated my hair. It&#x27;s short, gets frizzy often, and hard to manage! So I decided to buy a wig that was realistic enough to fool my friends and one that&#x27;s easy to manage and this was my first choice.&lt;br /&gt;When I got it in the mail, it looked a little more of an auburn color, but it&#x27;s not that big of a deal to me. The hair looks so realistic and healthy, and feels so real, I started to think that it could have been human hair! I instantly tried it on and it looked so beautiful I never wanted to take it off! There were a few little tangles, but I just went through it a couple of times with my fingers, and brushed it lightly for a harder tangle. The wig cap I had bought separately made the wig slip, but the one that came with the wig fits snug on my head, without it being too tight and makes the wig fit much better!&lt;br /&gt;The wig has the same waviness as in the picture and reaches almost to my hips at the longest. I am so in love with this wig and I will definitely buy from this company again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so beautiful, curly and just perfect.I love how soft it is and just the length of it. This wig is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I put my order in august 25th it said itd get here Sept 19-aug 7th did anyone get theirs sooner? I&#x27;m just so excited because of everything I&#x27;ve read about it. The reviews look great and I can&#x27;t wait any longer!</li>
            <li> I bought this wig after reading all of the great reviews and then could&#x27;ve kicked myself for not realizing that most of the 5 star reviewers have only ever reviewed this wig and are most likely hired reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picture is misleading but the name of the color isn&#x27;t, I blame myself for that. It does say &#x27;Wine Red&#x27; and the wig I received was a dark burgundy color that in no way resembles the pretty lighter red that the photo represents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely more a wig for costumes than for casual wear. If you wore this out on a regular day everyone would know it was a wig and in this particular color you might end up looking a little trashy. The material itself is average but I would say is slightly better than I would expect for the price. At least you won&#x27;t be too out of pocket if this wig doesn&#x27;t work for you and they do offer a return if you are not happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a cheap wig I would go with another color in this line and make sure you stick with its title rather than the photo.</li>
            <li> The color was really off and shiny. The wig cap is kinda small. It looks okay but I&#x27;d say it would be better  to spend more and get a better wig.</li>
