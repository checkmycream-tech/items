            <li>I was developing more laterally on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>Of course, I always have more popping up that need attention.  </li>
            <li>Hey Amazon shopper,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t write many reviews, but when I find a product that works, I feel obligated to share my experience.</li>
            <li>Boy am I glad</li>

            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>My doctor suggested I use it - I have used it for several years on my arms for bruising - it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>I will do more and see how it continues.</li>
            <li>Love using the cream on my legs.  </li>
            <li>so it is very clean.</li>
            <li>It is also amazing on bruises and helps to fade them really quickly.  </li>
            <li>For those of us who bruise easily, another trick is to rub the bruise quickly with your knuckle until the skin feels warm.</li>
            <li>There are better available</li>
            <li>It works great on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried other creams and this one seems to work the best.</li>
            <li>It will help to heal them very quickly and keep them from swelling.</li>
            <li>Used for easy bruising on sun damaged skin.  </li>
            <li>I bruise easily &amp; this does make them go away faster</li>
            <li>I bruise easily and am always finding bruises on my legs, even when I don&#x27;t remember bumping into anything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I bruise easily.  </li>
            <li>However, since my bruising is pretty severe (my own fault), I have yet to see the results that I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>Your bruises will fade much more quickly.</li>
            <li>I however see a softer glowing look, i lightly apply makeup.</li>
            <li>Great for undereye gross circles.</li>
            <li>We liked so much that this was a re-order</li>
            <li>This is truly a fantastic cream for rosacia or any type of redness.  </li>
            <li>I also found it works great on the back of my hands to lighten age spots.</li>
            <li>This product is great for scars and hematomas but if u want a really big hematoma to cleae out in 2 weeks just ise</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m young and in good health which may help with its effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good product so far.</li>
            <li>It has very little smell which is pleasant and it feels good on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is great stuff if you have a minor cut, scrape or burn.  </li>
            <li>I have used twice a day since it arrived four days and the hideous spider veins on my nose were significantly diminished within two days.</li>
            <li>Product as described and in original packaging</li>
            <li>I am truly super impressed with the quick timing (although these were both new problems vs. long standing issues).</li>
            <li>bright red.</li>
            <li>Not too thrilled with it, it states it helps fade and clear bruises which it did somewhat</li>
            <li>#34;it&#x27;s really cool that you moisturize your skin.  </li>
            <li>I read that Vitamin K is good for minimizing spider veins so I looked for some but couldn&#x27;t find it in any local stores.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good on this product, was sceptical read</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan of Reviva labs because the company has some good products to offer ; their 10% glycolic acid cream being a solid case in point.</li>
            <li>I quickly found out that it clogs my pores though</li>
            <li>/&gt;Delivery was quick.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with the results, which don&#x27;t happen overnight, but they are quick enough for you to notice after two weeks of daily use (I put mine on at nighttime after cleaning my face).</li>
            <li>Not greasy at all and absorbs quick.</li>
            <li>Reviva Labs Vitamin K cream worked great in diminishing the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Great for bruises and dark circles ..</li>
            <li>Often I use it all over my face and find it to be good for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>It also helps bruises clear more quickly.</li>
            <li>This is the best mild cream I have yet to try for around my tired eyes.</li>
            <li>I have very light skin that I exposed to a lot of tanning and burning when I was in my teens and early twenties.  </li>
            <li>i will obviously have to mix together my own batch of vitamin k cream from shea butter and vitamin k capsules.</li>
            <li>Does not work nearly as well as Vita-K product for skin bruising and costs more.</li>
            <li>varicose veins are minimal to moderate at best.</li>
            <li>Maybe Vitamin K is just really powerful, and not meant to be put around the eyes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>worth the 11-14 bux</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only thing he has found that really does a good job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth giving it a try to see if it will work for you.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see just how many spider veins it has removed.  </li>
            <li>It contains Vitamin K, which has a powerful effect on bleeding.</li>
            <li>K product, but this one appears to be far more powerful.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone who bruises easily.  </li>
            <li>I like this cream very much it absorbs quickly and leaves no greasy residue.</li>
            <li>right now.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Got my item and started using it right away.</li>
            <li>I washed it off right away</li>
            <li>After being rather embarrassed by some very large bruses that took forever to go away</li>
            <li>There is no question that this helps both with helping to fade bruises more quickly and after one small tub of it, my arm/hand skin is more elastic.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 87 year old mother, who bruises easily.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is I&#x27;ve had to stick with it for over six months applying it after every face wash to finally look in the mirror one day and be happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t seem to do very much for my skin.</li>
            <li>I like this cream very much.</li>
            <li>I am pretty amazed by this stuff.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a lite whitening agent in the formula to help cover dark circles around the eyes which I know is important to the ladies more so than the dudes.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well with fading bruising.  </li>
            <li>This cream does exactly what it is supposed to.  </li>
            <li>Since I have tried a lot of remedies I was willing to try another.</li>
            <li>I just gave this product a rating of three stars because Overall I am satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>You will see some results overnight, most likely, as I have.  </li>
            <li>I really like it this cream!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It also works great for the dark circles under my eyes, and it definitely fades bruises quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 70 years old and it really works!!!</li>
            <li>This creme fades the bruises quickly and leaves her skin looking normal.</li>
            <li>This product was very reasonable and really seems to be working.  </li>
            <li>On a positive note this is a dense cream (like Nivea).  </li>
            <li>It seems to me the positive reviews may have been paid for or solicited from the product owner.</li>
            <li>In my case is is, so the turn around is pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Since I can bruise easily, I&#x27;ve tried a few vitamin k products, and this one is far more effective than the other ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This is great stuff, especially if you have dark circles under your eyes.</li>
            <li>I tried many products to no avail, and figured I had nothing to loose by trying Vitamin K cream.</li>
            <li>This is a great cream to heal bruises and black and blue marks.</li>
            <li>I have seen a little improvement, but not as much as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>Read ALL the reviews, good and bad; form your own opinion.  </li>
            <li>and I can really see a difference.  </li>
            <li>I was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>fast and what I wanted</li>
            <li>This K cream does help to fade them out much quicker.</li>
            <li>Bruises get lighter with the treatment and go away much faster too.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very stressed so until I do something about that</li>
            <li>I really like the cream.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping to see some of them diminish from around my nose.</li>
            <li>My husband uses this to help heal bruises--works very well.</li>
            <li>This cream did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>I was one of those people who used this for two whole months and noticed no difference.</li>
            <li>and it really hasn&#x27;t done anything.  </li>
            <li>Very creamy.</li>
            <li>I really like the feel of the product on my face.</li>
            <li>The smell is very neutral and unnoticeable so it won&#x27;t clash with anything else you&#x27;re using.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Bruising heals much faster than with anything else.</li>
            <li>If you want to get rid of the &amp;#34;age spots&amp;#34; or bruises that come with aging, this product really does the job.  </li>
            <li>but it burned my face, I have really senistive skin and ezcema so i would not suggest buying it</li>
            <li>It did help with bruises, and it works fast.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see much of a differ</li>
            <li>It really made no difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also starting taking Vitamin K supplements and extra Vitamin C, and to be honest, I&#x27;m not sure which part is the most helpful, but together it&#x27;s all working!</li>
            <li>First of all this cream works as a light moisturizer for my &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;  meaning not overly dry or overly oily skin.  </li>
            <li>have pretty clear skin, but a stray pimple or two left some red spots on my cheeks that I had been trying to clear for a good two years.</li>
            <li>i was hoping to try it for a full month, but it&#x27;s just too gross.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make dark circles under eyes go away, no matter how many times a day you use it.</li>
            <li>When I look at my tractor it seems I get a new bruise!</li>
            <li>It does make a decent moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>doing some reading on the internet, I came upon a report suggesting that vitamin K cream works in fading the dark bruises.&lt;br /&gt;Being an avid Amazon.com shopper, I decided to see if it was available on Amazon</li>
            <li>the spider veins (or maybe broken capillaries would be more accurate) on the sides and bottom of my nose</li>
            <li>My older vintage skin gets those red-purple spots from bumping my hands and arms into everything around the garage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen ENORMOUS improvements, I&#x27;ve been only using it for one week and my eyes are better.</li>
            <li>She uses just a tiny bit, and showed off to me how it quickly removed the bruising from her skin.  </li>
            <li>Takes several days on mild bruised.  </li>
            <li>If anyone might have an idea on what&#x27;s going on with the left eye (maybe indicating something internal) would love to hear comments.</li>
            <li>highly recommend for use before and after cosmetic procedures that leave bruising.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this because I care about how I look.</li>
            <li>I had really high hopes after reading the reviews before buying, but this product didn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li>This stuff worked right away, I noticed an immediate difference in days with rings being lighter and bag going away, I say bag because this only seemed to be happening on my right eye, with not too much difference on the left.</li>
            <li>Vitamin K Cream is now part of my permanent routine along with Nars Tinted Moisturizer everyday to prevent any more UV damage.</li>
            <li>recommended, use it twice daily (after your shower, right before bed)</li>
            <li>So when I developed some bruising under my eyes due to broken capillaries, I turned to this product with high hopes of being able to effectively counter it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally gush about products, but this one&#x27;s clearly got something that works!</li>
            <li>It seems it might help a little, and maybe it will help more as I continue trying it for a longer time, but  so far there are  no drastic changes.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li>I have been using it faithfully twice a day on clean skin, but with absolutely no affect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of clumsy, and my legs are littered with bumps and bruises from frequent accidents.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product about a year and a half ago, to put on the dark spots under my eyes from swim goggles (which I had just stopped using for good when I got the cream).  </li>
            <li>Vitamin K cream by REviva is super and it really helps reduce any dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li>It works really well on getting rid of a hickey barely noticeable in 2 days gone in 3</li>
            <li>my wife love&#x27;s it Few days and the bruise is gone!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased to not be all black and blue.</li>
            <li>Very self conscious about them at times, especially when people mistaken the circles for a black-eye.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a cure all, but I think it does shorten the time until they clear up.  </li>
            <li>but so far it&#x27;s just 3 stars.</li>
            <li>old</li>
            <li>As far as clearing up spider veins no way, doesn&#x27;t even come close, spider veins on my nose still there</li>
            <li>This makes the areas that I use this on so so soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Vitamin K, as MK-7, by Jarrow, 90 micrograms, 60 soft gels.)  </li>
            <li>I am using this product for nearly three weeks</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>so I will continue to use it till spider veins r completely gone.</li>
            <li>So far this cream appears to be doing it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li>I have a tendency to get purpura and it really makes such a difference in shortening the time it lasts as well as keeping it under control.</li>
            <li>Clean any cut, laceration, opening, bleeding or healing area, and then rub a little in to it.  </li>
            <li>:  I&#x27;ve used this for a month and a half now and find it does help bruises to disappear quickly.  </li>
            <li>This actually works for my older mom who has thinning capillaries</li>
            <li>the bruises do not hurt at all, it is just very embarrasing and they take a long time to go away.</li>
            <li>I approached this product with a dose of skepticism, expecting a long commitment, but it really has been a miracle worker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:</li>
            <li>Sometimes, this causes me to burst little blood vessels on my face, making me look like I have mild acne.  </li>
            <li>So far, I I have little success in removing skin blemishes.</li>
            <li>The skin lightener got rid of the tannish color but left behind the pink which this lightened/cleared up pretty nicely.</li>
            <li>I am also applying it to tiny spider veins, but so far I have not seen clear results.  </li>
            <li>A little dab will go a long way, and the results are easily seen.</li>
            <li>Also from a very young age I was often told I looked like the Campbell soup kid because of my rosey red cheeks.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this because I really like Reviva products and to help with the broken capillaries on my nose and cheeks.  </li>
            <li>You do need to rub it in quickly or it may leave a slight white residue.</li>
            <li>When I read review prior to buying, i was hoping as the packaging suggests that helps fade and clear bruises.</li>
            <li>All of my life going back to early childhood</li>
            <li>Then another time it barely made a difference</li>
            <li>so your bruise will look worse before it gets better.</li>
            <li>Amount of product is &amp;#34;not that much.&amp;#34;  I went thru the first jar in less than three weeks.  </li>
            <li>Under my eyes they are a little puffy but look a lot better than the sunken eyes, as I said the color is a little lighter.</li>
            <li>This actually does help lighten the dark circles under my eyes when I use it consistently.</li>
            <li>The bruise was several days old before I got the cream but began fading the second day after using.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had large dark rings around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Usually, I would have a bruise for 6 weeks or more, and this cream cleared it in less than 2.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a complete disappearance, but the circles are lighter--more reddish than blackish--and they don&#x27;t extend as far.</li>
            <li>Although the circles are not completely gone, but they have lightened up to where I am not as self conscious about them.</li>
            <li>I got this thinking it would actually work on my naturally dark eyebags that I have suffered from my whole life.</li>
            <li>(It hurts a little initially but it works really well.)</li>
            <li>I think it helps a little, but ultimately it depends on how much sleep</li>

            <li> makes a nice light cream that will hopefully fade spots.  </li>
            <li> I was developing more laterally on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Of course, I always have more popping up that need attention.  </li>
            <li> Hey Amazon shopper,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t write many reviews, but when I find a product that works, I feel obligated to share my experience.</li>
            <li> Boy am I glad</li>
            <li> The results will come, and I think you’ll be as pleased as I am.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> My doctor suggested I use it - I have used it for several years on my arms for bruising - it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I will do more and see how it continues.</li>
            <li> Love using the cream on my legs.  </li>
            <li> so it is very clean.</li>
            <li> It is also amazing on bruises and helps to fade them really quickly.  </li>
            <li> For those of us who bruise easily, another trick is to rub the bruise quickly with your knuckle until the skin feels warm.</li>
            <li> There are better available</li>
            <li> It works great on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried other creams and this one seems to work the best.</li>
            <li> It will help to heal them very quickly and keep them from swelling.</li>
            <li> Used for easy bruising on sun damaged skin.  </li>
            <li> I bruise easily &amp; this does make them go away faster</li>
            <li> I bruise easily and am always finding bruises on my legs, even when I don&#x27;t remember bumping into anything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I bruise easily.  </li>
            <li> However, since my bruising is pretty severe (my own fault), I have yet to see the results that I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Your bruises will fade much more quickly.</li>
            <li> I however see a softer glowing look, i lightly apply makeup.</li>
            <li> Great for undereye gross circles.</li>
            <li> We liked so much that this was a re-order</li>
            <li> This is truly a fantastic cream for rosacia or any type of redness.  </li>
            <li> I also found it works great on the back of my hands to lighten age spots.</li>
            <li> This product is great for scars and hematomas but if u want a really big hematoma to cleae out in 2 weeks just ise</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m young and in good health which may help with its effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good product so far.</li>
            <li> It has very little smell which is pleasant and it feels good on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is great stuff if you have a minor cut, scrape or burn.  </li>
            <li> I have used twice a day since it arrived four days and the hideous spider veins on my nose were significantly diminished within two days.</li>
            <li> Product as described and in original packaging</li>
            <li> I am truly super impressed with the quick timing (although these were both new problems vs. long standing issues).</li>
            <li> bright red.</li>
            <li> Not too thrilled with it, it states it helps fade and clear bruises which it did somewhat</li>
            <li> #34;it&#x27;s really cool that you moisturize your skin.  </li>
            <li> I read that Vitamin K is good for minimizing spider veins so I looked for some but couldn&#x27;t find it in any local stores.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good on this product, was sceptical read</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Reviva labs because the company has some good products to offer ; their 10% glycolic acid cream being a solid case in point.</li>
            <li> I quickly found out that it clogs my pores though</li>
            <li> /&gt;Delivery was quick.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with the results, which don&#x27;t happen overnight, but they are quick enough for you to notice after two weeks of daily use (I put mine on at nighttime after cleaning my face).</li>
            <li> Not greasy at all and absorbs quick.</li>
            <li> Reviva Labs Vitamin K cream worked great in diminishing the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Great for bruises and dark circles ..</li>
            <li> Often I use it all over my face and find it to be good for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> It also helps bruises clear more quickly.</li>
            <li> This is the best mild cream I have yet to try for around my tired eyes.</li>
            <li> I have very light skin that I exposed to a lot of tanning and burning when I was in my teens and early twenties.  </li>
            <li> i will obviously have to mix together my own batch of vitamin k cream from shea butter and vitamin k capsules.</li>
            <li> Does not work nearly as well as Vita-K product for skin bruising and costs more.</li>
            <li> varicose veins are minimal to moderate at best.</li>
            <li> Maybe Vitamin K is just really powerful, and not meant to be put around the eyes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> worth the 11-14 bux</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing he has found that really does a good job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth giving it a try to see if it will work for you.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see just how many spider veins it has removed.  </li>
            <li> It contains Vitamin K, which has a powerful effect on bleeding.</li>
            <li> K product, but this one appears to be far more powerful.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone who bruises easily.  </li>
            <li> I like this cream very much it absorbs quickly and leaves no greasy residue.</li>
            <li> right now.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Got my item and started using it right away.</li>
            <li> I washed it off right away</li>
            <li> After being rather embarrassed by some very large bruses that took forever to go away</li>
            <li> There is no question that this helps both with helping to fade bruises more quickly and after one small tub of it, my arm/hand skin is more elastic.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my 87 year old mother, who bruises easily.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is I&#x27;ve had to stick with it for over six months applying it after every face wash to finally look in the mirror one day and be happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to do very much for my skin.</li>
            <li> I like this cream very much.</li>
            <li> I am pretty amazed by this stuff.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lite whitening agent in the formula to help cover dark circles around the eyes which I know is important to the ladies more so than the dudes.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well with fading bruising.  </li>
            <li> This cream does exactly what it is supposed to.  </li>
            <li> Since I have tried a lot of remedies I was willing to try another.</li>
            <li> I just gave this product a rating of three stars because Overall I am satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> You will see some results overnight, most likely, as I have.  </li>
            <li> I really like it this cream!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> It also works great for the dark circles under my eyes, and it definitely fades bruises quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 70 years old and it really works!!!</li>
            <li> This creme fades the bruises quickly and leaves her skin looking normal.</li>
            <li> This product was very reasonable and really seems to be working.  </li>
            <li> On a positive note this is a dense cream (like Nivea).  </li>
            <li> It seems to me the positive reviews may have been paid for or solicited from the product owner.</li>
            <li> In my case is is, so the turn around is pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Since I can bruise easily, I&#x27;ve tried a few vitamin k products, and this one is far more effective than the other ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, especially if you have dark circles under your eyes.</li>
            <li> I tried many products to no avail, and figured I had nothing to loose by trying Vitamin K cream.</li>
            <li> This is a great cream to heal bruises and black and blue marks.</li>
            <li> I have seen a little improvement, but not as much as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> Read ALL the reviews, good and bad; form your own opinion.  </li>
            <li> and I can really see a difference.  </li>
            <li> I was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> fast and what I wanted</li>
            <li> This K cream does help to fade them out much quicker.</li>
            <li> Bruises get lighter with the treatment and go away much faster too.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very stressed so until I do something about that</li>
            <li> I really like the cream.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to see some of them diminish from around my nose.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this to help heal bruises--works very well.</li>
            <li> This cream did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> I was one of those people who used this for two whole months and noticed no difference.</li>
            <li> and it really hasn&#x27;t done anything.  </li>
            <li> Very creamy.</li>
            <li> I really like the feel of the product on my face.</li>
            <li> The smell is very neutral and unnoticeable so it won&#x27;t clash with anything else you&#x27;re using.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Bruising heals much faster than with anything else.</li>
            <li> If you want to get rid of the &amp;#34;age spots&amp;#34; or bruises that come with aging, this product really does the job.  </li>
            <li> but it burned my face, I have really senistive skin and ezcema so i would not suggest buying it</li>
            <li> It did help with bruises, and it works fast.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much of a differ</li>
            <li> It really made no difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also starting taking Vitamin K supplements and extra Vitamin C, and to be honest, I&#x27;m not sure which part is the most helpful, but together it&#x27;s all working!</li>
            <li> First of all this cream works as a light moisturizer for my &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;  meaning not overly dry or overly oily skin.  </li>
            <li> have pretty clear skin, but a stray pimple or two left some red spots on my cheeks that I had been trying to clear for a good two years.</li>
            <li> i was hoping to try it for a full month, but it&#x27;s just too gross.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make dark circles under eyes go away, no matter how many times a day you use it.</li>
            <li> When I look at my tractor it seems I get a new bruise!</li>
            <li> It does make a decent moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> doing some reading on the internet, I came upon a report suggesting that vitamin K cream works in fading the dark bruises.&lt;br /&gt;Being an avid Amazon.com shopper, I decided to see if it was available on Amazon</li>
            <li> the spider veins (or maybe broken capillaries would be more accurate) on the sides and bottom of my nose</li>
            <li> My older vintage skin gets those red-purple spots from bumping my hands and arms into everything around the garage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen ENORMOUS improvements, I&#x27;ve been only using it for one week and my eyes are better.</li>
            <li> She uses just a tiny bit, and showed off to me how it quickly removed the bruising from her skin.  </li>
            <li> Takes several days on mild bruised.  </li>
            <li> If anyone might have an idea on what&#x27;s going on with the left eye (maybe indicating something internal) would love to hear comments.</li>
            <li> highly recommend for use before and after cosmetic procedures that leave bruising.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this because I care about how I look.</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes after reading the reviews before buying, but this product didn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked right away, I noticed an immediate difference in days with rings being lighter and bag going away, I say bag because this only seemed to be happening on my right eye, with not too much difference on the left.</li>
            <li> Vitamin K Cream is now part of my permanent routine along with Nars Tinted Moisturizer everyday to prevent any more UV damage.</li>
            <li> recommended, use it twice daily (after your shower, right before bed)</li>
            <li> So when I developed some bruising under my eyes due to broken capillaries, I turned to this product with high hopes of being able to effectively counter it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally gush about products, but this one&#x27;s clearly got something that works!</li>
            <li> It seems it might help a little, and maybe it will help more as I continue trying it for a longer time, but  so far there are  no drastic changes.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li> I have been using it faithfully twice a day on clean skin, but with absolutely no affect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of clumsy, and my legs are littered with bumps and bruises from frequent accidents.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product about a year and a half ago, to put on the dark spots under my eyes from swim goggles (which I had just stopped using for good when I got the cream).  </li>
            <li> Vitamin K cream by REviva is super and it really helps reduce any dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> It works really well on getting rid of a hickey barely noticeable in 2 days gone in 3</li>
            <li> my wife love&#x27;s it Few days and the bruise is gone!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pleased to not be all black and blue.</li>
            <li> Very self conscious about them at times, especially when people mistaken the circles for a black-eye.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a cure all, but I think it does shorten the time until they clear up.  </li>
            <li> but so far it&#x27;s just 3 stars.</li>
            <li> old</li>
            <li> As far as clearing up spider veins no way, doesn&#x27;t even come close, spider veins on my nose still there</li>
            <li> This makes the areas that I use this on so so soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Vitamin K, as MK-7, by Jarrow, 90 micrograms, 60 soft gels.)  </li>
            <li> I am using this product for nearly three weeks</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> so I will continue to use it till spider veins r completely gone.</li>
            <li> So far this cream appears to be doing it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> I have a tendency to get purpura and it really makes such a difference in shortening the time it lasts as well as keeping it under control.</li>
            <li> Clean any cut, laceration, opening, bleeding or healing area, and then rub a little in to it.  </li>
            <li> :  I&#x27;ve used this for a month and a half now and find it does help bruises to disappear quickly.  </li>
            <li> This actually works for my older mom who has thinning capillaries</li>
            <li> the bruises do not hurt at all, it is just very embarrasing and they take a long time to go away.</li>
            <li> I approached this product with a dose of skepticism, expecting a long commitment, but it really has been a miracle worker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:</li>
            <li> Sometimes, this causes me to burst little blood vessels on my face, making me look like I have mild acne.  </li>
            <li> So far, I I have little success in removing skin blemishes.</li>
            <li> The skin lightener got rid of the tannish color but left behind the pink which this lightened/cleared up pretty nicely.</li>
            <li> I am also applying it to tiny spider veins, but so far I have not seen clear results.  </li>
            <li> A little dab will go a long way, and the results are easily seen.</li>
            <li> Also from a very young age I was often told I looked like the Campbell soup kid because of my rosey red cheeks.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this because I really like Reviva products and to help with the broken capillaries on my nose and cheeks.  </li>
            <li> You do need to rub it in quickly or it may leave a slight white residue.</li>
            <li> When I read review prior to buying, i was hoping as the packaging suggests that helps fade and clear bruises.</li>
            <li> All of my life going back to early childhood</li>
            <li> Then another time it barely made a difference</li>
            <li> so your bruise will look worse before it gets better.</li>
            <li> Amount of product is &amp;#34;not that much.&amp;#34;  I went thru the first jar in less than three weeks.  </li>
            <li> Under my eyes they are a little puffy but look a lot better than the sunken eyes, as I said the color is a little lighter.</li>
            <li> This actually does help lighten the dark circles under my eyes when I use it consistently.</li>
            <li> The bruise was several days old before I got the cream but began fading the second day after using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had large dark rings around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Usually, I would have a bruise for 6 weeks or more, and this cream cleared it in less than 2.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a complete disappearance, but the circles are lighter--more reddish than blackish--and they don&#x27;t extend as far.</li>
            <li> Although the circles are not completely gone, but they have lightened up to where I am not as self conscious about them.</li>
            <li> I got this thinking it would actually work on my naturally dark eyebags that I have suffered from my whole life.</li>
            <li> (It hurts a little initially but it works really well.)</li>
            <li> I think it helps a little, but ultimately it depends on how much sleep</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really have high hopes for this, well, at least not real ones.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, and seems like it will last for a few years.</li>
            <li> Have not used this product long enough to see a big difference in my spider veins.  </li>
            <li> My first take on this is that it is horribly thick and doesn&#x27;t appear to absorb, leaving a white film on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it on my dark circles under my eyes and on old blemishes where the discoloration would not fade.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin K cream really helps the skin heal quickly- usually over night.  </li>
            <li> I do have dark circles under my eyes from working nights and brought this cream in hopes to reduce those but so far about 2 1/2  to 3 weeks</li>
            <li> It also caused me to have strange pock marks (or just really big pores), around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> i hit myself so hard in my upper leg almost the whole size of the it and</li>
            <li> Brusies that used to take a month to clear up are now gone in less than a week.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few months of twice daily use, the marks had cleared, and my face had that clear complexion I had been striving for.</li>
            <li> The creme is quite thick and greasy so I would suggest using it before bed since it doesn&#x27;t really absorb into the skin enough to wear makeup over it.</li>
            <li> but not completely like I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I really do not know HOW it works, only that now it always does.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Within a few days of using this product I have noticed a considerable difference in the darkness.</li>
            <li> Later in life as my blood pressure got higher they became worse.</li>
            <li> I use it almost every night because of the dry air here in the southwest.</li>
            <li> but where it was my skin is all dry and aggravated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;than dry it</li>
            <li> for small cuts, ripped cuticles, healing blemishes, and anything that is healing and/or bleeds, this cream works rapidly to clear things up.  </li>
            <li> I work in a kitchen where I get burns sometimes and am constantly bumping into the corners of the counters which give me dark bruises on my hips.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dark circles but rather white ones in comparison to my cheeks</li>
            <li> I had a really big and dark bruise on my forearm</li>
            <li> I actually bought this cream to help with my dark under-eye circles.  </li>
            <li> a little bit goes a long way so it&#x27;ll last longer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has done wonders for the dark rings around my eyes in just a few days, and the rosacea is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> However  with slightly bigger veins it takes  slightly longer to work.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m hoping this will help me bruise less with regular use.</li>
            <li> It helps heals my black &amp; blue marks</li>
            <li> At my age one of the problems we all have is that our skin thins out and leaves bruises and dark bruise areas, especially on our arms and hands.&lt;br /&gt;I was told by other doctors to stop some of my medications and that would do the trick.</li>
            <li> As a result I have skin damage that for me presents as broken capillaries and general redness on my face,  This cream has made a significant reduction in the redness and the appearance of the broken capillaries.  </li>
            <li> You only need a little of the cream.  </li>
            <li> However, this time I used this cream before and after the filler injections; I got minimal bruising and the bruises went away within a week.  </li>
            <li> Expensive but worth every penny</li>
            <li> Just be careful when applying it close to your eyes, since it irritates them.</li>
            <li> , by then I might see the expected results.</li>
            <li> Of course I have to be careful not to bruise my arms when I work in the garden or carry bundles from the grocery on my arms.</li>
            <li> and I have some scratches in my both arms, in few days the red marks are almost gone.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it until the container is empty and hope to some changes, otherwise i will not purchase it again, Ruby B.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell much yet with the broken capillaries, still there but might take longer.</li>
            <li> A little dab goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I will order this again, but don&#x27;t expect to run out soon because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Maybe they have faded a little but no clear.</li>
            <li> I do not trust this company, and I wish I could take some sort of legal action, but it would be hard to prove, expensive, and I&#x27;m in Canada, not the US.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used over 8 jars over the past four years and it&#x27;s back on my wish list.</li>
            <li> In fact everytime I use this cream I notice half black and half red under my eyes so something seems to be working</li>
            <li> (produce benzene, which is carcinogenic) and other preservatives.</li>
            <li> Usually the bruises last a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> But it did absoluetely nothing other</li>
            <li> It has other uses like</li>
            <li> After reading one of the other reviews about pain and blood clots it has worried me, I have been having pain in my legs also.</li>
            <li> Maybe other reviewer can let me know what they think.</li>
            <li> As I got older this got worse and became dark</li>
            <li> I bought this cream for the brown spots on my arms caused by broken capillaries, but so far it hasn&#x27;t worked as expected, but I&#x27;ll wait till I finish the jar and, perhaps</li>
            <li> She suggest that Vitamin K is used for bruising and other dark marks on the skin.</li>
            <li> The positives to this product is it does not irritated my skin, a small amount is needed and even though the container it comes in looks small it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Do this several times and you&#x27;ll notice that the bruise dissolves in much less time than usual.</li>
            <li> It fades dark circles?  </li>
            <li> and I often have dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have had dark circles</li>
            <li> She said it might lighten the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Since I have been applying the cream I have found it does lighten the dark circles</li>
            <li> would give 3 stars for its effectiveness on dark circles under the eyes...</li>
            <li> I have had dark circles all my life.</li>
            <li> Use it for my dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just under a year, and I no longer have those dark circles under my eyes - or as I call them, &amp;#34;Guinea Espresso cup-rings.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Purchased it because I&#x27;d read that vitamin K cream would help clear up broken capillaries on the face.  </li>
            <li> It has faded my dark under eye circles some.</li>
            <li> There was no change to my spider veins, the dark circles did get a bit lighter but product stop working.</li>
            <li> I purchased the product to use under my eyes because I have dark spots.</li>
            <li> I suggest trying if you have dark circles under your eyes....</li>
            <li> This product does work on dark circles under the eyes.  </li>
            <li> I prefer to help reduce dark spots than buy product to try to cover them.  </li>
            <li> Ok this product is Crap.</li>
            <li> I can say this cream really helps remove spider veins and is four times less expensive than you will find in a beauty/health store.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to work for everyone - just for those that have under-eye problems due to thinning skin, but it does work to improve that!</li>
            <li> only works if you rub it on real hard and for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> I am still going to keep going with it, but it&#x27;s not a quick fix.  </li>
            <li> we typically pay for this stuff...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I started using the cream, two or three times a day--certainly after showering--the spots have been &amp;#34;fading,&amp;#34; from red/brown to slightly read.  </li>
            <li> I ordered it a few months ago and wanted to use it at least 8 weeks prior to giving my opinion.</li>
            <li> do recommend this product but remember, it&#x27;s not a quick fix cream.</li>
            <li> This product did not help with my dark circles, I read the reviews and decided to purchase and give it a try, I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> reviews gave it a shot, and in less than 2 weeks saw my rosacea vanish and my very dark under eye circles almost vanish.  </li>
            <li> Also makes the skin around the eyes bit dry, at least my skin.</li>
            <li> This cream helps with the little scaly spots around my eye lashes too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a month (give or take a day or 9)</li>
            <li> you just need a little every day.</li>
            <li> I have tried other &amp;#34;vitamin k&amp;#34; creams in the past and they were a waste of time and money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it makes my complexion appear uneven, mannish-like.</li>
            <li> red broken</li>
            <li> but I finally got tired of looking like that</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, the cream does nothing.</li>
            <li> This K relieves my bruises in a few dats.</li>
            <li> In a few days I could see a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> This is my second jar of the creme to use on the thin skin type blood bruises.  </li>
            <li> A waste of money time and effort.</li>
            <li> I wasted time ordering it money paying for it and effort putting it on.</li>
            <li> However, this did help noticeably diminish the uneven skin on my cheeks just across the T-zone where I have pinkish discoloration.</li>
            <li> so this took away that stark contrast.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with my arms bruising</li>
            <li> I put this cream on it and in a few days the bruise is gone.</li>
            <li> At least once every two months someone will accuse me of having been a in a fight because I look like I have black eyes.</li>
            <li> BUT VERY LITTLE.</li>
            <li> It is a bit thick, so a little goes along way.  </li>
            <li> You need very little of this and does feel a bit waxy, doesn&#x27;t immediately absorb, so I use lighter coats.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount on the capillaries.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a small difference within 1 week.  </li>
            <li> Not sure about diminishing the look of veins.  </li>
            <li> However, even though it didn&#x27;t work for me after 2 weeks of application, when my mother-in-law came over, I noticed the worst bruising on her arms (from a hospital nurse trying to inject her and not being able to find a vein)</li>
            <li> I really wish I had never bought it. :-(</li>
            <li> My dark circles, didnt fade, if something I think they got bit worse.</li>
            <li> I had got broken capillaries in the centre of my nose which was extremely embarrassing !</li>
            <li> I use it trice a day and Lo And Behold some of the bruises have disappeared and others have lightened where they are hard to see.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even noticed the broken capillaries around my nose have faded a little since I started using this product about a year ago.  </li>
            <li> Although I am a fanatic about sun screen and believe in cocoa butter, some reddish spots (about the size of a pencil&#x27;s eraser) had been popping up on my forearms; selectively, about one or two at a time...</li>
            <li> You have to use it as directed for at least 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;D.</li>
            <li> Not a nice effect of prednisone.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 60&#x27;s and get bruises I can&#x27;t always account for.</li>
            <li> It lays on somewhat thick, and there&#x27;s no greasy after feeling.  </li>
            <li> get filler injections to my face about once a year, and that usually causes bad bruises that last 3 to 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li> She would have really appreciated making those ugly spots go away!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dark rings and broken capillaries on apples of my cheeks since childhood, but seeing the dark rings accompanied by bags one day I realized how bad it was so read up on solutions.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not pleasant to apply.</li>
            <li> But this product also helps your body absorb blood leaked from weak arteries...</li>
            <li> i bought it for broken capillaries around my nose that look like  reddish/blackish blemishs.</li>
            <li> and I was tired of layering my makeup on to cover them up.</li>
            <li> The directions state that after recommended use, bruises and broken capilliaries would fade in two weeks....</li>
            <li> #not happy.</li>
            <li> It has decreased the redness on my face as well.</li>
            <li> I put this on my face over the past 3 days (on a bad scratch mark and a broken blood vessel under my eye).</li>
            <li> I used after I&#x27;d had a few blood draws (and the phlebotomist aimed badly and nicked veins).  </li>
            <li> Well, I was skeptical, but I&#x27;ve used this product for about three months now under my eyes</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was also taking an OTC Vitamin K supplement (not the expensive Rx he prescribed) but together the two seem to have worked miracles.</li>
            <li> But after using this for well over a month, nothing happened, sadly.</li>
            <li> and I get a horrible looking dark bruise....</li>
            <li> I had HORRIBLE dark circles around my eyes</li>
            <li> I am in my late 50&#x27;s and have a terrible problem with bruising on my hands and forearms.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this cream.  </li>
            <li> Very sadly.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i bought it two weeks ago so i can&#x27;t rate it honestly just yet but so far it&#x27;s just 3 stars. i bought it for broken capillaries around my nose that look like  reddish/blackish blemishs. this area has been giving me problems for about 7 years now. i&#x27;m 35. it makes my complexion appear uneven, mannish-like. make-up won&#x27;t cover it. i hate it! this Reviva product hasn&#x27;t diminished the redness yet but it has only been two weeks. the ingredients kind of suck, it has greasy vegetable oil and it has lime flower extract, which is a possible irritant. it also has cetyl and cetearyl alcohols, which i don&#x27;t know what they are but why put any alcohol in it? why the lactic acid? i&#x27;m hoping for some improvement. i will update.    ** okay here&#x27;s my update: this stuff clogs your skin! i have bumps under and on the sides of my nose from this greasy stuff! i don&#x27;t even want to try it longer. i was hoping to try it for a full month, but it&#x27;s just too gross. i will obviously have to mix together my own batch of vitamin k cream from shea butter and vitamin k capsules.</li>
            <li> After reading the description, I couldn&#x27;t wait to start using this item.  It fades dark circles?  It makes bruises fade?  I bruise very easily and I often have dark circles under my eyes.  So I thought, \\&quot;If this works, it will be a dream come true.\\&quot;  On a positive note this is a dense cream (like Nivea).  It does make a decent moisturizer.  However, don&#x27;t expect any miracles.  It doesn&#x27;t fade bruises.  It doesn&#x27;t make dark circles under eyes go away, no matter how many times a day you use it.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this because I really like Reviva products and to help with the broken capillaries on my nose and cheeks.  I quickly found out that it clogs my pores though and I can&#x27;t use it on my face. BUT...&lt;br /&gt;It is great stuff if you have a minor cut, scrape or burn.  It will help to heal them very quickly and keep them from swelling. It is also amazing on bruises and helps to fade them really quickly.  I work in a kitchen where I get burns sometimes and am constantly bumping into the corners of the counters which give me dark bruises on my hips. This stuff gets rid of it all.</li>
            <li> There are better available</li>
            <li> good product, does what its supposed to</li>
            <li> I am happy using this product. As a moisturizer applied to the body after showers, it&#x27;s more than nice.  I&#x27;ll order it again, but can&#x27;t claim that the bruising-type blemishes (purpura, etc.) have disappeared as yet. We&#x27;ll see in time, but no loss, because it does a great job hydrating.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle and the bruises still there. Maybe they have faded a little but no clear.</li>
            <li> Does not work nearly as well as Vita-K product for skin bruising and costs more. Would never purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Product worked its magic</li>
            <li> All of my life going back to early childhood I&#x27;ve had large dark rings around my eyes. Later in life as my blood pressure got higher they became worse. At least once every two months someone will accuse me of having been a in a fight because I look like I have black eyes. Also from a very young age I was often told I looked like the Campbell soup kid because of my rosey red cheeks. As I got older this got worse and became dark red broken capillaries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not someone you&#x27;d call vain but I finally got tired of looking like that and I searched for a cure. Everything I found led me to believe I needed something with vitamin K to strengthen the walls of my arteries for my rosacea. But this product also helps your body absorb blood leaked from weak arteries...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has done wonders for the dark rings around my eyes in just a few days, and the rosacea is almost completely gone. I cant wait to see the results after two weeks of using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I got this cream for a bruise on my daughter&#x27;s eye.  I put it on every night and day and the bruise is still there.  I am still going to keep going with it, but it&#x27;s not a quick fix.  I will post again if it turns out to work.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 50&#x27;s and have a terrible problem with bruising on my hands and forearms.  The slightest bump to my hands and I get a horrible looking dark bruise....the bruises do not hurt at all, it is just very embarrasing and they take a long time to go away. I was constantly wearing band aids on my hands trying to disguise the bruises,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In doing some reading on the internet, I came upon a report suggesting that vitamin K cream works in fading the dark bruises.&lt;br /&gt;Being an avid Amazon.com shopper, I decided to see if it was available on Amazon and of course it was, and also offered the prime shipping as an added plus! I placed my order and had it the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is a Godsend!  After only 2 applications, I started to see the results. I will definitely reorder and just placed an order for my bosse&#x27;s mother.</li>
            <li> This actually does help lighten the dark circles under my eyes when I use it consistently. It&#x27;s not a complete disappearance, but the circles are lighter--more reddish than blackish--and they don&#x27;t extend as far. If I forget to use it for a while, I notice my circles darkening, and when I resume using it the circles lighten again after a couple of weeks. The only drawback is having to apply it with dampened fingertips. I keep it by the bathroom sink and use it every time I wash my hands, just for good measure. It also helps bruises clear more quickly. For those of us who bruise easily, another trick is to rub the bruise quickly with your knuckle until the skin feels warm. Do this several times and you&#x27;ll notice that the bruise dissolves in much less time than usual. (It hurts a little initially but it works really well.) Couple the knuckle-rubbing torture with this cream and watch your bruises vanish.</li>
            <li> Well, I was skeptical, but I&#x27;ve used this product for about three months now under my eyes and I can really see a difference.  It&#x27;s not going to work for everyone - just for those that have under-eye problems due to thinning skin, but it does work to improve that!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this cream.  I have tried other &amp;#34;vitamin k&amp;#34; creams in the past and they were a waste of time and money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get filler injections to my face about once a year, and that usually causes bad bruises that last 3 to 4 weeks.  However, this time I used this cream before and after the filler injections; I got minimal bruising and the bruises went away within a week.  I was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend for use before and after cosmetic procedures that leave bruising.</li>
            <li> My mother bruises very easily.  This creme fades the bruises quickly and leaves her skin looking normal. Expensive but worth every penny</li>
            <li> I am pretty amazed by this stuff. I have used twice a day since it arrived four days and the hideous spider veins on my nose were significantly diminished within two days. I approached this product with a dose of skepticism, expecting a long commitment, but it really has been a miracle worker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: the spider veins (or maybe broken capillaries would be more accurate) on the sides and bottom of my nose are probably 80% GONE. I love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> My masseur suggest this to me. I am a 67 yr.old man. I have had dark circles&lt;br /&gt;sINCE i HAVunder my eyes since I was 12 or 13 yr. old and I don&#x27;t know why. My masseur talk to me about it when I was getting a massage. She suggest that Vitamin K is used for bruising and other dark marks on the skin. She said it might lighten the dark circles under my eyes. I have been using it just under my eyes for about 2 weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that the skin under my eyes doesn&#x27;t seem so sunken in and the darkness is starting to lighten. It may be wishful thinking right now.&lt;br /&gt;But I will be checking back to let you know if it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HERES AN UPDATE. Since I have been applying the cream I have found it does lighten the dark circles BUT VERY LITTLE. I apply the cream at night. When I get up I wash my face so it is very clean. Then I apply the \\&quot;Queen Bee eye cream\\&quot; and wear that all day. The sunken eyes have gone away. Under my eyes they are a little puffy but look a lot better than the sunken eyes, as I said the color is a little lighter.</li>
            <li> Got my item and started using it right away. It&#x27;s only been 3 days and can&#x27;t say if it does the job or not. Hoping it&#x27;s not disappoint for the price. Will have to come back after using the cream for the next week or so.</li>
            <li> I like using it for my bruises</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, the cream does nothing.</li>
            <li> Used for easy bruising on sun damaged skin.  Seems to help in shortening the healing process.</li>
            <li> fast and what I wanted</li>
            <li> This is the best mild cream I have yet to try for around my tired eyes. A little dab goes a long way. I use it almost every night because of the dry air here in the southwest. There&#x27;s a lite whitening agent in the formula to help cover dark circles around the eyes which I know is important to the ladies more so than the dudes. This cream helps with the little scaly spots around my eye lashes too. My older vintage skin gets those red-purple spots from bumping my hands and arms into everything around the garage. When I look at my tractor it seems I get a new bruise! This K cream does help to fade them out much quicker. Works on razor burns too. I have used over 8 jars over the past four years and it&#x27;s back on my wish list. It&#x27;s fair priced.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the treatment of bruises. Bruises get lighter with the treatment and go away much faster too. Try it and see&gt;</li>
            <li> When I read review prior to buying, i was hoping as the packaging suggests that helps fade and clear bruises. Have not seen when it has fade any of the spots on my face. I however see a softer glowing look, i lightly apply makeup.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li> The spider vein faded after about a week of application and disappeared after 2 weeks. However  with slightly bigger veins it takes  slightly longer to work.  I am satisfied</li>
            <li> Did nothing to help my bruising</li>
            <li> Works great to reduce raccoon eyes. Just be careful when applying it close to your eyes, since it irritates them.</li>
            <li> Not too thrilled with it, it states it helps fade and clear bruises which it did somewhat but not completely like I had hoped. In fact everytime I use this cream I notice half black and half red under my eyes so something seems to be working but red is not the color I had hoped for. As far as clearing up spider veins no way, doesn&#x27;t even come close, spider veins on my nose still there bright red. Been using for about a month now.</li>
            <li> So far, I I have little success in removing skin blemishes.</li>
            <li> I bruse very easily; have done so for years.&lt;br /&gt;I had tried a different cream (in a tube), but it realy did not seem to make a difference. After being rather embarrassed by some very large bruses that took forever to go away I decided to try this brand. When I first tried it I was very impressed at how quickly the bruse faded. Then another time it barely made a difference and I thought ?!#$!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since determined why I have repeatedly had these two very different results. The directions say to &amp;#34;Apply morning and night with moistened fingertips&amp;#34;.  **Moistened** is the key! If I only applied at night or in the middle of the day I did not have mositened finger tips. If I applied it in the morning I would apply after my shower when my skin was still moist and that was when I would notice  a great improvement. It must take a bit of water to make it dissipate to the blood vessels? I really do not know HOW it works, only that now it always does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am grateful for what this cream does. I now even take it with me on vacations!</li>
            <li> Used it for 4 weeks, didn&#x27;t notice any change. Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I had researched that vitamin K helps with minimizing the look of varicose veins.&lt;br /&gt;My varicose veins are minimal to moderate at best. I didn&#x27;t expect this stuff to make them disappear,&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted them to fade some.  NOTHING happened.&lt;br /&gt;For my purpose this product did not work.</li>
            <li> I had bruises from chromium 1000mg from Springvalley brand recent intake. This K relieves my bruises in a few dats. Miracle!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a month (give or take a day or 9) and I&#x27;m impressed. I had HORRIBLE dark circles around my eyes and I was tired of layering my makeup on to cover them up. This reduced the darkness by about 65%. I sleep about 4 hours a night and I&#x27;m very stressed so until I do something about that, the circles will remain, but this helped and I&#x27;m shocked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was told to buy Vitamin K with Retinol for hydration and wrinkles in addition to the lightening of the circles so I&#x27;m going to get that now. But, YES, this works and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for a month now and I like it. It has very little smell which is pleasant and it feels good on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give 5 stars for its effectiveness on bruises; they disappear in no time when this cream is used.  I&#x27;m young and in good health which may help with its effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give 3 stars for its effectiveness on dark circles under the eyes...I think it helps a little, but ultimately it depends on how much sleep I get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give 3 stars for its effectiveness on facial blood vessels.  It seems it might help a little, and maybe it will help more as I continue trying it for a longer time, but  so far there are  no drastic changes.</li>
            <li> The directions state that after recommended use, bruises and broken capilliaries would fade in two weeks....NOT!!  Also the product does not soak into your skin as it has a wax base so it&#x27;s not pleasant to apply.</li>
            <li> It works really well on getting rid of a hickey barely noticeable in 2 days gone in 3</li>
            <li> Cream helps with bruising</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to do very much for my skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Been using it a month and noticed no changes it isn&#x27;t working keep your money and skip this product</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it had sodium benzoate and vitamin C (produce benzene, which is carcinogenic) and other preservatives. Liked the idea, but not the implementation.</li>
            <li> Good to use on arms for brushing.</li>
            <li> I have had dark circles all my life. Very self conscious about them at times, especially when people mistaken the circles for a black-eye. Within a few days of using this product I have noticed a considerable difference in the darkness. Although the circles are not completely gone, but they have lightened up to where I am not as self conscious about them. I put the cream on in the AM and before bed.</li>
            <li> Use it for my dark circles under my eyes. I&#x27;ve seen ENORMOUS improvements, I&#x27;ve been only using it for one week and my eyes are better. Fantastic!!!!!</li>
            <li> Nice product.  Have not used this product long enough to see a big difference in my spider veins.  I will continue to use and see what happens. Amount of product is &amp;#34;not that much.&amp;#34;  I went thru the first jar in less than three weeks.  Wish they had a larger size.  I will check with the Vitaman Shoppe in my neighborhood to see if they have the same product also.</li>
            <li> After applying the cream once or twice a day for two weeks, the bruising on my husband&#x27;s arms faded dramatically.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about a year and a half ago, to put on the dark spots under my eyes from swim goggles (which I had just stopped using for good when I got the cream).  This cream caused my skin to have milia (white bumps, which I&#x27;d never had in my life before. It also caused me to have strange pock marks (or just really big pores), around my eyes.  This hasn&#x27;t gone away.  The skin under my eyes looks really bad. I almost wonder if there was some sort of corrosive chemical or acid in this product. I still have it and wonder if I could get it tested somehwere.  Maybe Vitamin K is just really powerful, and not meant to be put around the eyes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried contacting Reviva Labs at the time. I sent them an email, and no one EVER got back to me. I was very disappointed. I do not trust this company, and I wish I could take some sort of legal action, but it would be hard to prove, expensive, and I&#x27;m in Canada, not the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are using this product on your face, please do so at your own risk. I really wish I had never bought it. :-(</li>
            <li> I get surface bruises on my forearm when I bump or scrape my arms and it is embarassing. Usually the bruises last a couple of weeks but this cream helps them disappear in 6-7 days. I really like the cream. Haven&#x27;t been able to see a difference on spider veins.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works on my hands and forearms like a charm.</li>
            <li> What I expected...good product!</li>
            <li> This cream did nothing to help fade or reduce bruise time for me. Hopefully the cream will work for someone else.</li>
            <li> Reviva Labs Vitamin K cream worked great in diminishing the dark circles under my eyes. I have used it for several months.</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;m a guy who has been &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; since 1983!! Back then, I actually had a girl remark to me in college that she thought &amp;#34;it&#x27;s really cool that you moisturize your skin.  Most guys don&#x27;t do that.&amp;#34;  Back then, men didn&#x27;t (admittedly) even pluck their eyebrows!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, as being part Italian, I&#x27;ve always had those under eye circles - and it sort of bugged me (Think Al Pacino, Sylvester Stallone in the 1970&#x27;s) and I thought to go to dermatologists, plastic surgeons, etc - but then a younger colleague of mine gave this to me for my birthday, and guess what?  It&#x27;s just under a year, and I no longer have those dark circles under my eyes - or as I call them, &amp;#34;Guinea Espresso cup-rings.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the 11-14 bux we typically pay for this stuff...recommended, use it twice daily (after your shower, right before bed) and you&#x27;ll be lookin&#x27; good!</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed in this product. I have been using it faithfully twice a day on clean skin, but with absolutely no affect. I have spider veins on my face and red blotchy areas. I had high hopes for this because I care about how I look. There is zero improvement.  It seems to me the positive reviews may have been paid for or solicited from the product owner. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face and chest and legs. Just a small amount on the capillaries.  It seems to be helping to diminish the redness and soon will help to totally eliminate the capillaries.</li>
            <li> I read that Vitamin K is good for minimizing spider veins so I looked for some but couldn&#x27;t find it in any local stores. Glad I found here. Seems to be working.</li>
            <li> This makes the areas that I use this on so so soft. It does seem to be working as I swear I couldn&#x27;t find one section of veins to put on this morning.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my hubby ,this the second bottle  I&#x27;ve bought it is really good stuff .</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand of Vitamin K cream.  It lays on somewhat thick, and there&#x27;s no greasy after feeling.  A little dab will go a long way, and the results are easily seen.</li>
            <li> After two months there is no difference in any of my red spider veins. I was really hoping to see some of them diminish from around my nose.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this to help heal bruises--works very well. It&#x27;s the only thing he has found that really does a good job.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well with fading bruising.  I have tried other creams and this one seems to work the best.</li>
            <li> This cream does exactly what it is supposed to.  I bought this for my 87 year old mother, who bruises easily.  She uses just a tiny bit, and showed off to me how it quickly removed the bruising from her skin.  She was very pleased!</li>
            <li> Great for undereye gross circles. Ladies and Gentleman and Aliens, buy this product today!</li>
            <li> This cream did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> Good for stubborn bruises. Leaves skin feeling soft. A little goes a long way. Recommend</li>
            <li> only works if you rub it on real hard and for a long period of time. but you can do that without the cream and have the same effect.</li>
            <li> Since I can bruise easily, I&#x27;ve tried a few vitamin k products, and this one is far more effective than the other ones I&#x27;ve tried. From the onset to resolution of a bruise, it tends to be around 3 days with this cream.</li>
            <li> This product is going to be a mainstay in my bathroom cabinet. I put this on my face over the past 3 days (on a bad scratch mark and a broken blood vessel under my eye). The scratch mark has dramatically faded and healed. The blood vessel is also fading. I am truly super impressed with the quick timing (although these were both new problems vs. long standing issues).</li>
            <li> Might give it 5 stars later...I am not a &amp;#34;spring chicken&amp;#34; any more:  Although I am a fanatic about sun screen and believe in cocoa butter, some reddish spots (about the size of a pencil&#x27;s eraser) had been popping up on my forearms; selectively, about one or two at a time...Needless to say, I was concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I checked the symptoms; from what I understood, no need to worry about skin cancer; just skin aging.  (Not flattering, but quite a relief!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I started using the cream, two or three times a day--certainly after showering--the spots have been &amp;#34;fading,&amp;#34; from red/brown to slightly read.  (I have also been taking one MK-7 Vitamin K, as MK-7, by Jarrow, 90 micrograms, 60 soft gels.)  DISCLAIMER:  I AM NOT RECOMMENDING EITHER OF THESE TWO PRODUCTS. I AM NOT A DOCTOR.  Anyway, from where I am standing, these are two very good products.  Suggestion:  Read ALL the reviews, good and bad; form your own opinion.  Best to you!</li>
            <li> Great product. Cleared up the redness around my nose and cheeks. Saved the pain and expense of laser!  I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I was one of those people who used this for two whole months and noticed no difference. Used it in my face withthe hope of lessening the appearance of the tiny spider veins around my nose.</li>
            <li> Purchased it because I&#x27;d read that vitamin K cream would help clear up broken capillaries on the face.  Used it every day for over a month and it really hasn&#x27;t done anything.  Don&#x27;t love the smell.</li>
            <li> We liked so much that this was a re-order</li>
            <li> I am using this product for nearly three weeks but no visible difference is seen. I will finish this jar of cream then i will tell u better.</li>
            <li> my wife love&#x27;s it Few days and the bruise is gone!</li>
            <li> Worked on the veins I wanted to lighten up</li>
            <li> My plastic surgeon recommended a Vitamin K cream pre and post surgery to help diminish bruising. Surgery was four days ago and I&#x27;m pleased to not be all black and blue. I was also taking an OTC Vitamin K supplement (not the expensive Rx he prescribed) but together the two seem to have worked miracles. I&#x27;m recovering from a mini tummy tuck and despite swelling don&#x27;t look like I was beaten.</li>
            <li> This is truly a fantastic cream for rosacia or any type of redness.  I&#x27;ve even noticed the broken capillaries around my nose have faded a little since I started using this product about a year ago.  It also works great for the dark circles under my eyes, and it definitely fades bruises quickly.  This one is definitely worth a try, folks, and it is a great price point too.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream for the brown spots on my arms caused by broken capillaries, but so far it hasn&#x27;t worked as expected, but I&#x27;ll wait till I finish the jar and, perhaps, by then I might see the expected results.</li>
            <li> The creme is quite thick and greasy so I would suggest using it before bed since it doesn&#x27;t really absorb into the skin enough to wear makeup over it. Despite that, it works! I&#x27;ve been using it on my dark circles under my eyes and on old blemishes where the discoloration would not fade. It is improving them. In a few days I could see a noticeable difference. Considering the fact that most beauty products for discoloration are so pricey, I&#x27;m happy that this product worked for me. It may not work for everyone if your issue isn&#x27;t a vitamin deficiency. In my case is is, so the turn around is pretty fast. It&#x27;s worth giving it a try to see if it will work for you.</li>
            <li> I love this !! I had got broken capillaries in the centre of my nose which was extremely embarrassing ! I started using this every night before sleep and after around a month I can state the redness is 80%gone !!! I&#x27;m so pleased with this and will continue using it .</li>
            <li> Very creamy. I will be using this product with the cups for my legs.</li>
            <li> This is my second jar of the creme to use on the thin skin type blood bruises.  It works excellent.  Brusies that used to take a month to clear up are now gone in less than a week.  I use twice a day as directed and have seen excellent results.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who bruises easily.  I have used it on arms and legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was quick.  Service excellent.</li>
            <li> This product did not help with my dark circles, I read the reviews and decided to purchase and give it a try, I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> When I used this product it made my skin turn all red and blotchy and I was left with a burning feeling. I washed it off right away but where it was my skin is all dry and aggravated. I thought maybe it was just me and a friend tried it. The same thing happened to her.</li>
            <li> Ok this product is Crap. A waste of money time and effort. I wasted time ordering it money paying for it and effort putting it on. #not happy.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, especially if you have dark circles under your eyes. It has decreased the redness on my face as well. This purchase was my third order from them - definitely will be ordering again. I am very happy with the results, which don&#x27;t happen overnight, but they are quick enough for you to notice after two weeks of daily use (I put mine on at nighttime after cleaning my face). I also found it works great on the back of my hands to lighten age spots.</li>
            <li> First of all this cream works as a light moisturizer for my &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;  meaning not overly dry or overly oily skin.  Secondly, it has definitely reduced the redness I have on my face and do not want!  I have very light skin that I exposed to a lot of tanning and burning when I was in my teens and early twenties.  As a result I have skin damage that for me presents as broken capillaries and general redness on my face,  This cream has made a significant reduction in the redness and the appearance of the broken capillaries.  The only thing is I&#x27;ve had to stick with it for over six months applying it after every face wash to finally look in the mirror one day and be happy with the results.  It definitely doesn&#x27;t happen overnight!  Vitamin K Cream is now part of my permanent routine along with Nars Tinted Moisturizer everyday to prevent any more UV damage.</li>
            <li> Have been using for 4 weeks now. It has faded my dark under eye circles some. But not totally gone.</li>
            <li> You may find more expensive creams out there-I did, but this is above and beyond the BEST!!!! It works, just keep applying....</li>
            <li> I RECIVED MY VITAMIN K CREAM AND IT SEEMS TO BE WORKING I WILL BE ORDERING MORE SOON IT WAS PACKAGED NICELY AND I RECIVED IT WITH IN DAYS OF THE SELLER SENDING IT THANKYOU</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin. This product didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. But it did absoluetely nothing other&lt;br /&gt;than dry it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I DID moisten my fingerss prior to application.</li>
            <li> I stated using this on 4/30/2015 once a day at night n in the morning I use Horse Chestnut Cream by Planetary Herbals n after 3 wks I started to see the difference on my spider veins. I still am using it cause I m on my feet a lot since I work in the hospital  so I will continue to use it till spider veins r completely gone.</li>
            <li> There was no change to my spider veins, the dark circles did get a bit lighter but product stop working. Tried it on stretchmarks since this has Vitamin K in it..didn&#x27;t work..</li>
            <li> good product, arrived in a timely fashion.  well packaged.  makes a nice light cream that will hopefully fade spots.  like.</li>
            <li> I really like the feel of the product on my face. I have seen a little improvement, but not as much as I would have liked. That may be my fault though because I forget to use it regularly. The smell is very neutral and unnoticeable so it won&#x27;t clash with anything else you&#x27;re using.</li>
            <li> SEE NO RESULTS WITH SPIDER VEI YET.</li>
            <li> I am anemic and I bruise very easy. This cream helps the bruise fade quicker than anything else I have tried.  Not greasy at all and absorbs quick.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I ordered it a few months ago and wanted to use it at least 8 weeks prior to giving my opinion. I purchased the product to use under my eyes because I have dark spots. After a couple of months I started noticing a difference, and to date I can see a big different. It doesn&#x27;t happen overnight but if you use it 2 times a day, as directed you will see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this product but remember, it&#x27;s not a quick fix cream. You have to use it as directed for at least 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;D. Woods</li>
            <li> I have had a similar product give me leg blood clots also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;was a D3 and K product. the Dots one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be carefull</li>
            <li> This is the real deal. Bruising heals much faster than with anything else. Note, this seems to pull the bruising to the surface so your bruise will look worse before it gets better.</li>
            <li> Its does the job of treating wounds that are not deep in the skin. It has other uses like&lt;br /&gt;skin lighten.</li>
            <li> Great product. Use twice a day. Take vitamin K supplements twice a day. Your bruises will fade much more quickly.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really have high hopes for this, well, at least not real ones. However, this did help noticeably diminish the uneven skin on my cheeks just across the T-zone where I have pinkish discoloration. I added this to some skin-lightening cream which had helped the what is likely melasma I was developing more laterally on my cheeks. The skin lightener got rid of the tannish color but left behind the pink which this lightened/cleared up pretty nicely. I don&#x27;t have dark circles but rather white ones in comparison to my cheeks so this took away that stark contrast.</li>
            <li> I can say this cream really helps remove spider veins and is four times less expensive than you will find in a beauty/health store.  I was surprised to see just how many spider veins it has removed.  I have used it for about a year, I do wonder though if I stop will the veins come back.  After reading one of the other reviews about pain and blood clots it has worried me, I have been having pain in my legs also. Maybe other reviewer can let me know what they think.</li>
            <li> This product is great for scars and hematomas but if u want a really big hematoma to cleae out in 2 weeks just ise something that almost nobody know abouy is a cream called: HIRUDOID FORTE JEL\\&quot; is a cream that is a miracle....i hit myself so hard in my upper leg almost the whole size of the it and this cream was jist amazing. But the Vitamin K is also good but for stretch mark and scars...so depends on your needs.</li>
            <li> This product was very reasonable and really seems to be working.  I suggest trying if you have dark circles under your eyes....you just need a little every day.</li>
            <li> So far this cream appears to be doing it&#x27;s job. Just being patient and allowing it to take it&#x27;s course.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on the &#x27;raspberry&#x27; marks on my hands and lower arms.  I take prednisone which causes those skin problems.  I do think it helps.  It&#x27;s not a cure all, but I think it does shorten the time until they clear up.  Of course, I always have more popping up that need attention.  Not a nice effect of prednisone.</li>
            <li> This product does work on dark circles under the eyes.  Just keep in mind that it&#x27;s going to take awhile.  Maybe a 1 year.  I noticed a small difference within 1 week.  I also notice that after about 2 or 3 months it seemed to stop working, so you will have to buy another one.  As soon as I bought another one I started seeing results again.  So every 3 months buy another one.</li>
            <li> Hey Amazon shopper,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t write many reviews, but when I find a product that works, I feel obligated to share my experience. In this case, it’s Reviva Vitamin K cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty clear skin, but a stray pimple or two left some red spots on my cheeks that I had been trying to clear for a good two years. I tried many products to no avail, and figured I had nothing to loose by trying Vitamin K cream. Boy am I glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few months of twice daily use, the marks had cleared, and my face had that clear complexion I had been striving for. In short, this stuff works. Remember to moisten your fingertips before applying (otherwise it’ll clog your pores) and just keep it up. The results will come, and I think you’ll be as pleased as I am.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Seems to work.  Takes several days on mild bruised.  Haven&#x27;t tried it on severe bruises.</li>
            <li> The wife and I use this and it seems to help with spider vains. We baught a couple different ones and tried them both. Mike B.</li>
            <li> This wonderful cream did what no other product could do. At my age one of the problems we all have is that our skin thins out and leaves bruises and dark bruise areas, especially on our arms and hands.&lt;br /&gt;I was told by other doctors to stop some of my medications and that would do the trick. It didn&#x27;t!!&lt;br /&gt;My Dermatologist suggested I get some vitamin K cream. Since I have tried a lot of remedies I was willing to try another. Boy oh Boy did that hit the spot.  I use it trice a day and Lo And Behold some of the bruises have disappeared and others have lightened where they are hard to see. Of course I have to be careful not to bruise my arms when I work in the garden or carry bundles from the grocery on my arms.</li>
            <li> This is a great cream to heal bruises and black and blue marks. It&#x27;s also great for fading spots on your skin.  On you face, it&#x27;s a great moisturizer for winter. I use it about twice a week, because I have oily skin, but it still works well on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It works great on my sensitive skin. I have a tendency to get purpura and it really makes such a difference in shortening the time it lasts as well as keeping it under control. Great price also. I am a return customer.</li>
            <li> This product works to help minimize bruises and ugly veins in my legs.</li>
            <li> If you want to get rid of the &amp;#34;age spots&amp;#34; or bruises that come with aging, this product really does the job.  I wish I had known about it before my mother died.  She would have really appreciated making those ugly spots go away!</li>
            <li> I weightlift.  Sometimes, this causes me to burst little blood vessels on my face, making me look like I have mild acne.  This Vitamin K cream really helps the skin heal quickly- usually over night.  It&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li> I just gave this product a rating of three stars because Overall I am satisfied with it.  I do have dark circles under my eyes from working nights and brought this cream in hopes to reduce those but so far about 2 1/2  to 3 weeks I have not seen any imporvement as of yet.  The positives to this product is it does not irritated my skin, a small amount is needed and even though the container it comes in looks small it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> for small cuts, ripped cuticles, healing blemishes, and anything that is healing and/or bleeds, this cream works rapidly to clear things up.  It contains Vitamin K, which has a powerful effect on bleeding. I have used another Vit. K product, but this one appears to be far more powerful.  Clean any cut, laceration, opening, bleeding or healing area, and then rub a little in to it.  You will see some results overnight, most likely, as I have.  I believe in Reviva products and this is another great one, probably the best one I have used.  You only need a little of the cream.  I am also applying it to tiny spider veins, but so far I have not seen clear results.  However, I will continue to use Vitamin K cream on them to see if they take longer to disappear.  This product does not seem to be for scars, but open and healing skin problems.  I will order this again, but don&#x27;t expect to run out soon because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This cream is awesome.  I bought this for my mother in law because she bruises very easy.  She loved it because it works.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I like this cream very much it absorbs quickly and leaves no greasy residue. It seems to be helping with the redness of my skin,i have mild Rosatia and the price is great. You do need to rub it in quickly or it may leave a slight white residue.</li>
            <li> I got this thinking it would actually work on my naturally dark eyebags that I have suffered from my whole life. But after using this for well over a month, nothing happened, sadly. Very sadly. I had really high hopes after reading the reviews before buying, but this product didn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li> I saw a big difference with thos cream! I highly recommend it!!! My bruises and spots have have deminished by a lot</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good on this product, was sceptical read reviews gave it a shot, and in less than 2 weeks saw my rosacea vanish and my very dark under eye circles almost vanish.  Now I feel great going without makeup.  Highly recommend, and seems like it will last for a few years.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this but it burned my face, I have really senistive skin and ezcema so i would not suggest buying it</li>
            <li> It did help with bruises, and it works fast.  Not sure about diminishing the look of veins.  I will keep using this product.</li>
            <li> My doctor suggested I use it - I have used it for several years on my arms for bruising - it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Does not work as advertised...</li>
            <li> I had a really big and dark bruise on my forearm so did some research on this product. It does what it says it will do. The bruise was several days old before I got the cream but began fading the second day after using. I have trouble with my arms bruising so I&#x27;m hoping this will help me bruise less with regular use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Reviva labs because the company has some good products to offer ; their 10% glycolic acid cream being a solid case in point. So when I developed some bruising under my eyes due to broken capillaries, I turned to this product with high hopes of being able to effectively counter it. However, since my bruising is pretty severe (my own fault), I have yet to see the results that I was hoping for. However, even though it didn&#x27;t work for me after 2 weeks of application, when my mother-in-law came over, I noticed the worst bruising on her arms (from a hospital nurse trying to inject her and not being able to find a vein) so I gave it to her to see if it would work for her. To my immense surprise, her bruising started clearing within 3 days of application, and we were both flabbergasted because her arm had been purple for 2 months. I don&#x27;t normally gush about products, but this one&#x27;s clearly got something that works! I just wish it had worked for me as well..:( hence the 3 star rating.</li>
            <li> Vitamin K cream by REviva is super and it really helps reduce any dark spots on my face. I prefer to help reduce dark spots than buy product to try to cover them.  Great item at great pricing.</li>
            <li> To be quite honest I was expecting more from this product. My dark circles, didnt fade, if something I think they got bit worse. Also makes the skin around the eyes bit dry, at least my skin.</li>
            <li> My first take on this is that it is horribly thick and doesn&#x27;t appear to absorb, leaving a white film on the skin.  It says to use damp fingertips, which I have done.  However, the skin will absorb all kinds of things so I&#x27;m going to keep using it and will report back and update in a month or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  I&#x27;ve used this for a month and a half now and find it does help bruises to disappear quickly.  If you put it on right away, it works best.  I used after I&#x27;d had a few blood draws (and the phlebotomist aimed badly and nicked veins).  This took care of the bruising on my arm.</li>
            <li> There is no question that this helps both with helping to fade bruises more quickly and after one small tub of it, my arm/hand skin is more elastic.  I will do more and see how it continues.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this cream to help with my dark under-eye circles.  I think it&#x27;s helped a bit when used with a retinol cream.  Often I use it all over my face and find it to be good for dry skin.  It is a bit thick, so a little goes along way.  I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Love using the cream on my legs.  It helps heals my black &amp; blue marks</li>
            <li> I am in my late 60&#x27;s and get bruises I can&#x27;t always account for. I put this cream on it and in a few days the bruise is gone. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Great cream. I have two cats and I have some scratches in my both arms, in few days the red marks are almost gone. I really like it this cream!</li>
            <li> An excellent product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for 1 month and have not notice any changes. I will continue to use it until the container is empty and hope to some changes, otherwise i will not purchase it again, Ruby B.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Good product so far.</li>
            <li> Love love vitamin &amp;quot;K&amp;quot;cream!! Great for bruises and dark circles .. Wonderful product to elemenate bruises faster !!! I&#x27;m 70 years old and it really works!!!</li>
            <li> I bruise easily &amp; this does make them go away faster</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much of a differ but I did break out</li>
            <li> I bruise easily and am always finding bruises on my legs, even when I don&#x27;t remember bumping into anything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My newest, and most successful routine for day-old bruises is&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rub the Vitamin K Cream on the bruise&lt;br /&gt;Apply heating pad for about 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;Remove pad and massage area gently for a few minutes while the area is warm.&lt;br /&gt;Re-apply heating pad for 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;Repeat massage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do this while watching TV at night for about a hour and the next day the bruise is noticeably lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I do this two nights in a row, it&#x27;s even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also starting taking Vitamin K supplements and extra Vitamin C, and to be honest, I&#x27;m not sure which part is the most helpful, but together it&#x27;s all working! That&#x27;s the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5. ;)</li>
            <li> This actually works for my older mom who has thinning capillaries</li>
            <li> THE SERVICE AND PRODUCT WERE EXCEPTIONAL.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dark rings and broken capillaries on apples of my cheeks since childhood, but seeing the dark rings accompanied by bags one day I realized how bad it was so read up on solutions. This stuff worked right away, I noticed an immediate difference in days with rings being lighter and bag going away, I say bag because this only seemed to be happening on my right eye, with not too much difference on the left. I can&#x27;t tell much yet with the broken capillaries, still there but might take longer. If anyone might have an idea on what&#x27;s going on with the left eye (maybe indicating something internal) would love to hear comments. I&#x27;ll keep using it tho, some things just take time.  You need very little of this and does feel a bit waxy, doesn&#x27;t immediately absorb, so I use lighter coats. Haven&#x27;t tried it on bruises.</li>
            <li> can already tell that it is working. a little bit goes a long way so it&#x27;ll last longer.</li>
            <li> I have seen results from this, I do a lot of mud runs and I bruise easily.  I&#x27;m not anemic just hereditary. V</li>
            <li> Product as described and in original packaging</li>
            <li> Had a scar on my left arm from surgery helping to take away discoloration</li>
            <li> My mother wanted this cream to help with the bruised looking spots on her aging skin.  It really made no difference.</li>
            <li> I like this cream very much.Have bought before and will buy again. Works well on bruises. Have given to family to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of clumsy, and my legs are littered with bumps and bruises from frequent accidents.  This cream has been a revelation. Usually, I would have a bruise for 6 weeks or more, and this cream cleared it in less than 2. Very impressive.</li>
