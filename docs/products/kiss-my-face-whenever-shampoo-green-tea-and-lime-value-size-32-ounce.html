            <li>Good price for the quantity and quality</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying to find a good organic shampoo/conditioner</li>
            <li>The bottle is good quality as well.</li>
            <li>and I had to use a good 2 dollars in quarters (size/volume) to get it to get</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair smelling really good.</li>
            <li>It made my hair look and feel good.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is somewhat affordable and it works good.</li>
            <li>This product smells really good</li>
            <li>It has a nice lite smell, and leaves my hair feeling great.</li>
            <li>And knowing that I haven&#x27;t doused my body with a bunch of harmful chemicals makes me feel good.</li>
            <li>and it does a good job of cleaning.</li>
            <li>good but looks like a soap bottle</li>
            <li>Good Value.  </li>

            <li>With this one she can wash every 3 to 4 days, and her healthy medium blond hair looks great.  </li>
            <li>I also like yes to tomatoes which is great to add volume to my hair and still feels healthy</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>the scent is very refreshing to me.</li>
            <li>It also smells fresh and wonderful!</li>
            <li>The smell is great and is refreshing.  </li>
            <li>This is a good size, too, and the pump is nice for the shower.  </li>
            <li>But this smells nice and feels good on my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>Whenever Shampoo, Value Size, 32 Ounce since it was the best value I could find for the right amount of money.</li>
            <li>Smell is amazing, fresh and delicious.</li>
            <li>The scent is very light and pleasant and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I was looking for shampoo that is SLS free &amp; found this one, so I tried it!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks, and my hair has never been in better condition!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this shampoo!  </li>
            <li>I simply love it!</li>
            <li>It immediately brought relief to my skin and to my surprise, cleans my hair so much better than non-natural shampoo ever did!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THE SEE-THROUGH BOTTLES!</li>
            <li>More scents, perhaps!</li>
            <li>i love the smell of this shampoo!</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my hair feel and smell!</li>
            <li>my hair has never looked better!</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>I shopped around and as always Amazon had the best deal, and the shipping was really fast, 5 stars!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>We love it!  </li>
            <li>It foams great and rinses easy.  </li>
            <li>I love my hair now and my husband is always touching it and saying how beautiful my hair is.</li>
            <li>This is a great all-natural shampoo, filled with earthly ingredients that I can pronounce.</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge and is really a great value.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing to me as well.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>It smells great and makes your hair feel silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner work great and have a light citrus scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li>Make your own shampoo?</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t loving the price of that brand shampoo.  </li>
            <li>My hair is nice and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Nice to find organics in this size.</li>
            <li>Now,just so you know,I&#x27;m NO environmental freak,I just happen to like using organic beauty products since I like being self sustainable,but still love a good deal like anyone else.</li>
            <li>The argan oil is a nice addition.</li>
            <li>This is my every-day shampoo, and nothing could be better than having it delivered at a good price.  </li>
            <li>She liked it, and we put it on Subscribe, and save.</li>
            <li>I tried making my own</li>
            <li>This shampoo lathers up so nicely.  </li>
            <li>Smells awesome, my whole family loves the smell.</li>
            <li>Smells nice but not at all overpowering.</li>
            <li>Smells really nice, and is cruelty-free.  </li>
            <li>Carrots\\&quot; or \\&quot;Yes to Tomatoes\\&quot; brand, those really are awesome.</li>
            <li>so I honestly didn&#x27;t care about the smell</li>
            <li>and if I liked it, I&#x27;d buy this one anyway.  </li>
            <li>I get a nice bit of froth.  </li>
            <li>The lime scent is nice.  </li>
            <li>and so this is a nice shampoo that I can choose to use conditioner if I want to or if it is one of those days where I am in a hurry I can skip it altogether.</li>
            <li>Overall, a wonderful product that is affordable and great for your hair and health.</li>
            <li>It smells delicious, like a fruit rollup, but you can&#x27;t really smell it in your hair once it dries, just while you&#x27;re shampooing.</li>
            <li>This shampoo doesn&#x27;t produce a rich lather like Panteen does, but it is great shampoo.</li>
            <li>Smell great, citrus clean smell.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend lather, rinse, lather again for the best result.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very nice feeling and clean.  </li>
            <li>Clean and bouncy!!</li>
            <li>a good note, the shampoo does clean my hair well and smells very refreshing.</li>
            <li>The price is good and the brand is a tried and true brand for years now!</li>
            <li>Starts strong and a lot like the fruity smells kid&#x27;s products favor, but the scent mellows so its good.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo itself seems to work well for all our hair types and has a light, pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>this is a gentle cleaner with great lather, great smell and easy on the pocketbook to boot.&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li>The price is great, my hair feels clean, what more could I ask for?</li>
            <li>Smells lovely, and my hair feels nice.  </li>
            <li>But the best things I have tried are always on the natural side.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been experimenting with sulfate-free shampoos, &amp; ordered this one because it had the best reviews, as far as I could see.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so shiny and soft and the curls are perfect!  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair squeaky clean and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>and I liked it ok.</li>
            <li>Shampoo leaves my hair clean and the lime scent is pleasant.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>Nice shampoo, good lather and leaves hair feeling clean with more body.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really matter if the shampoo is good if you can&#x27;t get it out of the bottle!</li>
            <li>I loved the smell and how squeaky clean</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many over the years and this is by far the best, along with SebaMed shampoos.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A very clean ingredient list and excellent natural smell of lime.  </li>
            <li>I find the smell mild and pleasant, and with the pump I can control the amount I get out better</li>
            <li>The plastic of this bottle is very cheaply made and it cracked spilling a lot of product on my carpet.</li>
            <li>It is free of many chemicals and yucky stuff that I wouldn&#x27;t want to use on my family&#x27;s skin!  </li>
            <li>I like that it is a large bottle and seems to work great on my hair.</li>
            <li>I can say that my hair is SOOO much more manageable.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>I often help my daughter, otherwise, her hair doesn&#x27;t get well washed and still oily in spots :-)</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>, I thought that it would be OK to try this Kiss</li>
            <li>Love the smell and lather</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>but they stopped selling it, maybe because of the ingredient changes that so many are talking about , I was going to order here</li>
            <li>but now I am hesitant and will have to do more research</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>The scent is refreshing, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I used to love it.  </li>
            <li>I love about the shampoo</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t contain any of the chemicals you shouldn&#x27;t be using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>My kids love.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using a Carol&#x27;s Daughter sulfate-free shampoo that I received from Sephora and immediately fell in love -</li>
            <li>too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just try this - I think you will love it.</li>
            <li>The Whenever Shampoo used to be mostly Aloe Vera Gel (was the 1st ingredient), but now it is ingredient #7.  </li>
            <li>and I must say I am quite satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found it.</li>
            <li>Glad I returned .</li>
            <li>Love the smell too.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is so refreshing and</li>
            <li>As others have said, it smells like lime jello, which isn&#x27;t my favorite scent</li>
            <li>I love the lime citrus smell of the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>We switched to this shampoo for organic lavenders because it has a better rating for allergenic concerns.  </li>
            <li>For whatever reason, the smell of this shampoo reminds me of lemon cake, which I happen to love.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell, too.  </li>
            <li>I also have the conditioner, and we love it, as well.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I still love it</li>
            <li>I love it and my hair loves it too.</li>
            <li>I could see myself sicking with it for quite some time. :)</li>
            <li>I liked that it was cruelty/paraben free, and that&#x27;s what i always use on my pets, so I&#x27;ll save it for her.</li>
            <li>my favorite shampoo of all time.&lt;br /&gt;living</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this product a week now, I love the name</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really make my hair look that great - as in how I *think</li>
            <li>The pump is a bit tricky, but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>My husband has been using this for about two years and we love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent &amp; the softness it gave my hair, but darned if it didn&#x27;t make my scalp itch.</li>
            <li>i am really enjoying this product.</li>
            <li>The conditioner was better than the shampoo... for some reason, the shampoo did not ladder as well as I anticipated.</li>
            <li>love this shampoo, the ingredients - and</li>
            <li>I love the company!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>My favorite shampoo, ever.  </li>
            <li>I have an allergy to SLS and quit using shampoo and toothpaste with SLS, and have been much better off.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>There are no sulfates, which I love, and I also appreciate the organic compounds in this product which offer almost a medicinal quality to it for itchy or dandruffy scalps.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of this shampoo, that&#x27;s my favorite part.</li>
            <li>But (and maybe that&#x27;s because it is a more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>and I love it at home and at the pool where I swim.  </li>
            <li>A safe product also, which is a must.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m do glad I did.</li>
            <li>but it does, probably more than others.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I sincerely hope this company reconsiders the formula.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think this shampoo is ok, but I do not anticipate purchasing it again.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>I have used it for about a year and continue to love how it leaves my hair feeling.</li>
            <li>The lathering is okay.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t ask for more.  </li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>I also love the safe, organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love the smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d pay a bit more for that for sure.  </li>
            <li>I will get him more as soon as he runs out.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping</li>
            <li>look more healthy and softer.</li>
            <li>My hair has look more volumized too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found this is a much better way to get the shampoo to the scalp, where you need it.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>It works but not my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more of this when the time comes.</li>
            <li>I bought I more</li>
            <li>My favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>To top it all off, when the pump on my bottle broke, I emailed Kiss My Face customer service about it</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, and it is a great all-around shampoo.  </li>
            <li>No longer as healthy to use, no longer preservative free, no longer nice smelling, no longer my shampoo of choice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>What more can you say?  </li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t LOVE this shampoo I do like it and will re-order it.  </li>
            <li>An even better value when you take advantage of the Subscribe and Save option.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so healthy when I use it.</li>
            <li>and I honestly love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, for how it works on my hair.... fantastic!</li>
            <li>My Face products is much more appealing than on most shampoos.</li>
            <li>(Mostly because it&#x27;s not stripping your hair of</li>
            <li>and it got my hair very clean and my hair feels very light as well</li>
            <li>Hair felt clean and healthy!</li>
            <li>So I decided to do some more research on the best natural shampoo products, and came across Kiss My Face, which is a brand I&#x27;m familiar with because I had already used their deodorant and lip balm.</li>
            <li>This shampoo makes my hair feel clean and smell good and also comes in an easy to use dispenserI love the animal and environmentally friendly products!</li>
            <li>Been using this for about five years now, best ever, non toxic, no harsh chemicals, squeaky clean, I do use it twice per day.  </li>
            <li>it looks great, meaning bouncy and full - it&#x27;s good for anyone who WANTS their hair to be more smooth and not as full - my hair does look nice -</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells great, leaves my hair looking great, and the huge bottle lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li>Hair smells nice and is clean and whiney after using.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and leaves my hair feeling clean but not stripped.</li>
            <li>Love how this leaves my scalp feeling--so clean!  </li>
            <li>is that my hair is very clean, all of the oil is gone.  </li>
            <li>We have searched for the perfect shampoo for a long time and have found it in the KISS my FACE brand.</li>
            <li>Pretty good stuff.  </li>
            <li>Many of the reviews about drying out the hair are true!</li>
            <li>Smells great, this is a new formula</li>
            <li>This is so great, my hair feels fresh and clean and it is cheap at the price.</li>
            <li>I like the smell,  its mild but nice.</li>
            <li>This product smells wonderful however after 2 months my hair was dry, tangled, and my scalp itched.</li>
            <li>Love the pump -- easy to use in the shower -- not overly sudsy -- cleans well.</li>
            <li>Really feels good on my hair and no horrible chemicals to worry about.</li>
            <li>My hair feels very clean and soft and the price is great.</li>
            <li>It smells great and really gets my hair clean.  </li>
            <li>You have to make sure your shampoo has the right pH-balance, and I wasn&#x27;t successful in getting the right balance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the purchase, guys, my special thanks to the manufacturers))</li>
            <li>Works great for my 9 year old preteen daughter who does not like to wash her hair often.  </li>
            <li>Great smell, and over the past year, the maker improved the foaminess, which is great.</li>
            <li>I did a great deal of research before I bought a natural shampoo.  </li>
            <li>but it does great with wild and curly hair.</li>
            <li>Of course lingering scent might be more of an issue as more of my hair grows back - LOL.</li>
            <li>The shampoo smells good and is gentle on my hair.</li>
            <li>I liked the fresh scent and</li>
            <li>Now,I say \\&quot;surfactant\\&quot; free as most \\&quot;sulfate-free\\&quot; shampoo brands still have a moderately strong surfactant,to \\&quot;clean\\</li>
            <li>But great for the whole family to use if you do not have damaged hair or super oily hair.</li>
            <li>Love the scent and keeps my hair feeling and smelling clean.</li>
            <li>The price of this shampoo is kind of expensive,as are most organic products,which really bothers me.</li>
            <li>Excellent gentle, natural shampoo...</li>
            <li>this shampoo lathers well and rinses clean - my hair looks healthy and people ask me what shampoo I use</li>
            <li>When you smell it in the bottle it seems that it might be too strong, but not at all.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>It has kind of a funny smell</li>
            <li>else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Paul Mitchell&#x27;s tea tree special shampoo, as tea tree oil is also supposed to help, and while it felt good tingling in my hair, and my hair was nice and clean and shiny, I had an increase in flakes, although smaller pieces and more like dandruff.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fine,</li>
            <li>There is a scent to it, but it is soft and pleasant.</li>
            <li>It is very natural &amp; good for your hair.</li>
            <li>But once I started using this shampoo I noticed a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>Also, this company is cruelty-free and this is HUGE to</li>
            <li>I bought two of these huge containers and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a huge bottle for just one user.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this shampoo makes my hair so soft and amazingly tangle free!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it has no dangerous chemicals.</li>
            <li>but it is healthier and works great overall.</li>
            <li>light-</li>
            <li>; Enjoy.</li>
            <li>A lot of sulfate free shampoo tend to leave my hair feeling greasy but this is not the case with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>so I will do a pre-wash with one pump of shampoo, lightly rinse, and then add another 2 pumps and re-lather.</li>
            <li>This really helps get a nice lather without having to use a ton of shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and do a cursory search and learn about C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, the primary detergent of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>pump is cheaply made.</li>
            <li>It is cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it is Sodium Laurel Sulfate free.</li>
            <li>I have highlighted hair and am into chemical free type products.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t work all that well with the viscosity of the shampoo (the same pump for the companion conditioner works great)</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s not a nasty detergent style soap but a more natural healthy one.</li>
            <li>, the smell is great, you get the type of hair experience you would have gotten from the name brand traditional chemical laden products we used to all use.</li>
            <li>This is a great product if you don&#x27;t have skin problems but the company should let the public know this could be a problem.</li>
            <li>I have used several of the kiss my face products and have been happy.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is easy to rinse off and you can feel it clean ..does not leave the residue on your hair.</li>
            <li>questions, feel free to ask.</li>
            <li>Great for low poo washes, because it doesn&#x27;t strip moisture.</li>
            <li>It is light with citus undertones.</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo primarily because I like the Kiss</li>
            <li>This is what we&#x27;ve settled on and I love it, but he&#x27;s not crazy about the scent.</li>

            <li>It does make my hair feel squeaky clean</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s because of the ingredients and most lathering agents are not green.</li>

            <li>Well,I&#x27;ve been looking for a sulfate free shampoo for my hair,since I noticed that it wasn&#x27;t looking its best lately.</li>
            <li>The scent is fresh and lemony, and not too strong.  </li>
            <li>no smell to strong just right..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please comment if you have found a suitable alternative for a decent price.</li>
            <li>This did nothing special for my hair, so I&#x27;m going to use it when washing my dog.</li>
            <li>But I would recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have special hair needs.</li>
            <li>At first this shampoo was a little drying, but they added Moroccan Argan Oil to it, and now it is wonderful!  </li>
            <li>The old formula was amazing for my hair</li>
            <li>I was surprised since the bar soap is really nice.</li>
            <li>A while ago,I had a full head relaxer done</li>
            <li>I wanted to get away from all the toxic products in my health-care items and this shampoo has been a true winner.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at how much I liked this and the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I loved the way it worked and it was the only thing that worked for my hair.</li>
            <li>Nice natural shampoo, almost all organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>You will need to use more of the product compared to sulfate shampoos as it does not lather as readily.</li>
            <li>For a full head of lather, I suggest lots of water in your hair before you apply it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;He loved it when he used it the next day.</li>
            <li>either so its good for not just girls but the entire family .</li>

            <li>Outlast All Day Lipcolor (Toxin score: 4, not bad and</li>
            <li>I have purchased both the shampoo and conditioner and my shampoo has gone down a lot faster than my conditioner has for the reason that I feel I need to use A LOT more to achieve a good washing.</li>
            <li>have normal hair, very fine in texture but a lot of it.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, soft, mild lime scent overall&lt;</li>
            <li>Smells great and lathers extremely well.</li>
            <li>It is economically and environmentally friendly.  </li>
            <li>the fragrance is great and the shampoo doesn&#x27;t strip my hair like other ones tend to do.  </li>
            <li>The first shampoo with this product was fine.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice the smell after showering, and it leaves my hair feeling adequately</li>
            <li>:) only thing is that I think another brand is better than this one</li>
            <li>but it goes away quickly</li>
            <li>it cleans really good, our whole family enjoys it, we even use it on our 3 year old</li>
            <li>Limes smell nice, green tea smells nice but in the bottle this stuff,</li>
            <li>Love the smell, the size, and the price for such a huge bottle!</li>
            <li>The conditioner that goes with this shampoo is really nice at detangling &amp; conditioning which is hard to find in a safe healthy product.  </li>
            <li>it does take a bit more than normal shampoo and conditioner because the shampoo does not lather a lot</li>
            <li>Let me say first and foremost that I do like that this is a cruelty free product.  </li>
            <li>I normally buy the 11 oz bottle, but this time I wanted to make sure I wouldn&#x27;t run out any time soon</li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased with this stuff.</li>
            <li>Although my hair is pretty tangled after I wash it, it gives my hair great body and has helped my dry scalp a ton!</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t able to fulfill my #1 objective - clean my hair!  </li>
            <li>but I think I might actually want more of a \\&quot;full body\\&quot; shampoo because my hair is fine -</li>
            <li>The very ingredients that are toxic to our bodies, are the ones that make a shampoo slide around your head, and suds up easily.</li>
            <li>When messaged into the hair, using your normal amount WILL leave your hair very clean even if it doesn&#x27;t foam.</li>
            <li>All I can say is I felt EXACTLY like the women from the Herbal Essence commercials!</li>
            <li>Will be buying again in the future, I&#x27;m sure!</li>
            <li>Since then, my entire family has switched over to this shampoo(THEIR choice) and we all love it!  </li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>He is very picky and loves it too!!</li>
            <li>hair is very blond/baby fine.  </li>
            <li>, KMF gets it clean the first wash.</li>
            <li>After the first use of kiss me whenever shampoo, if gave my hair silky and clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>Good price overall for a large amount of poo.</li>
            <li>This was a great product a few years ago.  </li>
            <li>So young people with healthy oily hair should give it try.  </li>
            <li>One more thing, getting it to lather is not a problem for me as I am used to using natural hair products.  </li>
            <li>I am surprised to see so many people saying this shampoo does not lather well, my experience is that is lathers a lot</li>
            <li>I typically only wash my hair once or twice a week, and it takes days for it to be any kind of greasy.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin to most products.  </li>
            <li>Not crazy about citrus scents</li>
            <li>32 ounces at this price is a great deal, especially for a product as natural as this.</li>
            <li>Glad to have something natural to use on my hair and get rid of those chemicals in store brands.</li>
            <li>I RARELY immediately re-purchase a product but Kiss My Face</li>
            <li>and I find it cleans better then the old.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Their shampoo in the green bottle was the best I tried, along with their old formula conditioner.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know if it was the shampoo or conditioner that did this to my hair, but this stuff left my hair fried!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s seriously worth checking out.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t, that was just a month&#x27;s worth of oil built</li>
            <li>Not much lather, but smells good.  </li>
            <li>The pump is useful, too.</li>
            <li>I am trying to find products that are more natural and decrease the amount of chemicals in my beauty routine.</li>
            <li>Like a considerable bit more.  </li>
            <li>I love natural products, although I don&#x27;t feel like the price should be prohibitive to buy them.</li>
            <li>They completely changed this shampoo and now it&#x27;s nowhere near as good as it was.</li>
            <li>I am working on growing my hair out and was told to use a more natural shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>the performance is worth it to me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the performance is worth it to me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product&#x27;s use of more natural ingredients and lack of parabens compared to other shampoos seemed like a good choice for me.</li>
            <li>However I have read from EWG and other sources that many, many shampoos are toxic.</li>
            <li>All the other brands I&#x27;ve tried make you sacrifice lather, detangling, smoothness or cleansing ability for being safe &amp; healthy.  </li>
            <li>, I feel like I have to use it everyday for my hair to smell good and look clean.</li>
            <li>I love that it has very few chemicals, it smells nice, I love the price, and it lathers well for a natural shampoo.</li>
            <li>(The good news is that there was no sign of rash or other allergic reactions).</li>
            <li>It works just as well as any other shampoo and leaves my hair looking good.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this shampoo because of the reasonable cost and it&#x27;s earth friendly approach.</li>
            <li>... right?  </li>
            <li>Oh right, the scent, it smells like lemonade with a hint of verbena to me.</li>
            <li>I contacted Amazon and they sent a replacement out right away.</li>
            <li>My hair feels very silky and clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It should be noted, however, that if you REALLY want the sudsing (it will clean without the sudsing)</li>
            <li>Also, the lime smell is very strong it smells like someone cut open a 100 limes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say that this cleans my hair very well and does not weigh my hair down one bit.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair soft, clean, &amp; manageable!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it does a good job of cleaning, even on oily hairs, but it only foam/sud half as much as normal shampoos but is organic and good for you.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo for a person who has scalp issues at times my hair and scalp can vary from dry to oily and this allows me to wash my  hair as needed to keep the stink low and my hair shiny clean.</li>
            <li>Great for everyday use for \\&quot;everyday\\&quot; hair, though!</li>
            <li>(Toxin score: 2, the blue, green, rose and pearl are all pearlescent, but the coffee, olive and white are more matte; the rose, white and pearl are good for highlighting.)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>that for me, it was nice going for so long without any flaking even after a shower and brushing...).  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair nice and clean without that &amp;#34;left over&amp;#34; oily feeling, I have a sensitive scalp and can&#x27;t use any fragrance in any shampoo, so this one (naturally scented and smell last for half a day) is ideal.</li>
            <li>Pleasant, but a tiny tiny bit sweet.</li>
            <li>, it is not working perfectly, and it is not as good as the initial results I had with Jason&#x27;s (makes me mad as I still think using something else ruined</li>
            <li>I estimate that I use six times as much to get my hair as clean as I did with my regular shampoo--almost more than I can hold in one hand.</li>
            <li>Very watery with kind of a slippery feel to it -- like it was mainly glycerin -- and it didn&#x27;t do much as far as cleaning our hair.</li>
            <li>So maybe this shampoo would be good for folks with slightly oilier</li>
            <li>I like the fact that the ingredients are safer to use than other products and it smells good too and cleans my hair really well</li>
            <li>It is watery, doesn&#x27;t suds up nice and leaves my hair very dry and oily looking.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the smell well enough and it does an admirable job of keeping my hair clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty upset</li>
            <li>My hair has grown thicker and does not tangle much anymore!</li>
            <li>I have thick hair and oily skin, so by the end of the day, it is not so great looking.  </li>
            <li>The ONLY problem is that every time you try to find an organic alternative,it seems to cost significantly more then what you would find in the stores.</li>
            <li>The size of this shampoo is very nice,so I guess that I can say that its worth it.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>During last many months I couldn&#x27;t find the shampoo for myself.</li>
            <li>I actually had better luck with the Aveeno sulfate-free shampoo, which had lower ratings.</li>
            <li>Great smell, but did not work for my thick hair.</li>
            <li>I most definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>I washed twice with this brand shampoo and conditioner (to make sure this was indeed the culprit), and the same thing happened both</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ended up drying out and making my hair frizzy for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li>And not expensive.</li>
            <li>My personal favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>I chose not to send it back, but to keep and use as a sulfate free body wash!</li>
            <li>I could get a pretty good lather with a lot of product but in that instance it would make me wonder if the shampoo is just heavily diluted.</li>
            <li>Nope, it feels smooth, soft and manageable when dried.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not that it wouldn&#x27;t work in those instances, but you would probably end up using so much that it wouldn&#x27;t be worth</li>
            <li>My current all time favorite.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this product.</li>
            <li>Has totally got rid of my static / frizz issues tho.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s better out there, but this is a good everyday option for multiple hair types.</li>
            <li>You need to get your hair really wet when applying this to make it lather nice.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo was my favorite but they cheaped out on ingredients and there is a total difference!</li>
            <li>This one was priced very appropriately (I&#x27;ve only ever done better with one-off&#x27;s that make it to Marshall&#x27;s or Ross)</li>
            <li>It has no scary ingredients, and it works.</li>
            <li>A lot of reviewers have been complaining about the low lather, and telling you to use more if you want a lather.</li>
            <li>Most of all, the absence of harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>It also smells pretty great, but the scent is subtle.</li>
            <li>its worth the extra time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have curly fine hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a few natural shampoos and they never leave my hair feeling great.</li>
            <li>My hair is clean and shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and clean .also</li>
            <li>My hair is clean, soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It gets my hair clean and doesn&#x27;t require that I use a separate conditioner to keep it soft.</li>
            <li>but this is surprisingly drying, so I only use very occasionally and will not repurchase.</li>
            <li>My Face shampoo is my favorite and has been a long time.</li>
            <li>The first day my hair was so oily and stringy, I was really embarrassed.  </li>
            <li>It takes a lot to lather good, but even when you don&#x27;t use a lot and just get a small lather it cleans well.  </li>
            <li>I use Nature&#x27;s Gate Organics Mandarin Orange and Patchouli conditioner with it and my hair always looks clean, feels soft, and has as much volume as I could expect.</li>
            <li>The bottle is a bit large to keep in the shower unless you have a lot of shelf space</li>
            <li>so I purchased one 11oz bottle to keep in the shower and refill it with this large one when needed.</li>
            <li>The pump for this large bottle doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li>I took one star off because the bottle is a bit large for my tastes and the pump</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a fairly large size...</li>
            <li>and I like my hair products in as large as volume as I can find.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made it through the whole bottle but won&#x27;t be buying again simply for the strong scent (like a bathroom/kitchen cleaner).  </li>
            <li>I mainly got this for my boyfriend because he has fine asian hair that gets greasy very fast.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is very mild does not dry or damage hair, since I use it I have had increased hair growth, for that price and quality I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>A bit about me: Asian with fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;Left</li>
            <li>like the option of buying the large size for a reasonable cost</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo not only because there are no chemicals but also because it gives my hair a very clean feeling and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li>Left my hair very soft and full of volume, which I was super suprised</li>
            <li>This shampoo definitely improves her blond color, gives a nice body, gentle on her sensitive scalp unlike some other strong shampoos.  </li>
            <li>My hair is shiny and growing so much healthier and faster.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li>Used to buy it from whole foods</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>All my life I&#x27;ve used \\&quot;regular\\&quot; shampoo &amp; had no idea that the very thing I was using all this time was contributing to the dryness of my hair.</li>
            <li>I really like how this stuff makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>What works for me is making sure that my hair is soaking wet, not damp, when I apply the shampoo.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Priced reasonably and has no harmful ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Purchasing it in these bulk bottles is so much cheaper.</li>
            <li>which sometimes correlates to very ineffective cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Oh, and it lathers really well.</li>
            <li>My hair felt so nurtured, gently cleaned, and</li>
            <li>However, the product itself leaves much to be desired.  </li>
            <li>It made my hair really shiny and</li>
            <li>But it makes my head very itchy and dandruffy.</li>
            <li>really hope you can send me one to replace it.</li>
            <li>Really looking for an Organic shampoo that won&#x27;t strip out color and doesnt cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li>and it probably is really cleaning my hair</li>
            <li>Sulfates just really irritate my scalp -</li>
            <li>this convenient size and bottle&#x27;s pump is very convenient.</li>
            <li>It does not lather a whole lot</li>
            <li>but I still really this one.</li>
            <li>My issues is I have very fine/thin hair and it leaves me greasy by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>I read someone review of another product - which they did not like so much.  </li>
            <li>It also lathers really well.</li>
            <li>The whole family uses this.</li>
            <li>Tried it again yesterday drastically increasing the amount I used and really taking the time to work it into my hair.  </li>
            <li>I am very allergic to SLS products.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m very picky in choosing my hair care.</li>
            <li>It has no sulphates, which can be very drying to hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather up very well.</li>
            <li>I like it so much that I don&#x27;t mind the diffreence.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve followed the advice in another review saying to make sure your hair is really wet</li>
            <li>and this seems to work really well.</li>
            <li>Once you really start looking at the ingredients list of products...</li>
            <li>(Tresemme went straight in the trash)</li>
            <li>Sodium Laurel Sulfoacetate may be a better alternative to Sodium Laurel/Laureth Sulfate,but it STILL foams,which means that it is still stripping the hair of its natural &amp; essential oils.</li>
            <li>Definitely one of the better natural shampoos.</li>
            <li>Going more natural recently, I researched and bought this from</li>
            <li>Recently tried this product as I am trying to switch to more natural products.  </li>
            <li>It left my hair soft and silky, much better than a box</li>
            <li>For example,the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Ever brand (Everstrong,Everpure,Eversleek,Evercreme) use the ingredient Sodium Laurel Sulfoacetate which is technically not a sulfate,but a mild surfactant that is used very much as an alternative to sulfates.</li>
            <li>Lathers and cleans well, doesn&#x27;t really smell strong and lasts long.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, and shampoo tends to leave it dry, but this shampoo leaves it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>This was bought for my 8 year-old daughter and it works very well with her long, fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have long straight hair, fine texture but have problem with volume.</li>
            <li>The other thing is that if your hair is longer than shoulder length, you will end up using a bit more of the product.  </li>
            <li>to the need to use more because it doesn&#x27;t lather, it&#x27;s not supposed to lather like other shampoos.  </li>
            <li>Yes, I still need more of it than I did Pantene or whatever other chemical-laden stuff I used to use.</li>
            <li>(If you use more, you&#x27;re buying more shampoo in the long run when you don&#x27;t have to, and, while it&#x27;s affordable, it&#x27;s not cheap)</li>
            <li>And then I realized that what you have to do is MAKE SURE YOUR HAIR IS VERY, VERY WET when you apply the shampoo to it.</li>
            <li>It is as if it doesn&#x27;t clean enough even though I use a lot on my hair.</li>
            <li>The first few uses were okay.  </li>
            <li>It might be too strong for color treated hair or dry hair.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, curly hair that has a tendency to get too dry.</li>
            <li>I have tried various things over the years and have a cupboard full of them.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this product and so far I believe I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li>(looks like dandruff, but can be pieces a full cm in diameter, sometimes bigger).  </li>
            <li>We all live it and it lasts forever!</li>
            <li>Takes a little more than regular shampoo to get my hair clean</li>
            <li>Decided to give Kiss My Face a try, since most of the shampoos she buys are over $30.00 for 32 ounces or less.</li>
            <li>I do not use the companion conditioner, but instead use Giovanni Smooth as Silk Deeper Moisture conditioner on my incredibly dry hair.</li>
            <li>As for the shampoo, it does lather less than most shampoos, but that hasn&#x27;t caused any problems for me.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be a decent product</li>
            <li>I had been looking for a sulphate free shampoo &amp; conditioner that wasn&#x27;t too expensive, but definitely effective.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is one of the only brands that I&#x27;ve found to be COMPLETELY surfactant free.</li>
            <li>I need more than one pump to get enough shampoo, but the mechanism takes a while to fill up for a second pump.</li>
            <li>Smell is alright, the ingredients are decent.</li>
            <li>So decent product, but not for us.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still seeking the perfect healthy shampoo that isn&#x27;t insanely priced.</li>
            <li>The shampoo will dissipate rather quickly, but it thoroughly cleans your entire hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smell is decent.  </li>
            <li>The only real &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; about this, which isn&#x27;t much, is that I NEED to use a conditioner with this, because if I don&#x27;t my hair ends up very, very tangled</li>
            <li>I never expected my husband to have a strong opinion on the hair products I buy, but I tried a different brand</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This shampoo meets my incredibly high standards and smells like lime sherbet.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>All natural, biodegradable shampoo that makes my hair feel better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Assuming it was just a bottle color change, I went to using it, but was disaapointed that I couldn&#x27;t get that same feeling of clean nurtured soft hair.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty large bottle and lasted my family almost 2 months the last time I bought it (3 people).</li>
            <li>By the time I realize how amazing it was and went ahead to order a large bottle, instead of the green I received a white bottle.</li>
            <li>Clear and gentle.</li>
            <li>Really did not see a different between this and cheap, regular shampoo?</li>
            <li>We have been using this shampoo about a month on my daughter&#x27;s hair and it seems clean, although a bit dry.</li>
            <li>I went through the No-Poo thing for a few months and though I thought my hair looked healthy and bouncy, it never had the luster that some people say they get when getting rid of shampoo.</li>
            <li>- it isn&#x27;t heavy and it makes my curls even better.  </li>
            <li>only 2 out of 10 by EWG, so I&#x27;m not afraid of using it on my baby</li>
            <li>My only complaint is I have to use two pumps per wash to really get a good lather going.</li>
            <li>I normally use Jason&#x27;s dandruff shampoo as it contains sulfur and that has been known to reduce the symptoms</li>
            <li>I would recommend using a nice thick conditioner with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product is good, but the packaging was poor.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be gentle on my fine hair (man) like other natural shampoos</li>
            <li>Tossed it out, it was half full, so used it long enough to see the results weren&#x27;t at all spectacular.</li>
            <li>It left my hair dry and stringy so this is more for people who have normal to oily hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m constantly looking for home products that are low in toxins and easy on the budget.  </li>
            <li>Whether pregnant or not, I will be using this product for a long time to come.</li>
            <li>Live and learn.</li>
            <li>Now I must look for a new brand because KISS</li>
            <li>product, new formula.</li>
            <li>Discusting, new formula is horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they mailed me a new pump.</li>
            <li>ALL NEW INGREDIENTS.</li>
            <li>that were I live.  </li>
            <li>It smells lovely and does not dry out her hair the way some other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoos have.</li>
            <li>I keep saying \\&quot;thoroughly\\&quot; only because I don&#x27;t want you to leave some in and then claim that either the shampoo or conditioner makes your hair greasy; however, it is SO much easier to rinse out than brands that contain sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium lareth sulfate (those bubbles that we miss so much)</li>
            <li>I have pretty bad Seborrhoeic dermatitis and my dermatologist told me that the best thing to do was to use a sensitive skin shampoo, or something with out a lot of chemicals in it, don&#x27;t brush my hair, use a comb instead, only wash my hair every 2 or 3 days, and don&#x27;t scratch.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>In other words this is a standard cheap shampoo that smells similar to the original.</li>
            <li>It leaves the hair very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>The new formula is just okay, no better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried in this price range.</li>
            <li>Lathers decently, rinses clean and does not contribute to the sticky, limp feeling I normally associate with other SLS free shampoos.</li>
            <li>The top wasn&#x27;t tightened and several ounces leaked out into its plastic bag and then into the box with a couple other items.</li>
            <li>I could not wait to rinse it all off completely!</li>
            <li>my face may not have the exact same fragrance as Carol&#x27;s Daughter, but the shampoo performs.  </li>
            <li>Lathers so much more than other similar products without the use of SLS.</li>
            <li>oh so soft!</li>
            <li>I know there are comments on here about an old formulation, but I purchased this when only the current formulation has been available.  </li>
            <li>You need to use twice the amount for the sud/foam action of normal shampoos.</li>
            <li>I first tried the big body</li>
            <li>All natural!  </li>
            <li>When I first opened the bottle and gave it a sniff it kinda reminded me of public washroom air freshener.</li>
            <li>I like the smell, but don&#x27;t feel like it cleans my hair as good as some other products, but it&#x27;s also not as harsh either since it&#x27;s Organic.</li>
            <li>thought natural would mean healthy hair too, not so much.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t strip my hair like other shampoos - however I can feel how clean it is.  </li>
            <li>Then do sell it in a smaller size here on Amazon,but this will last much longer,since I don&#x27;t really wash my hair that much.</li>
            <li>This bottle is huge , so it last a pretty long time if you dont wash your hair daily.</li>
            <li>Actually lathers, unlike most other natural shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I have used other Country Life products that are all natural that leave hair clean....</li>
            <li>I only have positive things to say about this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used expensive salon brands, but due to being pregnant, I&#x27;m more conscious of what chemicals I&#x27;m using in my daily routines and was looking for something more natural.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel really clean which is hard to find in the first place!I</li>
            <li>I think I kind of have to use the conditioner as well, otherwise the shampoo alone would leave my hair feeling a little rough.</li>
            <li>and I love that it hardly has any chemicals at all</li>
            <li>The conditioner isn&#x27;t as harsh on your hair either, very light, but follow up with that, leaving it in for at least 2 min, and then thoroughly wash it out and it will make your hair soft, smooth, and shiny.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling clean and soft without weighting it down.  </li>
            <li>I also agree with a previous reviewer about making sure your hair is VERY WET - it really does help with the lathering.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Whenever Shampoo (clear bottle):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The problem is, while that left my scalp feeling clean, my hair gets really dry and</li>
            <li>But for kids like my 9 year old, they may need mom&#x27;s help to wash their hair well with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I stopped using it completely after 1/4 usage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s drying to our hair and after several uses by my whole family it isn&#x27;t anything any of us like.</li>
            <li>shampoo so far.</li>
            <li>Then, I received my June 2013 shipment and they have completely changed the formula without any notification.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo really should not even be called by the same name.  </li>
            <li>My type of hair,which is mixed (african-american &amp; arab) is very curly,dry &amp; somewhat thin,I&#x27;ve noticed.</li>
            <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned,if it foams,drys,or otherwise irritates the hair \\&quot;like\\</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to shampoo my hair every day now since I&#x27;ve started using it, but if I want to--it&#x27;s still gentle enough that I can and quite often do.  </li>
            <li>Natural ingredients</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and smell good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>though - it had always been soft and silky before.</li>
            <li>I gave this one star because I used to use the old KMF</li>
            <li>Its all natural....</li>
            <li>I have an incredibly sensitive scalp.  </li>
            <li>bought this for its natural cleaning with no chemicals.</li>
            <li>I see there are lots of complaints about the formula changing, but I never used the old one...</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still natural.</li>
            <li>So I bought the 11oz bottle of this yesterday from my local Whole Foods store, as I needed it ASAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used it for a year thus far.</li>
            <li>Which is much healthier than shampoo regularly used.</li>
            <li>I like this a lot for natural shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Not harsh and can use every day.  </li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s all natural ingredients, which merits the one star.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a bit frizzy, which comes naturally with curly hair, but it&#x27;s always had a tendency to be frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest this to anyone that like natural shampoos and goods.</li>
            <li>My hair was very oily and frizzy at the same time.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo does not irritate my sensitive scalp.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural oils and shine, but also</li>
            <li>We switched all of our personal/hygiene products last year to more natural and cruelty-free, and tried a few shampoos that were either pricey or didn&#x27;t work that</li>
            <li>so I would be hesitant to recommend it to someone with thick hair, people who use a lot of product and thus might have more build-up to remove, or those who are looking to use it after strenuous exercise/sweating.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t pump the shampoo into my hands; rather, I pump it directly on my scalp - a small one of each side, two for the top, three for the back.  </li>
            <li>I feel better about using a product that isn&#x27;t full of artificial ingredients.  </li>
            <li>In fact, when I ordered it, I verified the ingredients list was still starting with Aloe, but when I received it I found water first ingredient and C14-16 olefin sulfonate is 2nd ingredient.  </li>
            <li>I discovered that the EXACT same item is 100% a different product.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t speak to the shampoo&#x27;s other assertions (promoting a healthy skull, stimulating hair growth, ...), because I didn&#x27;t notice any difference one way or the other.</li>
            <li>The secret is to make sure your hair is dripping wet, and then immediately apply the shampoo, and work it around quickly.</li>
            <li>with one full pump I get just a little itty bit of froth,</li>
            <li>Recently I started using only natural cosmetic products, after learning about how harmful harsh chemicals found in most beauty products can be.</li>
            <li>In the past two weeks of using a sulfate free shampoo, I have noticed an increase in softness/manageability/no dryness whatsoever/</li>
            <li>I bought the top of the line salon shampoos for years, and my hair was always dry dry dry - but oily at the scalp.  </li>
            <li>Just in case you aren&#x27;t familiar with products that do not include some toxic substances in their products, it is normal for it to not suds up like the common shampoos.</li>
            <li>I use a small bit of coconut oil and smooth it over my hair.  </li>
            <li>My tried and true shampoo was not available</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this shampoo because is supposed to be more natural and all that, but, unfortunately it makes my hair feel straw-like.  </li>
            <li>I love it, I have a sensitive scalp, and its very hard to find a product that doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch or break out.</li>
            <li>I tried it for my dark colored hair, and it was way too strong; I got dry frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>However, it completely stripped the color from my hair in a matter of about 6 shampoos and left it feeling pretty dry (even paired with the conditioner).</li>
            <li>2.5 years later I needed a new one.  </li>
            <li>But they&#x27;ve changed their formula (new white bottles).</li>
            <li>Not only new downgrade regarding their formula.</li>
            <li>I used to have a very itchy, severely dry scalp that dandruff shampoos didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>If this is what all natural shampoo is like then I will go back to &#x27;un&#x27; natural.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have with this ingredient is that I used L&#x27;Oreal Paris Everstrong to wash my hair &amp; it foamed JUST AS MUCH as the regular shampoos I used to use.</li>
            <li>But it is worth it, since my hair is now softer, thicker looking, and am losing 75% less hair each time I shower than I used to.</li>
            <li>went ahead and used up the entire bottles, but am ready to move on to a different product.</li>
            <li>No regrets, though!</li>
            <li>This shampoo gets your hair clean but has very little lather</li>
            <li>When I rinse, I can feel my hair being sqeaky clean, which usually translate to dry/frail/easily tangled hair when my hair drys.</li>
            <li>I use a few pumps and it rinses clean with only one shot.</li>
            <li>I have oily hair, which means the only time I get the sqeaky clean feeling after rinse is if I use harsh or clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li>I was worried about using something all-natural because I have moderately oily hair, and I didn&#x27;t know if a shampoo could get it clean without all of the harsh chemicals that cut grease.</li>
            <li>people have complained about the lather of this product but that is a problem with any sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is the only shampoo that fixed the problem.</li>
            <li>The grocery store near our house sells the shampoo and conditioner in far smaller bottles for ten dollars per bottle.</li>
            <li>I wish they&#x27;d just go back to their old formula.</li>
            <li>The hair does not appear quite as soft over all from the conditioner but is definitely healthier.  </li>
            <li>thus far, this is the only one I&#x27;ve truly thought did the job as a shampoo.</li>
            <li>Now all the natural ingredients are in smaller percentages and it now has sulfates for foaming.  </li>
            <li>I have been searching for something natural that actually cleans my hair instead of making it greasy.  </li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t willing to pay that much for such a small bottle</li>
            <li>My Face line of natural products without extra chemicals,</li>
            <li>Bottle came broken, wasn&#x27;t able to use the pump function.  </li>
            <li>It cleans and clarifies really well -- a little goes a long way which is super for my long hair.</li>
            <li>First five ingredients of previous shipments of Kiss My Face</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of purchasing several bottles this last time, not realizing that the formula had completely changed!</li>
            <li>I finally took the jump, and my hair is clean, soft, silky, thick, curly, manageable.  </li>
            <li>that my flaking scalp (cause by other products) is now much healthier.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used several other shampoos, like Naturoli&#x27;s, Avalon Organics, and Nature&#x27;s Gate, and this is by far my least favorite.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo- cleans my hair without the nasty ingredients that I don&#x27;t want absorbed into my body.  </li>
            <li>Just FYI- massage in really well and leave in for a few minutes its natural</li>
            <li>This was by far one of the most difficult categories to find something that met all of my criteria</li>
            <li>I have thin hair but a lot of it, as well as oily skin, so my hair gets weighed down and oily pretty easily.</li>
            <li>Initially, I was of the same opinion, until one day I had no trouble lathering with a moderate amount of the shampoo.</li>
            <li>highly Recommend the &amp;#34; Kiss my Face &amp;#34; Soap and Shampoo and I have not gotten other Kiss my Face Products.</li>
            <li>less breakage/a head of hair that actually wants to do what I want it</li>
            <li>I have blonde hair on top and black hair on the bottom and it does not strip my black hair of color and doesn&#x27;t dry out my blonde hair.</li>
            <li>(My hair is neither oily nor dry naturally.</li>
            <li>Local Whole Foods does not carry this size and driving to another town is not really economical.</li>
            <li>I like how it makes my hair and my scalp feel refresh and not dry and itchy like commercial shampoos.</li>
            <li>Its easier on my sensitive scalp than regular shampoo, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my psoriasis hands too</li>
            <li>I recently became aware of the palm oil crisis and decided to stop buying anything containing palm oil (no easy task).  </li>
            <li>I have straight, thin, normal hair and have developed topical allergies to fragrances and chemicals.</li>
            <li>bought this large bottle of Kiss my Face as the price difference between it and the itsy-bitsy other option was too small to make much of a difference</li>
            <li>I have thin, fine, hair and this</li>
            <li>Kiss my face whenever shampoo green tea and lime was a smart purchase.</li>
            <li>It leaves her very thick, long hair feeling clean, soft and and manageable.  </li>
            <li>Received this last night - used this morning - small amount is all you need and it is NOT going to foam very much - don&#x27;t worry about that, this product does what it needs too.  </li>
            <li>It has a very low toxicity rating and is about 30-40% cheaper than other products we&#x27;ve used, which only came in smaller, less economical sizes.  </li>
            <li>I would give it one star considering how bad my hair looks now, but I could see myself using it once a month later on to get a good cleansing - so it gets 3 stars.      </li>

            <li> More scents, perhaps!</li>
            <li> i love the smell of this shampoo!</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my hair feel and smell!</li>
            <li> my hair has never looked better!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!</li>
            <li> I shopped around and as always Amazon had the best deal, and the shipping was really fast, 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> We love it!  </li>
            <li> It foams great and rinses easy.  </li>
            <li> I love my hair now and my husband is always touching it and saying how beautiful my hair is.</li>
            <li> This is a great all-natural shampoo, filled with earthly ingredients that I can pronounce.</li>
            <li> The bottle is huge and is really a great value.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing to me as well.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> It smells great and makes your hair feel silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner work great and have a light citrus scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> Make your own shampoo?</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t loving the price of that brand shampoo.  </li>
            <li> My hair is nice and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Nice to find organics in this size.</li>
            <li> Now,just so you know,I&#x27;m NO environmental freak,I just happen to like using organic beauty products since I like being self sustainable,but still love a good deal like anyone else.</li>
            <li> The argan oil is a nice addition.</li>
            <li> This is my every-day shampoo, and nothing could be better than having it delivered at a good price.  </li>
            <li> She liked it, and we put it on Subscribe, and save.</li>
            <li> I tried making my own</li>
            <li> This shampoo lathers up so nicely.  </li>
            <li> Smells awesome, my whole family loves the smell.</li>
            <li> Smells nice but not at all overpowering.</li>
            <li> Smells really nice, and is cruelty-free.  </li>
            <li> Carrots\\&quot; or \\&quot;Yes to Tomatoes\\&quot; brand, those really are awesome.</li>
            <li> so I honestly didn&#x27;t care about the smell</li>
            <li> and if I liked it, I&#x27;d buy this one anyway.  </li>
            <li> I get a nice bit of froth.  </li>
            <li> The lime scent is nice.  </li>
            <li> and so this is a nice shampoo that I can choose to use conditioner if I want to or if it is one of those days where I am in a hurry I can skip it altogether.</li>
            <li> Overall, a wonderful product that is affordable and great for your hair and health.</li>
            <li> It smells delicious, like a fruit rollup, but you can&#x27;t really smell it in your hair once it dries, just while you&#x27;re shampooing.</li>
            <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t produce a rich lather like Panteen does, but it is great shampoo.</li>
            <li> Smell great, citrus clean smell.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend lather, rinse, lather again for the best result.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very nice feeling and clean.  </li>
            <li> Clean and bouncy!!</li>
            <li> a good note, the shampoo does clean my hair well and smells very refreshing.</li>
            <li> The price is good and the brand is a tried and true brand for years now!</li>
            <li> Starts strong and a lot like the fruity smells kid&#x27;s products favor, but the scent mellows so its good.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo itself seems to work well for all our hair types and has a light, pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> this is a gentle cleaner with great lather, great smell and easy on the pocketbook to boot.&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li> The price is great, my hair feels clean, what more could I ask for?</li>
            <li> Smells lovely, and my hair feels nice.  </li>
            <li> But the best things I have tried are always on the natural side.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been experimenting with sulfate-free shampoos, &amp; ordered this one because it had the best reviews, as far as I could see.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so shiny and soft and the curls are perfect!  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair squeaky clean and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> and I liked it ok.</li>
            <li> Shampoo leaves my hair clean and the lime scent is pleasant.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this shampoo!</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo, good lather and leaves hair feeling clean with more body.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really matter if the shampoo is good if you can&#x27;t get it out of the bottle!</li>
            <li> I loved the smell and how squeaky clean</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many over the years and this is by far the best, along with SebaMed shampoos.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A very clean ingredient list and excellent natural smell of lime.  </li>
            <li> I find the smell mild and pleasant, and with the pump I can control the amount I get out better</li>
            <li> The plastic of this bottle is very cheaply made and it cracked spilling a lot of product on my carpet.</li>
            <li> It is free of many chemicals and yucky stuff that I wouldn&#x27;t want to use on my family&#x27;s skin!  </li>
            <li> I like that it is a large bottle and seems to work great on my hair.</li>
            <li> I can say that my hair is SOOO much more manageable.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> I often help my daughter, otherwise, her hair doesn&#x27;t get well washed and still oily in spots :-)</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> , I thought that it would be OK to try this Kiss</li>
            <li> Love the smell and lather</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> but they stopped selling it, maybe because of the ingredient changes that so many are talking about , I was going to order here</li>
            <li> but now I am hesitant and will have to do more research</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> The scent is refreshing, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I used to love it.  </li>
            <li> I love about the shampoo</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t contain any of the chemicals you shouldn&#x27;t be using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> My kids love.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using a Carol&#x27;s Daughter sulfate-free shampoo that I received from Sephora and immediately fell in love -</li>
            <li> too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just try this - I think you will love it.</li>
            <li> The Whenever Shampoo used to be mostly Aloe Vera Gel (was the 1st ingredient), but now it is ingredient #7.  </li>
            <li> and I must say I am quite satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found it.</li>
            <li> Glad I returned .</li>
            <li> Love the smell too.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is so refreshing and</li>
            <li> As others have said, it smells like lime jello, which isn&#x27;t my favorite scent</li>
            <li> I love the lime citrus smell of the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> We switched to this shampoo for organic lavenders because it has a better rating for allergenic concerns.  </li>
            <li> For whatever reason, the smell of this shampoo reminds me of lemon cake, which I happen to love.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell, too.  </li>
            <li> I also have the conditioner, and we love it, as well.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I still love it</li>
            <li> I love it and my hair loves it too.</li>
            <li> I could see myself sicking with it for quite some time. :)</li>
            <li> I liked that it was cruelty/paraben free, and that&#x27;s what i always use on my pets, so I&#x27;ll save it for her.</li>
            <li> my favorite shampoo of all time.&lt;br /&gt;living</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product a week now, I love the name</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really make my hair look that great - as in how I *think</li>
            <li> The pump is a bit tricky, but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this for about two years and we love it.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent &amp; the softness it gave my hair, but darned if it didn&#x27;t make my scalp itch.</li>
            <li> i am really enjoying this product.</li>
            <li> The conditioner was better than the shampoo... for some reason, the shampoo did not ladder as well as I anticipated.</li>
            <li> love this shampoo, the ingredients - and</li>
            <li> I love the company!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo, ever.  </li>
            <li> I have an allergy to SLS and quit using shampoo and toothpaste with SLS, and have been much better off.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> There are no sulfates, which I love, and I also appreciate the organic compounds in this product which offer almost a medicinal quality to it for itchy or dandruffy scalps.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of this shampoo, that&#x27;s my favorite part.</li>
            <li> But (and maybe that&#x27;s because it is a more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and I love it at home and at the pool where I swim.  </li>
            <li> A safe product also, which is a must.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m do glad I did.</li>
            <li> but it does, probably more than others.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I sincerely hope this company reconsiders the formula.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think this shampoo is ok, but I do not anticipate purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> I have used it for about a year and continue to love how it leaves my hair feeling.</li>
            <li> The lathering is okay.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t ask for more.  </li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> I also love the safe, organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love the smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d pay a bit more for that for sure.  </li>
            <li> I will get him more as soon as he runs out.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping</li>
            <li> look more healthy and softer.</li>
            <li> My hair has look more volumized too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this is a much better way to get the shampoo to the scalp, where you need it.  </li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> It works but not my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering more of this when the time comes.</li>
            <li> I bought I more</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> To top it all off, when the pump on my bottle broke, I emailed Kiss My Face customer service about it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, and it is a great all-around shampoo.  </li>
            <li> No longer as healthy to use, no longer preservative free, no longer nice smelling, no longer my shampoo of choice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> What more can you say?  </li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t LOVE this shampoo I do like it and will re-order it.  </li>
            <li> An even better value when you take advantage of the Subscribe and Save option.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so healthy when I use it.</li>
            <li> and I honestly love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, for how it works on my hair.... fantastic!</li>
            <li> My Face products is much more appealing than on most shampoos.</li>
            <li> (Mostly because it&#x27;s not stripping your hair of</li>
            <li> and it got my hair very clean and my hair feels very light as well</li>
            <li> Hair felt clean and healthy!</li>
            <li> So I decided to do some more research on the best natural shampoo products, and came across Kiss My Face, which is a brand I&#x27;m familiar with because I had already used their deodorant and lip balm.</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes my hair feel clean and smell good and also comes in an easy to use dispenserI love the animal and environmentally friendly products!</li>
            <li> Been using this for about five years now, best ever, non toxic, no harsh chemicals, squeaky clean, I do use it twice per day.  </li>
            <li> it looks great, meaning bouncy and full - it&#x27;s good for anyone who WANTS their hair to be more smooth and not as full - my hair does look nice -</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells great, leaves my hair looking great, and the huge bottle lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> Hair smells nice and is clean and whiney after using.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and leaves my hair feeling clean but not stripped.</li>
            <li> Love how this leaves my scalp feeling--so clean!  </li>
            <li> is that my hair is very clean, all of the oil is gone.  </li>
            <li> We have searched for the perfect shampoo for a long time and have found it in the KISS my FACE brand.</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff.  </li>
            <li> Many of the reviews about drying out the hair are true!</li>
            <li> Smells great, this is a new formula</li>
            <li> This is so great, my hair feels fresh and clean and it is cheap at the price.</li>
            <li> I like the smell,  its mild but nice.</li>
            <li> This product smells wonderful however after 2 months my hair was dry, tangled, and my scalp itched.</li>
            <li> Love the pump -- easy to use in the shower -- not overly sudsy -- cleans well.</li>
            <li> Really feels good on my hair and no horrible chemicals to worry about.</li>
            <li> My hair feels very clean and soft and the price is great.</li>
            <li> It smells great and really gets my hair clean.  </li>
            <li> You have to make sure your shampoo has the right pH-balance, and I wasn&#x27;t successful in getting the right balance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the purchase, guys, my special thanks to the manufacturers))</li>
            <li> Works great for my 9 year old preteen daughter who does not like to wash her hair often.  </li>
            <li> Great smell, and over the past year, the maker improved the foaminess, which is great.</li>
            <li> I did a great deal of research before I bought a natural shampoo.  </li>
            <li> but it does great with wild and curly hair.</li>
            <li> Of course lingering scent might be more of an issue as more of my hair grows back - LOL.</li>
            <li> The shampoo smells good and is gentle on my hair.</li>
            <li> I liked the fresh scent and</li>
            <li> Now,I say \\&quot;surfactant\\&quot; free as most \\&quot;sulfate-free\\&quot; shampoo brands still have a moderately strong surfactant,to \\&quot;clean\\</li>
            <li> But great for the whole family to use if you do not have damaged hair or super oily hair.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and keeps my hair feeling and smelling clean.</li>
            <li> The price of this shampoo is kind of expensive,as are most organic products,which really bothers me.</li>
            <li> Excellent gentle, natural shampoo...</li>
            <li> this shampoo lathers well and rinses clean - my hair looks healthy and people ask me what shampoo I use</li>
            <li> When you smell it in the bottle it seems that it might be too strong, but not at all.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> It has kind of a funny smell</li>
            <li> else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Paul Mitchell&#x27;s tea tree special shampoo, as tea tree oil is also supposed to help, and while it felt good tingling in my hair, and my hair was nice and clean and shiny, I had an increase in flakes, although smaller pieces and more like dandruff.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s fine,</li>
            <li> There is a scent to it, but it is soft and pleasant.</li>
            <li> It is very natural &amp; good for your hair.</li>
            <li> But once I started using this shampoo I noticed a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> Also, this company is cruelty-free and this is HUGE to</li>
            <li> I bought two of these huge containers and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a huge bottle for just one user.</li>
            <li> Anyway, this shampoo makes my hair so soft and amazingly tangle free!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it has no dangerous chemicals.</li>
            <li> but it is healthier and works great overall.</li>
            <li> light-</li>
            <li> ; Enjoy.</li>
            <li> A lot of sulfate free shampoo tend to leave my hair feeling greasy but this is not the case with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> so I will do a pre-wash with one pump of shampoo, lightly rinse, and then add another 2 pumps and re-lather.</li>
            <li> This really helps get a nice lather without having to use a ton of shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and do a cursory search and learn about C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, the primary detergent of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> pump is cheaply made.</li>
            <li> It is cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it is Sodium Laurel Sulfate free.</li>
            <li> I have highlighted hair and am into chemical free type products.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work all that well with the viscosity of the shampoo (the same pump for the companion conditioner works great)</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s not a nasty detergent style soap but a more natural healthy one.</li>
            <li> , the smell is great, you get the type of hair experience you would have gotten from the name brand traditional chemical laden products we used to all use.</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you don&#x27;t have skin problems but the company should let the public know this could be a problem.</li>
            <li> I have used several of the kiss my face products and have been happy.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is easy to rinse off and you can feel it clean ..does not leave the residue on your hair.</li>
            <li> questions, feel free to ask.</li>
            <li> Great for low poo washes, because it doesn&#x27;t strip moisture.</li>
            <li> It is light with citus undertones.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo primarily because I like the Kiss</li>
            <li> This is what we&#x27;ve settled on and I love it, but he&#x27;s not crazy about the scent.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;3)Readily available on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li> because, while it&#x27;s light on your hair, IT WORKS)</li>
            <li> It smells good, lathers well, leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using natural shampoos for about 3 years now, so I&#x27;ve tried a good amount.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not thin like a lot of the more healthy shampoos</li>

            <li> It does make my hair feel squeaky clean</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s because of the ingredients and most lathering agents are not green.</li>

            <li> Well,I&#x27;ve been looking for a sulfate free shampoo for my hair,since I noticed that it wasn&#x27;t looking its best lately.</li>
            <li> The scent is fresh and lemony, and not too strong.  </li>
            <li> no smell to strong just right..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please comment if you have found a suitable alternative for a decent price.</li>
            <li> This did nothing special for my hair, so I&#x27;m going to use it when washing my dog.</li>
            <li> But I would recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have special hair needs.</li>
            <li> At first this shampoo was a little drying, but they added Moroccan Argan Oil to it, and now it is wonderful!  </li>
            <li> The old formula was amazing for my hair</li>
            <li> I was surprised since the bar soap is really nice.</li>
            <li> A while ago,I had a full head relaxer done</li>
            <li> I wanted to get away from all the toxic products in my health-care items and this shampoo has been a true winner.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at how much I liked this and the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I loved the way it worked and it was the only thing that worked for my hair.</li>
            <li> Nice natural shampoo, almost all organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> You will need to use more of the product compared to sulfate shampoos as it does not lather as readily.</li>
            <li> For a full head of lather, I suggest lots of water in your hair before you apply it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;He loved it when he used it the next day.</li>
            <li> either so its good for not just girls but the entire family .</li>
            <li> and it works like a dream come true.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s true</li>
            <li> it not bad at all..</li>
            <li> Outlast All Day Lipcolor (Toxin score: 4, not bad and</li>
            <li> Outlast All Day Lipcolor (Toxin score: 4, not bad and</li>
            <li> I have purchased both the shampoo and conditioner and my shampoo has gone down a lot faster than my conditioner has for the reason that I feel I need to use A LOT more to achieve a good washing.</li>
            <li> have normal hair, very fine in texture but a lot of it.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, soft, mild lime scent overall&lt;</li>
            <li> Smells great and lathers extremely well.</li>
            <li> It is economically and environmentally friendly.  </li>
            <li> the fragrance is great and the shampoo doesn&#x27;t strip my hair like other ones tend to do.  </li>
            <li> The first shampoo with this product was fine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice the smell after showering, and it leaves my hair feeling adequately</li>
            <li> :) only thing is that I think another brand is better than this one</li>
            <li> but it goes away quickly</li>
            <li> it cleans really good, our whole family enjoys it, we even use it on our 3 year old</li>
            <li> Limes smell nice, green tea smells nice but in the bottle this stuff,</li>
            <li> Love the smell, the size, and the price for such a huge bottle!</li>
            <li> The conditioner that goes with this shampoo is really nice at detangling &amp; conditioning which is hard to find in a safe healthy product.  </li>
            <li> it does take a bit more than normal shampoo and conditioner because the shampoo does not lather a lot</li>
            <li> Let me say first and foremost that I do like that this is a cruelty free product.  </li>
            <li> I normally buy the 11 oz bottle, but this time I wanted to make sure I wouldn&#x27;t run out any time soon</li>
            <li> Overall I am very pleased with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Although my hair is pretty tangled after I wash it, it gives my hair great body and has helped my dry scalp a ton!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t able to fulfill my #1 objective - clean my hair!  </li>
            <li> but I think I might actually want more of a \\&quot;full body\\&quot; shampoo because my hair is fine -</li>
            <li> The very ingredients that are toxic to our bodies, are the ones that make a shampoo slide around your head, and suds up easily.</li>
            <li> When messaged into the hair, using your normal amount WILL leave your hair very clean even if it doesn&#x27;t foam.</li>
            <li> All I can say is I felt EXACTLY like the women from the Herbal Essence commercials!</li>
            <li> Will be buying again in the future, I&#x27;m sure!</li>
            <li> Since then, my entire family has switched over to this shampoo(THEIR choice) and we all love it!  </li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> He is very picky and loves it too!!</li>
            <li> hair is very blond/baby fine.  </li>
            <li> , KMF gets it clean the first wash.</li>
            <li> After the first use of kiss me whenever shampoo, if gave my hair silky and clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> Good price overall for a large amount of poo.</li>
            <li> This was a great product a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> So young people with healthy oily hair should give it try.  </li>
            <li> One more thing, getting it to lather is not a problem for me as I am used to using natural hair products.  </li>
            <li> I am surprised to see so many people saying this shampoo does not lather well, my experience is that is lathers a lot</li>
            <li> I typically only wash my hair once or twice a week, and it takes days for it to be any kind of greasy.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin to most products.  </li>
            <li> Not crazy about citrus scents</li>
            <li> 32 ounces at this price is a great deal, especially for a product as natural as this.</li>
            <li> Glad to have something natural to use on my hair and get rid of those chemicals in store brands.</li>
            <li> I RARELY immediately re-purchase a product but Kiss My Face</li>
            <li> and I find it cleans better then the old.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Their shampoo in the green bottle was the best I tried, along with their old formula conditioner.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know if it was the shampoo or conditioner that did this to my hair, but this stuff left my hair fried!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seriously worth checking out.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t, that was just a month&#x27;s worth of oil built</li>
            <li> Not much lather, but smells good.  </li>
            <li> The pump is useful, too.</li>
            <li> I am trying to find products that are more natural and decrease the amount of chemicals in my beauty routine.</li>
            <li> Like a considerable bit more.  </li>
            <li> I love natural products, although I don&#x27;t feel like the price should be prohibitive to buy them.</li>
            <li> They completely changed this shampoo and now it&#x27;s nowhere near as good as it was.</li>
            <li> I am working on growing my hair out and was told to use a more natural shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> the performance is worth it to me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the performance is worth it to me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product&#x27;s use of more natural ingredients and lack of parabens compared to other shampoos seemed like a good choice for me.</li>
            <li> However I have read from EWG and other sources that many, many shampoos are toxic.</li>
            <li> All the other brands I&#x27;ve tried make you sacrifice lather, detangling, smoothness or cleansing ability for being safe &amp; healthy.  </li>
            <li> , I feel like I have to use it everyday for my hair to smell good and look clean.</li>
            <li> I love that it has very few chemicals, it smells nice, I love the price, and it lathers well for a natural shampoo.</li>
            <li> (The good news is that there was no sign of rash or other allergic reactions).</li>
            <li> It works just as well as any other shampoo and leaves my hair looking good.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo because of the reasonable cost and it&#x27;s earth friendly approach.</li>
            <li> ... right?  </li>
            <li> Oh right, the scent, it smells like lemonade with a hint of verbena to me.</li>
            <li> I contacted Amazon and they sent a replacement out right away.</li>
            <li> My hair feels very silky and clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It should be noted, however, that if you REALLY want the sudsing (it will clean without the sudsing)</li>
            <li> Also, the lime smell is very strong it smells like someone cut open a 100 limes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say that this cleans my hair very well and does not weigh my hair down one bit.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair soft, clean, &amp; manageable!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it does a good job of cleaning, even on oily hairs, but it only foam/sud half as much as normal shampoos but is organic and good for you.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for a person who has scalp issues at times my hair and scalp can vary from dry to oily and this allows me to wash my  hair as needed to keep the stink low and my hair shiny clean.</li>
            <li> Great for everyday use for \\&quot;everyday\\&quot; hair, though!</li>
            <li> (Toxin score: 2, the blue, green, rose and pearl are all pearlescent, but the coffee, olive and white are more matte; the rose, white and pearl are good for highlighting.)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li> that for me, it was nice going for so long without any flaking even after a shower and brushing...).  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair nice and clean without that &amp;#34;left over&amp;#34; oily feeling, I have a sensitive scalp and can&#x27;t use any fragrance in any shampoo, so this one (naturally scented and smell last for half a day) is ideal.</li>
            <li> Pleasant, but a tiny tiny bit sweet.</li>
            <li> , it is not working perfectly, and it is not as good as the initial results I had with Jason&#x27;s (makes me mad as I still think using something else ruined</li>
            <li> I estimate that I use six times as much to get my hair as clean as I did with my regular shampoo--almost more than I can hold in one hand.</li>
            <li> Very watery with kind of a slippery feel to it -- like it was mainly glycerin -- and it didn&#x27;t do much as far as cleaning our hair.</li>
            <li> So maybe this shampoo would be good for folks with slightly oilier</li>
            <li> I like the fact that the ingredients are safer to use than other products and it smells good too and cleans my hair really well</li>
            <li> It is watery, doesn&#x27;t suds up nice and leaves my hair very dry and oily looking.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy the smell well enough and it does an admirable job of keeping my hair clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty upset</li>
            <li> My hair has grown thicker and does not tangle much anymore!</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and oily skin, so by the end of the day, it is not so great looking.  </li>
            <li> The ONLY problem is that every time you try to find an organic alternative,it seems to cost significantly more then what you would find in the stores.</li>
            <li> The size of this shampoo is very nice,so I guess that I can say that its worth it.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> During last many months I couldn&#x27;t find the shampoo for myself.</li>
            <li> I actually had better luck with the Aveeno sulfate-free shampoo, which had lower ratings.</li>
            <li> Great smell, but did not work for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I most definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I washed twice with this brand shampoo and conditioner (to make sure this was indeed the culprit), and the same thing happened both</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ended up drying out and making my hair frizzy for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> And not expensive.</li>
            <li> My personal favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> I chose not to send it back, but to keep and use as a sulfate free body wash!</li>
            <li> I could get a pretty good lather with a lot of product but in that instance it would make me wonder if the shampoo is just heavily diluted.</li>
            <li> Nope, it feels smooth, soft and manageable when dried.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not that it wouldn&#x27;t work in those instances, but you would probably end up using so much that it wouldn&#x27;t be worth</li>
            <li> My current all time favorite.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product.</li>
            <li> Has totally got rid of my static / frizz issues tho.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s better out there, but this is a good everyday option for multiple hair types.</li>
            <li> You need to get your hair really wet when applying this to make it lather nice.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo was my favorite but they cheaped out on ingredients and there is a total difference!</li>
            <li> This one was priced very appropriately (I&#x27;ve only ever done better with one-off&#x27;s that make it to Marshall&#x27;s or Ross)</li>
            <li> It has no scary ingredients, and it works.</li>
            <li> A lot of reviewers have been complaining about the low lather, and telling you to use more if you want a lather.</li>
            <li> Most of all, the absence of harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> It also smells pretty great, but the scent is subtle.</li>
            <li> its worth the extra time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have curly fine hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few natural shampoos and they never leave my hair feeling great.</li>
            <li> My hair is clean and shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and clean .also</li>
            <li> My hair is clean, soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> It gets my hair clean and doesn&#x27;t require that I use a separate conditioner to keep it soft.</li>
            <li> but this is surprisingly drying, so I only use very occasionally and will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> My Face shampoo is my favorite and has been a long time.</li>
            <li> The first day my hair was so oily and stringy, I was really embarrassed.  </li>
            <li> It takes a lot to lather good, but even when you don&#x27;t use a lot and just get a small lather it cleans well.  </li>
            <li> I use Nature&#x27;s Gate Organics Mandarin Orange and Patchouli conditioner with it and my hair always looks clean, feels soft, and has as much volume as I could expect.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a bit large to keep in the shower unless you have a lot of shelf space</li>
            <li> so I purchased one 11oz bottle to keep in the shower and refill it with this large one when needed.</li>
            <li> The pump for this large bottle doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> I took one star off because the bottle is a bit large for my tastes and the pump</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a fairly large size...</li>
            <li> and I like my hair products in as large as volume as I can find.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made it through the whole bottle but won&#x27;t be buying again simply for the strong scent (like a bathroom/kitchen cleaner).  </li>
            <li> I mainly got this for my boyfriend because he has fine asian hair that gets greasy very fast.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is very mild does not dry or damage hair, since I use it I have had increased hair growth, for that price and quality I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> A bit about me: Asian with fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;Left</li>
            <li> like the option of buying the large size for a reasonable cost</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo not only because there are no chemicals but also because it gives my hair a very clean feeling and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Left my hair very soft and full of volume, which I was super suprised</li>
            <li> This shampoo definitely improves her blond color, gives a nice body, gentle on her sensitive scalp unlike some other strong shampoos.  </li>
            <li> My hair is shiny and growing so much healthier and faster.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li> Used to buy it from whole foods</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> All my life I&#x27;ve used \\&quot;regular\\&quot; shampoo &amp; had no idea that the very thing I was using all this time was contributing to the dryness of my hair.</li>
            <li> I really like how this stuff makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> What works for me is making sure that my hair is soaking wet, not damp, when I apply the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Priced reasonably and has no harmful ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Purchasing it in these bulk bottles is so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> which sometimes correlates to very ineffective cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Oh, and it lathers really well.</li>
            <li> My hair felt so nurtured, gently cleaned, and</li>
            <li> However, the product itself leaves much to be desired.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair really shiny and</li>
            <li> But it makes my head very itchy and dandruffy.</li>
            <li> really hope you can send me one to replace it.</li>
            <li> Really looking for an Organic shampoo that won&#x27;t strip out color and doesnt cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> and it probably is really cleaning my hair</li>
            <li> Sulfates just really irritate my scalp -</li>
            <li> this convenient size and bottle&#x27;s pump is very convenient.</li>
            <li> It does not lather a whole lot</li>
            <li> but I still really this one.</li>
            <li> My issues is I have very fine/thin hair and it leaves me greasy by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> I read someone review of another product - which they did not like so much.  </li>
            <li> It also lathers really well.</li>
            <li> The whole family uses this.</li>
            <li> Tried it again yesterday drastically increasing the amount I used and really taking the time to work it into my hair.  </li>
            <li> I am very allergic to SLS products.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m very picky in choosing my hair care.</li>
            <li> It has no sulphates, which can be very drying to hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather up very well.</li>
            <li> I like it so much that I don&#x27;t mind the diffreence.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve followed the advice in another review saying to make sure your hair is really wet</li>
            <li> and this seems to work really well.</li>
            <li> Once you really start looking at the ingredients list of products...</li>
            <li> (Tresemme went straight in the trash)</li>
            <li> Sodium Laurel Sulfoacetate may be a better alternative to Sodium Laurel/Laureth Sulfate,but it STILL foams,which means that it is still stripping the hair of its natural &amp; essential oils.</li>
            <li> Definitely one of the better natural shampoos.</li>
            <li> Going more natural recently, I researched and bought this from</li>
            <li> Recently tried this product as I am trying to switch to more natural products.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair soft and silky, much better than a box</li>
            <li> For example,the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Ever brand (Everstrong,Everpure,Eversleek,Evercreme) use the ingredient Sodium Laurel Sulfoacetate which is technically not a sulfate,but a mild surfactant that is used very much as an alternative to sulfates.</li>
            <li> Lathers and cleans well, doesn&#x27;t really smell strong and lasts long.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and shampoo tends to leave it dry, but this shampoo leaves it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> This was bought for my 8 year-old daughter and it works very well with her long, fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have long straight hair, fine texture but have problem with volume.</li>
            <li> The other thing is that if your hair is longer than shoulder length, you will end up using a bit more of the product.  </li>
            <li> to the need to use more because it doesn&#x27;t lather, it&#x27;s not supposed to lather like other shampoos.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I still need more of it than I did Pantene or whatever other chemical-laden stuff I used to use.</li>
            <li> (If you use more, you&#x27;re buying more shampoo in the long run when you don&#x27;t have to, and, while it&#x27;s affordable, it&#x27;s not cheap)</li>
            <li> And then I realized that what you have to do is MAKE SURE YOUR HAIR IS VERY, VERY WET when you apply the shampoo to it.</li>
            <li> It is as if it doesn&#x27;t clean enough even though I use a lot on my hair.</li>
            <li> The first few uses were okay.  </li>
            <li> It might be too strong for color treated hair or dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, curly hair that has a tendency to get too dry.</li>
            <li> I have tried various things over the years and have a cupboard full of them.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product and so far I believe I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> (looks like dandruff, but can be pieces a full cm in diameter, sometimes bigger).  </li>
            <li> We all live it and it lasts forever!</li>
            <li> Takes a little more than regular shampoo to get my hair clean</li>
            <li> Decided to give Kiss My Face a try, since most of the shampoos she buys are over $30.00 for 32 ounces or less.</li>
            <li> I do not use the companion conditioner, but instead use Giovanni Smooth as Silk Deeper Moisture conditioner on my incredibly dry hair.</li>
            <li> As for the shampoo, it does lather less than most shampoos, but that hasn&#x27;t caused any problems for me.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be a decent product</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a sulphate free shampoo &amp; conditioner that wasn&#x27;t too expensive, but definitely effective.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is one of the only brands that I&#x27;ve found to be COMPLETELY surfactant free.</li>
            <li> I need more than one pump to get enough shampoo, but the mechanism takes a while to fill up for a second pump.</li>
            <li> Smell is alright, the ingredients are decent.</li>
            <li> So decent product, but not for us.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still seeking the perfect healthy shampoo that isn&#x27;t insanely priced.</li>
            <li> The shampoo will dissipate rather quickly, but it thoroughly cleans your entire hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smell is decent.  </li>
            <li> The only real &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; about this, which isn&#x27;t much, is that I NEED to use a conditioner with this, because if I don&#x27;t my hair ends up very, very tangled</li>
            <li> I never expected my husband to have a strong opinion on the hair products I buy, but I tried a different brand</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This shampoo meets my incredibly high standards and smells like lime sherbet.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> All natural, biodegradable shampoo that makes my hair feel better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Assuming it was just a bottle color change, I went to using it, but was disaapointed that I couldn&#x27;t get that same feeling of clean nurtured soft hair.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty large bottle and lasted my family almost 2 months the last time I bought it (3 people).</li>
            <li> By the time I realize how amazing it was and went ahead to order a large bottle, instead of the green I received a white bottle.</li>
            <li> Clear and gentle.</li>
            <li> Really did not see a different between this and cheap, regular shampoo?</li>
            <li> We have been using this shampoo about a month on my daughter&#x27;s hair and it seems clean, although a bit dry.</li>
            <li> I went through the No-Poo thing for a few months and though I thought my hair looked healthy and bouncy, it never had the luster that some people say they get when getting rid of shampoo.</li>
            <li> - it isn&#x27;t heavy and it makes my curls even better.  </li>
            <li> only 2 out of 10 by EWG, so I&#x27;m not afraid of using it on my baby</li>
            <li> My only complaint is I have to use two pumps per wash to really get a good lather going.</li>
            <li> I normally use Jason&#x27;s dandruff shampoo as it contains sulfur and that has been known to reduce the symptoms</li>
            <li> I would recommend using a nice thick conditioner with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product is good, but the packaging was poor.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be gentle on my fine hair (man) like other natural shampoos</li>
            <li> Tossed it out, it was half full, so used it long enough to see the results weren&#x27;t at all spectacular.</li>
            <li> It left my hair dry and stringy so this is more for people who have normal to oily hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly looking for home products that are low in toxins and easy on the budget.  </li>
            <li> Whether pregnant or not, I will be using this product for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> Live and learn.</li>
            <li> Now I must look for a new brand because KISS</li>
            <li> product, new formula.</li>
            <li> Discusting, new formula is horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they mailed me a new pump.</li>
            <li> ALL NEW INGREDIENTS.</li>
            <li> that were I live.  </li>
            <li> It smells lovely and does not dry out her hair the way some other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoos have.</li>
            <li> I keep saying \\&quot;thoroughly\\&quot; only because I don&#x27;t want you to leave some in and then claim that either the shampoo or conditioner makes your hair greasy; however, it is SO much easier to rinse out than brands that contain sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium lareth sulfate (those bubbles that we miss so much)</li>
            <li> I have pretty bad Seborrhoeic dermatitis and my dermatologist told me that the best thing to do was to use a sensitive skin shampoo, or something with out a lot of chemicals in it, don&#x27;t brush my hair, use a comb instead, only wash my hair every 2 or 3 days, and don&#x27;t scratch.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> In other words this is a standard cheap shampoo that smells similar to the original.</li>
            <li> It leaves the hair very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> The new formula is just okay, no better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried in this price range.</li>
            <li> Lathers decently, rinses clean and does not contribute to the sticky, limp feeling I normally associate with other SLS free shampoos.</li>
            <li> The top wasn&#x27;t tightened and several ounces leaked out into its plastic bag and then into the box with a couple other items.</li>
            <li> I could not wait to rinse it all off completely!</li>
            <li> my face may not have the exact same fragrance as Carol&#x27;s Daughter, but the shampoo performs.  </li>
            <li> Lathers so much more than other similar products without the use of SLS.</li>
            <li> oh so soft!</li>
            <li> I know there are comments on here about an old formulation, but I purchased this when only the current formulation has been available.  </li>
            <li> You need to use twice the amount for the sud/foam action of normal shampoos.</li>
            <li> I first tried the big body</li>
            <li> All natural!  </li>
            <li> When I first opened the bottle and gave it a sniff it kinda reminded me of public washroom air freshener.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, but don&#x27;t feel like it cleans my hair as good as some other products, but it&#x27;s also not as harsh either since it&#x27;s Organic.</li>
            <li> thought natural would mean healthy hair too, not so much.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t strip my hair like other shampoos - however I can feel how clean it is.  </li>
            <li> Then do sell it in a smaller size here on Amazon,but this will last much longer,since I don&#x27;t really wash my hair that much.</li>
            <li> This bottle is huge , so it last a pretty long time if you dont wash your hair daily.</li>
            <li> Actually lathers, unlike most other natural shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I have used other Country Life products that are all natural that leave hair clean....</li>
            <li> I only have positive things to say about this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used expensive salon brands, but due to being pregnant, I&#x27;m more conscious of what chemicals I&#x27;m using in my daily routines and was looking for something more natural.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel really clean which is hard to find in the first place!I</li>
            <li> I think I kind of have to use the conditioner as well, otherwise the shampoo alone would leave my hair feeling a little rough.</li>
            <li> and I love that it hardly has any chemicals at all</li>
            <li> The conditioner isn&#x27;t as harsh on your hair either, very light, but follow up with that, leaving it in for at least 2 min, and then thoroughly wash it out and it will make your hair soft, smooth, and shiny.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling clean and soft without weighting it down.  </li>
            <li> I also agree with a previous reviewer about making sure your hair is VERY WET - it really does help with the lathering.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Whenever Shampoo (clear bottle):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The problem is, while that left my scalp feeling clean, my hair gets really dry and</li>
            <li> But for kids like my 9 year old, they may need mom&#x27;s help to wash their hair well with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using it completely after 1/4 usage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s drying to our hair and after several uses by my whole family it isn&#x27;t anything any of us like.</li>
            <li> shampoo so far.</li>
            <li> Then, I received my June 2013 shipment and they have completely changed the formula without any notification.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo really should not even be called by the same name.  </li>
            <li> My type of hair,which is mixed (african-american &amp; arab) is very curly,dry &amp; somewhat thin,I&#x27;ve noticed.</li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned,if it foams,drys,or otherwise irritates the hair \\&quot;like\\</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to shampoo my hair every day now since I&#x27;ve started using it, but if I want to--it&#x27;s still gentle enough that I can and quite often do.  </li>
            <li> Natural ingredients</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and smell good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> though - it had always been soft and silky before.</li>
            <li> I gave this one star because I used to use the old KMF</li>
            <li> Its all natural....</li>
            <li> I have an incredibly sensitive scalp.  </li>
            <li> bought this for its natural cleaning with no chemicals.</li>
            <li> I see there are lots of complaints about the formula changing, but I never used the old one...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still natural.</li>
            <li> So I bought the 11oz bottle of this yesterday from my local Whole Foods store, as I needed it ASAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used it for a year thus far.</li>
            <li> Which is much healthier than shampoo regularly used.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot for natural shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Not harsh and can use every day.  </li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s all natural ingredients, which merits the one star.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a bit frizzy, which comes naturally with curly hair, but it&#x27;s always had a tendency to be frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest this to anyone that like natural shampoos and goods.</li>
            <li> My hair was very oily and frizzy at the same time.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo does not irritate my sensitive scalp.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural oils and shine, but also</li>
            <li> We switched all of our personal/hygiene products last year to more natural and cruelty-free, and tried a few shampoos that were either pricey or didn&#x27;t work that</li>
            <li> so I would be hesitant to recommend it to someone with thick hair, people who use a lot of product and thus might have more build-up to remove, or those who are looking to use it after strenuous exercise/sweating.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t pump the shampoo into my hands; rather, I pump it directly on my scalp - a small one of each side, two for the top, three for the back.  </li>
            <li> I feel better about using a product that isn&#x27;t full of artificial ingredients.  </li>
            <li> In fact, when I ordered it, I verified the ingredients list was still starting with Aloe, but when I received it I found water first ingredient and C14-16 olefin sulfonate is 2nd ingredient.  </li>
            <li> I discovered that the EXACT same item is 100% a different product.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t speak to the shampoo&#x27;s other assertions (promoting a healthy skull, stimulating hair growth, ...), because I didn&#x27;t notice any difference one way or the other.</li>
            <li> The secret is to make sure your hair is dripping wet, and then immediately apply the shampoo, and work it around quickly.</li>
            <li> with one full pump I get just a little itty bit of froth,</li>
            <li> Recently I started using only natural cosmetic products, after learning about how harmful harsh chemicals found in most beauty products can be.</li>
            <li> In the past two weeks of using a sulfate free shampoo, I have noticed an increase in softness/manageability/no dryness whatsoever/</li>
            <li> I bought the top of the line salon shampoos for years, and my hair was always dry dry dry - but oily at the scalp.  </li>
            <li> Just in case you aren&#x27;t familiar with products that do not include some toxic substances in their products, it is normal for it to not suds up like the common shampoos.</li>
            <li> I use a small bit of coconut oil and smooth it over my hair.  </li>
            <li> My tried and true shampoo was not available</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this shampoo because is supposed to be more natural and all that, but, unfortunately it makes my hair feel straw-like.  </li>
            <li> I love it, I have a sensitive scalp, and its very hard to find a product that doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch or break out.</li>
            <li> I tried it for my dark colored hair, and it was way too strong; I got dry frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> However, it completely stripped the color from my hair in a matter of about 6 shampoos and left it feeling pretty dry (even paired with the conditioner).</li>
            <li> 2.5 years later I needed a new one.  </li>
            <li> But they&#x27;ve changed their formula (new white bottles).</li>
            <li> Not only new downgrade regarding their formula.</li>
            <li> I used to have a very itchy, severely dry scalp that dandruff shampoos didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> If this is what all natural shampoo is like then I will go back to &#x27;un&#x27; natural.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with this ingredient is that I used L&#x27;Oreal Paris Everstrong to wash my hair &amp; it foamed JUST AS MUCH as the regular shampoos I used to use.</li>
            <li> But it is worth it, since my hair is now softer, thicker looking, and am losing 75% less hair each time I shower than I used to.</li>
            <li> went ahead and used up the entire bottles, but am ready to move on to a different product.</li>
            <li> No regrets, though!</li>
            <li> This shampoo gets your hair clean but has very little lather</li>
            <li> When I rinse, I can feel my hair being sqeaky clean, which usually translate to dry/frail/easily tangled hair when my hair drys.</li>
            <li> I use a few pumps and it rinses clean with only one shot.</li>
            <li> I have oily hair, which means the only time I get the sqeaky clean feeling after rinse is if I use harsh or clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li> I was worried about using something all-natural because I have moderately oily hair, and I didn&#x27;t know if a shampoo could get it clean without all of the harsh chemicals that cut grease.</li>
            <li> people have complained about the lather of this product but that is a problem with any sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo that fixed the problem.</li>
            <li> The grocery store near our house sells the shampoo and conditioner in far smaller bottles for ten dollars per bottle.</li>
            <li> I wish they&#x27;d just go back to their old formula.</li>
            <li> The hair does not appear quite as soft over all from the conditioner but is definitely healthier.  </li>
            <li> thus far, this is the only one I&#x27;ve truly thought did the job as a shampoo.</li>
            <li> Now all the natural ingredients are in smaller percentages and it now has sulfates for foaming.  </li>
            <li> I have been searching for something natural that actually cleans my hair instead of making it greasy.  </li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t willing to pay that much for such a small bottle</li>
            <li> My Face line of natural products without extra chemicals,</li>
            <li> Bottle came broken, wasn&#x27;t able to use the pump function.  </li>
            <li> It cleans and clarifies really well -- a little goes a long way which is super for my long hair.</li>
            <li> First five ingredients of previous shipments of Kiss My Face</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of purchasing several bottles this last time, not realizing that the formula had completely changed!</li>
            <li> I finally took the jump, and my hair is clean, soft, silky, thick, curly, manageable.  </li>
            <li> that my flaking scalp (cause by other products) is now much healthier.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used several other shampoos, like Naturoli&#x27;s, Avalon Organics, and Nature&#x27;s Gate, and this is by far my least favorite.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo- cleans my hair without the nasty ingredients that I don&#x27;t want absorbed into my body.  </li>
            <li> Just FYI- massage in really well and leave in for a few minutes its natural</li>
            <li> This was by far one of the most difficult categories to find something that met all of my criteria</li>
            <li> I have thin hair but a lot of it, as well as oily skin, so my hair gets weighed down and oily pretty easily.</li>
            <li> Initially, I was of the same opinion, until one day I had no trouble lathering with a moderate amount of the shampoo.</li>
            <li> highly Recommend the &amp;#34; Kiss my Face &amp;#34; Soap and Shampoo and I have not gotten other Kiss my Face Products.</li>
            <li> less breakage/a head of hair that actually wants to do what I want it</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair on top and black hair on the bottom and it does not strip my black hair of color and doesn&#x27;t dry out my blonde hair.</li>
            <li> (My hair is neither oily nor dry naturally.</li>
            <li> Local Whole Foods does not carry this size and driving to another town is not really economical.</li>
            <li> I like how it makes my hair and my scalp feel refresh and not dry and itchy like commercial shampoos.</li>
            <li> Its easier on my sensitive scalp than regular shampoo, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my psoriasis hands too</li>
            <li> I recently became aware of the palm oil crisis and decided to stop buying anything containing palm oil (no easy task).  </li>
            <li> I have straight, thin, normal hair and have developed topical allergies to fragrances and chemicals.</li>
            <li> bought this large bottle of Kiss my Face as the price difference between it and the itsy-bitsy other option was too small to make much of a difference</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine, hair and this</li>
            <li> Kiss my face whenever shampoo green tea and lime was a smart purchase.</li>
            <li> It leaves her very thick, long hair feeling clean, soft and and manageable.  </li>
            <li> Received this last night - used this morning - small amount is all you need and it is NOT going to foam very much - don&#x27;t worry about that, this product does what it needs too.  </li>
            <li> It has a very low toxicity rating and is about 30-40% cheaper than other products we&#x27;ve used, which only came in smaller, less economical sizes.  </li>
            <li> I would give it one star considering how bad my hair looks now, but I could see myself using it once a month later on to get a good cleansing - so it gets 3 stars.      </li>
            <li> I used to use one of Dove&#x27;s shampoos before switching over to this because the Dove shampoo stopped working after a few weeks and left my hair feeling very stringy and dry.</li>
            <li> while it took some getting used to, it has a TINY bit of lather but as long as you thoroughly wash and rinse your hair, it goes above and beyond the $2 brands you used to buy.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo in the past and really appreciated the quality and \\&quot;healthiness\\&quot; of the brand.</li>
            <li> All of them left my hair looking strange -</li>
            <li> so invested in the 32 oz bottle which should last a long time.</li>
            <li> which tends to get greasy really fast because I have really thin hair and a naturally greasy scalp, but this shampoo works well for me and my kids who both have completely different hair than me.</li>
            <li> I think it will last me a long time!</li>
            <li> However, I still used it at much faster rate than I used \\&quot;Yes to Carrots\\&quot; which is also free of bad chemicals.</li>
            <li> I used it in conjunction with the conditioner and both left my hair dry.</li>
            <li> In fact, no matter how little/much I use or how long I scrub, it feels grimey and oily, especially under my crown (and I have notoriously dry hair!).&lt;br /&gt;Back</li>
            <li> Anyone looking to remove artificial products from your life, this is top notch.</li>
            <li> My Face olive oil bar soap for a long time and have had no adverse effects from it</li>
            <li> conditioner is a must, but I only use a quarter size--enough so that the hairbrush will go through my wet hair.</li>
            <li> A strange name for a shampoo though.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> long run.  </li>
            <li> I get sufficient suds if my hair is wet enough.  </li>
            <li> My hair is bottom of shoulder-blade long</li>
            <li> I have long, average-thickness hair and use almost no products of any sort.</li>
            <li> but for someone with long hair it could be an issue.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it because it does smell good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to buy a bottle in a local supermarket -- at least then I&#x27;ll know whether what I bought here was counterfeit or whether I now need to find a new brand.</li>
            <li> I cannot use the typical shampoo sold in supermarket/drug store because they either left my hair oily, cause acne/bump around my head and back, or cause dandruff or flake on scalp.  </li>
            <li> I think this has made a difference in how long he can go between washes because it doesn&#x27;t dry out his scalp.</li>
            <li> After researching the side effects of chemicals such as sulfates (commonly found in most commercial shampoos and other products), parabens, phthalates, and artificial fragrances, I decided I needed to get some natural shampoo.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy other products by them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then I recently started purchasing other Kiss my Face products and so decided to give this</li>
            <li> if very long</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t dry out my skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dry and brittle, and becomes oily after 15 hours of shampoo-ing.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about 3 weeks, my hair is not as dry</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because if you have dry hair you should not buy this.</li>
            <li> However, after using it, my hair has become dry and tangled.</li>
            <li> My hair also started feeling dry.</li>
            <li> MAKE MY HAIR TOO DRY.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t color treated but it does tend to have dry ends, who doesn&#x27;t, eh?</li>
            <li> Big size, big waste of money.</li>
            <li> It does not lather as much as regular shampoo, but it&#x27;s the harsh chemicals used in regular shampoos that makes the lather.</li>
            <li> this one takes 3-4 tries to equal one cleaning of other types...it could be my hair, so YMMV.</li>
            <li> For what I paid it was not worth sending back for another one.</li>
            <li> There are a few reviews out there saying the conditioner wasn&#x27;t soft or heavy enough for them, but this has not been my experience at all.</li>
            <li> I have very long, curly, very dry hair.  </li>
            <li> me with less hair than before AND left my hair dry.</li>
            <li> - a big reason that I continue to purchase this 32-oz size is that it costs less in&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li> Brushing out the tangles has left me with considerably less hair.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> I used to buy this shampoo at my local WalMart, but they only sell it in small 7oz bottles.</li>
            <li> and I have only gone half way through it.</li>
            <li> which sometimes makes it feel like the hair is very dry</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo I have ever found that doesn&#x27;t make my scalp a flaky mess.</li>
            <li> The faint key lime scent is very fresh and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> For those of us who are older with processed hair, not a good choice in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I used less than I did with normal shampoo, a palmful, (I have very long and thick hair, by the way</li>
            <li> I was very anxious because I color my hair because of the white (not grey!)</li>
            <li> The main ingredient that makes shampoo lather is sodium laurel sulfate, which is very drying, and it&#x27;s almost impossible to get all the &#x27;bubbles&#x27; rinsed from your hair.  </li>
            <li> Ever since then,though,I haven&#x27;t seen my hair grow an inch,&amp; I have absolutely no idea</li>
            <li> : that is partially the nature of my hair anyway, though.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s not unusual for me to have the one-in-a-million reaction.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> Purchased this not really doing any background research, just trusted the Kiss</li>
            <li> Not really a gentle cleansing agent.</li>
            <li> your hair needs to be soaking wet...</li>
            <li> Not much smell to it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very toxic,</li>
            <li> I use the EWG skindeep database and try for only products that score a 2 or below, but have a few that are 3 or 4.</li>
            <li> I think they need to rethink their design a bit or just get a plain flip open bottle.....</li>
            <li> It is also a little runnier, but also not a major</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to pump enough shampoo for long hair.  </li>
            <li> My little girl used to cry when I combed her long hair but not since we started using this product.</li>
            <li> The shine that it gives is unrivaled by any other product I have used.</li>
            <li> It cleans hair extremely well and smells yummy.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo for about two weeks until I realized that it was extremely drying.</li>
            <li> somehow my hair never got greasy by the end of the day like it does with other shampoos.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s almost like buying any other shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have read some other reviews and its mentioned that it doesn&#x27;t foam up like other shampoo&#x27;s</li>
            <li> This product did not contain hydrogenated oils which other Kiss</li>
            <li> Hopes this helps other people from wasting their money.</li>
            <li> Plus I tried to avoid Paraben and SLS or other toxic chemicals shampoo.  </li>
            <li> not sure what happened there, it was working 100% for over 6 months, then I went out of town and forgot to bring it with me, I used something else for a week, and when I got back</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to look around for other fragrances &#x27;cause this one ain&#x27;t working for me.</li>
            <li> a note, if you like lather, this can do it, but it requires your hair to be VERY wet.  </li>
            <li> , that goes down my back, and small hands) and didn&#x27;t lather, rinse, repeat like I have with other shampoos, and,</li>
            <li> Unusable bad, I had to pour it into an old lotion bottle with a real pump.  </li>
            <li> My hair is normallysmooth shiny soft abs healthy but after this it was completely terrible and it never washed out my hair would be left hard and clumpy</li>
            <li> This is very disappointing because it was my favorite.</li>
            <li> This shampoo cleans my hair so well that volume happens naturally due to it not being weighed down.  </li>
            <li> The current shampoo is so bad I might just use it as a hand soap, my hair hates the new formula, gross.</li>
            <li> Also, you definitely need to use conditioner after because it leaves the hair hard to comb through.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not lathered so well as typical shampoo, but if you apply on very wet hair, it does help a lot.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding a conditioner that gives me enough moisture and frizz control without weighing down my hair.</li>
            <li> My husband and son also use it and have only one complaint...</li>
            <li> the only complaint I have it that it does not lather well.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick, coarse and dry, however</li>
            <li> The shampoo is running down the side of the bottle and is dripping all over the bathtub.</li>
            <li> My waves are not weighed down.  </li>
            <li> and it dried out her hair and left it dull.</li>
            <li> Buying individual bottles was too expensive to keep purchasing regularly-</li>
            <li> That way I get to still use this with less chemicals but get that bit of body I like from my Body Envy shampoo.</li>
            <li> Also, the cap came slightly off when it was being shipped</li>
            <li> Also, the pushing mechanism to get the shampoo out is not super practical.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a less chemical laden alternative and tried this.</li>
            <li> Previous review:  </li>
            <li> This met the criteria for less chemicals</li>
            <li> I have city water and need half a squirt.</li>
            <li> I have medium-length wavy hair and a slightly oily scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Less lather means healthier hair.</li>
            <li> that this shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather as much as conventional shampoos – but lather is just an indication of harsh detergents.</li>
            <li> weighs my hair down just a little.</li>
            <li> Tried to do the baking soda/apple cider vinegar route at first, but just too inconvenient for me.</li>
            <li> I have thick and long hair</li>
            <li> When I received this the lid was not screwed on tight, and the shampoo had spilled out onto the box.  </li>
            <li> It does not clean my hair the way it used to.</li>
            <li> i do switch up every once in a while &amp; it is a little pricey for my budget</li>
            <li> Understand I have hair that is thinning and has a tendency to be a little fuzzy.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that in Hard water it doesn&#x27;t lather as well,</li>
            <li> but that is also because it does not have harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not to mention my hair is in the worse condition that&#x27;s its ever been in my entire 27 years of life.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a conditioner because it makes my hair too heavy and bundle together, but if I were to continue using this, I would have to.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t waste shampoo.</li>
            <li> The scent is divine and I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It came messy, since some leaked i packaging.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> ... wasted it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m replacing the aveeno shampoo with the green label.</li>
            <li> that is dried and split</li>
            <li> I have trouble getting used to the lack of lather, though.</li>
            <li> Well, I say that&#x27;s a waste of your money.</li>
            <li> , Dont you just hate when they fix what is not broken?!!!</li>
            <li> Not only does this stuff smell terrible but it left my hair rough dry abd frizzy.</li>
            <li> BUT it&#x27;s not super concentrated or thick either.  </li>
            <li> It is really too bad.  </li>
            <li> I washed as usual, put my hair in a towel as usual, and when I took the towel off the ends of my hair were kinked and felt like straw.  </li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t completely wasted my money!</li>
            <li> No more frizzies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> WENT BACK TO SALON AND BOUGHT EXPENSIVE ONE</li>
            <li> Not only is it watered down but it stinks like lemon dish</li>
            <li> I usually go through at least 3 pumps each time I use it.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this shampoo but was massively disappointed.  </li>
            <li> my wife had started developing rashes from time to which we wondered if it was caused by developing allergies to common brand name shampoo and conditioners.  </li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick, and just a bit longer than Clark Kent&#x27;s, if water is dripping in my face with my head drenched and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using Bumble &amp; Bumble, which is really expensive, and this is half the price, for twice the amount.</li>
            <li> So, don&#x27;t think of the opposite happening as a bad thing.</li>
            <li> After using this for about a month, I am sad to report that my hair is very dried out, and my hair is damaged and broken.  </li>
            <li> The Conditioner is worse.</li>
            <li> have had issues with the durability of the pump which has broken before.</li>
            <li> Poor packaging.</li>
            <li> Has the least harmful stuff in it without being outrageously expensive.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> I was told that my hair needed time to adapt to the product, but the longer I used it the worse my hair got.  </li>
            <li> the failure of the bottle head, causing my shampoo is very difficult squeezed out,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So sad.</li>
            <li> It took 5-6 pumps to create a lather, and it left my hair really awful looking after styling.</li>
            <li> but honestly I&#x27;m not completely impressed with it.  </li>
            <li> have gone for years wondering what was wrong that made my scalp itch and burn.  </li>
            <li> - I don&#x27;t recommend it for thin hair!  </li>
            <li> have to say, sadly, my hair/scalp does not like this.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this shampoo lightens my hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather and the conditiner is very thin, but that didn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li> Would purchase again, disappointed by the shampoo leakage and poor packaging.</li>
            <li> yes, but what&#x27;s the point if you scalp remains dirty and grimey?</li>
            <li> All around disappointment.</li>
            <li> In this case... wrong!</li>
            <li> &quot; a sulfate does,then its just as bad.</li>
            <li> Might&#x27;ve been just a bad batch.</li>
            <li> It has no LSL, I couldn&#x27;t find any bad ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> This is just as bad as SLS for skin irritation.</li>
            <li> bad:  </li>
            <li> Also, the pump is REALLY bad.  </li>
            <li> However, after a week or so of using this product, my scalp started itching like crazy!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed and will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Pump is a piece of crap and doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> You will NOT be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> &quot; My scalp, face, and hands began to burn terribly!!  </li>
            <li> terrible product after they changed the ingredients to chemical based</li>
            <li> and this was (surprisingly) horrible for my hair.</li>
            <li> I tried a When shampoo, and it was awful for my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I checked out the ingredients list and found out why it smelled so horrible and have my family dandruff.  </li>
            <li> smells awful!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am trying to grow my hair out so I thought I would give this a try. While I can&#x27;t say yet that it is helping in that department I can say that my hair is SOOO much more manageable. I stopped coloring my hair when I cut it short and it is &amp;#34;too healthy&amp;#34; to do anything I want it to do. But once I started using this shampoo I noticed a HUGE difference. I LOVE this stuff. And it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all that it smells like a coconut lime snow cone!</li>
            <li> Love the scent and keeps my hair feeling and smelling clean.</li>
            <li> Works great for my 9 year old preteen daughter who does not like to wash her hair often.  With this one she can wash every 3 to 4 days, and her healthy medium blond hair looks great.  This shampoo definitely improves her blond color, gives a nice body, gentle on her sensitive scalp unlike some other strong shampoos.  I tried it for my dark colored hair, and it was way too strong; I got dry frizzy hair.  So young people with healthy oily hair should give it try.  For those of us who are older with processed hair, not a good choice in my opinion.  One more thing, getting it to lather is not a problem for me as I am used to using natural hair products.  But for kids like my 9 year old, they may need mom&#x27;s help to wash their hair well with this shampoo.  I often help my daughter, otherwise, her hair doesn&#x27;t get well washed and still oily in spots :-)</li>
            <li> thought natural would mean healthy hair too, not so much. just didn&#x27;t go so well with my scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> I like it but irritates my scalp a bit. I love the fact that it has no dangerous chemicals. Good size to.</li>
            <li> I went through the No-Poo thing for a few months and though I thought my hair looked healthy and bouncy, it never had the luster that some people say they get when getting rid of shampoo. Plus, whenever I wanted to deep condition my hair, I couldn&#x27;t wash out the oils from the conditioner. I got this shampoo and I love it. My hair is clean and shiny and soft. I think I kind of have to use the conditioner as well, otherwise the shampoo alone would leave my hair feeling a little rough.</li>
            <li> Great smell, and over the past year, the maker improved the foaminess, which is great. A pump-full now is all I need - used to take 1 1/2.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. It is one of the best shampoos I&#x27;ve ever used for oily hair. It cleans and clarifies really well -- a little goes a long way which is super for my long hair. The best thing about this purchase is that it comes in bulk. Buying individual bottles was too expensive to keep purchasing regularly- this way I&#x27;ve got 4 bottles in 1 and don&#x27;t have to worry about reordering for awhile! Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> Many of the reviews about drying out the hair are true! A bit about me: Asian with fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;Left me with less hair than before AND left my hair dry. So sad. I stopped using it completely after 1/4 usage. I&#x27;m pretty upset but oh be well. Live and learn.</li>
            <li> If this is what all natural shampoo is like then I will go back to &#x27;un&#x27; natural. It&#x27;s drying to our hair and after several uses by my whole family it isn&#x27;t anything any of us like. I gave it 2 stars only because it gets the job done...just not well.</li>
            <li> We have searched for the perfect shampoo for a long time and have found it in the KISS my FACE brand. My little girl used to cry when I combed her long hair but not since we started using this product. It smells great. When you smell it in the bottle it seems that it might be too strong, but not at all. The shine that it gives is unrivaled by any other product I have used. My hair is only benifiting as well. I used to have a very itchy, severely dry scalp that dandruff shampoos didn&#x27;t help. This is the only shampoo that fixed the problem. My hair is shiny and growing so much healthier and faster. I only have positive things to say about this shampoo. My husband and son also use it and have only one complaint...their hair grows faster now.</li>
            <li> Smell great, citrus clean smell.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo &amp; conditioner. It is very natural &amp; good for your hair. it does take a bit more than normal shampoo and conditioner because the shampoo does not lather a lot but that is also because it does not have harsh chemicals.  It leaves my hair very nice feeling and clean.  i do switch up every once in a while &amp; it is a little pricey for my budget but it is healthier and works great overall. prolly my fav. shampoo so far. I also like yes to tomatoes which is great to add volume to my hair and still feels healthy</li>
            <li> Great shampoo.  Smells lovely, and my hair feels nice.  I feel better about using a product that isn&#x27;t full of artificial ingredients.  The bottle is a bit large to keep in the shower unless you have a lot of shelf space so I purchased one 11oz bottle to keep in the shower and refill it with this large one when needed.</li>
            <li> The bottle leak. The top wasn&#x27;t tightened and several ounces leaked out into its plastic bag and then into the box with a couple other items.</li>
            <li> My hair has grown thicker and does not tangle much anymore! This is so great, my hair feels fresh and clean and it is cheap at the price. Highly recommend. Same goes for the conditioner, they go hand in hand!</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive. My tried and true shampoo was not available so I decided to try Kiss My Face Whenever Shampoo. Since I have used Kiss My Face olive oil bar soap for a long time and have had no adverse effects from it, I thought that it would be OK to try this Kiss My Face Shampoo... right?  In this case... wrong! The first shampoo with this product was fine. However, when I shampooed with it for a second time there was instant \\&quot;Yikes!!\\&quot; My scalp, face, and hands began to burn terribly!!  I could not wait to rinse it all off completely! I was surprised since the bar soap is really nice. However I have read from EWG and other sources that many, many shampoos are toxic. (The good news is that there was no sign of rash or other allergic reactions). So what to do? Make your own shampoo? These are rhetorical questions, of course. For me, the fact remains that I will not use this shampoo again. Big size, big waste of money.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and lather</li>
            <li> I like that it is a large bottle and seems to work great on my hair. I use it every day. Its affordable and hopefully good for my body as well.</li>
            <li> I am surprised to see so many people saying this shampoo does not lather well, my experience is that is lathers a lot and I love it. Used to buy it from whole foods but they stopped selling it, maybe because of the ingredient changes that so many are talking about , I was going to order here but now I am hesitant and will have to do more research, Dont you just hate when they fix what is not broken?!!!</li>
            <li> I typically only wash my hair once or twice a week, and it takes days for it to be any kind of greasy. This shampoo makes my hair SO oily! And flaky. Very disappointed. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this shampoo. It cleans well leaving hair with a shine.  The scent is refreshing, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> AVOID THIS PRODUCT.  I used to love it.  Then, I received my June 2013 shipment and they have completely changed the formula without any notification.  The bottle does not indicate anywhere that they changed the formula.  Not only is it watered down but it stinks like lemon dish soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about the shampoo is that my hair is very clean, all of the oil is gone.  I have thick hair and oily skin, so by the end of the day, it is not so great looking.  This shampoo cleans my hair so well that volume happens naturally due to it not being weighed down.  I love that it doesn&#x27;t contain any of the chemicals you shouldn&#x27;t be using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is a must, but I only use a quarter size--enough so that the hairbrush will go through my wet hair.</li>
            <li> use it every day on my hair, like it a lot</li>
            <li> All I can say is I felt EXACTLY like the women from the Herbal Essence commercials! All natural, biodegradable shampoo that makes my hair feel better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve already ordered the same size conditioner to see how that fairs! Anyone looking to remove artificial products from your life, this is top notch.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. Everything about it! Most of all, the absence of harmful chemicals. The only problem was with the pump the shampoo was in. I bought two bottles and the pump only worked for a short amount of time on both. They were white bottles. I&#x27;ve had bottles of this that were green that were purchased from whole foods and never had this problem.</li>
            <li> Great organic shampoo. My kids love.</li>
            <li> This shampoo gets your hair clean but has very little lather so you end up needing a lot of it to get it worked through your hair. I estimate that I use six times as much to get my hair as clean as I did with my regular shampoo--almost more than I can hold in one hand. Also, you definitely need to use conditioner after because it leaves the hair hard to comb through. I&#x27;m going to use the bottle up but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Smell is amazing, fresh and delicious. Hair felt clean and healthy!</li>
            <li> I just used it today9/29/13 to was my dreads and no lie it not bad at all.. no smell to strong just right..</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.  It cleans hair extremely well and smells yummy.  The only downside to this product is I wish it was thicker.  Other than that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo not only because there are no chemicals but also because it gives my hair a very clean feeling and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. Some shampoos leave your hair feeling sticky with shampoo residue, but not this shampoo! The scent is very light and pleasant and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin to most products.  I swear that Kiss My Face products.  They are friendly to my skin and eyes.  They don&#x27;t dry out my skin and they don&#x27;t clog my pores.  I have tried various things over the years and have a cupboard full of them. But the best things I have tried are always on the natural side.  The shampoo smells good and is gentle on my hair.</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful but that&#x27;s about it. It doesn&#x27;t clean your scalp. Your hair yes, but what&#x27;s the point if you scalp remains dirty and grimey? Not to mention my hair is in the worse condition that&#x27;s its ever been in my entire 27 years of life. It&#x27;s dry and brittle, and becomes oily after 15 hours of shampoo-ing. This is a waste of money I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone. The Conditioner is worse.</li>
            <li> Received this last night - used this morning - small amount is all you need and it is NOT going to foam very much - don&#x27;t worry about that, this product does what it needs too.  Left my hair very soft and full of volume, which I was super suprised about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using a Carol&#x27;s Daughter sulfate-free shampoo that I received from Sephora and immediately fell in love - but I wasn&#x27;t loving the price of that brand shampoo.  Kiss my face may not have the exact same fragrance as Carol&#x27;s Daughter, but the shampoo performs.  This price is really great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very blond/baby fine.  In the past two weeks of using a sulfate free shampoo, I have noticed an increase in softness/manageability/no dryness whatsoever/less breakage/a head of hair that actually wants to do what I want it too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just try this - I think you will love it.</li>
            <li> This seems to be lasting forever.  My hair is nice and shiny.  It foams great and rinses easy.  i need to get some of their conditioner.  I like the smell,  its mild but nice.</li>
            <li> terrible product after they changed the ingredients to chemical based</li>
            <li> I was looking for shampoo that is SLS free &amp; found this one, so I tried it!! It is wonderful!!! Leaves your hair soft, clean, &amp; manageable! Will be buying again in the future, I&#x27;m sure!</li>
            <li> Nice to find organics in this size. Seems to be a decent product and I like to keep it in my guest bathroom.</li>
            <li> The Whenever Shampoo used to be mostly Aloe Vera Gel (was the 1st ingredient), but now it is ingredient #7.  This shampoo really should not even be called by the same name.  In fact, when I ordered it, I verified the ingredients list was still starting with Aloe, but when I received it I found water first ingredient and C14-16 olefin sulfonate is 2nd ingredient.  Now I must look for a new brand because KISS MY FACE is no longer the company they&#x27;ve been for the 20 years I&#x27;d been using their products.</li>
            <li> I used to use one of Dove&#x27;s shampoos before switching over to this because the Dove shampoo stopped working after a few weeks and left my hair feeling very stringy and dry. I used this shampoo for about two weeks until I realized that it was extremely drying. I have used several other shampoos, like Naturoli&#x27;s, Avalon Organics, and Nature&#x27;s Gate, and this is by far my least favorite. It just took all the shine out of my hair and left it almost brittle. I don&#x27;t use a conditioner because it makes my hair too heavy and bundle together, but if I were to continue using this, I would have to.</li>
            <li> I did a great deal of research before I bought a natural shampoo.  I decided Kiss My Face was the one for me.  I have been using it for three weeks now and I must say I am quite satisfied.  It works just as well as any other shampoo and leaves my hair looking good.  I will buy it again!</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a sulphate free shampoo &amp; conditioner that wasn&#x27;t too expensive, but definitely effective. So I decided to give this shampoo a try. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks, and my hair has never been in better condition! It&#x27;s super soft, silky and shiny, and it smells amazing! The faint key lime scent is very fresh and not overwhelming. The price point on this shampoo and conditioner is great too. I&#x27;d been using Bumble &amp; Bumble, which is really expensive, and this is half the price, for twice the amount. Everything about this line is great. I&#x27;m so glad I found it.</li>
            <li> Product as described. I have used this shampoo in the past and really appreciated the quality and \\&quot;healthiness\\&quot; of the brand. Glad I returned . Leaves my hair soft and clean .also like the option of buying the large size for a reasonable cost</li>
            <li> Well,I&#x27;ve been looking for a sulfate free shampoo for my hair,since I noticed that it wasn&#x27;t looking its best lately.A while ago,I had a full head relaxer done &amp; since then it got so knotted up that I had a friend chop off a lot of my hair,since I felt I had to.Ever since then,though,I haven&#x27;t seen my hair grow an inch,&amp; I have absolutely no idea why.My type of hair,which is mixed (african-american &amp; arab) is very curly,dry &amp; somewhat thin,I&#x27;ve noticed.All my life I&#x27;ve used \\&quot;regular\\&quot; shampoo &amp; had no idea that the very thing I was using all this time was contributing to the dryness of my hair.The ONLY problem is that every time you try to find an organic alternative,it seems to cost significantly more then what you would find in the stores.Now,just so you know,I&#x27;m NO environmental freak,I just happen to like using organic beauty products since I like being self sustainable,but still love a good deal like anyone else.This shampoo is one of the only brands that I&#x27;ve found to be COMPLETELY surfactant free.Now,I say \\&quot;surfactant\\&quot; free as most \\&quot;sulfate-free\\&quot; shampoo brands still have a moderately strong surfactant,to \\&quot;clean\\&quot; the hair just like a sulfate would.For example,the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Ever brand (Everstrong,Everpure,Eversleek,Evercreme) use the ingredient Sodium Laurel Sulfoacetate which is technically not a sulfate,but a mild surfactant that is used very much as an alternative to sulfates.The only problem I have with this ingredient is that I used L&#x27;Oreal Paris Everstrong to wash my hair &amp; it foamed JUST AS MUCH as the regular shampoos I used to use.As far as I&#x27;m concerned,if it foams,drys,or otherwise irritates the hair \\&quot;like\\&quot; a sulfate does,then its just as bad.Sodium Laurel Sulfoacetate may be a better alternative to Sodium Laurel/Laureth Sulfate,but it STILL foams,which means that it is still stripping the hair of its natural &amp; essential oils.Now,I bought Kiss My Face Whenever Shampoo, Value Size, 32 Ounce since it was the best value I could find for the right amount of money.Then do sell it in a smaller size here on Amazon,but this will last much longer,since I don&#x27;t really wash my hair that much.The price of this shampoo is kind of expensive,as are most organic products,which really bothers me.The size of this shampoo is very nice,so I guess that I can say that its worth it.So,if your have dry,irritated,chemically treated or otherwise hair that isn&#x27;t in the best condition,then this shampoo is just what you need.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing!! Makes my hair so shiny, clean, and smooth. Love the smell too. Lathers so much more than other similar products without the use of SLS. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is so refreshing and light- it smells like a lime margarita almost. I&#x27;m hooked. The argan oil is a nice addition.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shampoo!  I wanted to get away from all the toxic products in my health-care items and this shampoo has been a true winner.  I don&#x27;t need to shampoo my hair every day now since I&#x27;ve started using it, but if I want to--it&#x27;s still gentle enough that I can and quite often do.  I simply love it!</li>
            <li> I like the idea/philosophy of Kiss My Face products, and size of this with the pump, so I thought I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up not liking it at all, and basically disposing of it.&lt;br /&gt;Why? It took 5-6 pumps to create a lather, and it left my hair really awful looking after styling. It had no life in it, and sometimes looked not clean.&lt;br /&gt;I have normal hair, very fine in texture but a lot of it.</li>
            <li> I really like how this stuff makes my hair feel. My wife got this for herself, but I used it when I ran out of my shampoo, and now it&#x27;s all EITHER of us use. I work at a pulp and paper mill. If anyone knows how they smell, you can imagine trying to get that smell off your body and out of your hair. This stuff does it. I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair four times like before, KMF gets it clean the first wash.</li>
            <li> This is my every-day shampoo, and nothing could be better than having it delivered at a good price.  Delivered clean, and not all sticky products are.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how much I liked this and the conditioner. Not crazy about citrus scents but it does great with wild and curly hair.</li>
            <li> Recently I started using only natural cosmetic products, after learning about how harmful harsh chemicals found in most beauty products can be. This is a great all-natural shampoo, filled with earthly ingredients that I can pronounce. I have thin hair but a lot of it, as well as oily skin, so my hair gets weighed down and oily pretty easily. I&#x27;m happy to say that this cleans my hair very well and does not weigh my hair down one bit. As others have said, it smells like lime jello, which isn&#x27;t my favorite scent but it does smell good. I can&#x27;t smell it on my hair during the day at all, so don&#x27;t let the smell deter you from this shampoo. The only real &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; about this, which isn&#x27;t much, is that I NEED to use a conditioner with this, because if I don&#x27;t my hair ends up very, very tangled: that is partially the nature of my hair anyway, though. I use Nature&#x27;s Gate Organics Mandarin Orange and Patchouli conditioner with it and my hair always looks clean, feels soft, and has as much volume as I could expect. 32 ounces at this price is a great deal, especially for a product as natural as this. I think it will last me a long time!</li>
            <li> First five ingredients of previous shipments of Kiss My Face Whenever Shampoo (clear bottle):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Organic Aloe Barbadensis&lt;br /&gt;2. Organic Rosemary Leaf Extract&lt;br /&gt;3. Organic Chamomile Flower Extract&lt;br /&gt;4. Organic Lemon Balm Leaf Extract&lt;br /&gt;5. Organic Nettle Leaf Extract&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First five ingredients of 10/5/13 shipment of Kiss My Face Whenever Shampoo (white bottle):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Water&lt;br /&gt;2. C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate&lt;br /&gt;3. Salt&lt;br /&gt;4. Cocamidopropyl Betaine&lt;br /&gt;5. Glycerin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Same product, new formula. They also removed their claim of &amp;#34;no preservatives.&amp;#34; Enjoy.</li>
            <li> I love the lime citrus smell of the shampoo.  It takes a lot to lather good, but even when you don&#x27;t use a lot and just get a small lather it cleans well.  Glad to have something natural to use on my hair and get rid of those chemicals in store brands.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this shampoo.  It leaves her very thick, long hair feeling clean, soft and and manageable.  She&#x27;s tried a number of products and this one has really impressed her.</li>
            <li> We switched to this shampoo for organic lavenders because it has a better rating for allergenic concerns.  For whatever reason, the smell of this shampoo reminds me of lemon cake, which I happen to love.  I don&#x27;t notice the smell after showering, and it leaves my hair feeling adequately clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had issues with the durability of the pump which has broken before.</li>
            <li> I started using this shampoo when I realized I was allergic to SLS(Sodium Laureth Sulfate) and it was affecting me in a big way.  It immediately brought relief to my skin and to my surprise, cleans my hair so much better than non-natural shampoo ever did!  I love the smell, too.  Since then, my entire family has switched over to this shampoo(THEIR choice) and we all love it!  This is a good size, too, and the pump is nice for the shower.  Very pleased with this shampoo.  I also have the conditioner, and we love it, as well.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  It smells great and really gets my hair clean.  It might be too strong for color treated hair or dry hair.  I have oily hair and use it daily.</li>
            <li> A lot of sulfate free shampoo tend to leave my hair feeling greasy but this is not the case with this shampoo. My hair feels very silky and clean. It also smells pretty great, but the scent is subtle. I would recommend using a nice thick conditioner with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people have complained about the lather of this product but that is a problem with any sulfate free shampoo. What works for me is making sure that my hair is soaking wet, not damp, when I apply the shampoo. I have thick and long hair so I will do a pre-wash with one pump of shampoo, lightly rinse, and then add another 2 pumps and re-lather. This really helps get a nice lather without having to use a ton of shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have finished this bottle, finally! I still love it and I received my second bottle through Amazon Subscribe &amp; Save. I RARELY immediately re-purchase a product but Kiss My Face Whenever Shampoo is awesome! I love it and my hair loves it too. I could see myself sicking with it for quite some time. :)</li>
            <li> My wife is always picky about what shampoo to use. Decided to give Kiss My Face a try, since most of the shampoos she buys are over $30.00 for 32 ounces or less. She liked it, and we put it on Subscribe, and save. The scent, the texture, and the look of the hair after shampooing is awesome. A strange name for a shampoo though.</li>
            <li> Excellent gentle, natural shampoo...and we also use it as a body wash. Clean, soothing fragrance. Lots of product for the price. Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This did nothing special for my hair, so I&#x27;m going to use it when washing my dog. I liked that it was cruelty/paraben free, and that&#x27;s what i always use on my pets, so I&#x27;ll save it for her.</li>
            <li> my favorite shampoo of all time.&lt;br /&gt;living in florida and gardening constantly, i need to wash my hair every day.  this is a gentle cleaner with great lather, great smell and easy on the pocketbook to boot.&lt;br /&gt;my daughter sells bumble &amp; bumble at her salon so i have access to the best shampoos but truthfully, i love this one the best of all.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for a person who has scalp issues at times my hair and scalp can vary from dry to oily and this allows me to wash my  hair as needed to keep the stink low and my hair shiny clean. Smells great, this is a new formula and I find it cleans better then the old. Just FYI- massage in really well and leave in for a few minutes its natural so it takes longer to work but its worth the extra time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have curly fine hair.</li>
            <li> Have been using this brand for years and have loved it. Either they&#x27;ve recently changed their formula or this was counterfeit. Very watery with kind of a slippery feel to it -- like it was mainly glycerin -- and it didn&#x27;t do much as far as cleaning our hair. I&#x27;m about to buy a bottle in a local supermarket -- at least then I&#x27;ll know whether what I bought here was counterfeit or whether I now need to find a new brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product a week now, I love the name ;-) so does my boyfriend but honestly I&#x27;m not completely impressed with it.  Maybe it will grow on me? But here&#x27;s the skinny:&lt;br /&gt;What I DO like:&lt;br /&gt;1. Smells nice, soft, mild lime scent overall&lt;br /&gt;2. Good price for the quantity and quality&lt;br /&gt;3. Natural ingredients&lt;br /&gt;4. Makes my hair soft and smell good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like&lt;br /&gt;1. Doesn&#x27;t lather that great&lt;br /&gt;2. Doesn&#x27;t really make my hair look that great - as in how I *think* it looks great, meaning bouncy and full - it&#x27;s good for anyone who WANTS their hair to be more smooth and not as full - my hair does look nice - but I think I might actually want more of a \\&quot;full body\\&quot; shampoo because my hair is fine - I have a lot of it but it&#x27;s fine, a bit coarse and medium lenght.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line? I&#x27;m using it! But decided to buy my favorite (with chemicals unfortunately) Herbal Essences Body Envy Volumizing Shampoo and add just a bit of that too it.  That way I get to still use this with less chemicals but get that bit of body I like from my Body Envy shampoo.</li>
            <li> After researching the side effects of chemicals such as sulfates (commonly found in most commercial shampoos and other products), parabens, phthalates, and artificial fragrances, I decided I needed to get some natural shampoo. I tried making my own and I wasn&#x27;t successful in doing so. You have to make sure your shampoo has the right pH-balance, and I wasn&#x27;t successful in getting the right balance. So I decided to do some more research on the best natural shampoo products, and came across Kiss My Face, which is a brand I&#x27;m familiar with because I had already used their deodorant and lip balm. The bottle is huge and is really a great value. I like the shampoo, it lathers pretty good despite being SLS-free (which I don&#x27;t really care about the lather anyways). I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought it &#x27;cause the bottle is big and it was subscribe and save eligible. I decided to try and.. miracle happened. I liked the fresh scent and ESPECIALLY I loved how my hair look and feel after this production. During last many months I couldn&#x27;t find the shampoo for myself. All of them left my hair looking strange - though - it had always been soft and silky before. I&#x27;m happy with the purchase, guys, my special thanks to the manufacturers))</li>
            <li> It smells good, lathers well, leaves my hair soft. The pump is a bit tricky, but that&#x27;s okay. It&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this for about two years and we love it.  Priced reasonably and has no harmful ingredients.  Smells great!  KISS MY FACE brand anything is wonderful.</li>
            <li> This was bought for my 8 year-old daughter and it works very well with her long, fine hair. It smells lovely and does not dry out her hair the way some other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoos have. The grocery store near our house sells the shampoo and conditioner in far smaller bottles for ten dollars per bottle. Purchasing it in these bulk bottles is so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> When I received this the lid was not screwed on tight, and the shampoo had spilled out onto the box.  Poor packaging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been experimenting with sulfate-free shampoos, &amp; ordered this one because it had the best reviews, as far as I could see. I love the scent &amp; the softness it gave my hair, but darned if it didn&#x27;t make my scalp itch. Well, it&#x27;s not unusual for me to have the one-in-a-million reaction. My husband, who has different scalp issues than me, loves this shampoo. I actually had better luck with the Aveeno sulfate-free shampoo, which had lower ratings. Go figure. No regrets, though!</li>
            <li> I gave this one star because I used to use the old KMF Whenever shampoo formula before they decided to change it. I loved the way it worked and it was the only thing that worked for my hair. I wish they&#x27;d just go back to their old formula. Also, the cap came slightly off when it was being shipped and I lost some of it. All around disappointment.</li>
            <li> Its all natural.... which sometimes correlates to very ineffective cleaning.  I have used other Country Life products that are all natural that leave hair clean....this one takes 3-4 tries to equal one cleaning of other types...it could be my hair, so YMMV.</li>
            <li> i am really enjoying this product. the scent is very refreshing to me. leaves my hair clean. very nice vegan product.</li>
            <li> Great smell, but did not work for my thick hair. It ended up tangling my hair. I used it in conjunction with the conditioner and both left my hair dry.</li>
            <li> my wife had started developing rashes from time to which we wondered if it was caused by developing allergies to common brand name shampoo and conditioners.  This stuff has no sulfates so when it all cleared up for her we got our answer.  she loves the smell and the way her hair feels in terms of clean.  The hair does not appear quite as soft over all from the conditioner but is definitely healthier.  Great product with reccomend.</li>
            <li> The product is good, but the packaging was poor. The package arrived with a lot of product spilled on the inside of the box. The conditioner was better than the shampoo... for some reason, the shampoo did not ladder as well as I anticipated. Will keep looking for an organic shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I regularly buy this shampoo, in this size, along with the matching conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I love this shampoo, the ingredients - and I love the company!&lt;br /&gt;Also - a big reason that I continue to purchase this 32-oz size is that it costs less in&lt;br /&gt;the long run.  Also, this company is cruelty-free and this is HUGE to me.&lt;br /&gt;AND I LOVE THE SEE-THROUGH BOTTLES!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and shampoo tends to leave it dry, but this shampoo leaves it soft and shiny. I no longer feel like I need to condition every day to restore moisture to my hair. I find the smell mild and pleasant, and with the pump I can control the amount I get out better so I don&#x27;t waste shampoo. Oh, and it lathers really well.</li>
            <li> Kiss my face whenever shampoo green tea and lime was a smart purchase. Hair smells nice and is clean and whiney after using. Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo, ever.  The scent is divine and I use it everyday.  My stylist commends the health of my hair... I most definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I have an incredibly sensitive scalp.  I researched shampoos trying to find one that had no ingredients that are known to irritate skin, and no ingredients that have ever shown up in human blood tests.  This shampoo meets my incredibly high standards and smells like lime sherbet.  My husband uses it too.  Sometimes I even use it as body wash.  At first this shampoo was a little drying, but they added Moroccan Argan Oil to it, and now it is wonderful!  I have very long, curly, very dry hair.  I do not use the companion conditioner, but instead use Giovanni Smooth as Silk Deeper Moisture conditioner on my incredibly dry hair.</li>
            <li> Discusting, new formula is horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their shampoo in the green bottle was the best I tried, along with their old formula conditioner. My hair felt so nurtured, gently cleaned, and oh so soft! By the time I realize how amazing it was and went ahead to order a large bottle, instead of the green I received a white bottle. Assuming it was just a bottle color change, I went to using it, but was disaapointed that I couldn&#x27;t get that same feeling of clean nurtured soft hair. Once I realized what they have done, I cannot wait until I run out of it.  The current shampoo is so bad I might just use it as a hand soap, my hair hates the new formula, gross. Shame!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great! I get sufficient suds if my hair is wet enough.  I also use this on my children!  It is free of many chemicals and yucky stuff that I wouldn&#x27;t want to use on my family&#x27;s skin!  It also smells fresh and wonderful!</li>
            <li> The pump for this large bottle doesn&#x27;t work well. I need more than one pump to get enough shampoo, but the mechanism takes a while to fill up for a second pump.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know if it was the shampoo or conditioner that did this to my hair, but this stuff left my hair fried!  I washed as usual, put my hair in a towel as usual, and when I took the towel off the ends of my hair were kinked and felt like straw.  Some even broke off.  I washed twice with this brand shampoo and conditioner (to make sure this was indeed the culprit), and the same thing happened both times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying to find a good organic shampoo/conditioner and this was (surprisingly) horrible for my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo I have ever found that doesn&#x27;t make my scalp a flaky mess. No SLS! I have an allergy to SLS and quit using shampoo and toothpaste with SLS, and have been much better off. Use it every day.</li>
            <li> Let me say first and foremost that I do like that this is a cruelty free product.  However, the product itself leaves much to be desired.  It is watery, doesn&#x27;t suds up nice and leaves my hair very dry and oily looking.  I currently have it mixed with another product just until I can use it up, but after that I will not be buying it again.</li>
            <li> like the product but don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li> Formula has changed. The old formula was amazing for my hair and I would have bought a million bottles of it if I&#x27;d known it was soon to change. It made my hair really shiny and somehow my hair never got greasy by the end of the day like it does with other shampoos. The new formula is just okay, no better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried in this price range.</li>
            <li> I know there are comments on here about an old formulation, but I purchased this when only the current formulation has been available.  I absolutely LOVE this product.  I use it in conjunction with the conditioner, and it is unbeatable.  I have tried a lot of different products in trying to get away from the &amp;#34;paraben&amp;#34; products, and this product is definintely the winner.  The price is great, my hair feels clean, what more could I ask for? More scents, perhaps!</li>
            <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t produce a rich lather like Panteen does, but it is great shampoo. It is also a little runnier, but also not a major concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for its natural cleaning with no chemicals. I use a few pumps and it rinses clean with only one shot.</li>
            <li> i love the smell of this shampoo! it is a great shampoo!</li>
            <li> Love the scent, love the price and the size is perfect.  I would highly recommend.  Takes a little more than regular shampoo to get my hair clean but eh my hair runs oily so it&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo. I have been using it for about 5 years and I can tell such a difference with this shampoo over others. There are no sulfates, which I love, and I also appreciate the organic compounds in this product which offer almost a medicinal quality to it for itchy or dandruffy scalps.  The smell is amazing to me as well. I normally buy the 11 oz bottle, but this time I wanted to make sure I wouldn&#x27;t run out any time soon so invested in the 32 oz bottle which should last a long time. Love, love, love this shampoo!</li>
            <li> I have used this for about 3 weeks, my hair is not as dry and it actually has some shine. Understand I have hair that is thinning and has a tendency to be a little fuzzy. Not anymore, now if only you could get the conditioner, my hair would look like it did before kids.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t act like a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoo -- because it isn&#x27;t. Take a look at the ingredients. I thought this would be gentle on my fine hair (man) like other natural shampoos but it&#x27;s ended up drying out and making my hair frizzy for the first time in my life. Purchased this not really doing any background research, just trusted the Kiss My Face brand to some extent.  But I guess I can&#x27;t do that anymore.  Do yourself a favor and do a cursory search and learn about C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, the primary detergent of this shampoo. Not really a gentle cleansing agent. And the third ingredient is salt?? Huh?</li>
            <li> Smell is alright, the ingredients are decent. Good price overall for a large amount of poo. The bottle is good quality as well.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this shampoo, that&#x27;s my favorite part. But (and maybe that&#x27;s because it is a more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoo), I feel like I have to use it everyday for my hair to smell good and look clean. Also, the pushing mechanism to get the shampoo out is not super practical. I would buy again from Kiss My Face, but I&#x27;ll try a different type.</li>
            <li> This shampoo lathers up so nicely.  The scent is great and I love it at home and at the pool where I swim.  A very nice product that I like as well as my Alba shampoo.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Will continue to buy this in the future. Kiss My Face products are the best!! A safe product also, which is a must.</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo, good lather and leaves hair feeling clean with more body.</li>
            <li> I love that it has very few chemicals, it smells nice, I love the price, and it lathers well for a natural shampoo. But it makes my head very itchy and dandruffy. My husband and daughter are experiencing the same thing. So decent product, but not for us.</li>
            <li> Not only does this stuff smell terrible but it left my hair rough dry abd frizzy. My hair is normallysmooth shiny soft abs healthy but after this it was completely terrible and it never washed out my hair would be left hard and clumpy</li>
            <li> This quality of this product didn&#x27;t match the reviews. My daughter (17) used this and it dried out her hair and left it dull. Tossed it out, it was half full, so used it long enough to see the results weren&#x27;t at all spectacular. She&#x27;s since moved on to OGX cherry blossom ginseng shampoo. After 1 wash, the shine had come back. #hydration #shine</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shampoo. I&#x27;ve been using natural shampoos for about 3 years now, so I&#x27;ve tried a good amount. None have come even close to how this leaves my hair. Clean and bouncy!! I see there are lots of complaints about the formula changing, but I never used the old one...and it&#x27;s still natural. And not expensive. It&#x27;s seriously worth checking out. I&#x27;m do glad I did.</li>
            <li> Smells naturally wonderful...lemongrass and tea tree essence. Clear and gentle.</li>
            <li> Lathers decently, rinses clean and does not contribute to the sticky, limp feeling I normally associate with other SLS free shampoos. A must for me as I am prone to eczema and regular shampoos made my scalp itchy, flaky and extra oily. Tried to do the baking soda/apple cider vinegar route at first, but just too inconvenient for me. Hunted and tried about 5 different brands of shampoos with no SLS in the ingredients list and thus far, this is the only one I&#x27;ve truly thought did the job as a shampoo.</li>
            <li> So I bought the 11oz bottle of this yesterday from my local Whole Foods store, as I needed it ASAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Around Christmas time, I decided that I wanted to go no-poo. It didn&#x27;t work so well. I tried it for almost 4 weeks (washing 2-3 times a week), and nothing. My hair was incredibly greasy and I had a tonne of dandruff. I had my mom go through and loosen the dandruff so that I could wash it out, and she asked me if I had poured olive oil on my head because it was soo oily. I hadn&#x27;t, that was just a month&#x27;s worth of oil built up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I used the Kiss My Face whenever shampoo on it... and it got my hair very clean and my hair feels very light as well, it&#x27;s amazing. Thumbs up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be noted, however, that if you REALLY want the sudsing (it will clean without the sudsing) your hair needs to be soaking wet... like keep-your-hair-under-running-water-until-the-soap-is-in-your-hand-wet. My hair is bottom of shoulder-blade long and I had to use a good 2 dollars in quarters (size/volume) to get it to get sudsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to use this for a month, and see what my results are then.</li>
            <li> Not sure &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34; is quite the right comment, but this has a nice fragrance, is a good price for a huge amount which will last a good while, and Miss My Face shampoo is my favorite and has been a long time.</li>
            <li> Shampoo is great, good for me and my daughter&#x27;s allergy skin,&lt;br /&gt;But the failure of the bottle head, causing my shampoo is very difficult squeezed out,&lt;br /&gt;I bought two bottles and both the same problem,&lt;br /&gt;after the pressure it will not bounce back&lt;br /&gt;i must use my  hand to pull it out.&lt;br /&gt;very disappointed,&lt;br /&gt;every day I have to head this and I bought two bottles are the same situation!&lt;br /&gt;$ 15 bottle of shampoo should not have this problem ,&lt;br /&gt;I really hope you can send me one to replace it.</li>
            <li> Used it for a year thus far.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my hair feel and smell! I never expected my husband to have a strong opinion on the hair products I buy, but I tried a different brand and he specifically requested this one again. Of course, it&#x27;s cruelty-free!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is very mild does not dry or damage hair, since I use it I have had increased hair growth, for that price and quality I highly recommend it.  Marco</li>
            <li> pump is cheaply made. Not much lather, but smells good.  Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this again</li>
            <li> Nice natural shampoo, almost all organic ingredients. Great for medium hair types. Reduces my frizz some but does not eliminate unless I use argan oil too. But great for the whole family to use if you do not have damaged hair or super oily hair.</li>
            <li> I used to purchase this shampoo before but the ingredients have changed to ones that aren&#x27;t so great for your hair so it&#x27;s almost like buying any other shampoo. I have read some other reviews and its mentioned that it doesn&#x27;t foam up like other shampoo&#x27;s but it does, probably more than others. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because if you have dry hair you should not buy this. It left my hair dry and stringy so this is more for people who have normal to oily hair. Also, the lime smell is very strong it smells like someone cut open a 100 limes so if you&#x27;re not that into citrusy smells this might not be for you.</li>
            <li> we needed a shampoo that has a lot of scent in it that you feel the fragrence after bath but its almost none i think.</li>
            <li> I order every 6 weeks! We use as body wash too! Awesome and I have oily hair so I love it!! Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy...</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. I was looking for a less chemical laden alternative and tried this. I love it. You have to get accustomed to the lesser sudsy-ness, but once you do that you&#x27;ll never go back. I highly recommend lather, rinse, lather again for the best result. My hair is clean, soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> This was a great product a few years ago.  I bought two of these huge containers and 2.5 years later I needed a new one.  I discovered that the EXACT same item is 100% a different product.  Now all the natural ingredients are in smaller percentages and it now has sulfates for foaming.  In other words this is a standard cheap shampoo that smells similar to the original.</li>
            <li> We switched all of our personal/hygiene products last year to more natural and cruelty-free, and tried a few shampoos that were either pricey or didn&#x27;t work that well (or both!). After trying this Kiss My Face shampoo and conditioner, my husband and I were hooked!</li>
            <li> It is really too bad.  I have used products from this company for years.  I recently became aware of the palm oil crisis and decided to stop buying anything containing palm oil (no easy task).  I was looking forward to using it.  I sincerely hope this company reconsiders the formula.</li>
            <li> My personal favorite shampoo. Has the least harmful stuff in it without being outrageously expensive. Leaves your hair smelling really good.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell and how squeaky clean my hair was after using this. However, it completely stripped the color from my hair in a matter of about 6 shampoos and left it feeling pretty dry (even paired with the conditioner). I chose not to send it back, but to keep and use as a sulfate free body wash!</li>
            <li> Really feels good on my hair and no horrible chemicals to worry about.</li>
            <li> Loved everything but the scent! It made my hair look and feel good.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting. Really did not see a different between this and cheap, regular shampoo? It did last a while, though. Really looking for an Organic shampoo that won&#x27;t strip out color and doesnt cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo because of the reasonable cost and it&#x27;s earth friendly approach. It does make my hair feel squeaky clean the only complaint I have it that it does not lather well. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s because of the ingredients and most lathering agents are not green. I could get a pretty good lather with a lot of product but in that instance it would make me wonder if the shampoo is just heavily diluted. I have purchased both the shampoo and conditioner and my shampoo has gone down a lot faster than my conditioner has for the reason that I feel I need to use A LOT more to achieve a good washing. For now I&#x27;m debating whether or not I will purchase again. Might&#x27;ve been just a bad batch.</li>
            <li> I have straight, thin, normal hair and have developed topical allergies to fragrances and chemicals. This product&#x27;s use of more natural ingredients and lack of parabens compared to other shampoos seemed like a good choice for me. However, after using it, my hair has become dry and tangled. Brushing out the tangles has left me with considerably less hair.&lt;br /&gt;On a good note, the shampoo does clean my hair well and smells very refreshing. You will need to use more of the product compared to sulfate shampoos as it does not lather as readily. I do like that my flaking scalp (cause by other products) is now much healthier.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this shampoo is ok, but I do not anticipate purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this shampoo because is supposed to be more natural and all that, but, unfortunately it makes my hair feel straw-like.  I don&#x27;t hate it because it does smell good and it probably is really cleaning my hair but the final effect on my hair is not what I desired.</li>
            <li> Sulfates just really irritate my scalp - have gone for years wondering what was wrong that made my scalp itch and burn.  Also, I have curly hair, but it just seemed to keep fighting me! I bought the top of the line salon shampoos for years, and my hair was always dry dry dry - but oily at the scalp.  FINALLY, I discovered this low sulfate shampoo!  Instant relief for my scalp and my hair has never looked better! It&#x27;s so shiny and soft and the curls are perfect!  It doesn&#x27;t strip my hair like other shampoos - however I can feel how clean it is.  I ALWAYS use it with the Whenever Conditioner, and sometimes I don&#x27;t rinse all the conditioner out - it isn&#x27;t heavy and it makes my curls even better.  It doesn&#x27;t lather like alot of shampoos, but it does CLEAN.  Dont be fooled by the suds!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair squeaky clean and has a pleasant scent. Nothing fancy.  I think it&#x27;s a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> This product smells wonderful however after 2 months my hair was dry, tangled, and my scalp itched. I would not recommend this product. It is cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the shampoo and conditioner are WONDERFUL!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many over the years and this is by far the best, along with SebaMed shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using it for the last 3+ years now.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! I used to buy this shampoo at my local WalMart, but they only sell it in small 7oz bottles. Once I tried it, I knew this was a keeper. It has no LSL, I couldn&#x27;t find any bad ingredients in it. It smells great and works well for my hair. I have blonde hair on top and black hair on the bottom and it does not strip my black hair of color and doesn&#x27;t dry out my blonde hair. I love this convenient size and bottle&#x27;s pump is very convenient. I shopped around and as always Amazon had the best deal, and the shipping was really fast, 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I have oily hair, which means the only time I get the sqeaky clean feeling after rinse is if I use harsh or clarifying shampoo. The problem is, while that left my scalp feeling clean, my hair gets really dry and frail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo cleans well. When messaged into the hair, using your normal amount WILL leave your hair very clean even if it doesn&#x27;t foam. You need to use twice the amount for the sud/foam action of normal shampoos. When I rinse, I can feel my hair being sqeaky clean, which usually translate to dry/frail/easily tangled hair when my hair drys. Nope, it feels smooth, soft and manageable when dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it does a good job of cleaning, even on oily hairs, but it only foam/sud half as much as normal shampoos but is organic and good for you. Oh right, the scent, it smells like lemonade with a hint of verbena to me. Pleasant, but a tiny tiny bit sweet.</li>
            <li> My entire family uses this shampoo. It leaves the hair very soft and shiny. The majority of the ingredients are organic. Which is much healthier than shampoo regularly used. This product did not contain hydrogenated oils which other Kiss my Face shampoos did contain. But it seems they changed the formula, which means I will continue to buy it. Smells awesome, my whole family loves the smell. I have used it for about a year and continue to love how it leaves my hair feeling.</li>
            <li> I have long, average-thickness hair and use almost no products of any sort. This works great for my every-other-day-or-so shampoo routine. It does not lather a whole lot so I would be hesitant to recommend it to someone with thick hair, people who use a lot of product and thus might have more build-up to remove, or those who are looking to use it after strenuous exercise/sweating. Not that it wouldn&#x27;t work in those instances, but you would probably end up using so much that it wouldn&#x27;t be worth the trade-off. Great for everyday use for \\&quot;everyday\\&quot; hair, though! Smells nice but not at all overpowering. My hair feels clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> Smells really nice, and is cruelty-free.  However, the bottle leaked in its shipping package and box.  I contacted Amazon and they sent a replacement out right away.</li>
            <li> Updated review:  After using this for about a month, I am sad to report that my hair is very dried out, and my hair is damaged and broken.  I have thin hair - I don&#x27;t recommend it for thin hair!  I would give it one star considering how bad my hair looks now, but I could see myself using it once a month later on to get a good cleansing - so it gets 3 stars.      Previous review:  I like this a lot for natural shampoo.  I have been searching for something natural that actually cleans my hair instead of making it greasy.  It also keeps my hair from being too wavy.</li>
            <li> I try to find vegetarian products whenever possible and like this shampoo, anyway. Local Whole Foods does not carry this size and driving to another town is not really economical. The pump is useful, too.</li>
            <li> Shampoo was great.  Bottle came broken, wasn&#x27;t able to use the pump function.  Would purchase again, disappointed by the shampoo leakage and poor packaging.</li>
            <li> I am trying to find products that are more natural and decrease the amount of chemicals in my beauty routine. This shampoo is somewhat affordable and it works good. I first tried the big body but I wasn&#x27;t willing to pay that much for such a small bottle so I found these bigger bottles. I like the shampoo it smells like a lime margarita. But the conditioner doesn&#x27;t condition my hair well.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel really clean which is hard to find in the first place!I have and will still recommend this to friends and family!!</li>
            <li> This product smells really good and I love that it hardly has any chemicals at all :) only thing is that I think another brand is better than this one but I still really this one.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Scored well on EWG website.  Actually lathers, unlike most other natural shampoos.  Definitely one of the better natural shampoos.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few natural shampoos and they never leave my hair feeling great. Although my hair is pretty tangled after I wash it, it gives my hair great body and has helped my dry scalp a ton!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this magnificent shampoo in the 32 Oz bottle anywhere. Paid $14.14 for the 16 oz bottle. Happy to find it here and at a great price.</li>
            <li> Going more natural recently, I researched and bought this from the favorable reviews.&lt;br /&gt;It came messy, since some leaked i packaging.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, sadly, my hair/scalp does not like this. In fact, no matter how little/much I use or how long I scrub, it feels grimey and oily, especially under my crown (and I have notoriously dry hair!).&lt;br /&gt;Back to the drawing board...</li>
            <li> I bought this because it is Sodium Laurel Sulfate free. It cleans my hair, and doesn&#x27;t add chemicals that are harmful. For a full head of lather, I suggest lots of water in your hair before you apply it.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty large bottle and lasted my family almost 2 months the last time I bought it (3 people). I like the fact that the ingredients are safer to use than other products and it smells good too and cleans my hair really well which tends to get greasy really fast because I have really thin hair and a naturally greasy scalp, but this shampoo works well for me and my kids who both have completely different hair than me.</li>
            <li> I have highlighted hair and am into chemical free type products.  This met the criteria for less chemicals so I decided to give it a try.  The smell is great and is refreshing.  The lathering is okay.  My issues is I have very fine/thin hair and it leaves me greasy by the end of the day.  It is as if it doesn&#x27;t clean enough even though I use a lot on my hair.</li>
            <li> Just in case you aren&#x27;t familiar with products that do not include some toxic substances in their products, it is normal for it to not suds up like the common shampoos. The very ingredients that are toxic to our bodies, are the ones that make a shampoo slide around your head, and suds up easily. So, don&#x27;t think of the opposite happening as a bad thing. The secret is to make sure your hair is dripping wet, and then immediately apply the shampoo, and work it around quickly. This is a great shampoo! It has a nice lite smell, and leaves my hair feeling great. And knowing that I haven&#x27;t doused my body with a bunch of harmful chemicals makes me feel good.</li>
            <li> Kiss my Face whenever shampoo leaves my hair feeling clean and light.  Not covered with a film.  I will only use this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Works great for a dandruff condition</li>
            <li> Love it!  Can&#x27;t recommend it enough!  It smells great and makes your hair feel silky smooth.  All natural!  You can&#x27;t ask for more.  I am giving this together with the conditioner to all my family members as Christmas gifts.  I have to share it and spread the word!</li>
            <li> I read someone review of another product - which they did not like so much.  They had mentioned the Kiss My Face products (specifically the shampoo and conditioner) - stating all of its benefits.  Glad I did some research on them and decided to order them.  The Kiss My Face line is excellent.  The other thing is that if your hair is longer than shoulder length, you will end up using a bit more of the product.  But it is worth it, since my hair is now softer, thicker looking, and am losing 75% less hair each time I shower than I used to.</li>
            <li> I used \\&quot;Yes to Carrots\\&quot; shampoo and body wash for several years now. I simply wanted to use something different, change things up. I have used Kiss my Face brand before and I liked it ok. However, I have not used shampoo. I like the way it was packaged, as value size with a pump. However, I had to use quite a bit of it to wash my hair. I know that it because it doesn&#x27;t have all the \\&quot;bad\\&quot; stuff in it so it doesn&#x27;t foam up like regular shampoos. However, I still used it at much faster rate than I used \\&quot;Yes to Carrots\\&quot; which is also free of bad chemicals. My hair also started feeling dry. I didn&#x27;t like that it doesn&#x27;t have any scent. I probably won&#x27;t buy it again, I think I am going back to my \\&quot;Yes to Carrots\\&quot; or \\&quot;Yes to Tomatoes\\&quot; brand, those really are awesome.</li>
            <li> It has kind of a funny smell but it goes away quickly and it does a good job of cleaning. It also lathers really well. I also have highlighted hair and I have not noticed any problems with it drying out my hair.</li>
            <li> good but looks like a soap bottle.. guess that stay in the house thought it was bodywash... wasted it</li>
            <li> I used to buy this all the time. But they&#x27;ve changed their formula (new white bottles). Not only new downgrade regarding their formula. Also, it appears, it&#x27;s &amp;#34;cruelty free&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;no animal ingredients&amp;#34;, BUT it doesn&#x27;t say anymore NO ANIMAL TESTING - ??? Not gonna buy anymore, there are brands that don&#x27;t suddenly change their values and the value of the product altogether.</li>
            <li> Love the pump -- easy to use in the shower -- not overly sudsy -- cleans well. I also love the safe, organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes my hair feel clean and smell good and also comes in an easy to use dispenserI love the animal and environmentally friendly products!</li>
            <li> Good Value.  Doesnt lather well, but smells great, does the job, would buy again!  I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a organic shampoo</li>
            <li> A very clean ingredient list and excellent natural smell of lime.  Not harsh and can use every day.  My current all time favorite.</li>
            <li> Clean and fresh smelling!  Great price point and good to the environment, too. I keep this stocked and have given it as a gift to friends to try and the feedback is great--it&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I hope it never discontinues!!! Leaves my hair nice and clean without that &amp;#34;left over&amp;#34; oily feeling, I have a sensitive scalp and can&#x27;t use any fragrance in any shampoo, so this one (naturally scented and smell last for half a day) is ideal. I like to buy in bulk so the 32oz was perfect!</li>
            <li> this shampoo lathers well and rinses clean - my hair looks healthy and people ask me what shampoo I use</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  It leaves my hair feeling clean and soft without weighting it down.  I took one star off because the bottle is a bit large for my tastes and the pump doesn&#x27;t work all that well with the viscosity of the shampoo (the same pump for the companion conditioner works great) so it&#x27;s hard to pump enough shampoo for long hair.  Despite having no Sodium Laureth Sulfate, the shampoo foams very nicely.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product. I&#x27;m replacing the aveeno shampoo with the green label. Smells great and lathers extremely well. I have city water and need half a squirt. I have thin, fine, hair and this weighs my hair down just a little. Has totally got rid of my static / frizz issues tho. I&#x27;d reccomend for an affordable option. There&#x27;s better out there, but this is a good everyday option for multiple hair types.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s all natural ingredients, which merits the one star.  However, after a week or so of using this product, my scalp started itching like crazy!  As soon as I stopped using it, no itchy scalp.  I&#x27;m really disappointed.  I will use it once a week or 2 weeks so I haven&#x27;t completely wasted my money!</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff.  You need to get your hair really wet when applying this to make it lather nice.  That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s not a nasty detergent style soap but a more natural healthy one. You&#x27;ll love the smell.  It&#x27;s not thin like a lot of the more healthy shampoos BUT it&#x27;s not super concentrated or thick either.  On that scale it lands somewhere in the middle.  I&#x27;m still seeking the perfect healthy shampoo that isn&#x27;t insanely priced. Until then there is this one.  I&#x27;ve used it a couple years now.  It gets my hair really clean &amp; shiny.  It&#x27;s a budget buy at this size.  I just wish they would go 100% organic/healthy &amp; give it to us in twice this concentration.  I&#x27;d pay a bit more for that for sure.  Like a considerable bit more.  The conditioner that goes with this shampoo is really nice at detangling &amp; conditioning which is hard to find in a safe healthy product.  I suggest getting the set because you save money, the smell is great, you get the type of hair experience you would have gotten from the name brand traditional chemical laden products we used to all use. All the other brands I&#x27;ve tried make you sacrifice lather, detangling, smoothness or cleansing ability for being safe &amp; healthy.  This brand hasn&#x27;t done that.</li>
            <li> I like the scent but this is surprisingly drying, so I only use very occasionally and will not repurchase. My hair is very thick, coarse and dry, however</li>
            <li> My son and I use this product and it works great on our scalp and hair.  I recommend to all.</li>
            <li> Excellent buy.  Shampoo leaves my hair clean and the lime scent is pleasant.</li>
            <li> The whole family uses this. We all live it and it lasts forever!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Lathers and cleans well, doesn&#x27;t really smell strong and lasts long. Everyone in the family can use it</li>
            <li> Pump is a piece of crap and doesn&#x27;t work well. Doesn&#x27;t really matter if the shampoo is good if you can&#x27;t get it out of the bottle!</li>
            <li> It was a Gift to my Friend/Son.&lt;br /&gt;He loved it when he used it the next day. I will get him more as soon as he runs out.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was great, got it in two days with the Olive Oil soap.&lt;br /&gt;I highly Recommend the &amp;#34; Kiss my Face &amp;#34; Soap and Shampoo and I have not gotten other Kiss my Face Products.</li>
            <li> I have not tried this yet. I have just received it today and some of it, was spilled in the bag. For what I paid it was not worth sending back for another one. Not much smell to it. I will see how it works tonight.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has served it&#x27;s purpose well.  It is economically and environmentally friendly.  There is a scent to it, but it is soft and pleasant. It gets my hair clean and doesn&#x27;t require that I use a separate conditioner to keep it soft.</li>
            <li> Recently tried this product as I am trying to switch to more natural products.  I had high hopes for this shampoo but was massively disappointed.  It wasn&#x27;t able to fulfill my #1 objective - clean my hair!  The first day my hair was so oily and stringy, I was really embarrassed.  Tried it again yesterday drastically increasing the amount I used and really taking the time to work it into my hair.  While there was some improvement, it was still a bit stringy with no volume.  By the end of the day I felt oily again.  Wish this could work but I&#x27;m going to have to try something else.</li>
            <li> This shampoo was my favorite but they cheaped out on ingredients and there is a total difference! I&#x27;m not a fan....</li>
            <li> I am very allergic to SLS products. I bought this and after using it realized that it has olefin sulfonate. This is just as bad as SLS for skin irritation. This is a great product if you don&#x27;t have skin problems but the company should let the public know this could be a problem. I have used several of the kiss my face products and have been happy. Hopes this helps other people from wasting their money.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is nice smelling, lathers well and leaves my hair and scalp feeling very good. This is my first time using this product and so far I believe I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I have long straight hair, fine texture but have problem with volume. I cannot use the typical shampoo sold in supermarket/drug store because they either left my hair oily, cause acne/bump around my head and back, or cause dandruff or flake on scalp.  So, I&#x27;m very picky in choosing my hair care. Plus I tried to avoid Paraben and SLS or other toxic chemicals shampoo.  After the first use of kiss me whenever shampoo, if gave my hair silky and clean feeling.  it&#x27;s not lathered so well as typical shampoo, but if you apply on very wet hair, it does help a lot. The shampoo is easy to rinse off and you can feel it clean ..does not leave the residue on your hair. I order both shampoo and conditioner, I can see that my hair end that is dried and split look more healthy and softer. My hair has look more volumized too. So, I would recommend this product to try. It may work for your hair like it did to mine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Kiss My Face products before, but, when I saw the &#x27;value size&#x27; and the price, I grabbed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I read some of the reviews.  Dries hair?  I was very anxious because I color my hair because of the white (not grey!) growing in.  The color process that I use is excellent, bought here on Amazon.  It left my hair soft and silky, much better than a box color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I was terrified of using this shampoo.  I finally took the jump, and my hair is clean, soft, silky, thick, curly, manageable.  It&#x27;s still a bit frizzy, which comes naturally with curly hair, but it&#x27;s always had a tendency to be frizzy.  I use a small bit of coconut oil and smooth it over my hair.  No more frizzies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the need to use more because it doesn&#x27;t lather, it&#x27;s not supposed to lather like other shampoos.  The main ingredient that makes shampoo lather is sodium laurel sulfate, which is very drying, and it&#x27;s almost impossible to get all the &#x27;bubbles&#x27; rinsed from your hair.  I don&#x27;t pump the shampoo into my hands; rather, I pump it directly on my scalp - a small one of each side, two for the top, three for the back.  I&#x27;ve found this is a much better way to get the shampoo to the scalp, where you need it.  I work that into my scalp, and I can feel the shampoo in my hair.  If you massage your scalp when you hair is went, it feels much differently than when you massage the shampoo into your scalp.  The shampoo will dissipate rather quickly, but it thoroughly cleans your entire hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone has different hair, and what works for one, may not work for someone else.  I tried a When shampoo, and it was awful for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any questions, feel free to ask.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. I am here to buy my 4th bottle of it, and one bottle lasts me about 4-5 months. I have medium-length wavy hair and a slightly oily scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest issue I saw in the reviews here is that this shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather well. Initially, I was of the same opinion, until one day I had no trouble lathering with a moderate amount of the shampoo. And then I realized that what you have to do is MAKE SURE YOUR HAIR IS VERY, VERY WET when you apply the shampoo to it. With this method, I have had no problems. Yes, I still need more of it than I did Pantene or whatever other chemical-laden stuff I used to use. But like I said, Kiss My Face lasts me a very long time and winds up being a great deal nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you found this helpful, would you please click the \\&quot;Yes\\&quot; button below this review? Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Been using this for about five years now, best ever, non toxic, no harsh chemicals, squeaky clean, I do use it twice per day.  It does not lather as much as regular shampoo, but it&#x27;s the harsh chemicals used in regular shampoos that makes the lather.</li>
            <li> I love natural products, although I don&#x27;t feel like the price should be prohibitive to buy them. This was a lot of shampoo at a great price. A very good deal.</li>
            <li> eh...smells a bit like a cleaning spray.  It works but not my favorite.  I&#x27;ve made it through the whole bottle but won&#x27;t be buying again simply for the strong scent (like a bathroom/kitchen cleaner).  The pump works great and it&#x27;s a fairly large size...those are the pros!</li>
            <li> Super gentle shampoo, great for people trying to move towards a more natural hair care. It has no sulphates, which can be very drying to hair. This bottle is huge , so it last a pretty long time if you dont wash your hair daily. However you need to use a lot of it for it to work. I usually go through at least 3 pumps each time I use it. The consistency is like aloe, its gooey and gel-like. The scent is fresh and lemony, and not too strong.  Great for low poo washes, because it doesn&#x27;t strip moisture. I mainly got this for my boyfriend because he has fine asian hair that gets greasy very fast. I think this has made a difference in how long he can go between washes because it doesn&#x27;t dry out his scalp. The scent and the packaging isn&#x27;t too girly either so its good for not just girls but the entire family .</li>
            <li> They completely changed this shampoo and now it&#x27;s nowhere near as good as it was. It does not clean my hair the way it used to. This is very disappointing because it was my favorite.</li>
            <li> The good:  Smell is decent.  Starts strong and a lot like the fruity smells kid&#x27;s products favor, but the scent mellows so its good.  Its easier on my sensitive scalp than regular shampoo, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my psoriasis hands too badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:  I like having brown hair that does not include blonde highlights.  Unfortunately this shampoo lightens my hair. Also, the pump is REALLY bad.  Unusable bad, I had to pour it into an old lotion bottle with a real pump.  Wish the company would just market it in a envelope like</li>
            <li> I purchased this on a whim but it&#x27;s great.  I have had 2 places on my scalp that itched no matter what I used or tried.  This has ceased the itch.  My hair if very long and it doesn&#x27;t require a lot of this to wash all of it.  I will be ordering more of this when the time comes.</li>
            <li> excellent product.  highly recommend. great company to deal with.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is so good and smells like heaven. It is light with citus undertones. I use about a Tablespoon and it works like a dream come true. I love my hair now and my husband is always touching it and saying how beautiful my hair is. So Now I share with him. He is very picky and loves it too!! So yummy I bought I more so I always have back up!!  100% wonderful discovery</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo primarily because I like the Kiss My Face line of natural products without extra chemicals, and I like my hair products in as large as volume as I can find. This one was priced very appropriately (I&#x27;ve only ever done better with one-off&#x27;s that make it to Marshall&#x27;s or Ross) and it&#x27;s lasted well. I enjoy the smell well enough and it does an admirable job of keeping my hair clean. Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo. It has no scary ingredients, and it works.</li>
            <li> The plastic of this bottle is very cheaply made and it cracked spilling a lot of product on my carpet. I didn&#x27;t think the quality of the shampoo itself to be especially good. I was disappointed and will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and leaves my hair feeling clean but not stripped.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo that will stay in our house. it cleans really good, our whole family enjoys it, we even use it on our 3 year old</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells great, leaves my hair looking great, and the huge bottle lasts a very long time. To top it all off, when the pump on my bottle broke, I emailed Kiss My Face customer service about it and they mailed me a new pump. I will definitely buy other products by them.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s true that this shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather as much as conventional shampoos – but lather is just an indication of harsh detergents. Less lather means healthier hair.</li>
            <li> Suds good. Smells good and it does not bother my allergies.</li>
            <li> Love how this leaves my scalp feeling--so clean!  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, and it is a great all-around shampoo.  It was shipped well, too.  No spills.</li>
            <li> As a result of the change in formula, I now have to find an alternative to this. I have used this shampoo for years with wonderful results.  I made the mistake of purchasing several bottles this last time, not realizing that the formula had completely changed! I checked out the ingredients list and found out why it smelled so horrible and have my family dandruff.  ALL NEW INGREDIENTS. No longer as healthy to use, no longer preservative free, no longer nice smelling, no longer my shampoo of choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please comment if you have found a suitable alternative for a decent price.</li>
            <li> What more can you say?  We love it!  The price is good and the brand is a tried and true brand for years now!</li>
            <li> Very good. I have allergies and this shampoo does not cause me any itching</li>
            <li> smells awful!  like chemicals.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t LOVE this shampoo I do like it and will re-order it.  I like the smell, but don&#x27;t feel like it cleans my hair as good as some other products, but it&#x27;s also not as harsh either since it&#x27;s Organic.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather up very well. ;(</li>
            <li> This is a great &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoo.  I have thick curly hair.  It works great!</li>
            <li> Not so good. Didn&#x27;t change anything for the air.</li>
            <li> delicious for the hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly looking for home products that are low in toxins and easy on the budget.  This is the best option I have found to date.  It has a very low toxicity rating and is about 30-40% cheaper than other products we&#x27;ve used, which only came in smaller, less economical sizes.  The shampoo itself seems to work well for all our hair types and has a light, pleasant smell.  We also use the Whenever Conditioner for the same reasons noted here.  An even better value when you take advantage of the Subscribe and Save option.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, I like the size, dispenser is very handy. It&#x27;s not very toxic, only 2 out of 10 by EWG, so I&#x27;m not afraid of using it on my baby</li>
            <li> Great shampoo- cleans my hair without the nasty ingredients that I don&#x27;t want absorbed into my body.  My only complaint is I have to use two pumps per wash to really get a good lather going. But I would recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have special hair needs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done some research on good quality natural beauty products and based on the information I found on the ewg.org/skindeep website I decided to give this a shot. The shampoo was supposed to be for my toddlers so I honestly didn&#x27;t care about the smell but I have to admit that it smells rather delicious. It has a very fresh and clean scent. Also I have not had any issues to get it to lather up.&lt;br /&gt;It literally leaves my kids hair squeaky clean which sometimes makes it feel like the hair is very dry so I suggest you also go get the conditioner to go with it.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I&#x27;ve had with this product is the fact that the pump bottle keeps leaking. The shampoo is running down the side of the bottle and is dripping all over the bathtub. I don&#x27;t know how much of the product essentially goes to waste but it is a shame that it does that. I think they need to rethink their design a bit or just get a plain flip open bottle.....</li>
            <li> I love it, I have a sensitive scalp, and its very hard to find a product that doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch or break out. But this smells nice and feels good on my hair and scalp. My only complaint is that in Hard water it doesn&#x27;t lather as well, But I cant fix that were I live.  I would suggest this to anyone that like natural shampoos and goods.</li>
            <li> We have been using this shampoo about a month on my daughter&#x27;s hair and it seems clean, although a bit dry.</li>
            <li> DID NOT LIKE, WAS NOT WHAT I WANTED. MAKE MY HAIR TOO DRY. BOUGHT IT BECAUSE OF REVIEWS. GAVE IT TO MY DAUGHTER TO USE, SHE DOES NOT LIKE IT EITHER. WENT BACK TO SALON AND BOUGHT EXPENSIVE ONE THAT I KNOW WILL WORK FOR ME.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is wonderful- it smells wonderful, feels wonderful, is good for you and the environment... However you may have to wash your locks twice in order to feel squeaky clean. This was no problem for me as I have really short hair- but for someone with long hair it could be an issue. I like it so much that I don&#x27;t mind the diffreence.</li>
            <li> I am working on growing my hair out and was told to use a more natural shampoo and conditioner.  I bought this because of the great price for the size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DO NOT like this product.  My hair looked aweful!  The first few uses were okay.  This shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather and the conditiner is very thin, but that didn&#x27;t bother me.  I was told that my hair needed time to adapt to the product, but the longer I used it the worse my hair got.  My hair was very oily and frizzy at the same time.  I tried shampooing multiple times and only applying the conditioner to my ends, but that didn&#x27;t help the situation at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using this product and wont use it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a huge bottle for just one user. I have had it for a good two months now and I have only gone half way through it. I like how it makes my hair and my scalp feel refresh and not dry and itchy like commercial shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have pretty bad Seborrhoeic dermatitis and my dermatologist told me that the best thing to do was to use a sensitive skin shampoo, or something with out a lot of chemicals in it, don&#x27;t brush my hair, use a comb instead, only wash my hair every 2 or 3 days, and don&#x27;t scratch.  I normally use Jason&#x27;s dandruff shampoo as it contains sulfur and that has been known to reduce the symptoms (looks like dandruff, but can be pieces a full cm in diameter, sometimes bigger).  not sure what happened there, it was working 100% for over 6 months, then I went out of town and forgot to bring it with me, I used something else for a week, and when I got back I could not get the flaking to stop, even after 60 days of exclusively using Jason&#x27;s, so I started looking for something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Paul Mitchell&#x27;s tea tree special shampoo, as tea tree oil is also supposed to help, and while it felt good tingling in my hair, and my hair was nice and clean and shiny, I had an increase in flakes, although smaller pieces and more like dandruff.  (If you have it, you know tell the difference)  Then I recently started purchasing other Kiss my Face products and so decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this large bottle of Kiss my Face as the price difference between it and the itsy-bitsy other option was too small to make much of a difference and if I liked it, I&#x27;d buy this one anyway.  Well I like it and will reorder when I run out, it is not working perfectly, and it is not as good as the initial results I had with Jason&#x27;s (makes me mad as I still think using something else ruined that for me, it was nice going for so long without any flaking even after a shower and brushing...).  but it is the best I&#x27;ve had since and I&#x27;m not going to look any farther.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just a note, if you like lather, this can do it, but it requires your hair to be VERY wet.  My hair is thick, and just a bit longer than Clark Kent&#x27;s, if water is dripping in my face with my head drenched and I use1.5 pumps of this, and I get a nice bit of froth.  with one full pump I get just a little itty bit of froth, if I don&#x27;t have enough water in my hair, I may not get any froth.</li>
            <li> Great product.  My hair feels so healthy when I use it.</li>
            <li> Shampoo is wonderful. Great smell.</li>
            <li> My child requests this shampoo by name.</li>
            <li> Good value for a natural product without a lot of chemical additives</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner work great and have a light citrus scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering. There are a few reviews out there saying the conditioner wasn&#x27;t soft or heavy enough for them, but this has not been my experience at all. I have fine, curly hair that has a tendency to get too dry. I have a hard time finding a conditioner that gives me enough moisture and frizz control without weighing down my hair. I think the conditioner is the perfect mix and I honestly love it. As for the shampoo, it does lather less than most shampoos, but that hasn&#x27;t caused any problems for me.  I&#x27;ve followed the advice in another review saying to make sure your hair is really wet all the way through before lathering up and this seems to work really well. My hair feels very clean and soft and the price is great. I&#x27;ve always used expensive salon brands, but due to being pregnant, I&#x27;m more conscious of what chemicals I&#x27;m using in my daily routines and was looking for something more natural. Whether pregnant or not, I will be using this product for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> Having finished chemo and radiation treatments I have become quite a &#x27;post cancer hippie&#x27; with regards to all of my personal products. I don&#x27;t want anything with a bunch of toxic ingredients. Once you really start looking at the ingredients list of products... well, it&#x27;s more disturbing that I ever realized. I use the EWG skindeep database and try for only products that score a 2 or below, but have a few that are 3 or 4. ([...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the shampoo and conditioner for about 4 months. This was by far one of the most difficult categories to find something that met all of my criteria AND my boyfriend was happy using. This is what we&#x27;ve settled on and I love it, but he&#x27;s not crazy about the scent. I&#x27;m not either but that&#x27;s not a big deal to either of us since it works and the scent is really only noticeable when you&#x27;re in the shower, it doesn&#x27;t linger... Of course lingering scent might be more of an issue as more of my hair grows back - LOL. I also agree with a previous reviewer about making sure your hair is VERY WET - it really does help with the lathering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After MUCH research, trial and error - the natural beauty products I have happily settled on that are&lt;br /&gt;1)Low in toxic ingredients&lt;br /&gt;2)Still quality products that work well and&lt;br /&gt;3)Readily available on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001GIOV8M Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Serum]] (Toxin score: 1)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003TC5SM6 Juice Beauty Refining Finishing Powder]] (Toxin score: 2)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000Z61VVQ Juice Beauty SPF 30 Tinted Mineral Moisturizer]] (Toxin score: 3)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000E3C024 Larenim Blush]] (Toxin score: 2)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0049QV3KC SANTE All-Natural Eyeshadow Stick]] (Toxin score: 2, the blue, green, rose and pearl are all pearlescent, but the coffee, olive and white are more matte; the rose, white and pearl are good for highlighting.)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000US0804 Ecco Bella Mascara]] (Toxin score: 1)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0013OXEFU Lavilin Deodorant]] (Custom toxin score: ~3)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00015XAQ0 Avalon Organics Vitamin C Cleansing Gel]] (Toxin Score 3)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0063I3RNA EO Everyone Soap Lavender and Aloe]] (Toxin Score: 3)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003EUR1D2 Kiss My Face Whenever Shampoo and Conditioner]] (Toxin score: 2)&lt;br /&gt;CoverGirl Outlast All Day Lipcolor (Toxin score: 4, not bad and the performance is worth it to me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this is helpful for others with the same intention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/30 update - I decided to start a blog with all of this (and more as I go)- if you&#x27;re interested it&#x27;s at PostCancerHippie.com or facebook/postcancerhippieXAQ0 Avalon Organics Vitamin C Cleansing Gel]] (Toxin Score 3)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0063I3RNA EO Everyone Soap Lavender and Aloe]] (Toxin Score: 3)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003EUR1D2 Kiss My Face Whenever Shampoo and Conditioner]] (Toxin score: 2)&lt;br /&gt;CoverGirl Outlast All Day Lipcolor (Toxin score: 4, not bad and the performance is worth it to me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this is helpful for others with the same intention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/30 update - I decided to start a blog with all of this (and more as I go)- if you&#x27;re interested it&#x27;s at PostCancerHippie.com or facebook/postcancerhippie</li>
            <li> When I first opened the bottle and gave it a sniff it kinda reminded me of public washroom air freshener. After putting it on my hair and giving it a lather the scent improved quite a bit. Limes smell nice, green tea smells nice but in the bottle this stuff, well, you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for how it works on my hair.... fantastic! My hair isn&#x27;t color treated but it does tend to have dry ends, who doesn&#x27;t, eh? Anyway, this shampoo makes my hair so soft and amazingly tangle free! And without conditioner even! Also, after my hair dries the scent goes away. Overall I am very pleased with this stuff. I&#x27;m going to look around for other fragrances &#x27;cause this one ain&#x27;t working for me.</li>
            <li> I used the shampoo and conditioner and disagree with the claim that it will \\&quot;lock in moister.\\&quot; I found it to be drying. (My hair is neither oily nor dry naturally. So maybe this shampoo would be good for folks with slightly oilier hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak to the shampoo&#x27;s other assertions (promoting a healthy skull, stimulating hair growth, ...), because I didn&#x27;t notice any difference one way or the other. But it did get my head clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went ahead and used up the entire bottles, but am ready to move on to a different product. It&#x27;s a shame I have to, because the list of ingredients on Kiss My Face products is much more appealing than on most shampoos.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does not irritate my sensitive scalp.  The lime scent is nice.  My waves are not weighed down.  I have trouble getting used to the lack of lather, though.</li>
            <li> the fragrance is great and the shampoo doesn&#x27;t strip my hair like other ones tend to do.  I don&#x27;t always like to use conditioner and so this is a nice shampoo that I can choose to use conditioner if I want to or if it is one of those days where I am in a hurry I can skip it altogether.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it. Her hair is so clean and shinny</li>
            <li> Great product! Love the smell, the size, and the price for such a huge bottle!</li>
            <li> This shampoo works great. I was worried about using something all-natural because I have moderately oily hair, and I didn&#x27;t know if a shampoo could get it clean without all of the harsh chemicals that cut grease. Well, this one gets my hair EVEN CLEANER than the Tresemme I was using before, and my hair wasn&#x27;t greasy the next day either! (Tresemme went straight in the trash) A lot of reviewers have been complaining about the low lather, and telling you to use more if you want a lather. Well, I say that&#x27;s a waste of your money. (If you use more, you&#x27;re buying more shampoo in the long run when you don&#x27;t have to, and, while it&#x27;s affordable, it&#x27;s not cheap) I used less than I did with normal shampoo, a palmful, (I have very long and thick hair, by the way, that goes down my back, and small hands) and didn&#x27;t lather, rinse, repeat like I have with other shampoos, and, while it took some getting used to, it has a TINY bit of lather but as long as you thoroughly wash and rinse your hair, it goes above and beyond the $2 brands you used to buy. The conditioner isn&#x27;t as harsh on your hair either, very light, but follow up with that, leaving it in for at least 2 min, and then thoroughly wash it out and it will make your hair soft, smooth, and shiny. (Mostly because it&#x27;s not stripping your hair of it&#x27;s natural oils and shine, but also because, while it&#x27;s light on your hair, IT WORKS) I keep saying \\&quot;thoroughly\\&quot; only because I don&#x27;t want you to leave some in and then claim that either the shampoo or conditioner makes your hair greasy; however, it is SO much easier to rinse out than brands that contain sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium lareth sulfate (those bubbles that we miss so much) Overall, a wonderful product that is affordable and great for your hair and health. It smells delicious, like a fruit rollup, but you can&#x27;t really smell it in your hair once it dries, just while you&#x27;re shampooing. So, that being said, it&#x27;s great for guys to use, too, because they don&#x27;t have to worry about smelly \\&quot;fruity\\&quot; or like a girl. BUY THIS SHAMPOO and use it sparingly. You will NOT be disappointed!bout smelly \\&quot;fruity\\&quot; or like a girl. BUY THIS SHAMPOO and use it sparingly. You will NOT be disappointed!</li>
