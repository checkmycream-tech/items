            <li>This is the best product for smoothing out crunchy ends!</li>
            <li>the best hair product on the market.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect \\&quot;finish\\&quot; when I am done styling my hair.  </li>
            <li>Protects my hair make it beautiful</li>
            <li>Product is great for straightening hair and smoothing frizzy&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>This product is great</li>
            <li>Great product And price</li>
            <li>It works great at taming fly aways and giving your hair that added shine.  </li>
            <li>Great product &amp; good seller.</li>
            <li>I bought this from the salon a year ago &amp; loved it.</li>
            <li>Aveda&#x27;s smoothing lotion is a really good product.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It smells great without being overpowering and is so light that I can use it often without adding any weight to my hair.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice as well.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance as well.</li>
            <li>This is the best stuff for smoothing and really reduces frizziness.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair very smooth without the greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find this sufficient for that purpose, because it has a very light serum-like texture.  </li>
            <li>I do have to use a bit more (about 4 squirts now as opposed to 2 before)</li>
            <li>but I still love it.</li>
            <li>This Aveda lotion is light, tames your hair, and doesn&#x27;t make it look greasy!  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I was glad to see I could get them on Amazon and not have to drive to an Aveda salon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on ky second bottle &amp; bought some for 2 of my daughters &amp; we are all very happy.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I am using it for year.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.......</li>
            <li>Found this on Amazon and it was the same item that I purchased from my salon which was perfect.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>What more can you ask?</li>
            <li>so if I want shine, softness and a great scent I&#x27;ll stick with Moroccan Oil - but this is a different kind of smell anyway.</li>
            <li>I can happily say that is works just as well on my natural kinky curly hair too.</li>
            <li>This product does the trick to reduce fly aways and makes my hair soft and shiny (but not too shiny).</li>
            <li>I like this lotion for two reasons; shininess and give you light manageable texture.</li>
            <li>The best product I&#x27;ve tested in years for my hair to be entangles much and in addition leaves it no greasy, use it daily thank you</li>
            <li>One of my favorite products and I am very particular with what I use.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to get ready in the morning.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and it is light weight and has a light fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love Aveda products and I&#x27;ve been using light elements smoothing fluid for years.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it pretty expensive compared to the other serums out there, but it really does leave a brilliant shine and the scent is just wonderful.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do much in terms of softness</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it (if you can afford it!).</li>
            <li>It smells like lavender and rosemary (very clean and fresh) and the shine was unbelievable.</li>
            <li>Helps dry my hair faster and makes it super shiny!</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, because of those qualities it is FANTASTIC in already dry hair, almost as a finishing product-</li>
            <li>the decision to purchase was mainly based on the fact that I like the scent of Aveda products and this had the word \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; in the name, which brings to mind a thicker moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have chemically treated hair and purchased this originally as something to put in wet, towel-dried hair...</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair soft and frizz free without leaving it heavy and flat.  </li>
            <li>You only need to use a couple of pumps of this clear, non sticky, odorless liquid.  </li>
            <li>but it is not clear &amp; thick like most shine adding finishing products.  </li>
            <li>It makes my long hair soft and no tangles!</li>
            <li>In fact, you put it on when our hair is wet and then finish styling as normal.</li>
            <li>Price may have been only a little higher (buy a buck or so) than at the salon.</li>

            <li> Price may have been only a little higher (buy a buck or so) than at the salon.</li>
            <li> With lots of coloring, blow drying, flat ironing my hair</li>
            <li> I have long hair that has a keratin straightening treatment</li>
            <li> While the bottle directions say for wet or dry hair, I recommend putting on after blow drying to dry hair &amp; only on the &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; ends.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have ever used \\&quot;too much\\&quot; and can liberally apply to dry looking ends.</li>
            <li> (I just blow dry and brush mine).  </li>
            <li> A must for those who use flat irons or any other hair-drying machinery.  </li>
            <li> I put it on wet hair after I was before blow drying and on the ends of my hair in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have very coarse, dry, thick hair.</li>
            <li> One bottle will last at least a year.</li>
            <li> Just as it states it&#x27;s &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> I often find that those clear, thick finishing products can leave hair looking heavy &amp; greasy with even a small amount.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll run out of it a little faster</li>
            <li> A little dab will do you.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this from my salon a few times, but did not have the time to go to the store to pick up another bottle.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, you will need to wash it off of your hands, but it does not leave a heavy coating on your hair.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed with this product.</li>

            <li> When my hair was relaxed, I used this all the time as a finishing serum. It smells like lavender and rosemary (very clean and fresh) and the shine was unbelievable. I can happily say that is works just as well on my natural kinky curly hair too. I do have to use a bit more (about 4 squirts now as opposed to 2 before) so I&#x27;ll run out of it a little faster but I still love it. Yes, it pretty expensive compared to the other serums out there, but it really does leave a brilliant shine and the scent is just wonderful.

            <li> ...use this.  A little dab will do you.  A must for those who use flat irons or any other hair-drying machinery.  One bottle will last at least a year.</li>
            <li> This Aveda lotion is light, tames your hair, and doesn&#x27;t make it look greasy!  :)  My husband uses it too!</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed with this product. It doesn&#x27;t control frizz or flyaways. It also left my hair feeling greasy when I only used a tiny amount. I plan on returning this product. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I like Aveda products but I think they&#x27;re over priced. I was glad to see I could get them on Amazon and not have to drive to an Aveda salon. Price may have been only a little higher (buy a buck or so) than at the salon. Product is great for straightening hair and smoothing frizzy&#x27;s.  Just as it states it&#x27;s &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> With lots of coloring, blow drying, flat ironing my hair I have &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; ends. This is the best product for smoothing out crunchy ends! The smell is nice as well. I&#x27;m on ky second bottle &amp; bought some for 2 of my daughters &amp; we are all very happy.

            <li> Love this. I have very coarse, dry, thick hair. You would never know it from using this. I put it on wet hair after I was before blow drying and on the ends of my hair in the morning.</li>
            <li> This was my 2nd bottle. I like this lotion for two reasons; shininess and give you light manageable texture. Nice fragrance as well.</li>
            <li> I always use this product before blow drying my hair.  It makes my hair soft and it is light weight and has a light fragrance. I also use this product when I style my hair curly.  I will probably never stop using this. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff for smoothing and really reduces frizziness. It makes my long hair soft and no tangles! I&#x27;ve used this product for 10yrs can&#x27;t go without it!</li>
            <li> I love this product, I am using it for year. Protects my hair make it beautiful</li>
