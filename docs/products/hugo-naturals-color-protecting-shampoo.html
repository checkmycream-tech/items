            <li>Good EWG rating as well.</li>
            <li>My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this good forever; My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this good forever</li>
            <li>Hugo Naturals was as good as any of them, plus it&#x27;s the cheapest, so</li>
            <li>You have to use a TON to get a good lather, and it doesn&#x27;t smell like coconut.  </li>
            <li>None stood out as exceptional.  </li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I think my hair has been conditioned nicely after switching to Hugo&#x27;s line.</li>
            <li>Really nice smell and unlike almost ALL shampoos on the market</li>
            <li>This one lathers up nicely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The fragrance doesn&#x27;t really smell like coconut, and is tolerable at best.  </li>
            <li>I was using John Masters (also a good EWG rating), and this, alongside the conditioner does a much better job for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed any spectacular changes to my hair, but then again I don&#x27;t have curly or frizzy hair...</li>
            <li>I have a strong sensitivity to chemicals, which some might think is a good thing, as it protects me.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful and leaves my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>Some I didn&#x27;t like, but many were nice shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that a lot of the more natural shampoos/conditioners do this so still trying to find one that works perfectly.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find the coconut smell very strong with this shampoo, and that&#x27;s 100% ok with me.</li>
            <li>The Hugo Naturals Coconut Shampoo/Conditioner are my favorite because they are non-toxic, smell good, and leave my hair clean and shiny without any oily residue.</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely so I don&#x27;t need a ton of it with my fine hair.</li>
            <li>its (carcinogenic) chemical free!  </li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>have curly hair, and I don&#x27;t have many fly-aways or frizzies going on while using this shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo and conditioner in Coconut.</li>
            <li>It has a nice light scent.  </li>
            <li>If you want to stay healthy, it&#x27;s not just all about food...</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love the ingredients in the shampoo</li>
            <li>Love the results.  </li>
            <li>Leaves a lovely coconut scent.</li>
            <li>Love it :)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t contain the sodium lauryl sulfate or Sodium laureth sulfate - chemical detergents found in most shampoos.</li>
            <li>and I searched for many of them on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>love this stuff.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is okay but tends to make your hair matt up.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful, natural coconut scent.  </li>
            <li>Really great products and not a heavy fragrance, so, in this case, I have done your research for you!</li>
            <li>great natural ingredients</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been working towards more people and animal friendly products and, given that I have thinning hair</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s an easy winner.  </li>
            <li>Strong coconut scent, but it does not linger in hair after rinsing.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this a try and to my utter surprise, I had a wonderful lather for the first time.</li>
            <li>Which is a huge improvement for my oily hair</li>
            <li>it was a waste of money but great shampoo tried it before and liked it</li>
            <li>The smell is light and coconutty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great with the coconut conditioner (though the conditioner isn&#x27;t necessary for me).</li>
            <li>Chemical free.</li>
            <li>But my hair texture isn&#x27;t silky, shiny and frizz free.</li>
            <li>Smells are important to me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s companion conditioner is even better, offering low price and superior performance.</li>
            <li>My hair feels light and clean.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the natural ingredients in this product.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is rated as safe by the Environmental Working Group and it works really well!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that other people in these reviews don&#x27;t seem to have this issue, so maybe your experience will be more pleasant.</li>
            <li>I have to wash my hair 2-3 times with this product and it STILL doesn&#x27;t feel clean :0</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not drying and leaves my scalp feeling squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>This product would be great for some one  that has dry hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, due to the mechanical difficulties, the smell, and knowing that I won&#x27;t even look good afterward, this shampoo has taken most of the pleasantness out of my morning shower.  </li>
            <li>As a long time believer in the power of coconut oil, this shampoo is the best by far.</li>
            <li>Not overpowering or too sweet.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the best scent when you first use it but that to me is an extremely small price to pay for this fabulous product</li>
            <li>Nice natural coconut fragrance</li>
            <li>I decided to teach myself how to swim this summer, and because I was in the pool 6 days a week, I asked my stylist if it was okay that I was shampooing my hair so much</li>
            <li>but this shampoo is not bad.</li>
            <li>This is a nice natural conditioner with a mild scent.</li>
            <li>Came quickly.  </li>
            <li>--it doesn&#x27;t have all those questionable ingredients that many shampoos have--gets good ratings from Environmental Working Group--a safe product!</li>
            <li>Overall happy customer because my scalp has definitely become healthy after i started using this shampoo</li>
            <li>I have naturally oily, very fine hair.</li>
            <li>Its gluten free, cruelty free, no harmful chemicals and gets my hair clean and soft.</li>
            <li>smells very tropical, light coconut scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s natural &amp; doesn&#x27;t have chemicals, but it doesn&#x27;t work well.  </li>
            <li>My hair is healthy, soft, and shiny.</li>
            <li>I do know that the inconvenience in the shower is well worth the results afterward.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t lather very much, but i would rather natural ingredients than more bubbles.  </li>
            <li>our body is 80 percent skin and if we put something on our skin, our body, our head, well, it&#x27;s gonna seep right in...  </li>
            <li>This specific shampoo and its associated conditioner are among the purest that I have found in my research and accessible as far as being able to easily buy them online.</li>
            <li>This is a good brand, I like their natural liquid hand soap a little better</li>
            <li>I have used other natural organic sulfate free and silicone free products that are far superior to this and cheaper.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re reviewing this product, one might assume you buy organically for many different reasons.</li>
            <li>It seems like you have to use more of it then regular shampoo, but I like it.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is I noticed more hair on the floor of the shower.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this shampoo (especially once I learned the trick to make it lather!).</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve been a supermarket brand guy for my whole life)!    </li>
            <li>This was my first bottle</li>
            <li>When I first purchased this shampoo, I liked it a lot, but I didn&#x27;t like the fact that it didn&#x27;t lather like other shampoos.</li>
            <li>but it does clean well and leaves your hair soft.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is not bad as far as &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoos go.</li>
            <li>It has a soapy watered down vanilla kind of smell.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair smooth and shiny,  No dry scalp issues with Hugo products.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s loaded with pure coconut oil, and no synthetic ingredients whatsoever.</li>
            <li>pure silk like hair when done.</li>
            <li>(I really don&#x27;t like it at all, but</li>
            <li>I am a frugal shopper, and I can&#x27;t even use the whole bottle that I bought.</li>
            <li>It takes significantly more product to thoroughly clean my hair than a traditional shampoo and then leaves it feeling dry even with use of the conditioner.</li>
            <li>Finally a worry free solution to cleaning my hair.</li>
            <li>this is very concentrated</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t lather very well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This product made it very snarly.</li>
            <li>I recently started trying to find more natural products to use</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a while for a natural alternative to commercial shampoos, and Hugo Naturals is not my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I am so tired of being sold, for a high price many times!, shampoo to put on my hair (and head!)</li>
            <li>Smells good, slightly different from typical coconut scent.</li>
            <li>After trying countless natural shampoos rated well by the ewg and attempting to make my own shampoo I finally decided to try HN.</li>
            <li>Ok--the main thing I like about it</li>
            <li>and it tries to leave my hair soft (most of the time)</li>
            <li>It has taken forever to find a product that I feel addresses my need for pure, natural shampoo which I can trust to not poison me with all those chemical ingredients.</li>
            <li>( I would definitely not waste your money on this product!!</li>
            <li>When I first opened it, I gagged a little - it smells like cheap booze.</li>
            <li>So washing hair twice a week without rubbing too much will leave hair soft with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I can normally use a shampoo without a conditioner.</li>
            <li>so women (or rock dudes with long hair) will probably go thru this quickly and seeing as how it doesn&#x27;t lather so well</li>
            <li>but you have to use a lot more than a regular shampoo and its way more expensive.</li>
            <li>like I do, you will want to consider using the conditioner only on your ends the first couple weeks as your body adjusts to the product and relieves your roots of name brand residues.</li>
            <li>It does make the  hair  very soft without a conditioner, but for me it is to soft.</li>
            <li>This prodcut although it is supposedly natural and was well reviewed by a reputable allergen warnings website contains several ingredients that were unknown to the website and gave both my wife and I a bad rash on our ears (most sensitive skin on the face) as a result of our hair touching our ears after use.</li>
            <li>I certainly could never go strolling in a department store fragrance section, I&#x27;d likely pass out.</li>
            <li>and I have long, dry super straight hair.</li>
            <li>My hair was not dried out</li>
            <li>I bought this item hoping to find a natural shampoo that worked well for my family.</li>
            <li>Try another natural shampoo.</li>
            <li>Our whole family uses this product exclusively, and I&#x27;m thinking of naming my next pet, HUGO!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>but a 1 or 2 may be a warning that a natural oil is used</li>
            <li>I tried a few of the others on the EWG list and many left my hair feeling like hay.</li>
            <li>I have been cutting out the highly chemical products from our life and this gets good scores on EWG.org.</li>
            <li>I can smell chemicals when no one else can, as well as many other scents seemingly missed by the average nose.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that is thick and fine.</li>
            <li>I initially thought this was crazy until he told me that most  (if not all) shampoo is from concentrated and that it wouldn&#x27;t make it less effective by diluting it.</li>
            <li>If you really want it to lather up, first wash your hair with a small amount of the shampoo, rinse, then repeat.  </li>
            <li>Never dry, never heavy, but</li>
            <li>Lathers way more on the second wash using the same small amount of shampoo on wash #1.</li>
            <li>No other shampoo has made my hair feel this way.</li>
            <li>Even days later it&#x27;s still soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair a bit greasy and nappy, but I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a really unpleasant funk that overwhelms the pleasant coconut scent.</li>
            <li>This left my hair feeling soft and manageable enough to put a comb through it.</li>
            <li>Most were a bit pricier than I usually choose for shampoo, a few were even more expensive, and this Hugo Naturals was the cheapest.  </li>
            <li>Which may be good or bad, depending on how you like that.</li>

            <li> The smell is light and coconutty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great with the coconut conditioner (though the conditioner isn&#x27;t necessary for me).</li>
            <li> Chemical free.</li>
            <li> But my hair texture isn&#x27;t silky, shiny and frizz free.</li>
            <li> Smells are important to me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s companion conditioner is even better, offering low price and superior performance.</li>
            <li> My hair feels light and clean.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the natural ingredients in this product.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is rated as safe by the Environmental Working Group and it works really well!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that other people in these reviews don&#x27;t seem to have this issue, so maybe your experience will be more pleasant.</li>
            <li> I have to wash my hair 2-3 times with this product and it STILL doesn&#x27;t feel clean :0</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not drying and leaves my scalp feeling squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> This product would be great for some one  that has dry hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, due to the mechanical difficulties, the smell, and knowing that I won&#x27;t even look good afterward, this shampoo has taken most of the pleasantness out of my morning shower.  </li>
            <li> As a long time believer in the power of coconut oil, this shampoo is the best by far.</li>
            <li> Not overpowering or too sweet.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the best scent when you first use it but that to me is an extremely small price to pay for this fabulous product</li>
            <li> Nice natural coconut fragrance</li>
            <li> I decided to teach myself how to swim this summer, and because I was in the pool 6 days a week, I asked my stylist if it was okay that I was shampooing my hair so much</li>
            <li> but this shampoo is not bad.</li>
            <li> This is a nice natural conditioner with a mild scent.</li>
            <li> Came quickly.  </li>
            <li> --it doesn&#x27;t have all those questionable ingredients that many shampoos have--gets good ratings from Environmental Working Group--a safe product!</li>
            <li> Overall happy customer because my scalp has definitely become healthy after i started using this shampoo</li>
            <li> I have naturally oily, very fine hair.</li>
            <li> Its gluten free, cruelty free, no harmful chemicals and gets my hair clean and soft.</li>
            <li> smells very tropical, light coconut scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s natural &amp; doesn&#x27;t have chemicals, but it doesn&#x27;t work well.  </li>
            <li> My hair is healthy, soft, and shiny.</li>
            <li> I do know that the inconvenience in the shower is well worth the results afterward.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t lather very much, but i would rather natural ingredients than more bubbles.  </li>
            <li> our body is 80 percent skin and if we put something on our skin, our body, our head, well, it&#x27;s gonna seep right in...  </li>
            <li> This specific shampoo and its associated conditioner are among the purest that I have found in my research and accessible as far as being able to easily buy them online.</li>
            <li> This is a good brand, I like their natural liquid hand soap a little better</li>
            <li> I have used other natural organic sulfate free and silicone free products that are far superior to this and cheaper.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re reviewing this product, one might assume you buy organically for many different reasons.</li>
            <li> It seems like you have to use more of it then regular shampoo, but I like it.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is I noticed more hair on the floor of the shower.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo (especially once I learned the trick to make it lather!).</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve been a supermarket brand guy for my whole life)!    </li>
            <li> This was my first bottle</li>
            <li> When I first purchased this shampoo, I liked it a lot, but I didn&#x27;t like the fact that it didn&#x27;t lather like other shampoos.</li>
            <li> but it does clean well and leaves your hair soft.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is not bad as far as &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoos go.</li>
            <li> It has a soapy watered down vanilla kind of smell.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair smooth and shiny,  No dry scalp issues with Hugo products.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s loaded with pure coconut oil, and no synthetic ingredients whatsoever.</li>
            <li> pure silk like hair when done.</li>
            <li> (I really don&#x27;t like it at all, but</li>
            <li> I am a frugal shopper, and I can&#x27;t even use the whole bottle that I bought.</li>
            <li> It takes significantly more product to thoroughly clean my hair than a traditional shampoo and then leaves it feeling dry even with use of the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Finally a worry free solution to cleaning my hair.</li>
            <li> this is very concentrated</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t lather very well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This product made it very snarly.</li>
            <li> I recently started trying to find more natural products to use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a while for a natural alternative to commercial shampoos, and Hugo Naturals is not my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I am so tired of being sold, for a high price many times!, shampoo to put on my hair (and head!)</li>
            <li> Smells good, slightly different from typical coconut scent.</li>
            <li> After trying countless natural shampoos rated well by the ewg and attempting to make my own shampoo I finally decided to try HN.</li>
            <li> Ok--the main thing I like about it</li>
            <li> and it tries to leave my hair soft (most of the time)</li>
            <li> It has taken forever to find a product that I feel addresses my need for pure, natural shampoo which I can trust to not poison me with all those chemical ingredients.</li>
            <li> ( I would definitely not waste your money on this product!!</li>
            <li> When I first opened it, I gagged a little - it smells like cheap booze.</li>
            <li> So washing hair twice a week without rubbing too much will leave hair soft with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I can normally use a shampoo without a conditioner.</li>
            <li> so women (or rock dudes with long hair) will probably go thru this quickly and seeing as how it doesn&#x27;t lather so well</li>
            <li> but you have to use a lot more than a regular shampoo and its way more expensive.</li>
            <li> like I do, you will want to consider using the conditioner only on your ends the first couple weeks as your body adjusts to the product and relieves your roots of name brand residues.</li>
            <li> It does make the  hair  very soft without a conditioner, but for me it is to soft.</li>
            <li> This prodcut although it is supposedly natural and was well reviewed by a reputable allergen warnings website contains several ingredients that were unknown to the website and gave both my wife and I a bad rash on our ears (most sensitive skin on the face) as a result of our hair touching our ears after use.</li>
            <li> I certainly could never go strolling in a department store fragrance section, I&#x27;d likely pass out.</li>
            <li> and I have long, dry super straight hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was not dried out</li>
            <li> I bought this item hoping to find a natural shampoo that worked well for my family.</li>
            <li> Try another natural shampoo.</li>
            <li> Our whole family uses this product exclusively, and I&#x27;m thinking of naming my next pet, HUGO!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> but a 1 or 2 may be a warning that a natural oil is used</li>
            <li> I tried a few of the others on the EWG list and many left my hair feeling like hay.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting out the highly chemical products from our life and this gets good scores on EWG.org.</li>
            <li> I can smell chemicals when no one else can, as well as many other scents seemingly missed by the average nose.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that is thick and fine.</li>
            <li> I initially thought this was crazy until he told me that most  (if not all) shampoo is from concentrated and that it wouldn&#x27;t make it less effective by diluting it.</li>
            <li> If you really want it to lather up, first wash your hair with a small amount of the shampoo, rinse, then repeat.  </li>
            <li> Never dry, never heavy, but</li>
            <li> Lathers way more on the second wash using the same small amount of shampoo on wash #1.</li>
            <li> No other shampoo has made my hair feel this way.</li>
            <li> Even days later it&#x27;s still soft.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair a bit greasy and nappy, but I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a really unpleasant funk that overwhelms the pleasant coconut scent.</li>
            <li> This left my hair feeling soft and manageable enough to put a comb through it.</li>
            <li> Most were a bit pricier than I usually choose for shampoo, a few were even more expensive, and this Hugo Naturals was the cheapest.  </li>
            <li> Which may be good or bad, depending on how you like that.</li>
            <li> It lathers up well, unlike some of the other soap-based natural shampoos.</li>
            <li> Maybe they got a different type of Hugo naturals, but as a blond haired blue eyes male, most shampoos do dry my hair out badly, but Hugo&#x27;s coconut defining shampoo not only moisturizes, but heals due to the properties associated with real coconut oil.</li>
            <li> and I need almost a whole handful to get all my hair clean.the conditioner I do like a lot although neither of them smell like coconut which is what I wanted my hair to smell like :/</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling dry, tangled &amp; flat as if it were stripped of</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has short curly dry hair</li>
            <li> I have to use a bit more than regular shampoo and its not thick, but it doesn&#x27;t run out too quickly so not too bad for its price.</li>
            <li> but it left my hair very dry.  </li>
            <li> I tried doing it without the rubbing (at least not until the end) and it didn&#x27;t lather up as much.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair</li>
            <li> That didn&#x27;t stop me from purchasing it, was just a minor pet peeve of mine.</li>
            <li> Regardless, I certainly cannot use this product, and I seriously doubt the authenticity of its claim.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As might be expected from the lack of sulfates, the shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather well.  </li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> I now use it for my neonate and my other child.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other shampoo&#x27;s from EWG recommended site</li>
            <li> I used to wash my hair every other day, now I do it every 3 days.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have the unnecessary weird stuff in it that my supermarket brands have in them (who gives a s</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so difficult to work the shampoo in enough to feel like it&#x27;s cleaning my scalp that I&#x27;ve actually caused mechanical abrasion to the tips of my hair and now have dry split ends.&lt;br</li>
            <li> :  I don&#x27;t have frizzies because my hair feels like it&#x27;s coated with grease less than 18 hours after washing.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo is a little thin so will run out of your hand if you&#x27;re not careful</li>
            <li> Not fun!</li>
            <li> This should not be a surprise, considering that it doesn&#x27;t have any sulfates, but it&#x27;s inconvenient because I have to wash my hair twice every time I use it, and it just doesn&#x27;t work through my hair very well.</li>
            <li> However this dried my hair out and tangled it so that I could not get a comb through it.</li>
            <li> It is one of the few shampoos that is not loaded with harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Someone wrote that it dried their hair out?????</li>
            <li> It also felt like it needed rewashed after two washes and it is NOT a strong coconut smell.</li>
            <li> I fear it is becoming sentient and not just a little evil.</li>
            <li> I usually use John Masters Organics products but decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> While I would rate this product&#x27;s performance as average or adequate, it definitely loses points for smelling terrible.  </li>
            <li> The amount of frizz after washing hair also depends on how hard you scrub your hair.</li>
            <li> have been using this shampoo/conditioner combo for at least 6 months.</li>
            <li> It actually collects in cold seasons at the bottom of the bottle until you shake it.</li>
            <li> I find this is common with organic &amp;#34;safer&amp;#34; shampoos.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is either a 0 or a 1 on the Environmental Working Group (EWG.com) skindeep database, which means it&#x27;s not full of a bunch of scary toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural oils or something, very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, wavy, curly, frizzy hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately using the conditioner made my hair look dirty, like I hadn&#x27;t even washed it.</li>
            <li> It also dried out my hands very badly and the skin around my face was flaking.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately i received a damaged bottle too bad</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather well, and smells bad.</li>
            <li> *** if it lathers if that lathering agent is bad?).</li>
            <li> I know that this label shows a conspicuous lack of artificial ingredients, but I tell you, there is something there, I&#x27;m guessing a fragrance, but it is chemical in nature and nasty.</li>
            <li> It is impossible for this shampoo to do that!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a nice natural conditioner with a mild scent. Simple and fulfills it&#x27;s purpose well. I think my hair has been conditioned nicely after switching to Hugo&#x27;s line. I love Hugo&#x27;s products!</li>
            <li> I have hair that is on the short side of medium length. I can normally use a shampoo without a conditioner. However this dried my hair out and tangled it so that I could not get a comb through it. Once my hair dried it was very frizzy. It also dried out my hands very badly and the skin around my face was flaking. Next time I washed I used the conditioner. My hair was not dried out but my hands still were. Unfortunately using the conditioner made my hair look dirty, like I hadn&#x27;t even washed it. Thankfully the store I bought it from has a good return policy.</li>
            <li> Really nice smell and unlike almost ALL shampoos on the market its (carcinogenic) chemical free!  Tip:  If you really want it to lather up, first wash your hair with a small amount of the shampoo, rinse, then repeat.  Lathers way more on the second wash using the same small amount of shampoo on wash #1.</li>
            <li> Works great, lathers nicely. Strong coconut scent, but it does not linger in hair after rinsing. Good EWG rating as well.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re reviewing this product, one might assume you buy organically for many different reasons. I as well, for all those same reasons, with one added level of interest, that being my sense of smell. I can smell chemicals when no one else can, as well as many other scents seemingly missed by the average nose. I have a strong sensitivity to chemicals, which some might think is a good thing, as it protects me. I certainly could never go strolling in a department store fragrance section, I&#x27;d likely pass out. I know that this label shows a conspicuous lack of artificial ingredients, but I tell you, there is something there, I&#x27;m guessing a fragrance, but it is chemical in nature and nasty. If I were to give the benefit of the doubt to the producer, perhaps it is simply a chemical reaction occurring between constituents in the recipe? Regardless, I certainly cannot use this product, and I seriously doubt the authenticity of its claim.</li>
            <li> Treats your body and the earth!</li>
            <li> Best shampoo. Now used by all of us.  Both babies and both of us.  I now use it for my neonate and my other child.</li>
            <li> I recently started trying to find more natural products to use so know I am spoiled with how those work but at the price of my health, no way! This one lathers up nicely. Also got conditioner which didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling stuff.</li>
            <li> I like Hugo shampoo in the lavender, but the coconut one started smelling so rancid before I could use it up that I finally threw it out.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t lather very much, but i would rather natural ingredients than more bubbles.  smells very tropical, light coconut scent.</li>
            <li> I am recommending this wonderful product to everyone who washes their hair!  I absolutely love how it cleans and nourishes my hair, easy to rinse out and smells delightful!</li>
            <li> great natural ingredients but you have to use a lot more than a regular shampoo and its way more expensive.I have really long hair and I need almost a whole handful to get all my hair clean.the conditioner I do like a lot although neither of them smell like coconut which is what I wanted my hair to smell like :/ wont purchase this shampoo again.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. I have naturally oily, very fine hair. I also strive to use only non-toxic or extremely low toxic products. The Hugo Naturals Coconut Shampoo/Conditioner are my favorite because they are non-toxic, smell good, and leave my hair clean and shiny without any oily residue. If you have oily hair like I do, you will want to consider using the conditioner only on your ends the first couple weeks as your body adjusts to the product and relieves your roots of name brand residues. I use the conditioner on my roots 2x a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this shampoo/conditioner combo for at least 6 months. 1 bottle of each lasts me 2-3 months and I wash my hair daily. It lathers nicely so I don&#x27;t need a ton of it with my fine hair. Give it a try, using it about 2 weeks before making a final decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pictures of before and after washing/conditioning with this product.</li>
            <li> Found this product on the ewg.org website.  It is one of the few shampoos that is not loaded with harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I bought this item hoping to find a natural shampoo that worked well for my family. This was definitely NOT what I was hoping for. It doesn&#x27;t lather well, and smells bad. I have to wash my hair 2-3 times with this product and it STILL doesn&#x27;t feel clean :0( I would definitely not waste your money on this product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a while for a natural alternative to commercial shampoos, and Hugo Naturals is not my favorite.  Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:  There are no sulfate containing compounds in the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I have curly hair, and I don&#x27;t have many fly-aways or frizzies going on while using this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:  I don&#x27;t have frizzies because my hair feels like it&#x27;s coated with grease less than 18 hours after washing.  I&#x27;m actually embarrassed to wash my hair the night before I go somewhere when I&#x27;m using this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;As might be expected from the lack of sulfates, the shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather well.  It&#x27;s so difficult to work the shampoo in enough to feel like it&#x27;s cleaning my scalp that I&#x27;ve actually caused mechanical abrasion to the tips of my hair and now have dry split ends.&lt;br /&gt;The use of this shampoo and the accompanying conditioner has caused acne breakouts all along my hairline.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance doesn&#x27;t really smell like coconut, and is tolerable at best.  (I really don&#x27;t like it at all, but I don&#x27;t quite think it&#x27;s objectively nasty-smelling.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, due to the mechanical difficulties, the smell, and knowing that I won&#x27;t even look good afterward, this shampoo has taken most of the pleasantness out of my morning shower.  I am a frugal shopper, and I can&#x27;t even use the whole bottle that I bought.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the natural ingredients in this product. I also love the fragrance. However, I am underwhelmed at it&#x27;s performance. It takes significantly more product to thoroughly clean my hair than a traditional shampoo and then leaves it feeling dry even with use of the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting out the highly chemical products from our life and this gets good scores on EWG.org. I decided to try it and I like it. It seems like you have to use more of it then regular shampoo, but I like it. I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair Ok--the main thing I like about it --it doesn&#x27;t have all those questionable ingredients that many shampoos have--gets good ratings from Environmental Working Group--a safe product!</li>
            <li> This product leaves your hair feeling grimy. It does not throughly wash the hair. I was hoping my hair would could use to it after using it over two weeks but I am finishing the bottle now and it&#x27;s still a no-go. Try another natural shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner in Coconut. Beautiful, natural coconut scent.  Not overpowering or too sweet.  Leaves my hair smooth and shiny,  No dry scalp issues with Hugo products.  Recommended for anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this shampoo.  I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s natural &amp; doesn&#x27;t have chemicals, but it doesn&#x27;t work well.  It left my hair feeling dry, tangled &amp; flat as if it were stripped of it&#x27;s natural oils or something, very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This shampoo along with the conditioner made my thick,dry,wavy hair soft,silky and shiny.  It has a nice light scent.  The only drawback is I noticed more hair on the floor of the shower. Then my hair became greasy and the oils covered my face.</li>
            <li> Finally a worry free solution to cleaning my hair. It has taken forever to find a product that I feel addresses my need for pure, natural shampoo which I can trust to not poison me with all those chemical ingredients. I am so tired of being sold, for a high price many times!, shampoo to put on my hair (and head!) which will not harm me physically and not bathe me in gluten. If you want to stay healthy, it&#x27;s not just all about food... our body is 80 percent skin and if we put something on our skin, our body, our head, well, it&#x27;s gonna seep right in...  So, this stuff is absolutely wonderful! I&#x27;d recommend it to all my friends and strangers, too!</li>
            <li> My hair was thinning from an antidepressant I was on, after I stopped taking it my hair still didn&#x27;t thicken up like it had been. I wanted to try a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoo to see if would help. It did!!!!! It doesn&#x27;t have the best scent when you first use it but that to me is an extremely small price to pay for this fabulous product plus I like the scent of it now :) five stars across the board for this product!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. I don&#x27;t have to worry that I am pouring toxic chemicals into my hair. My hair is healthy, soft, and shiny. Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. It is everything I want in a shampoo. Its gluten free, cruelty free, no harmful chemicals and gets my hair clean and soft.</li>
            <li> this is very concentrated so u can even stretch it with water.</li>
            <li> Nice natural coconut fragrance</li>
            <li> When I first opened it, I gagged a little - it smells like cheap booze. However, I was out of shampoo, so I decided to give it a try.  Then I noticed the shampoo bubbles and the bottle puffs up if I forget and close the lid. I fear it is becoming sentient and not just a little evil.</li>
            <li> After trying countless natural shampoos rated well by the ewg and attempting to make my own shampoo I finally decided to try HN. My boyfriend has short curly dry hair and I have long, dry super straight hair. This shampoo works perfectly for both of us! It&#x27;s not drying and leaves my scalp feeling squeaky clean. It has a soapy watered down vanilla kind of smell. I don&#x27;t smell coconut at all. But I just care about the ewg score and not getting dandruff so I&#x27;m happy! We follow up with the coconut conditioner.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY! This prodcut although it is supposedly natural and was well reviewed by a reputable allergen warnings website contains several ingredients that were unknown to the website and gave both my wife and I a bad rash on our ears (most sensitive skin on the face) as a result of our hair touching our ears after use. Not fun!</li>
            <li> This shampoo works well and doesn&#x27;t contain harmful chemical. Plus my hubby thinks it smells really good!</li>
            <li> You have to use quite a bit of this product to get it to suds up and worked into you hair.  Otherwise it feels like you are just rubbing water into you hair.  I&#x27;ve used other shampoo&#x27;s from EWG recommended site and I will be trying others to find one that I don&#x27;t need to use a lot of to get it worked into my hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo (especially once I learned the trick to make it lather!). When I first purchased this shampoo, I liked it a lot, but I didn&#x27;t like the fact that it didn&#x27;t lather like other shampoos. That didn&#x27;t stop me from purchasing it, was just a minor pet peeve of mine. I decided to teach myself how to swim this summer, and because I was in the pool 6 days a week, I asked my stylist if it was okay that I was shampooing my hair so much (I&#x27;m AA so generally only shampoo my hair 3x a week). He told me that I should dilute my shampoo. I initially thought this was crazy until he told me that most  (if not all) shampoo is from concentrated and that it wouldn&#x27;t make it less effective by diluting it. I decided to give this a try and to my utter surprise, I had a wonderful lather for the first time. I now dilute both my swimmers shampoo and this one and my hair looks and feels great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do is add about 4ounces of water to a tint measuring cup and drizzle about 5 drops into the water. I then tilt my head and pour the un-stirred solution onto my head while rubbing where I&#x27;m pouring. I get a beautiful lather when I do this. I tried doing it without the rubbing (at least not until the end) and it didn&#x27;t lather up as much. I also tried stirring the shampoo into the water, and didn&#x27;t get a lather at all when I did that.</li>
            <li> Love the ingredients in the shampoo but it left my hair very dry.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Love it! My hair is so shiny and is growing faster than ever..I used to wash my hair every other day, now I do it every 3 days. Which is a huge improvement for my oily hair/scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I also had dandruff, seems that this problem is gone too!.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit torn on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I love:&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks and feels great after I use this shampoo (with the conditioner, of course.) I have coarse wavy hair that tends to get \\&quot;crispy\\&quot; at the ends between cuts, and this shampoo (with the conditioner) extends the time between cuts. My hair feels light and clean. The smell is light and coconutty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I don&#x27;t love:&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t lather very well. This should not be a surprise, considering that it doesn&#x27;t have any sulfates, but it&#x27;s inconvenient because I have to wash my hair twice every time I use it, and it just doesn&#x27;t work through my hair very well. I run out of it faster than the conditioner because of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that other people in these reviews don&#x27;t seem to have this issue, so maybe your experience will be more pleasant. I do know that the inconvenience in the shower is well worth the results afterward.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is either a 0 or a 1 on the Environmental Working Group (EWG.com) skindeep database, which means it&#x27;s not full of a bunch of scary toxic ingredients. I tried a few of the others on the EWG list and many left my hair feeling like hay. I was using John Masters (also a good EWG rating), and this, alongside the conditioner does a much better job for a fraction of the cost. It&#x27;s been a couple months and my hair still feels silky and great. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> As a long time believer in the power of coconut oil, this shampoo is the best by far. Someone wrote that it dried their hair out????? It is impossible for this shampoo to do that! It&#x27;s loaded with pure coconut oil, and no synthetic ingredients whatsoever. Maybe they got a different type of Hugo naturals, but as a blond haired blue eyes male, most shampoos do dry my hair out badly, but Hugo&#x27;s coconut defining shampoo not only moisturizes, but heals due to the properties associated with real coconut oil. It actually collects in cold seasons at the bottom of the bottle until you shake it. Our whole family uses this product exclusively, and I&#x27;m thinking of naming my next pet, HUGO!&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is a Homerun! If you wash your hair daily, this is the way to go! Never dry, never heavy, but pure silk like hair when done. Cheers!</li>
            <li> Works great with the coconut conditioner (though the conditioner isn&#x27;t necessary for me). My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this good forever; My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this good forever (I&#x27;ve been a supermarket brand guy for my whole life)!    I have to admit that I don&#x27;t have the longest of hair so women (or rock dudes with long hair) will probably go thru this quickly and seeing as how it doesn&#x27;t lather so well, they may not think it is working like a shampoo, but, as a guy (who isn&#x27;t a rock dude) this makes my hair feel great and--full! No other shampoo has made my hair feel this way. I&#x27;ve been working towards more people and animal friendly products and, given that I have thinning hair, this makes it feel fuller (not a scientific fact but an opinion).    No problems like anyone else has stated.    Wish it was cheaper.    I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have the unnecessary weird stuff in it that my supermarket brands have in them (who gives a s*** if it lathers if that lathering agent is bad?).</li>
            <li> This was my first bottle and I used the Hugo Naturals smoothing and defining Shampoo and conditioner together. Love the results.  Leaves a lovely coconut scent.</li>
            <li> Great product. Chemical free.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find the coconut smell very strong with this shampoo, and that&#x27;s 100% ok with me. I use coconut oil on my hair after I wash it anyway.. This shampoo is rated as safe by the Environmental Working Group and it works really well! Love it :)</li>
            <li> If you are money conscience but want to remain in the naturals category - this works well. I usually use John Masters Organics products but decided to give this a try. The shampoo is a little thin so will run out of your hand if you&#x27;re not careful but it does clean well and leaves your hair soft.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and leaves my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> great shampoo,but unfortunately i received a damaged bottle too bad it was a waste of money but great shampoo tried it before and liked it</li>
            <li> I no longer buy any products that touch the body without researching. This specific shampoo and its associated conditioner are among the purest that I have found in my research and accessible as far as being able to easily buy them online. Really great products and not a heavy fragrance, so, in this case, I have done your research for you! Please note that you have to check each product and cannot assume by a company. I use www.ewg.org and they have apps for your smartphone - one for all products that you use on your body - SkinDeep - and one for food - FoodScores. Also, to help you, when you are looking at product scores, check why a product is scored. For instance, the best score for skin products is 0 but a 1 or 2 may be a warning that a natural oil is used and some people are allergic.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that is thick and fine. This product made it very snarly. It also felt like it needed rewashed after two washes and it is NOT a strong coconut smell. I have used other natural organic sulfate free and silicone free products that are far superior to this and cheaper. I also bought the matching conditioner, which I reviewed as well.</li>
            <li> This left my hair feeling soft and manageable enough to put a comb through it. Even days later it&#x27;s still soft.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and leaves my hair feeling wonderful.</li>
            <li> While I would rate this product&#x27;s performance as average or adequate, it definitely loses points for smelling terrible.  There&#x27;s a really unpleasant funk that overwhelms the pleasant coconut scent.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is not bad as far as &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoos go. It doesn&#x27;t contain the sodium lauryl sulfate or Sodium laureth sulfate - chemical detergents found in most shampoos. It lathers up well, unlike some of the other soap-based natural shampoos. It&#x27;s derived from coconut and smells like it. Which may be good or bad, depending on how you like that. This is a good brand, I like their natural liquid hand soap a little better but this shampoo is not bad.</li>
            <li> Smells good, slightly different from typical coconut scent. Foams but not a lot, so I have to use a bit more than regular shampoo and its not thick, but it doesn&#x27;t run out too quickly so not too bad for its price. Haven&#x27;t noticed any spectacular changes to my hair, but then again I don&#x27;t have curly or frizzy hair...</li>
            <li> BEST low-toxin shampoo.  I discovered this shampoo while looking at low-toxin options on Environmental Working Group&#x27;s website.  There were a number of shampoos low in toxins and I searched for many of them on Amazon.  Bought a bunch, about a dozen.  Most were a bit pricier than I usually choose for shampoo, a few were even more expensive, and this Hugo Naturals was the cheapest.  Some I didn&#x27;t like, but many were nice shampoos.  None stood out as exceptional.  Hugo Naturals was as good as any of them, plus it&#x27;s the cheapest, so it&#x27;s an easy winner.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months now and still have no complaints.  It&#x27;s companion conditioner is even better, offering low price and superior performance.</li>
            <li> Not the best shampoo out there but knowing that I am not damaging my hair with chemicals is a great feeling. I have very thick, wavy, curly, frizzy hair and it tries to leave my hair soft (most of the time) But my hair texture isn&#x27;t silky, shiny and frizz free. The amount of frizz after washing hair also depends on how hard you scrub your hair. So washing hair twice a week without rubbing too much will leave hair soft with this shampoo. Overall happy customer because my scalp has definitely become healthy after i started using this shampoo</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair a bit greasy and nappy, but I&#x27;ve only used it once so far so perhaps I need to get used to it. I noticed that a lot of the more natural shampoos/conditioners do this so still trying to find one that works perfectly.</li>
            <li> while I reallt like the hugi &amp; debra line, this product does not agree with my scalp. it may be a chemical in it as it is not 100% natural.check with ewg.org for yourself. I do like the 100% natual of hugo and debra</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this.  Leaves my hair feeling stripped.  You have to use a TON to get a good lather, and it doesn&#x27;t smell like coconut.  I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Came quickly.  Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> love this stuff. Only shampoo I use.</li>
            <li> Smells are important to me.  I like the smell.  The shampoo is okay but tends to make your hair matt up.  I find this is common with organic &amp;#34;safer&amp;#34; shampoos.  Still looking for that perfect organic, safe shampoo.</li>
            <li> This product would be great for some one  that has dry hair.  It does make the  hair  very soft without a conditioner, but for me it is to soft.</li>
