            <li>It has a nice smell and when applied to my skin goes in quickly and makes my skin feel smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>First off I love that this cream is made in the USA!</li>
            <li>You don need to use a lot of cream, it s blends very quickly.</li>
            <li>it glides on easily and doesnt get all over my clothes.</li>
            <li>so you can access easily.</li>
            <li>It rubs and absorve in very quickly.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and rubs in easily.  </li>
            <li>It has a very pleasant scent and it&#x27;s PINK.</li>
            <li>However, it came when stated, it was light and went on easily.  </li>
            <li>For me that&#x27;s a huge thing.</li>
            <li>overall a great product</li>
            <li>My thighs have never looked so smooth.</li>
            <li>Great packaging with big lid to open/close.</li>
            <li>Overall great product  </li>
            <li>So Far so good ..</li>
            <li>I used it right after done with my bath so it will be absorb more.</li>
            <li>Hoping to see some more positive results.!</li>
            <li>This is a high quality cream with a nice scent.  </li>
            <li>I am excited to see what the results will be after using it over an extended time..</li>
            <li>My skin since the first time of use look and feels more even.</li>
            <li>I love this line of product, this is my first cellulite cream from them.</li>
            <li>My super-dry skin loves the rich moisture this cream provides.</li>
            <li>I am excited that I can now get it on Amazon, so I thought I would come here and share my results.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure at first because like all&lt;br /&gt;cellulite creams it took some time.</li>
            <li>So many people reviewed this without trying it first.  </li>
            <li>I canâ€™t wait to see what other positive results that Iâ€™ll get from this wonderful product!</li>
            <li>I use my cream after my shower with my skin clean.</li>
            <li>It has such a pleasant scent and it doesn&#x27;t leave a film all over.</li>
            <li>Moreover, the container is made to appear as though it holds more cream than it really does.  </li>
            <li>i haven&#x27;t seen any true results yet.</li>
            <li>It soaks into my skin completely, and doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of residue.  </li>
            <li>Love this it has a soft orange smell and absorbs easily</li>
            <li>Honestly I have more of an issue with loose skin than I do cellulite.</li>
            <li>It is great for cellulite problems and it also takes any other marks that you may have on you.</li>
            <li>I could not believe how quickly I reached the bottom of the container until I noticed the added thickness to the plastic at the bottom.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not at all greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>The cellulite dimples on both of our legs have improved tremendously.</li>
            <li>have diminished tremendously.</li>
            <li>I also believe that it must be helping with cellulite because my pants seem to be fitting better overall around the waist.</li>
            <li>I found that the product rubs in quickly and no waiting to get dressed.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t actually put it at night, I put it on after working out (after shower obviously) and I feel that&#x27;s when it works best.</li>
            <li>Very high quality!!</li>
            <li>Normally retinol are by itself most of the time.</li>
            <li>It has a light fresh scent, goes in smooth and dries fast</li>
            <li>Love the natural, organic ingredients - and it&#x27;s rich, creamy texture.</li>
            <li>I started using several weeks ago and love it!  </li>
            <li>I got hot legs for the summer !</li>
            <li>It is not heavy cream, very light.</li>
            <li>I believe that your body makes collagen to keep skin tight, so using the right ingredients on your skin can stimulate your body to make its own collagen and provide a more toned youthful look where cellulite has accumulated.</li>
            <li>Smooth to apply on skin, dries quickly &amp; very non greasy.</li>
            <li>My arms look more toned and the cellulite has almost completely disappeared.</li>
            <li>I love the natural ingredients and the smell.</li>
            <li>I love all of the natural ingredients, the way it feels</li>
            <li>This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product and has not been influenced in any way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price .</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant odor, is not a heavy or greasy cream, its a light cream that goes on very easy and does not take a long time to dry like some others.</li>
            <li>Absorbing quickly into my skin.</li>
            <li>Skin feels nice and smooth and also firm.</li>
            <li>Really did help belly toning!</li>
            <li>I have had cellulite for many years as I was approaching my 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I will keep using it daily and perhaps will see more of a difference in another week.</li>
            <li>, I think this is the first one</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it, just make sure to use it consistently.</li>
            <li>I would say this cream is comparable to a spa treatment cream; non-sticky, makes skin luxuriously smooth, natural &amp; organic ingredients clinically proven to help reduce the size of fat cells, helps remove excess water and toxins, &amp; increases collagen production helping to reduce stretch marks and varicose veins.</li>
            <li>The cream is light, not heavy and doesnâ€™t leave any residue.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients are natural (really important to me) and of high quality (they&#x27;re organic!).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and thick like body butter, but goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>This is truely the Best Cellulite Cream, I have tried several recently, and they all have different effects on different parts of my body.  </li>
            <li>I could tell right away when I opened it that it is high quality.</li>
            <li>Amazing, less than 1 weeks use and my legs are smoother than they have been in years.</li>
            <li>After a few days I&#x27;m noticing that it&#x27;s getting flatter and more tone!</li>
            <li>Second, I love that it is made of natural and organic products!</li>
            <li>Very high quality.</li>
            <li>So, for as large as the container appears on your screen, you will not receive as much cream as you might expect.  </li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re really looking to just reduce the appearance of cellulite, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>and I can really see a difference.</li>
            <li>This cream worked very well in the areas I&#x27;ve used it on.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Oh, and texture of my skin improved dramatically, it feels much softer now.</li>
            <li>I have used this cream for several weeks, and it is only slightly more effective than the Nivea Q10 lotion, which sells for much less.  </li>
            <li>It goes on super easy, has no strong smell, or greasy feeling after you put it on.</li>
            <li>I have noticed more firmness and less appearance of cellulite</li>
            <li>The cream seems to be helping tighten skin slightly with muffin top and has helped decrease look of cellulite on legs.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it (especially above others with many unrecognizable ingredients) as a daily anti-cellulite regimen.</li>
            <li>rather quickly I felt a different in my skin</li>
            <li>Iâ€™ve read research where caffeine can be used to naturally tighten and firm the appearance of skin and is effective for fighting cellulite.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes considering the reviews.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Ove Beauty&#x27;s cellulite cream had both caffeine and retinol, which are highly recommended for tightening products.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product if you want to improve the appearance of your body.</li>
            <li>The product packaging has a large easy to remove and replace lid that allows you to access a small or large amount of the cream.  </li>
            <li>i happy that the cream doesn&#x27;t have a weird order</li>
            <li>Cream is pink color and has light grapefruity scent.</li>
            <li>This is helping my skin look hydrated and shiney and more firm.</li>
            <li>The smell is mint but not strong at all which I love .</li>
            <li>A rich, pleasant-smelling, pink cream.</li>
            <li>I am always trying new things for cellulite, with no luck</li>
            <li>I understand that this is not a miracle cream that will make my fat legs thin, but it did make me feel better about how they looked after I applied it so that is worth it for me.#gotitatadiscount</li>
            <li>I could not believe how great it worked, my old lady wings are flying the coop, being replaced by the tight firm arms of my youth.  </li>
            <li>and feel very soft.</li>
            <li>This cream works as long as you exercise and eat right as well.  </li>
            <li>It comes in a larger container with a large lid</li>
            <li>There are a lot of cellulite creams out there that include harsh chemicals, this one has all natural ingredients with a pleasing light floral scent that isnâ€™t greasy after applying.  </li>
            <li>Helps to tighten, firm and smooth skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using it daily and my skin feels and looks much softer and smoother.  </li>
            <li>Wow- the appearance of cellulite&lt;br /&gt;dimples</li>
            <li>(as I wish they would naturally with the workouts I do!).&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This product is all natural and it isn&#x27;t greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t wash my hands fast enough after using it.</li>
            <li>But I was completely surprised when I recived a compliment about how soft my skin was.</li>
            <li>My cellulite is almost completely gone .</li>
            <li>I love this and will continue use daily to maintain my firm arms.</li>
            <li>so you only need a little and its smears everywhere easily .</li>
            <li>I am careful about what I put on my skin because so many cellulite products have harsh chemicals</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been excercising and eating right and along with exfoliation and this cream, my cellulite areas look smoother and less noticeable.</li>
            <li>My legs felt and looked much smoother and the cellulite was not really noticeable.</li>

            <li> First off I love that this cream is made in the USA!</li>
            <li> You don need to use a lot of cream, it s blends very quickly.</li>
            <li> it glides on easily and doesnt get all over my clothes.</li>

            <li> It rubs and absorve in very quickly.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and rubs in easily.  </li>
            <li> It has a very pleasant scent and it&#x27;s PINK.</li>
            <li> However, it came when stated, it was light and went on easily.  </li>
            <li> For me that&#x27;s a huge thing.</li>
            <li> overall a great product</li>
            <li> My thighs have never looked so smooth.</li>
            <li> Great packaging with big lid to open/close.</li>
            <li> Overall great product  </li>
            <li> So Far so good ..</li>
            <li> I used it right after done with my bath so it will be absorb more.</li>
            <li> Hoping to see some more positive results.!</li>
            <li> This is a high quality cream with a nice scent.  </li>

            <li> My skin since the first time of use look and feels more even.</li>
            <li> I love this line of product, this is my first cellulite cream from them.</li>
            <li> My super-dry skin loves the rich moisture this cream provides.</li>
            <li> I am excited that I can now get it on Amazon, so I thought I would come here and share my results.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure at first because like all&lt;br /&gt;cellulite creams it took some time.</li>
            <li> So many people reviewed this without trying it first.  </li>
            <li> I canâ€™t wait to see what other positive results that Iâ€™ll get from this wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I use my cream after my shower with my skin clean.</li>
            <li> It has such a pleasant scent and it doesn&#x27;t leave a film all over.</li>
            <li> Moreover, the container is made to appear as though it holds more cream than it really does.  </li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t seen any true results yet.</li>
            <li> It soaks into my skin completely, and doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of residue.  </li>
            <li> Love this it has a soft orange smell and absorbs easily</li>
            <li> Honestly I have more of an issue with loose skin than I do cellulite.</li>
            <li> It is great for cellulite problems and it also takes any other marks that you may have on you.</li>
            <li> I could not believe how quickly I reached the bottom of the container until I noticed the added thickness to the plastic at the bottom.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not at all greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> The cellulite dimples on both of our legs have improved tremendously.</li>
            <li> have diminished tremendously.</li>
            <li> I also believe that it must be helping with cellulite because my pants seem to be fitting better overall around the waist.</li>
            <li> I found that the product rubs in quickly and no waiting to get dressed.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t actually put it at night, I put it on after working out (after shower obviously) and I feel that&#x27;s when it works best.</li>
            <li> Very high quality!!</li>
            <li> Normally retinol are by itself most of the time.</li>
            <li> It has a light fresh scent, goes in smooth and dries fast</li>
            <li> Love the natural, organic ingredients - and it&#x27;s rich, creamy texture.</li>
            <li> I started using several weeks ago and love it!  </li>
            <li> I got hot legs for the summer !</li>
            <li> It is not heavy cream, very light.</li>
            <li> I believe that your body makes collagen to keep skin tight, so using the right ingredients on your skin can stimulate your body to make its own collagen and provide a more toned youthful look where cellulite has accumulated.</li>
            <li> Smooth to apply on skin, dries quickly &amp; very non greasy.</li>
            <li> My arms look more toned and the cellulite has almost completely disappeared.</li>
            <li> I love the natural ingredients and the smell.</li>
            <li> I love all of the natural ingredients, the way it feels</li>
            <li> This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product and has not been influenced in any way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price .</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant odor, is not a heavy or greasy cream, its a light cream that goes on very easy and does not take a long time to dry like some others.</li>
            <li> Absorbing quickly into my skin.</li>
            <li> Skin feels nice and smooth and also firm.</li>
            <li> Really did help belly toning!</li>
            <li> I have had cellulite for many years as I was approaching my 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I will keep using it daily and perhaps will see more of a difference in another week.</li>
            <li> , I think this is the first one</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it, just make sure to use it consistently.</li>
            <li> I would say this cream is comparable to a spa treatment cream; non-sticky, makes skin luxuriously smooth, natural &amp; organic ingredients clinically proven to help reduce the size of fat cells, helps remove excess water and toxins, &amp; increases collagen production helping to reduce stretch marks and varicose veins.</li>
            <li> The cream is light, not heavy and doesnâ€™t leave any residue.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients are natural (really important to me) and of high quality (they&#x27;re organic!).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and thick like body butter, but goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> This is truely the Best Cellulite Cream, I have tried several recently, and they all have different effects on different parts of my body.  </li>
            <li> I could tell right away when I opened it that it is high quality.</li>
            <li> Amazing, less than 1 weeks use and my legs are smoother than they have been in years.</li>
            <li> After a few days I&#x27;m noticing that it&#x27;s getting flatter and more tone!</li>
            <li> Second, I love that it is made of natural and organic products!</li>
            <li> Very high quality.</li>
            <li> So, for as large as the container appears on your screen, you will not receive as much cream as you might expect.  </li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re really looking to just reduce the appearance of cellulite, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> and I can really see a difference.</li>
            <li> This cream worked very well in the areas I&#x27;ve used it on.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Oh, and texture of my skin improved dramatically, it feels much softer now.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for several weeks, and it is only slightly more effective than the Nivea Q10 lotion, which sells for much less.  </li>
            <li> It goes on super easy, has no strong smell, or greasy feeling after you put it on.</li>
            <li> I have noticed more firmness and less appearance of cellulite</li>
            <li> The cream seems to be helping tighten skin slightly with muffin top and has helped decrease look of cellulite on legs.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it (especially above others with many unrecognizable ingredients) as a daily anti-cellulite regimen.</li>
            <li> rather quickly I felt a different in my skin</li>
            <li> Iâ€™ve read research where caffeine can be used to naturally tighten and firm the appearance of skin and is effective for fighting cellulite.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes considering the reviews.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Ove Beauty&#x27;s cellulite cream had both caffeine and retinol, which are highly recommended for tightening products.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product if you want to improve the appearance of your body.</li>
            <li> The product packaging has a large easy to remove and replace lid that allows you to access a small or large amount of the cream.  </li>
            <li> i happy that the cream doesn&#x27;t have a weird order</li>
            <li> Cream is pink color and has light grapefruity scent.</li>
            <li> This is helping my skin look hydrated and shiney and more firm.</li>
            <li> The smell is mint but not strong at all which I love .</li>
            <li> A rich, pleasant-smelling, pink cream.</li>
            <li> I am always trying new things for cellulite, with no luck</li>
            <li> I understand that this is not a miracle cream that will make my fat legs thin, but it did make me feel better about how they looked after I applied it so that is worth it for me.#gotitatadiscount</li>
            <li> I could not believe how great it worked, my old lady wings are flying the coop, being replaced by the tight firm arms of my youth.  </li>
            <li> and feel very soft.</li>
            <li> This cream works as long as you exercise and eat right as well.  </li>
            <li> It comes in a larger container with a large lid</li>
            <li> There are a lot of cellulite creams out there that include harsh chemicals, this one has all natural ingredients with a pleasing light floral scent that isnâ€™t greasy after applying.  </li>
            <li> Helps to tighten, firm and smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using it daily and my skin feels and looks much softer and smoother.  </li>
            <li> Wow- the appearance of cellulite&lt;br /&gt;dimples</li>
            <li> (as I wish they would naturally with the workouts I do!).&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> This product is all natural and it isn&#x27;t greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wash my hands fast enough after using it.</li>
            <li> But I was completely surprised when I recived a compliment about how soft my skin was.</li>
            <li> My cellulite is almost completely gone .</li>
            <li> I love this and will continue use daily to maintain my firm arms.</li>
            <li> so you only need a little and its smears everywhere easily .</li>
            <li> I am careful about what I put on my skin because so many cellulite products have harsh chemicals</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been excercising and eating right and along with exfoliation and this cream, my cellulite areas look smoother and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> My legs felt and looked much smoother and the cellulite was not really noticeable.</li>
            <li> It looked thick at first glance but wasnt greasy at all..</li>
            <li> I not only used this on cellulite , I also used it on , what I call my arm wings, the loose flab and skin on the underside of the upper arm.</li>
            <li> I am just starting to get that little bit of flabby skin under my arms, old lady wings I call them, so I decided to try this out on the arm flaps.  </li>
            <li> So far, I can see a slight difference in the dimples in my thighs.</li>
            <li> I started using this daily about a week ago and so far, I can see a small improvement in the overall tightness of my skin.</li>
            <li> After having three children via c-section, my stomach has some definite loose skin, cellulite issues.  </li>
            <li> Still problem areas present, but slightly less apparent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel any tightening from the caffeine nor tingling from the Retin-A, and I don&#x27;t know whether that&#x27;s bad, or a nice difference.</li>
            <li> , I cant wait to see long term results!</li>
            <li> But I have really dry skin</li>
            <li> After 2 kids, I have some loose skin on my stomach.</li>
            <li> You only need a little and it goes a long way when I apply on my thighs and bottom.</li>
            <li> but only a slight amount.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a little while</li>
            <li> little improvement is not enough to matter or spend the money on.</li>
            <li> With all of the rave reviews for this product, I expected it to work</li>
            <li> I notice a differance alreay only from using a few times</li>
            <li> only been using for a few days now</li>
            <li> Big waste of $$.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday only once in the mornings when I get out the shower .</li>
            <li> Ok so I may be crazy but after using this for less than a week twice a day -- I see toneness returning!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It smells great and works wonders..it my skin firm in jus one week..ofcourse u need to apply it twice a day.It looked thick at first glance but wasnt greasy at all..overall a great product</li>
            <li> Love this cream!! It smells wonderful &amp; is already working. I love the more toned look that it gives to my arms and thighs. This is the best cellulite cream I have used. Very high quality.</li>
            <li> Really did help belly toning!</li>
            <li> A wonderful product to thats helps with that nasty Cellulite. I&#x27;ve been dealing with it for sometime now. But it seems to be working. Im just so glad to see some progress.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for reducing Cellulite. Helps to tighten, firm and smooth skin. Creates a more toned and youthful skin appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> So Far so good .. I have only used it a little while but i have noticed a definite tightening .. also the smell is awesome! Another thing i noticed was a evening in skin tone a lil. Excited to keep using it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks and I am very happy with the results I am starting to see! I have noticed more firmness and less appearance of cellulite I am excited to see what the results will be after using it over an extended time..I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Smells great!  Like the way it leaves my skin feeling.</li>
            <li> I give it only three stars because it didn&#x27;t reduce the appearance of cellulite at all, but there is an up side! It smells very nice, and I&#x27;d say it does have a very nice moisturizing aspect to it. But if you&#x27;re really looking to just reduce the appearance of cellulite, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> Used religiously for two weeks now. I don&#x27;t have a lot of cellulite and it didn&#x27;t diminish it at all.  Even the jar is deceptive. Bottom of the product is padded at least by a quarter inch. Save your money ladies.</li>
            <li> You only need a little and it goes a long way when I apply on my thighs and bottom. I don&#x27;t detect a scent but it feels good when I put it on.  I&#x27;ve been excercising and eating right and along with exfoliation and this cream, my cellulite areas look smoother and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 7 days on my upper thighs. Its not a miracle worker and all my cellulite is gone but I have noticed a smoother appearance to my thighs. I am going to continue using this product and will hopefully get great results. Which what I have seen so far i will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> My skin since the first time of use look and feels more even. You don need to use a lot of cream, it s blends very quickly. You don have any oily or greasy sensation on your skin after use it. The holes of my thighs are less visible, and my other areas are improving too. I like that it s USA made. I use my cream after my shower with my skin clean.</li>
            <li> Ok so I may be crazy but after using this for less than a week twice a day -- I see toneness returning! I&#x27;ve recently lost 50 lbs and admit I have a belly pouch, cellulite etc in my lower tummy area. After a few days I&#x27;m noticing that it&#x27;s getting flatter and more tone! I&#x27;ve been exercising but not seeing this result with just that so great to use together or alone. In fact it&#x27;s working so well I started to put it on my neck and that skin it getting tighter! I don&#x27;t know how this works but it is for sure! Going to use it on my arm &amp;#34;hang&amp;#34; too.  It has a pleasant almost grapefruit smell (no migraine from it- yea!) and feel very soft. Absorbing quickly into my skin. Again I don&#x27;t know how or why this works but it sure does so just go with it-- but it and try it! The customer service is great and you&#x27;ll not be disappointed!!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!!&lt;br /&gt;Received free for my honest review</li>
            <li> I dont know why I keep trying these kindof creams. Maybe they would work better if I was more diligent about applying it day and night. I try to but I definitely dont stick to the regimen. I am almost out of it tho and have not noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> This is not a miracle cream.  I have used this cream for several weeks, and it is only slightly more effective than the Nivea Q10 lotion, which sells for much less.  I work out all the time, drink plenty of water, and massage and moisturize my skin daily.  With all of the rave reviews for this product, I expected it to work as well as the $100+ Clarins cream (which shows instant results).  It does not.  Moreover, the container is made to appear as though it holds more cream than it really does.  The bottom of the container is at least a quarter of an inch thick.  I could not believe how quickly I reached the bottom of the container until I noticed the added thickness to the plastic at the bottom.  So, for as large as the container appears on your screen, you will not receive as much cream as you might expect.  This product does work a little bit but does not adequately outperform drugstore buys for the price.</li>
            <li> Nothing changed in my skin, texture, tightness, used for a month.</li>
            <li> Love this it has a soft orange smell and absorbs easily</li>
            <li> I love this cream, certainly the best I&#x27;ve ever found. The ingredients are natural (really important to me) and of high quality (they&#x27;re organic!). It&#x27;s absorbs quickly, smells surprisingly good and works wonders. My arms look more toned and the cellulite has almost completely disappeared. Every woman needs this!</li>
            <li> I have had cellulite for many years as I was approaching my 30&#x27;s and I have tried quite a few products and nothing seemed to work. I purchased the Best cellulite cream with caffeine by Ove&#x27; Beauty and was extremely pleased with the results. It made a difference in the appearance of my legs. My legs felt and looked much smoother and the cellulite was not really noticeable. I would defineately purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I started using this daily about a week ago and so far, I can see a small improvement in the overall tightness of my skin. First off, it has a pleasant grapefruit scent. After 2 kids, I have some loose skin on my stomach. After using this, I can see it toning up slightly. I haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference on my thighs. But I have really dry skin and this helps to moisturize if nothing else. I will keep using it daily and perhaps will see more of a difference in another week.</li>
            <li> Great product! I am always trying new things for cellulite, with no luck, I think this is the first one im going to have great results with! It goes on super easy, has no strong smell, or greasy feeling after you put it on. I notice a differance alreay only from using a few times, I cant wait to see long term results!</li>
            <li> Been using it for 2 weeks but only once a day after taking a shower and surprisely i can see some change! I can only imagine the difference I would see if I was using it in its recommended dose. (2 times a day) also don&#x27;t be afraid to rub it in with some force to help assist the breaking up of the cellulite. Glad I bought it. Now where&#x27;s summer??</li>
            <li> smells good but that is it does NOT treat cellulite</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream everyday, twice a day, for about 2 weeks now and I am not noticing a difference at all. I had high hopes considering the reviews.</li>
            <li> I still have yet to see improvement on my cellulite. I have been using this for weeks now.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a week now. It feels nice on my skin.  It appears to be smoothing everything out. I am however working out a lot more now in combination. So that may have an impact. Hoping to see some more positive results.!</li>
            <li> I got this today, arrived very quickly! I love this line of product, this is my first cellulite cream from them. There is no strong smell to it unlike the previous one i have tried. Smooth to apply on skin, dries quickly &amp; very non greasy. I definitely recommend this product to a friend!</li>
            <li> i love the cream! I used it right after done with my bath so it will be absorb more. What i like with it is it does not leave a greasy feeling after u apply it and smells good as well. Notice some difference on my skin concerned this couple of days of using it!</li>
            <li> I have never like the look of the back of my upper legs. So I was glad to try this cream to see if it was a dream cream. It has a nice smell and when applied to my skin goes in quickly and makes my skin feel smooth and silky. I understand that this is not a miracle cream that will make my fat legs thin, but it did make me feel better about how they looked after I applied it so that is worth it for me.#gotitatadiscount</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for over a year! I use it for the wrinkles that I have under my triceps...works wonderfully and the best for the value!</li>
            <li> I like the cream. Although, I did see a little improvement it&#x27;s not a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;A little improvement is not enough to matter or spend the money on.</li>
            <li> A rich, pleasant-smelling, pink cream. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week or so, at this point. It&#x27;s not at all greasy and absorbs quickly. My super-dry skin loves the rich moisture this cream provides. I don&#x27;t feel any tightening from the caffeine nor tingling from the Retin-A, and I don&#x27;t know whether that&#x27;s bad, or a nice difference. I&#x27;ll update when I either see a difference or finish the jar.</li>
            <li> I started using several weeks ago and love it!  I&#x27;ve tried so many products and this is becoming one of my favorites.  The texture and scent is amazing and feels great.  Not sticky or greasy like many others.  I have been using it daily and my skin feels and looks much softer and smoother.  I&#x27;ll keep using this one for sure.</li>
            <li> Seems to improve my legs in a few weeks</li>
            <li> My friend heard about this cream and has been sharing her jar :)  We have both been applying the cream regularly morning and at night.  The cellulite dimples on both of our legs have improved tremendously. My legs look more toned and even and are beginning to show off the results so well that I ditched my bikini skirt! I am excited that I can now get it on Amazon, so I thought I would come here and share my results. We are going to order another jar as soon as this one runs&lt;br /&gt;out.  The cream is fairly thick and will go a long way. I love the natural ingredients and the smell.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It&#x27;s not overnight miracle but does work. Started tightening thighs. Much needed, lol.</li>
            <li> Great product! I love all of the natural ingredients, the way it feels&lt;br /&gt;on my skin and the fresh, beautiful smell!</li>
            <li> I love this cream. It has such a pleasant scent and it doesn&#x27;t leave a film all over. My skin is nice and smooth. I would recommend this product with 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I love this brand of cream - it exceeded my expectations in every way.</li>
            <li> With a big weight gain from my 2 pregnancy I have been working out and trying to lose weight. I can see cellulite around my muffin top and thighs. I was given this product to review and give my unbiased opinion. I apply this cream after my shower and I have to say I can feel my skin tighten. This is not an instant problem solver but  I hope with this skin tightening this will help my cellulite go bye bye.</li>
            <li> I bought this many times and now buying it again co&#x27;z I love the result for me very easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;all those  disgusting cellulite will gone ..&lt;br /&gt;I just love it and of course I would recommend this product to anyone best result.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple of days now.. I will post another review as it keeps going. So far so good! :)</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t seen any true results yet. i happy that the cream doesn&#x27;t have a weird order so i&#x27;m more prone to wearing it. it glides on easily and doesnt get all over my clothes. i&#x27;m hopeful for results.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of this cellulite cream it is spa quality. It has a pleasant odor, is not a heavy or greasy cream, its a light cream that goes on very easy and does not take a long time to dry like some others. I have been using for a little over a week to help get rid of some excess flab as I call it from losing weight and I can really see a difference. I can tell that it is firming my stomach up and I am very happy with the results so far and cant wait to see the ending result. It comes in a larger container with a large lid so you can access easily. I would recommend to all who are trying to get rid of cellulite or tighten up skin like me it works for me that way.</li>
            <li> Great product. Has a good smell and makes your skin feel smooth and helps reduce fat cells. I use this everyday after i shower. Love it.</li>
            <li> This cream did nothing for me I haven&#x27;t seen any result at all</li>
            <li> It soaks into my skin completely, and doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of residue.  I&#x27;ve used it for four days, and the skin already feels smoother.</li>
            <li> This is helping my skin look hydrated and shiney and more firm. I apply a few times a day. I think all skin could use a little caffeine!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product!!! I am careful about what I put on my skin because so many cellulite products have harsh chemicals and I don&#x27;t want to cause any skin irritaion or use a product that has poor ingredients. I believe that your body makes collagen to keep skin tight, so using the right ingredients on your skin can stimulate your body to make its own collagen and provide a more toned youthful look where cellulite has accumulated. I looked at the ingredients before buying this product and it has the best combination of ingredients. I could tell right away when I opened it that it is high quality. I would recommend it (especially above others with many unrecognizable ingredients) as a daily anti-cellulite regimen.</li>
            <li> This cream is my hero!! I wasn&#x27;t sure at first because like all&lt;br /&gt;cellulite creams it took some time. I applied the cream at morning and&lt;br /&gt;at night every day for three weeks. Wow- the appearance of cellulite&lt;br /&gt;dimples have diminished tremendously. Thereâ€™s a definite improvement&lt;br /&gt;in the firmness of my skin â€“ it looks smoother and tighter. I wasn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;sure if it would make a big difference because I do already exercise&lt;br /&gt;and drink a lot of water but the results are terrific. My thighs look&lt;br /&gt;smoother (as I wish they would naturally with the workouts I do!).&lt;br /&gt;This cream works-whereas others I have tried do not!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few other cellulite creams and non compare to this one. It was absolutely amazing how quick I saw results. My thighs have never looked so smooth. I not only used this on cellulite , I also used it on , what I call my arm wings, the loose flab and skin on the underside of the upper arm. (If you don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m talking about it&#x27;s because you&#x27;re still under 30:). This tighten my arm wings amazingly. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. In fact after only 1 treatment on the arms it tightened the skin so well I was embarrassed to wear a sleeveless blouse. For me that&#x27;s a huge thing. I choose my shirts according to how well the sleeves hide my arm wings. This product is all natural and it isn&#x27;t greasy feeling. It absorbs really fast and does an awesome job. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a tightening wrap at home and was looking for a good product. Ove Beauty&#x27;s cellulite cream had both caffeine and retinol, which are highly recommended for tightening products. I first applied this product without using a wrap and I was extremely impressed.  My legs look and feel smoother. The consistency feels good and it rubs in quickly so you do not feel gooey after the fact. Very high quality!!</li>
            <li> really nice cream! smells great and is nice and smooth, absorbs quickly as well. only been using for a few days now and i can see the difference! i look and feel firmer! so glad i had the chance to try this free for testing and review!</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t do anything for me, very disappointed!</li>
            <li> So many people reviewed this without trying it first.  It did nothing for me.  Big waste of $$.</li>
            <li> To make this product effective you do need to use twice a day per label on the product, which I don&#x27;t always remember to do.  This cream smells like grapefruit so it is very refreshing, is super creamy, and light peach in color.  I have been trying to target my stomach to decrease muffin top and stretch marks.  I have cellulite on upper thighs that I have been targeting too.  The cream seems to be helping tighten skin slightly with muffin top and has helped decrease look of cellulite on legs.  Still problem areas present, but slightly less apparent.</li>
            <li> have not noticed any cellulite lessening, but mousterizes well</li>
            <li> This cream worked very well in the areas I&#x27;ve used it on.  rather quickly I felt a different in my skin, it was much smoother and didn&#x27;t leaver a bad cream smell.</li>
            <li> This is a great item that I am in love with. It is great for cellulite problems and it also takes any other marks that you may have on you. I am in love with the stuff and would recommend it to anyone if that skinny person that have marks.</li>
            <li> Amazing, less than 1 weeks use and my legs are smoother than they have been in years.</li>
            <li> I love how this cream has a lot of skin benefit ingredients. It even has retinol in it as well as caffeine. Normally retinol are by itself most of the time. I feel that my cellulite are disappearing on my legs.</li>
            <li> After having three children via c-section, my stomach has some definite loose skin, cellulite issues.  I have been using this cream for several weeks as directed, and it seems to be helping with the appearance of stretch marks and the overall appearance of my skin.  I also believe that it must be helping with cellulite because my pants seem to be fitting better overall around the waist.</li>
            <li> Great packaging with big lid to open/close. It has floral scent. It rubs and absorve in very quickly. No residue afterwards. It is not heavy cream, very light. It works efficiently. It has tighten my skin and gave me a younger look. I am glad I got to try this for free to give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I was totally hesitant about purchasing this product, but it worked for me.</li>
            <li> I just reordered another one !&lt;br /&gt;Very happy....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about two weeks and have already noticed a difference in my gross cellulite! It has a light fresh scent, goes in smooth and dries fast doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy! Good stuff!</li>
            <li> First off I love that this cream is made in the USA! Second, I love that it is made of natural and organic products! Third, I love the smell, has great texture, not greasy, and leaves my skin looking smooth and toned! Great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Product was received for review and testing purposes.</li>
            <li> Smoother skin in a little jar. I started using this a few days ago,and already my skin is softer and smoother. This cellulite cream also has a pleasant smell,no harmful chemicals!</li>
            <li> Unconditional....unconditional....unconditional money back guarantee. What do you have to lose? So far, I can see a slight difference in the dimples in my thighs. Makes my skin feel great! I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it works yet, just got it. Smells good though.</li>
            <li> Not sure why my previous review wasnt posted, but I do like this cream. you do have to use it 2x/day, and within a week I saw results. skin appeared much more supple and lifted. Cream is pink color and has light grapefruity scent. I like that it has organic ingredients. I would definitely recommend it, just make sure to use it consistently. Oh, and texture of my skin improved dramatically, it feels much softer now.</li>
            <li> I would say this cream is comparable to a spa treatment cream; non-sticky, makes skin luxuriously smooth, natural &amp; organic ingredients clinically proven to help reduce the size of fat cells, helps remove excess water and toxins, &amp; increases collagen production helping to reduce stretch marks and varicose veins. Iâ€™ve definitely noticed smoother/toned skin!</li>
            <li> I can feel my skin tightning already.I see a reduction in the amount of cellulite.I have been using this for a short time and already see results.I cant wait to see what this product will do with longer use</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I decided to try the best Cellulite Cream with Caffeine and Retinol . I can enthusiastically report that my skin feels both softer and firmer!. I am so glad that I decided to trust and treat myself with this cream. I canâ€™t wait to see what other positive results that Iâ€™ll get from this wonderful product! I received a discount on this product in exchange for an honest, unbiased review. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product and has not been influenced in any way.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about using this product.  I have been using it for about a week now and, while subtle, I do notice change.  I have been using it as directed, morning and night....</li>
            <li> It was a very small amount inside, I applied twice a day, until its gone..and i dont see any changes...I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Honestly I have more of an issue with loose skin than I do cellulite. This is largely due to gaining and losing weight all my life.I purchased it for my stomach, rump and double chin. I used to use a product from Avon called Lift and Tuck but they longer make it. It worked for the day but had an unpleasant scent, was very greasy and sticky. I couldn&#x27;t wash my hands fast enough after using it. This product is wonderful. The list of organic ingredients is the reason. It has a very pleasant scent and it&#x27;s PINK. It tightens on contact and I love that it&#x27;s moisturizing as well. It reduces my neck lines which makes me look noticeably younger (I&#x27;m 51). I&#x27;ll keep using this product and will purchase one for my twin sister for Christmas. Now she has cellulite.... lol. Best of all, it&#x27;s made in the USA!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product. It helps her remove her cellulite problem. I can see a lot of changes on her skin. Very nice product, it works.</li>
            <li> This cream works as long as you exercise and eat right as well.  I also paired it with a massage roller.</li>
            <li> I just received product.  However, it came when stated, it was light and went on easily.  I look forward to seeing how it works.  So far so good!</li>
            <li> this one of the best cream I have had</li>
            <li> Ove Beauty comes in a nice jar with great amount of 4 oz. with complete directions of how and when to use on your bad areas.  The active ingredients are also listed as retinol and caffeine.  This product is made in the USA with a money back guarantee.  It is always a plus to help here at home when you make a purchase.</li>
            <li> we love this cream and the smell so good, having that non-greasy feeling after using it!</li>
            <li> Love the natural, organic ingredients - and it&#x27;s rich, creamy texture. It also smells yummy too! Thrilled to have found a product that is both enjoyable to put on - and with great results!</li>
            <li> This cream is great. It&#x27;s nice and thick like body butter, but goes on smooth. Has a great mild scent that doesn&#x27;t linger. I feel like it&#x27;s already working after a week! Skin feels nice and smooth and also firm. Great product.</li>
            <li> Ove Beauty is an outstanding product!  This is a high quality cream with a nice scent.  It is easy to apply and rubs in easily.  I would highly recommend this product if you want to improve the appearance of your body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used cellulite creams in the past to little to no improvement, I&#x27;ve been using this product for just over a week now with visible improvement.  There are a lot of cellulite creams out there that include harsh chemicals, this one has all natural ingredients with a pleasing light floral scent that isnâ€™t greasy after applying.  Iâ€™ve read research where caffeine can be used to naturally tighten and firm the appearance of skin and is effective for fighting cellulite.  I found that the product rubs in quickly and no waiting to get dressed.  The product packaging has a large easy to remove and replace lid that allows you to access a small or large amount of the cream.  The cream is light, not heavy and doesnâ€™t leave any residue.  I will definitely continue to use the product, best cellulite cream Iâ€™ve used.</li>
            <li> i love this. it smells great and makes your skin feel so nice.</li>
            <li> After using it for a few days I noticed it did make my skin firmer but only a slight amount. But I was completely surprised when I recived a compliment about how soft my skin was.</li>
            <li> One of the anti-cellulite products that seems works, I may tell more about products after I will use a bit longer,  but for now this one does make a difference plus it smells good! I don&#x27;t actually put it at night, I put it on after working out (after shower obviously) and I feel that&#x27;s when it works best. Overall great product  This product was received for the purpose of testing and  review.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this cream . I bought every cream possible . This was a little pricey but I thought what the hell ! I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and I&#x27;m legs are toned and firm . My cellulite is almost completely gone . I use it everyday only once in the mornings when I get out the shower . The cream is thick so you only need a little and its smears everywhere easily . The smell is mint but not strong at all which I love . I don&#x27;t work out just used the cream and it did all the magic for me . I&#x27;m ordering another container so I can keep looking this good . It&#x27;s worth the price . I got hot legs for the summer ! Must get !</li>
            <li> This is truely the Best Cellulite Cream, I have tried several recently, and they all have different effects on different parts of my body.  I am just starting to get that little bit of flabby skin under my arms, old lady wings I call them, so I decided to try this out on the arm flaps.  I could not believe how great it worked, my old lady wings are flying the coop, being replaced by the tight firm arms of my youth.  I love this and will continue use daily to maintain my firm arms.</li>
            <li> ooooh I love how this smells and feels... no heavyness and no greasiness. I really do love this cream and so glad I got to try this.</li>
