    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>For what I needed this dryer for it is PERFECT.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is, quite simply, an excellent hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>The ion function on the hair dryer seems to help keep my hair from frizzing some, but the best results for no frizz blow-dried hair is when you use the Thermal Creation Heat Tamer spray they include in the product packaging.</li>
            <li>For now, I say this is definitely a great buy!</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t know that Phillips was in the hair drying business, but this is a very good product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Having said that, though, it&#x27;s a great hair dryer.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it&#x27;s a great hair dryer.    </li>
            <li>For the price, I felt this was a great hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a great hairdryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing about it that makes me want to toss it in the trash, but it&#x27;s going to be my backup and dog drying blow dryer, not the one I depend on to have great hair every day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Whatever the technology may be the thing works great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a great hairdryer.</li>
            <li>can change the setting on the fly, you want to make it hotter?  </li>
            <li>The air flow is good -- it&#x27;s not a \\&quot;blow me</li>
            <li>The COOL setting is PERFECT for my wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had another 1875 watt dryer for a couple of years now and been perfectly happy with it, but when I got this TRESemme version I was confident it would be a good replacement for my aging one.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.   </li>
            <li>but I was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the results I get from the Tresemme Philips Thermal Creations hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Although this is an attractive sleek design, I feel it is more geared for the \\&quot;person drying your hair\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>it also looks very stylish.  </li>
            <li>I hope you are as pleased as I am with your purchase!</li>
            <li>I love this dryer!  </li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer!</li>
            <li>This is a nice hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to have the chance to grab this product and test it</li>
            <li>in all, a good item that I hope to use for many years to come.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so thrilled I did.</li>
            <li>Therefore, if you are like me, you do your own hairdrying.  </li>
            <li>The medium setting is good for styling, and the cool setting is good for setting.  </li>
            <li>but I really love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Add the word \\&quot;nano\\&quot; to anything these days, and it sounds more high-tech.    </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s any better (based on the price)</li>
            <li>it just means I need it to do more things.  </li>
            <li>anyone who has owned an ionic air cleaner will know what I&#x27;m talking about (but don&#x27;t worry, it doesn&#x27;t make your hair smell of ions!)  :)</li>
            <li>The once a year hair dryer user like me will be satisfied.</li>
            <li>That must be the reason for the non-fried look :)</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t you just love the blow dryers that make your hair frizzy, burn and blow it off to never-never land?</li>
            <li>I love the nozzle design on this dryer,too.</li>
            <li>However, this wonderful hair dryer is much more quiet than any others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The low speed is perfect for setting my hair.</li>
            <li>ENJOY!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the dryer for more than a month now</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the dryer for more than a month now</li>
            <li>in all, the hairdryer does a good job, high wattage, looks nice....</li>
            <li>Lots of hot air, and thats a good thing.      </li>
            <li>Her hair dries faster and she doesn&#x27;t get hot while using this -- both good things.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair quickly and does a nice job.  </li>
            <li>I was very impressed as I really put the dryer to the challenge with using it in a very steamy hot/humid bathroom - just after stepping out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I was impressed with the high flow of air on the fast setting.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The two speeds are perfect, and the two temperature settings are not too extreme in either direction.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE all the options available and it is light and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I like the rocker-style buttons, which are easy to use even if your hands are damp.  </li>
            <li>The buttons are easy to use, and the ion thingies might even soften your hair.  </li>
            <li>attachment looks like it should be screwed on, but it snaps on and this isn&#x27;t always an easy shot.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is so easy, and so intuitive.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am very satisfied, and if this hair dryer lasts as long as my old Pro 1400 workhorse, I will be REALLY impressed!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The 6 heat/cool intensity settings are easy to figure out and, even though I mostly use high and hottest because I&#x27;m always in a hurry, I can see where, if you&#x27;re using a curling brush to style, they would come in handy.</li>
            <li>Wow, I think I love that spray even more than the hair dryer!    </li>
            <li>Really huge.</li>
            <li>For those of us who spend a bit of time with our hair dryers, lighter is a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is especially important if you wash your hair on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The hair dryer also comes with a bonus Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Spray, which will help smooth your hair while drying.  </li>
            <li>I do miss having a retractable cord on this model, but will enjoy it anyway!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think someone with petite hands is going to be comfortable holding it.</li>
            <li>As someone who rarely uses a hair dryer, I&#x27;m satisfied with the quality of this unit.</li>
            <li>The light weight&lt;</li>
            <li>I thought this one would be nice because it had the ion feature that I have heard so much about.</li>
            <li>The diffuser in particular is really effective.</li>
            <li>It did the work quickly and allowed me to easily swivel the nozzle and finish off with cooler air.  </li>
            <li>The TRESemme Thermal Creations Dryer dries my shoulder length hair quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li>The speeds are great, with high providing plenty of volume of air movement, without getting the heat too high.</li>
            <li>This model is light, powerful, and comfortable in hand.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize Philips was is the hair dryer business, but after enjoying good service from their other products, I decided to give this hair dryer a try.  </li>
            <li>To top it off, the grip seems large in diameter</li>
            <li>Although this is a good hair dryer, I would recommend the [[ASIN:B001B1C91U V.S. Dryer Pro with Finger Diffuser 1875 Watt]] by Vidal Sassoon which sells for only $16.89.  </li>
            <li>And, both hair dryers are ionic, have hooks for hanging, and have cool shot buttons.</li>
            <li>People talk about the weight, but it&#x27;s very lightweight compared to my ancient one, and the decibel level is much better as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really understand ceramic technology and the wonder of ionic conditioning for healthy, shiny hair....</li>
            <li>However it does have three heat settings, a &#x27;cool&#x27; button, and a switch to turn the ionic part of it on/off.    </li>
            <li>The cool shot button also works well and even gets the air completely cool when the heat setting was on high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Push a button, want cool air?  </li>
            <li>When I used it, I had to look to be sure I really had the dryer pointed at my head, it&#x27;s that good--and yet your hair dries just as quickly as without the diffuser.</li>
            <li>There is a cool burst button to allow quick cooling for setting a style.  </li>
            <li>The heat settings go from cool air to very hot.       </li>
            <li>would recommend this dryer to someone looking for a full size high powered dryer, but I would warn that if space is an issue, you might want to look for something more compact.</li>
            <li>The 1875 watts are adequate as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The heating and fan settings are adequate.  </li>
            <li>Watts Super Turbo Hair Dryer (Model:CP2002GB)]] has a ceramic barrel and has lasted for years.  </li>
            <li>She will never go back to using the cheap kind again ...</li>
            <li>The warm setting for heat is also good; it&#x27;s warm enough to dry your hair without being too high and causing damage.</li>
            <li>It fits nicely in my hand and even though it&#x27;s a large dryer, it feels light, not heavy.  </li>
            <li>The one thing it doesn&#x27;t have that my other hair dryer has is a diffuser, a very handy attachment.  </li>
            <li>The nozzle is longer than I am accustomed to, but I am sure it will seem normal soon.</li>
            <li>She has also used the dryer multiple times and is very pleased.  </li>
            <li>But if you spend a long time straightening with a dryer I don&#x27;t think it is a good choice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But the good thing is the long cord!  </li>
            <li>The loud noise is a trade off with this dryer over quieter dryers as the TRESemme dryer dries hair more quickly than quieter</li>
            <li>It has a constant cool setting (which I have never had), a warm setting and a hot setting and switches between them effortlessly and immediately.</li>
            <li>but it seems more like a professional salon dryer.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a slim, concentrator nozzle that you can use to direct the air to a smaller area that&#x27;s great for styling.  </li>
            <li>This hairdryer is comparable in size to most, but is not nearly as heavy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also thrilled that I didn&#x27;t burn my hair, even with the dryer on the highest setting - right next to my scalp (to give it body).</li>
            <li>I also found that I was able to blow dry my wigs very quickly and without the frizziness that sometimes accompanies the styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another nice feature for me is that the barrel of the dryer stays pretty cool, no matter how long I&#x27;ve run the dryer at the highest heat setting.  </li>
            <li>The sound level and weight are reasonable and it does not get unpleasantly hot.     </li>
            <li>The Thermal Creations hair dryer is honestly the first DIFFERENT dryer I have every owned.</li>
            <li>For someone who is undemanding of their dryer, such as a quick blast and out the door sort of person, this dryer is probably ok.</li>
            <li>The dryer has a nice long cord with a test and reset button on the plug.   </li>
            <li>cord is nice and long and gives me plenty of room to work - another</li>
            <li>The multiple settings - hot, warm, cool and high and low&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>When I first started using this hair dryer, I noticed that my hair did seem softer and less frizzy, but some experimentation proved that it was not the hair dryer deserving credit -- but the  free sample of TREsemme Hair Tamer Spray that came with it.  </li>
            <li>A number of years ago, I began investing a little more money in better hair dryers, and found I very much like the ceramic dryers.  </li>
            <li>hairdryer is much bigger than my old one but, surprisingly is also quite a bit lighter.</li>
            <li>This dryer is much quieter and doesn&#x27;t generate nearly as much heat as my cheap one that I have been using.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s otherwise straightforward and not hard to tell what the instructions mean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is comfortable to use although it weighs ½ pound more than my other hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>The TRESemme Phillips hair dryer is a full size, high powered hair drying monster.  </li>
            <li>I tried this out today for the first time</li>
            <li>I love my current hot air dryer [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gentle breeze!</li>
            <li>My hair most definitely didn&#x27;t frizz (a first)</li>
            <li>First time in years.  </li>
            <li>, it looks pretty</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d think that&#x27;d be a good thing, but in fact the dryer&#x27;s so heavy that it pulls the wall-wart out of the receptacle.</li>
            <li>So, this one doesn&#x27;t fit in my drawer as easily as my old one, but I like it so much</li>
            <li>I thought at first that it was quiet because it wasn&#x27;t as strong.</li>
            <li>but they did include a small bottle of Heat Tamer Spray which smells really good.</li>
            <li>I can see where this will be useful since, with hairspray and all the other gack that clogs up inlets on hair dryers, you can just pop off the external cap and give it a good cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is easy to operate and has several options for speed and temperature plus an ion function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>taking it out of the package is that the dryer is a bit heavier and bigger to hang onto, but that deficiency is more than made up for when, at the high heat blowing setting, the dryer is so much quieter.</li>
            <li>As someone who has frizzy hair, I really appreciate the different heat settings and the flexible, easy to use nozzle.      </li>
            <li>Since the handle is fairly bulky, it wasn&#x27;t too hard to avoid accidentally flipping the switches, but I would think that sliding switches would have been better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But this hair dryer provides much of their technology and power, at a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li>It was also fairly quiet, as hair dryers go, which made me comfortable with using it in a neighboring room when my daughter was napping.  </li>
            <li>It just has a feeling of real quality about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t end up with aching hands from waving it in the air for the whole time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to see a company standing firmly behind their product.</li>
            <li>in all, my acquisition of the TRESemme Philips HP4990/05 Thermal Creations Hair Dryer is much appreciated.  </li>
            <li>All in all, my acquisition of the TRESemme Philips HP4990/05 Thermal Creations Hair Dryer is much appreciated.  </li>
            <li>Compared to the old Wahl hairdryer this one has a lot more power, albeit only with two settings</li>
            <li>The hair dryer seems heavier than an average, and with the size, it is more challenging to pack for a trip, keeping in mind packing with the very long</li>
            <li>It has 6 different settings for airflow and temperature and is a very powerful 1875 watts.  </li>
            <li>I liked the cool shot at the end to make sure -- first, that my hair was really dry as it&#x27;s hard to tell sometimes with just using heat --and secondly, to set my style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At 1875 Watts, its powerful airflow gets your hair dry quickly.  </li>
            <li>It also boasted that, while it would blow dry my hair very quickly, it wouldn&#x27;t have heat-spots.</li>
            <li>The cord is nice and long, but I hope Philips makes a cordless Lithium-Ion powered hair dryer next.</li>
            <li>It has a FABULOUS low setting that is a bit stronger than average and a high setting that is SUPER quick for drying my daughter&#x27;s straight hair.</li>
            <li>This unit moves a lot of hot (or cool) air to dry your hair.</li>
            <li>Since my old \\&quot;Pro 1400\\&quot; blow dryer was 25 years old and as loud as a jackhammer, this one is a huge improvement.  </li>
            <li>When I first opened the box, I was surprised at the size.</li>
            <li>With a 45 day money back guarantee, and a 2 year full warranty, I decided to give this dryer a shot.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat the 45 day money back guarantee or the full 2 year warranty.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it several times now and it consistently performs better than my old dryer in terms of speed of drying and in ease of styling because of the different settings.</li>
            <li>less frizz because my hair was so smooth!</li>
            <li>I think I will start using it whenever I need to because its actually pretty fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also note, it is pretty big.  </li>
            <li>I have mid-back length med-fine straight black hair, and when used in conjunction with with my ceramic/tourmaline hair brush, I can actually get my hair dried practically frizz free and the shine is amazing!</li>
            <li>I can highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This dryer doesn&#x27;t seem to put out as much heat as my old dryer and its predecessors did.  </li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s powerful, it&#x27;s relatively quiet.  </li>
            <li>and while I didn&#x27;t notice my hair was any shinier than normal, it did feel lighter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavy and loud, but dries hair very quickly!</li>
            <li>Nothing that blows hot air at your head is going to \\&quot;protect and condition\\&quot; your hair, but TREsemme just picked up a new customer for their Heat Tamer Spray, which apparently does.</li>
            <li>This is important to me, since not only do I use it to blow dry my own thick, long Asian hair (which dried very quickly using this hairdryer), but on my wigs which are made of more fine, European virgin hair which cost over $1000</li>
            <li>I have always used a cheap hair dryer (usually $15 or less) and can really tell the difference with this one.  </li>
            <li>It worked just fine, but I prefer and recommend the use of BioSilk when working with your hair and heated appliances such as hairdryers or straightening irons.commend the use of BioSilk when working with your hair and heated appliances such as hairdryers or straightening irons.</li>
            <li>It is beginning to show some signs of wear, and it was time to find a new dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was a new one on me.  </li>
            <li>This was a new one on me.  </li>
            <li>They seem to dry better, last longer, and my old [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>So, in summary: This is a powerful hair dryer that is not too big for comfortable use, as long as you leave off the extra nozzle.  </li>
            <li>It also has a pretty big cord.  </li>
            <li>I try to let my hair dry naturally during the warmer months, but for winter it just takes TOO long and ordinarily using a blowdryer would cause fluff and frizz, but the COOL and LOW setting on his dryer were PERFECT.</li>
            <li>I just needed a new hair dryer as my old one quit on me.</li>
            <li>I liked the little one, BUT on the positive side, it is much less loud than the old one.</li>
            <li>weight of the HP4990/05 is also a little lighter than my old dryer, making it easier to wield, but it doesn&#x27;t feel flimsy or cheap at all.  </li>
            <li>Everything is clearly marked.</li>
            <li>blurb on the info sheet states that the hairdryer has an ION function which produces negatively charged ions which prevent static and flyaway hair.</li>
            <li>I used to skip drying if I could because my hair felt so much better air dried, now I actually use this even if I don&#x27;t have to leave the house.</li>
            <li>appliance is easy to use, though the instructions take a little getting used to -- for example, there&#x27;s a reference to Figure 4 in the text, but no Figure 4!  </li>
            <li>While the size scared me a little (I have issues with weak wrists/hands), it&#x27;s actually very light and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>The ionic feature is nice, and really seems to cut down on the frizz, at least for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so particular about having several speeds either.  </li>
            <li>That said, I was surprised that it wasn&#x27;t too heavy and was actually lighter than many of the smaller models I&#x27;ve used before.  </li>
            <li>own a much more expensive hairdryer for myself that has all the features this doesn&#x27;t - now that doesn&#x27;t mean</li>
            <li>I had an old one that was 6 inches long by 10 inches high (and folded.)</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;high\\&quot; setting on this thing feels like turbo on your head, and it gets your hair dry fast.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is comfortable to hold, and not too heavy, although it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to be a tiny bit lighter.  </li>
            <li>This morning not only was I late for work because it took longer to dry my hair, I also had a nice case of the frizzies.     </li>
            <li>Luckily, the extra nozzle is not really needed, because the air flow is concentrated enough without it.  </li>
            <li>It is big, but it&#x27;s not unbearable, overall it&#x27;s a decent mid-range hairdryer.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have noted, it is rather large, but not very heavy.</li>
            <li>This one is 9 inches long by 11 inches high.</li>
            <li>This feels like a professional product--I just wish it weren&#x27;t such a honkin&#x27; space hog.</li>
            <li>It is as quiet as my old dryer, which was marketed for its quietness.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly loud compared to my generic hair dryer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no expert, but it seems to me that this will be much healthier for my hair - especially considering I wash and dry my hair</li>
            <li>This dryer is actually quite lightweight and easy to hold when drying my below the shoulders thick hair.  </li>
            <li>only drawback to me is that it&#x27;s bigger than my old one and doesn&#x27;t have a cordkeeper or a folding handle</li>
            <li>Apparently you do need the extra protection of the spray and can&#x27;t rely on the dryer not to damage your hair if you overdo it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My arms are not long, so this does provide some maneuvering.  </li>
            <li>Thermal Creations Hair Dryer seemed to have everything I required from this kind of device:  ceramic, long cord, decent price, various speed and heat settings, and a cold shot</li>
            <li>Thermal Creations Hair Dryer actually seems to dry my hair FASTER than the old unit I used, although it is blowing cooler even at the highest heat setting!  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice hair dryer -- powerful enough to dry my medium-length extra-dense hair before I get bored and/or tired of holding it up.  </li>
            <li>Size: A little on the large size, but not overweight.  </li>
            <li>It is a little large to be travel portable however.    </li>
            <li>This would be a great hair dryer for anyone with thick or long hair because of the power behind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve left the ion setting turned on (back of handle and is not in the way) because it really does keep some of the frizz down.</li>
            <li>It certainly delivers on strength and heat - I managed to get a sleek blowdry done in less than 20 minutes!</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> For what I needed this dryer for it is PERFECT.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is, quite simply, an excellent hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> The ion function on the hair dryer seems to help keep my hair from frizzing some, but the best results for no frizz blow-dried hair is when you use the Thermal Creation Heat Tamer spray they include in the product packaging.</li>
            <li> For now, I say this is definitely a great buy!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t know that Phillips was in the hair drying business, but this is a very good product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Having said that, though, it&#x27;s a great hair dryer.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it&#x27;s a great hair dryer.    </li>
            <li> For the price, I felt this was a great hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a great hairdryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing about it that makes me want to toss it in the trash, but it&#x27;s going to be my backup and dog drying blow dryer, not the one I depend on to have great hair every day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whatever the technology may be the thing works great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is a great hairdryer.</li>
            <li> can change the setting on the fly, you want to make it hotter?  </li>
            <li> The air flow is good -- it&#x27;s not a \\&quot;blow me</li>
            <li> The COOL setting is PERFECT for my wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had another 1875 watt dryer for a couple of years now and been perfectly happy with it, but when I got this TRESemme version I was confident it would be a good replacement for my aging one.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.   </li>
            <li> but I was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the results I get from the Tresemme Philips Thermal Creations hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Although this is an attractive sleek design, I feel it is more geared for the \\&quot;person drying your hair\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> it also looks very stylish.  </li>
            <li> I hope you are as pleased as I am with your purchase!</li>
            <li> I love this dryer!  </li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer!</li>
            <li> This is a nice hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled to have the chance to grab this product and test it</li>
            <li> in all, a good item that I hope to use for many years to come.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so thrilled I did.</li>
            <li> Therefore, if you are like me, you do your own hairdrying.  </li>
            <li> The medium setting is good for styling, and the cool setting is good for setting.  </li>
            <li> but I really love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Add the word \\&quot;nano\\&quot; to anything these days, and it sounds more high-tech.    </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s any better (based on the price)</li>
            <li> it just means I need it to do more things.  </li>
            <li> anyone who has owned an ionic air cleaner will know what I&#x27;m talking about (but don&#x27;t worry, it doesn&#x27;t make your hair smell of ions!)  :)</li>
            <li> The once a year hair dryer user like me will be satisfied.</li>
            <li> That must be the reason for the non-fried look :)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t you just love the blow dryers that make your hair frizzy, burn and blow it off to never-never land?</li>
            <li> I love the nozzle design on this dryer,too.</li>
            <li> However, this wonderful hair dryer is much more quiet than any others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The low speed is perfect for setting my hair.</li>
            <li> ENJOY!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the dryer for more than a month now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the dryer for more than a month now</li>
            <li> in all, the hairdryer does a good job, high wattage, looks nice....</li>
            <li> Lots of hot air, and thats a good thing.      </li>
            <li> Her hair dries faster and she doesn&#x27;t get hot while using this -- both good things.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair quickly and does a nice job.  </li>
            <li> I was very impressed as I really put the dryer to the challenge with using it in a very steamy hot/humid bathroom - just after stepping out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the high flow of air on the fast setting.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The two speeds are perfect, and the two temperature settings are not too extreme in either direction.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE all the options available and it is light and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I like the rocker-style buttons, which are easy to use even if your hands are damp.  </li>
            <li> The buttons are easy to use, and the ion thingies might even soften your hair.  </li>
            <li> attachment looks like it should be screwed on, but it snaps on and this isn&#x27;t always an easy shot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is so easy, and so intuitive.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am very satisfied, and if this hair dryer lasts as long as my old Pro 1400 workhorse, I will be REALLY impressed!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The 6 heat/cool intensity settings are easy to figure out and, even though I mostly use high and hottest because I&#x27;m always in a hurry, I can see where, if you&#x27;re using a curling brush to style, they would come in handy.</li>
            <li> Wow, I think I love that spray even more than the hair dryer!    </li>
            <li> Really huge.</li>
            <li> For those of us who spend a bit of time with our hair dryers, lighter is a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is especially important if you wash your hair on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The hair dryer also comes with a bonus Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Spray, which will help smooth your hair while drying.  </li>
            <li> I do miss having a retractable cord on this model, but will enjoy it anyway!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think someone with petite hands is going to be comfortable holding it.</li>
            <li> As someone who rarely uses a hair dryer, I&#x27;m satisfied with the quality of this unit.</li>
            <li> The light weight&lt;</li>
            <li> I thought this one would be nice because it had the ion feature that I have heard so much about.</li>
            <li> The diffuser in particular is really effective.</li>
            <li> It did the work quickly and allowed me to easily swivel the nozzle and finish off with cooler air.  </li>
            <li> The TRESemme Thermal Creations Dryer dries my shoulder length hair quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li> The speeds are great, with high providing plenty of volume of air movement, without getting the heat too high.</li>
            <li> This model is light, powerful, and comfortable in hand.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize Philips was is the hair dryer business, but after enjoying good service from their other products, I decided to give this hair dryer a try.  </li>
            <li> To top it off, the grip seems large in diameter</li>
            <li> Although this is a good hair dryer, I would recommend the [[ASIN:B001B1C91U V.S. Dryer Pro with Finger Diffuser 1875 Watt]] by Vidal Sassoon which sells for only $16.89.  </li>
            <li> And, both hair dryers are ionic, have hooks for hanging, and have cool shot buttons.</li>
            <li> People talk about the weight, but it&#x27;s very lightweight compared to my ancient one, and the decibel level is much better as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really understand ceramic technology and the wonder of ionic conditioning for healthy, shiny hair....</li>
            <li> However it does have three heat settings, a &#x27;cool&#x27; button, and a switch to turn the ionic part of it on/off.    </li>
            <li> The cool shot button also works well and even gets the air completely cool when the heat setting was on high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Push a button, want cool air?  </li>
            <li> When I used it, I had to look to be sure I really had the dryer pointed at my head, it&#x27;s that good--and yet your hair dries just as quickly as without the diffuser.</li>
            <li> There is a cool burst button to allow quick cooling for setting a style.  </li>
            <li> The heat settings go from cool air to very hot.       </li>
            <li> would recommend this dryer to someone looking for a full size high powered dryer, but I would warn that if space is an issue, you might want to look for something more compact.</li>
            <li> The 1875 watts are adequate as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The heating and fan settings are adequate.  </li>
            <li> Watts Super Turbo Hair Dryer (Model:CP2002GB)]] has a ceramic barrel and has lasted for years.  </li>
            <li> She will never go back to using the cheap kind again ...</li>
            <li> The warm setting for heat is also good; it&#x27;s warm enough to dry your hair without being too high and causing damage.</li>
            <li> It fits nicely in my hand and even though it&#x27;s a large dryer, it feels light, not heavy.  </li>
            <li> The one thing it doesn&#x27;t have that my other hair dryer has is a diffuser, a very handy attachment.  </li>
            <li> The nozzle is longer than I am accustomed to, but I am sure it will seem normal soon.</li>
            <li> She has also used the dryer multiple times and is very pleased.  </li>
            <li> But if you spend a long time straightening with a dryer I don&#x27;t think it is a good choice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But the good thing is the long cord!  </li>
            <li> The loud noise is a trade off with this dryer over quieter dryers as the TRESemme dryer dries hair more quickly than quieter</li>
            <li> It has a constant cool setting (which I have never had), a warm setting and a hot setting and switches between them effortlessly and immediately.</li>
            <li> but it seems more like a professional salon dryer.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a slim, concentrator nozzle that you can use to direct the air to a smaller area that&#x27;s great for styling.  </li>
            <li> This hairdryer is comparable in size to most, but is not nearly as heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also thrilled that I didn&#x27;t burn my hair, even with the dryer on the highest setting - right next to my scalp (to give it body).</li>
            <li> I also found that I was able to blow dry my wigs very quickly and without the frizziness that sometimes accompanies the styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another nice feature for me is that the barrel of the dryer stays pretty cool, no matter how long I&#x27;ve run the dryer at the highest heat setting.  </li>
            <li> The sound level and weight are reasonable and it does not get unpleasantly hot.     </li>
            <li> The Thermal Creations hair dryer is honestly the first DIFFERENT dryer I have every owned.</li>
            <li> For someone who is undemanding of their dryer, such as a quick blast and out the door sort of person, this dryer is probably ok.</li>
            <li> The dryer has a nice long cord with a test and reset button on the plug.   </li>
            <li> cord is nice and long and gives me plenty of room to work - another</li>
            <li> The multiple settings - hot, warm, cool and high and low&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> When I first started using this hair dryer, I noticed that my hair did seem softer and less frizzy, but some experimentation proved that it was not the hair dryer deserving credit -- but the  free sample of TREsemme Hair Tamer Spray that came with it.  </li>
            <li> A number of years ago, I began investing a little more money in better hair dryers, and found I very much like the ceramic dryers.  </li>
            <li> hairdryer is much bigger than my old one but, surprisingly is also quite a bit lighter.</li>
            <li> This dryer is much quieter and doesn&#x27;t generate nearly as much heat as my cheap one that I have been using.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s otherwise straightforward and not hard to tell what the instructions mean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is comfortable to use although it weighs ½ pound more than my other hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> The TRESemme Phillips hair dryer is a full size, high powered hair drying monster.  </li>
            <li> I tried this out today for the first time</li>
            <li> I love my current hot air dryer [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gentle breeze!</li>
            <li> My hair most definitely didn&#x27;t frizz (a first)</li>
            <li> First time in years.  </li>
            <li> , it looks pretty</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think that&#x27;d be a good thing, but in fact the dryer&#x27;s so heavy that it pulls the wall-wart out of the receptacle.</li>
            <li> So, this one doesn&#x27;t fit in my drawer as easily as my old one, but I like it so much</li>
            <li> I thought at first that it was quiet because it wasn&#x27;t as strong.</li>
            <li> but they did include a small bottle of Heat Tamer Spray which smells really good.</li>
            <li> I can see where this will be useful since, with hairspray and all the other gack that clogs up inlets on hair dryers, you can just pop off the external cap and give it a good cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is easy to operate and has several options for speed and temperature plus an ion function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> taking it out of the package is that the dryer is a bit heavier and bigger to hang onto, but that deficiency is more than made up for when, at the high heat blowing setting, the dryer is so much quieter.</li>
            <li> As someone who has frizzy hair, I really appreciate the different heat settings and the flexible, easy to use nozzle.      </li>
            <li> Since the handle is fairly bulky, it wasn&#x27;t too hard to avoid accidentally flipping the switches, but I would think that sliding switches would have been better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But this hair dryer provides much of their technology and power, at a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li> It was also fairly quiet, as hair dryers go, which made me comfortable with using it in a neighboring room when my daughter was napping.  </li>
            <li> It just has a feeling of real quality about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t end up with aching hands from waving it in the air for the whole time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to see a company standing firmly behind their product.</li>
            <li> in all, my acquisition of the TRESemme Philips HP4990/05 Thermal Creations Hair Dryer is much appreciated.  </li>
            <li> All in all, my acquisition of the TRESemme Philips HP4990/05 Thermal Creations Hair Dryer is much appreciated.  </li>
            <li> Compared to the old Wahl hairdryer this one has a lot more power, albeit only with two settings</li>
            <li> The hair dryer seems heavier than an average, and with the size, it is more challenging to pack for a trip, keeping in mind packing with the very long</li>
            <li> It has 6 different settings for airflow and temperature and is a very powerful 1875 watts.  </li>
            <li> I liked the cool shot at the end to make sure -- first, that my hair was really dry as it&#x27;s hard to tell sometimes with just using heat --and secondly, to set my style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At 1875 Watts, its powerful airflow gets your hair dry quickly.  </li>
            <li> It also boasted that, while it would blow dry my hair very quickly, it wouldn&#x27;t have heat-spots.</li>
            <li> The cord is nice and long, but I hope Philips makes a cordless Lithium-Ion powered hair dryer next.</li>
            <li> It has a FABULOUS low setting that is a bit stronger than average and a high setting that is SUPER quick for drying my daughter&#x27;s straight hair.</li>
            <li> This unit moves a lot of hot (or cool) air to dry your hair.</li>
            <li> Since my old \\&quot;Pro 1400\\&quot; blow dryer was 25 years old and as loud as a jackhammer, this one is a huge improvement.  </li>
            <li> When I first opened the box, I was surprised at the size.</li>
            <li> With a 45 day money back guarantee, and a 2 year full warranty, I decided to give this dryer a shot.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the 45 day money back guarantee or the full 2 year warranty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it several times now and it consistently performs better than my old dryer in terms of speed of drying and in ease of styling because of the different settings.</li>
            <li> less frizz because my hair was so smooth!</li>
            <li> I think I will start using it whenever I need to because its actually pretty fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also note, it is pretty big.  </li>
            <li> I have mid-back length med-fine straight black hair, and when used in conjunction with with my ceramic/tourmaline hair brush, I can actually get my hair dried practically frizz free and the shine is amazing!</li>
            <li> I can highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This dryer doesn&#x27;t seem to put out as much heat as my old dryer and its predecessors did.  </li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s powerful, it&#x27;s relatively quiet.  </li>
            <li> and while I didn&#x27;t notice my hair was any shinier than normal, it did feel lighter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy and loud, but dries hair very quickly!</li>
            <li> Nothing that blows hot air at your head is going to \\&quot;protect and condition\\&quot; your hair, but TREsemme just picked up a new customer for their Heat Tamer Spray, which apparently does.</li>
            <li> This is important to me, since not only do I use it to blow dry my own thick, long Asian hair (which dried very quickly using this hairdryer), but on my wigs which are made of more fine, European virgin hair which cost over $1000</li>
            <li> I have always used a cheap hair dryer (usually $15 or less) and can really tell the difference with this one.  </li>

            <li> It is beginning to show some signs of wear, and it was time to find a new dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was a new one on me.  </li>
            <li> This was a new one on me.  </li>
            <li> They seem to dry better, last longer, and my old [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> So, in summary: This is a powerful hair dryer that is not too big for comfortable use, as long as you leave off the extra nozzle.  </li>
            <li> It also has a pretty big cord.  </li>
            <li> I try to let my hair dry naturally during the warmer months, but for winter it just takes TOO long and ordinarily using a blowdryer would cause fluff and frizz, but the COOL and LOW setting on his dryer were PERFECT.</li>
            <li> I just needed a new hair dryer as my old one quit on me.</li>
            <li> I liked the little one, BUT on the positive side, it is much less loud than the old one.</li>
            <li> weight of the HP4990/05 is also a little lighter than my old dryer, making it easier to wield, but it doesn&#x27;t feel flimsy or cheap at all.  </li>
            <li> Everything is clearly marked.</li>
            <li> blurb on the info sheet states that the hairdryer has an ION function which produces negatively charged ions which prevent static and flyaway hair.</li>
            <li> I used to skip drying if I could because my hair felt so much better air dried, now I actually use this even if I don&#x27;t have to leave the house.</li>
            <li> appliance is easy to use, though the instructions take a little getting used to -- for example, there&#x27;s a reference to Figure 4 in the text, but no Figure 4!  </li>
            <li> While the size scared me a little (I have issues with weak wrists/hands), it&#x27;s actually very light and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> The ionic feature is nice, and really seems to cut down on the frizz, at least for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so particular about having several speeds either.  </li>
            <li> That said, I was surprised that it wasn&#x27;t too heavy and was actually lighter than many of the smaller models I&#x27;ve used before.  </li>
            <li> own a much more expensive hairdryer for myself that has all the features this doesn&#x27;t - now that doesn&#x27;t mean</li>
            <li> I had an old one that was 6 inches long by 10 inches high (and folded.)</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;high\\&quot; setting on this thing feels like turbo on your head, and it gets your hair dry fast.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is comfortable to hold, and not too heavy, although it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to be a tiny bit lighter.  </li>
            <li> This morning not only was I late for work because it took longer to dry my hair, I also had a nice case of the frizzies.     </li>
            <li> Luckily, the extra nozzle is not really needed, because the air flow is concentrated enough without it.  </li>
            <li> It is big, but it&#x27;s not unbearable, overall it&#x27;s a decent mid-range hairdryer.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted, it is rather large, but not very heavy.</li>
            <li> This one is 9 inches long by 11 inches high.</li>
            <li> This feels like a professional product--I just wish it weren&#x27;t such a honkin&#x27; space hog.</li>
            <li> It is as quiet as my old dryer, which was marketed for its quietness.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly loud compared to my generic hair dryer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no expert, but it seems to me that this will be much healthier for my hair - especially considering I wash and dry my hair</li>
            <li> This dryer is actually quite lightweight and easy to hold when drying my below the shoulders thick hair.  </li>
            <li> only drawback to me is that it&#x27;s bigger than my old one and doesn&#x27;t have a cordkeeper or a folding handle</li>
            <li> Apparently you do need the extra protection of the spray and can&#x27;t rely on the dryer not to damage your hair if you overdo it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My arms are not long, so this does provide some maneuvering.  </li>
            <li> Thermal Creations Hair Dryer seemed to have everything I required from this kind of device:  ceramic, long cord, decent price, various speed and heat settings, and a cold shot</li>
            <li> Thermal Creations Hair Dryer actually seems to dry my hair FASTER than the old unit I used, although it is blowing cooler even at the highest heat setting!  </li>
            <li> This is a very nice hair dryer -- powerful enough to dry my medium-length extra-dense hair before I get bored and/or tired of holding it up.  </li>
            <li> Size: A little on the large size, but not overweight.  </li>
            <li> It is a little large to be travel portable however.    </li>
            <li> This would be a great hair dryer for anyone with thick or long hair because of the power behind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve left the ion setting turned on (back of handle and is not in the way) because it really does keep some of the frizz down.</li>
            <li> It certainly delivers on strength and heat - I managed to get a sleek blowdry done in less than 20 minutes!</li>
            <li> This one dried my hair just as quickly, but with much less noise.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice anything one way or the other as far as conditioning</li>
            <li> I got this hairdryer to replace my old revlon clunker which was taking forever to dry thick long hair and did not have much of a variety to its settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> product description says this dryer won&#x27;t damage your hair or leave it frazzled, but they really push the TRESemm&amp;eacute; Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Spray to prevent hair damage and have included a small bottle.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it is 9 inches long, which is longer than my last hair dryer, but not unmanageable for me.  </li>
            <li> The cord is extra long compared to drug store brand hair dryers.  </li>
            <li> The cord on this hair dryer is 9 feet long, which I personally think is too long.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at how quickly it dried my hair, a big time saver in the morning when I&#x27;m in a hurry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had full size dryers in the past and they were always so heavy.</li>
            <li> Operation is primarily limited to two simple toggle buttons - Speed: off-low-high; and heat: cool-warm-hot.</li>
            <li> The ionic flow sounds a little gimmicky, but seems to work pretty well.  </li>
            <li> 1875 watts goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> This is too long for me to use without whacking myself in the head repeatedly.    </li>
            <li> is so long that I have to hold my arm fully extended to get to my head.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The buttons are positioned well so that I can easily switch heat, speed, or access the cold shot button with my thumb on the same hand that is holding the dryer - no fumbling with the switches.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I worried the amount of time required to dry my long hair would increase because of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very long hair.</li>
            <li> It took me all of five minutes to dry it - I kid you not.</li>
            <li> So it is difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the size is a little large for travel.</li>
            <li> Although the wattage is the same as my old dryer, the airflow can be set very high, allowing me to dry my casual style in half the time and without heat.</li>
            <li> I stopped using hair dryers because it was a pain, your hair would stink, it would get overly hot, and your hair would look bad (at least with the cheap hair dryers I had).  </li>
            <li> we&#x27;re only trying to get their hair dried before they hop into bed...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s heavy relative to the one I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s simple to use, no confusing or useless settings.  </li>
            <li> My other hair dryer has a 4½ foot cord, which is sufficient.    </li>
            <li> , I found the switches could flip off and on or warm/hot/cold by accident if you were clumsy or not careful with your fingers.  </li>
            <li> (No, really!)</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have already stated, this dryer has a lot of choices for speed and heat.</li>
            <li> I received my HP4990/05 and first turned it on, I was actually skeptical.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it over any other hair dryer in this price range.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and this dryer gets it dry faster than any other i&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> which is designed to produce a gentler warmth than conventional heating elements.</li>
            <li> The nose of it is a little long, but the dryer isn&#x27;t heavy.  </li>
            <li> only complaint with this unit is its size.  </li>
            <li> I got rid of other things to make room for it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s big and heavy, so it can be hard to handle along with a brush.  </li>
            <li> This means less chance of a burned fingertip, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the attachment that narrows the spout because it seems to make my hair less frizzy.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s due to the hair dryer itself, or something else.  </li>
            <li> and I can say that even with the colder weather in Nashville lately, my hair hasn&#x27;t fallen victim to the frizzies.  </li>
            <li> Maybe a little of both, but</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a nice hair dryer.  With 1875 watts and six speed settings it has almost everything you could want in a hair dryer.  The one thing it doesn&#x27;t have that my other hair dryer has is a diffuser, a very handy attachment.  This hair dryer is comfortable to use although it weighs ½ pound more than my other hair dryer.  The cord on this hair dryer is 9 feet long, which I personally think is too long.  My other hair dryer has a 4½ foot cord, which is sufficient.    Although this is a good hair dryer, I would recommend the [[ASIN:B001B1C91U V.S. Dryer Pro with Finger Diffuser 1875 Watt]] by Vidal Sassoon which sells for only $16.89.  The V.S. Dryer Pro does not have ceramic radiant heat, which doesn&#x27;t make any difference to me, but it does include a diffuser.  And, both hair dryers are ionic, have hooks for hanging, and have cool shot buttons.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize Philips was is the hair dryer business, but after enjoying good service from their other products, I decided to give this hair dryer a try.  This unit moves a lot of hot (or cool) air to dry your hair. The bonus is an ion stream to minimize damage to your hair. This is especially important if you wash your hair on a daily basis.  There is a cool burst button to allow quick cooling for setting a style.  My only complaint is the size is a little large for travel.</li>
            <li> Salon quality hair dryers can run upwards of $130-230.  But this hair dryer provides much of their technology and power, at a fraction of the cost.  At 1875 Watts, its powerful airflow gets your hair dry quickly.  It includes 3 fan settings and 3 heat settings, plus the cold shot button which you can use to quickly alternate between warm/hot air and cold air to set your style.  The element is designed to distribute airflow so that you don&#x27;t get hotspots in your blowdrying, which can damage your hair.  This is important to me, since not only do I use it to blow dry my own thick, long Asian hair (which dried very quickly using this hairdryer), but on my wigs which are made of more fine, European virgin hair which cost over $1000 and I don&#x27;t want anything damaging them.  I also found that I was able to blow dry my wigs very quickly and without the frizziness that sometimes accompanies the styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hairdryer is a bit larger than I was accustomed to, so it can be awkward to move your arms around to make room.  That said, I was surprised that it wasn&#x27;t too heavy and was actually lighter than many of the smaller models I&#x27;ve used before.  It was also fairly quiet, as hair dryers go, which made me comfortable with using it in a neighboring room when my daughter was napping.  I also like the removeable filter, which makes periodic cleaning of the dryer easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find the rocker buttons annoying.  Although the box boasts \\&quot;professional-style rocker switches\\&quot; (seriously, though, what are \\&quot;professional-style\\&quot; buttons?), I found the switches could flip off and on or warm/hot/cold by accident if you were clumsy or not careful with your fingers.  Since the handle is fairly bulky, it wasn&#x27;t too hard to avoid accidentally flipping the switches, but I would think that sliding switches would have been better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair dryer also comes with a bonus Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Spray, which will help smooth your hair while drying.  It worked just fine, but I prefer and recommend the use of BioSilk when working with your hair and heated appliances such as hairdryers or straightening irons.commend the use of BioSilk when working with your hair and heated appliances such as hairdryers or straightening irons.</li>
            <li> This thing is a monster. Really huge. If you&#x27;re the type who puts away your hair dryer after every use, no problem--but if not, expect to sacrifice some acreage on your countertop. Also, the wall-wart (transformer) is pretty small. You&#x27;d think that&#x27;d be a good thing, but in fact the dryer&#x27;s so heavy that it pulls the wall-wart out of the receptacle. Thirdly, there&#x27;s no swivel attachment on the cord (which is quite long)--I&#x27;d prefer a shorter cord with a swivel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, though, it&#x27;s a great hair dryer. (No, really!) The diffuser in particular is really effective. When I used it, I had to look to be sure I really had the dryer pointed at my head, it&#x27;s that good--and yet your hair dries just as quickly as without the diffuser. This feels like a professional product--I just wish it weren&#x27;t such a honkin&#x27; space hog.</li>
            <li> The Thermal Creations hair dryer is honestly the first DIFFERENT dryer I have every owned. It has a constant cool setting (which I have never had), a warm setting and a hot setting and switches between them effortlessly and immediately. It also has a cold shot button for finishing touches. It has a FABULOUS low setting that is a bit stronger than average and a high setting that is SUPER quick for drying my daughter&#x27;s straight hair. The COOL setting is PERFECT for my wavy hair. I try to let my hair dry naturally during the warmer months, but for winter it just takes TOO long and ordinarily using a blowdryer would cause fluff and frizz, but the COOL and LOW setting on his dryer were PERFECT. I LOVE all the options available and it is light and easy to use. I do miss having a retractable cord on this model, but will enjoy it anyway!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> I tried this out today for the first time and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.   As someone who has frizzy hair, I really appreciate the different heat settings and the flexible, easy to use nozzle.      The dryer has a nice long cord with a test and reset button on the plug.   The heat settings go from cool air to very hot.       In my opinion, it&#x27;s a great hair dryer.    It did the work quickly and allowed me to easily swivel the nozzle and finish off with cooler air.  No frizzies.</li>
            <li> Since my old \\&quot;Pro 1400\\&quot; blow dryer was 25 years old and as loud as a jackhammer, this one is a huge improvement.  People talk about the weight, but it&#x27;s very lightweight compared to my ancient one, and the decibel level is much better as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This appliance is easy to use, though the instructions take a little getting used to -- for example, there&#x27;s a reference to Figure 4 in the text, but no Figure 4!  But it&#x27;s otherwise straightforward and not hard to tell what the instructions mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product description says this dryer won&#x27;t damage your hair or leave it frazzled, but they really push the TRESemm&amp;eacute; Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Spray to prevent hair damage and have included a small bottle.  Apparently you do need the extra protection of the spray and can&#x27;t rely on the dryer not to damage your hair if you overdo it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very satisfied, and if this hair dryer lasts as long as my old Pro 1400 workhorse, I will be REALLY impressed!</li>
            <li> I have fairly short hair and I rely on the blow dryer to do my styling for me. I love my current hot air dryer [[ASIN:B0007NZPNM Conair Cord-Keeper 1875Wt With Folding Handle]] -- but it&#x27;s on its last blows. I was thrilled to have the chance to grab this product and test it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing I notice taking it out of the package is that the dryer is a bit heavier and bigger to hang onto, but that deficiency is more than made up for when, at the high heat blowing setting, the dryer is so much quieter. I don&#x27;t hear that horrible high-pitched sound drowning out everything else!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 6 heat/cool intensity settings are easy to figure out and, even though I mostly use high and hottest because I&#x27;m always in a hurry, I can see where, if you&#x27;re using a curling brush to style, they would come in handy. I liked the cool shot at the end to make sure -- first, that my hair was really dry as it&#x27;s hard to tell sometimes with just using heat --and secondly, to set my style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m not a scientist and I don&#x27;t really understand ceramic technology and the wonder of ionic conditioning for healthy, shiny hair....but I was very pleased with the results. I&#x27;ve used it several times now and it consistently performs better than my old dryer in terms of speed of drying and in ease of styling because of the different settings. The air flow is good -- it&#x27;s not a \\&quot;blow me away\\&quot; force, but definitely sufficient to get the job done. The 1875 watts are adequate as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback to me is that it&#x27;s bigger than my old one and doesn&#x27;t have a cordkeeper or a folding handle so it will be more difficult to pack and travel -- but I really love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend: BUY</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t know that Phillips was in the hair drying business, but this is a very good product.  I&#x27;m not sure what else I can add that hasn&#x27;t already been said before, but here goes.    Size: A little on the large size, but not overweight.  Hey, if it&#x27;s too heavy, go hit the gym and work on those guns.  It is a little large to be travel portable however.    Power: 1875 watts goes a long way.  The cold shot works instantaneously and effectively.    Ions: The ionic flow sounds a little gimmicky, but seems to work pretty well.  However, I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s due to the hair dryer itself, or something else.  Add the word \\&quot;nano\\&quot; to anything these days, and it sounds more high-tech.    The cord is nice and long, but I hope Philips makes a cordless Lithium-Ion powered hair dryer next.</li>
            <li> For the price, I felt this was a great hairdryer.  The sleekness of it makes it look more expensive and it&#x27;s lightweight to boot.  I&#x27;m not into fancy, expensive hairdryers for my children b/c we&#x27;re only trying to get their hair dried before they hop into bed... no styling features needed.  I&#x27;m not so particular about having several speeds either.  Just an on/off button is needed here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own a much more expensive hairdryer for myself that has all the features this doesn&#x27;t - now that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s any better (based on the price) it just means I need it to do more things.  For what I needed this dryer for it is PERFECT.</li>
            <li> The ionic feature is nice, and really seems to cut down on the frizz, at least for me.  You know those ions are working because you can smell it... anyone who has owned an ionic air cleaner will know what I&#x27;m talking about (but don&#x27;t worry, it doesn&#x27;t make your hair smell of ions!)  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two speeds are perfect, and the two temperature settings are not too extreme in either direction.  But I&#x27;m a bit confused as to why the product description (at the time of this review) mentions \\&quot;six speeds\\&quot;, unless they are counting the possible combinations of speeds + temperatures or something.  It&#x27;s misleading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is comfortable to hold, and not too heavy, although it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to be a tiny bit lighter.  And as you can see in the photo, it comes with a detachable concentrator nozzle, and a loop on the handle so you can hang it from a hook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great hairdryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Switches:&lt;br /&gt;- SPEED: OFF/ON/FAST&lt;br /&gt;- TEMP: COOL/WARM/HOT&lt;br /&gt;- COLD BLAST BUTTON (Must hold down to use, release to turn off)&lt;br /&gt;- ION ON/OFF</li>
            <li> This hair dryer says that it&#x27;s for home use but it seems more like a professional salon dryer.  It has 6 different settings for airflow and temperature and is a very powerful 1875 watts.  Although it&#x27;s powerful, it&#x27;s relatively quiet.  I was surprised at how quickly it dried my hair, a big time saver in the morning when I&#x27;m in a hurry.  There&#x27;s a slim, concentrator nozzle that you can use to direct the air to a smaller area that&#x27;s great for styling.  This would be a great hair dryer for anyone with thick or long hair because of the power behind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s simple to use, no confusing or useless settings.  Everything is clearly marked. It fits nicely in my hand and even though it&#x27;s a large dryer, it feels light, not heavy.  It just has a feeling of real quality about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has the \\&quot;ionic conditioner\\&quot; feature which I&#x27;m not sure I fully understand the benefit of.  I didn&#x27;t notice anything one way or the other as far as conditioning but they did include a small bottle of Heat Tamer Spray which smells really good. I could smell it even before I opened the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is, quite simply, an excellent hair dryer.  I can highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had another 1875 watt dryer for a couple of years now and been perfectly happy with it, but when I got this TRESemme version I was confident it would be a good replacement for my aging one. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s going to be the case. This morning not only was I late for work because it took longer to dry my hair, I also had a nice case of the frizzies.     This dryer has less power both in the strength of the air current and in the heat temperature than my older dryer and just didn&#x27;t get the job done as well. I kept looking at the switches thinking I didn&#x27;t have it turned up to the highest levels... but I did! To top it off, the grip seems large in diameter and it&#x27;s heavy relative to the one I&#x27;ve been using. I don&#x27;t think someone with petite hands is going to be comfortable holding it. By the time I was done with my blowout (round brushing by section) both my hand and my arm were tired and my elbow is sore.     For someone who is undemanding of their dryer, such as a quick blast and out the door sort of person, this dryer is probably ok. But if you spend a long time straightening with a dryer I don&#x27;t think it is a good choice. There&#x27;s nothing about it that makes me want to toss it in the trash, but it&#x27;s going to be my backup and dog drying blow dryer, not the one I depend on to have great hair every day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the results I get from the Tresemme Philips Thermal Creations hair dryer. It has all the features I like and none of the features I don&#x27;t. The ion function on the hair dryer seems to help keep my hair from frizzing some, but the best results for no frizz blow-dried hair is when you use the Thermal Creation Heat Tamer spray they include in the product packaging. I have mid-back length med-fine straight black hair, and when used in conjunction with with my ceramic/tourmaline hair brush, I can actually get my hair dried practically frizz free and the shine is amazing!</li>
            <li> As someone who rarely uses a hair dryer, I&#x27;m satisfied with the quality of this unit. The sound level and weight are reasonable and it does not get unpleasantly hot.     The once a year hair dryer user like me will be satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice hair dryer -- powerful enough to dry my medium-length extra-dense hair before I get bored and/or tired of holding it up.  As other reviewers have noted, it is rather large, but not very heavy. In fact, it is 9 inches long, which is longer than my last hair dryer, but not unmanageable for me.  However, if I snap on the narrow air flow nozzle, it extends the hair dryer to almost 12 inches.  This is too long for me to use without whacking myself in the head repeatedly.    Luckily, the extra nozzle is not really needed, because the air flow is concentrated enough without it.  I like the rocker-style buttons, which are easy to use even if your hands are damp.  I can&#x27;t vouch for whether the \\&quot;ions\\&quot; make my hair softer -- in fact, my last hair dryer claimed the same function.  When I first started using this hair dryer, I noticed that my hair did seem softer and less frizzy, but some experimentation proved that it was not the hair dryer deserving credit -- but the  free sample of TREsemme Hair Tamer Spray that came with it.  Wow, I think I love that spray even more than the hair dryer!    So, in summary: This is a powerful hair dryer that is not too big for comfortable use, as long as you leave off the extra nozzle.  The buttons are easy to use, and the ion thingies might even soften your hair.  Nothing that blows hot air at your head is going to \\&quot;protect and condition\\&quot; your hair, but TREsemme just picked up a new customer for their Heat Tamer Spray, which apparently does.</li>
            <li> I got this hairdryer to replace my old revlon clunker which was taking forever to dry thick long hair and did not have much of a variety to its settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hairdryer is much bigger than my old one but, surprisingly is also quite a bit lighter. It certainly delivers on strength and heat - I managed to get a sleek blowdry done in less than 20 minutes! It did not end up frying my hair and I didn&#x27;t end up with aching hands from waving it in the air for the whole time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blurb on the info sheet states that the hairdryer has an ION function which produces negatively charged ions which prevent static and flyaway hair. You can turn this function off if you prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It further has a &#x27;nano-diamond ceramic element\\&quot; (??) which is designed to produce a gentler warmth than conventional heating elements. That must be the reason for the non-fried look :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever the technology may be the thing works great. I especialy like:&lt;br /&gt;1. The light weight&lt;br /&gt;2. The multiple settings - hot, warm, cool and high and low&lt;br /&gt;3. Removable air inlet grille. This is a cap with mesh that goes over the mesh covering the air inlet. I can see where this will be useful since, with hairspray and all the other gack that clogs up inlets on hair dryers, you can just pop off the external cap and give it a good cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a good item that I hope to use for many years to come.</li>
            <li> I just needed a new hair dryer as my old one quit on me. I thought this one would be nice because it had the ion feature that I have heard so much about. When I first opened the box, I was surprised at the size. I had an old one that was 6 inches long by 10 inches high (and folded.) This one is 9 inches long by 11 inches high. I liked the little one, BUT on the positive side, it is much less loud than the old one. I thought at first that it was quiet because it wasn&#x27;t as strong. This one dried my hair just as quickly, but with much less noise. i haven&#x27;t bothered with the attachment or the heat settings, as my \\&quot;styling\\&quot; consists of bending over and drying only! There must be some truth to this ions&#x3D;less frizz because my hair was so smooth! I used to skip drying if I could because my hair felt so much better air dried, now I actually use this even if I don&#x27;t have to leave the house. So, this one doesn&#x27;t fit in my drawer as easily as my old one, but I like it so much I got rid of other things to make room for it!</li>
            <li> Lots of hot air, and thats a good thing.      Compared to the old Wahl hairdryer this one has a lot more power, albeit only with two settings (low/high).  However it does have three heat settings, a &#x27;cool&#x27; button, and a switch to turn the ionic part of it on/off.    It is big, but it&#x27;s not unbearable, overall it&#x27;s a decent mid-range hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t you just love the blow dryers that make your hair frizzy, burn and blow it off to never-never land? Neither do I! So I had stopped using them. I came across the Tresemme hairdryer that insisted it would make my hair shinier and frizz-free. It also boasted that, while it would blow dry my hair very quickly, it wouldn&#x27;t have heat-spots. With a 45 day money back guarantee, and a 2 year full warranty, I decided to give this dryer a shot. I&#x27;m so thrilled I did. While the size scared me a little (I have issues with weak wrists/hands), it&#x27;s actually very light and easy to manage. I have very long hair. It took me all of five minutes to dry it - I kid you not. I love the nozzle design on this dryer,too. It disperses the heat, so I don&#x27;t end up with the smell of burnt hair permeating the room. I was impressed with the high flow of air on the fast setting. Usually, I can&#x27;t hear anyone around me when I&#x27;m blow drying my hair. However, this wonderful hair dryer is much more quiet than any others I&#x27;ve used. The low speed is perfect for setting my hair. It&#x27;s a gentle breeze! My hair most definitely didn&#x27;t frizz (a first) and while I didn&#x27;t notice my hair was any shinier than normal, it did feel lighter. I was very impressed as I really put the dryer to the challenge with using it in a very steamy hot/humid bathroom - just after stepping out of the shower. I still can&#x27;t believe it dried my hair so fast. I&#x27;m also thrilled that I didn&#x27;t burn my hair, even with the dryer on the highest setting - right next to my scalp (to give it body). I&#x27;ll update if there are any issues later. For now, I say this is definitely a great buy! You can&#x27;t beat the 45 day money back guarantee or the full 2 year warranty. I&#x27;m happy to see a company standing firmly behind their product. I hope you are as pleased as I am with your purchase! ENJOY!</li>
            <li> I love this dryer!  Although the wattage is the same as my old dryer, the airflow can be set very high, allowing me to dry my casual style in half the time and without heat. It is as quiet as my old dryer, which was marketed for its quietness.  The nozzle is longer than I am accustomed to, but I am sure it will seem normal soon. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer! I&#x27;ve had full size dryers in the past and they were always so heavy. This dryer is actually quite lightweight and easy to hold when drying my below the shoulders thick hair.  As other reviewers have already stated, this dryer has a lot of choices for speed and heat. I give it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Although this is an attractive sleek design, I feel it is more geared for the \\&quot;person drying your hair\\&quot;.  The dryer is with a longer base, and when you attach the nozzle, it makes it that much longer.  Therefore, if you are like me, you do your own hairdrying.  My arms are not long, so this does provide some maneuvering.  The hair dryer seems heavier than an average, and with the size, it is more challenging to pack for a trip, keeping in mind packing with the very long cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachment looks like it should be screwed on, but it snaps on and this isn&#x27;t always an easy shot. I tried and tried to screw it on, then realized it snaps on.  When my hairdryer falls from it&#x27;s ledge, the attachment always comes off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the good thing is the long cord!  The heating and fan settings are adequate.  And, there is an ion switch for control of the frizzies, something I don&#x27;t need to be concerned with.  This seems like a newer feature today and not sure it could be that efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the hairdryer does a good job, high wattage, looks nice....Rizzo</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is comparable in size to most, but is not nearly as heavy. Operation is primarily limited to two simple toggle buttons - Speed: off-low-high; and heat: cool-warm-hot. The speeds are great, with high providing plenty of volume of air movement, without getting the heat too high. The warm setting for heat is also good; it&#x27;s warm enough to dry your hair without being too high and causing damage. I&#x27;ve left the ion setting turned on (back of handle and is not in the way) because it really does keep some of the frizz down. The cool shot button also works well and even gets the air completely cool when the heat setting was on high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great hairdryer. Simple to use and dries your hair without causing damage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy.  I haven&#x27;t used a hair dryer in years.  Recently my girl friend convinced me I needed one for my place so she could do her hair here instead of bringing one with hair.  I agreed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny thing is though, I actually used the hair dryer.  First time in years.  I stopped using hair dryers because it was a pain, your hair would stink, it would get overly hot, and your hair would look bad (at least with the cheap hair dryers I had).  This one has none of those problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can change the setting on the fly, you want to make it hotter?  Push a button, want cool air?  Flip a switch.  Want it to blow like crazy?  Push a button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is so easy, and so intuitive.  My girl friend is now obsessed with it.&lt;br /&gt;And I think I will start using it whenever I need to because its actually pretty fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also note, it is pretty big.  This thing looks serious (and it is) it also looks very stylish.  Even the box.  It is well designed, ergonomic, and makes sense.  All the problems I have ever had with a hair dryer are gone with this hair dryer.  It also has a pretty big cord.  And I have to admit, it looks pretty cool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it. Guy or Girl.</li>
            <li> The TRESemme Phillips hair dryer is a full size, high powered hair drying monster.  The \\&quot;high\\&quot; setting on this thing feels like turbo on your head, and it gets your hair dry fast.  The medium setting is good for styling, and the cool setting is good for setting.  I have long, thick hair and this dryer gets it dry faster than any other i&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint with this unit is its size.  It&#x27;s big and heavy, so it can be hard to handle along with a brush.  Also, it takes up a lot of counter/storage space, especially because the handle doesn&#x27;t fold into the body for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this dryer to someone looking for a full size high powered dryer, but I would warn that if space is an issue, you might want to look for something more compact.</li>
            <li> A number of years ago, I began investing a little more money in better hair dryers, and found I very much like the ceramic dryers.  They seem to dry better, last longer, and my old [[ASIN:B000KXYXKA CONAIR Plimatic 1900 Watts Super Turbo Hair Dryer (Model:CP2002GB)]] has a ceramic barrel and has lasted for years.  It is beginning to show some signs of wear, and it was time to find a new dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The TRESemme Philips HP4990/05 Thermal Creations Hair Dryer seemed to have everything I required from this kind of device:  ceramic, long cord, decent price, various speed and heat settings, and a cold shot button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received my HP4990/05 and first turned it on, I was actually skeptical.  This dryer doesn&#x27;t seem to put out as much heat as my old dryer and its predecessors did.  I worried the amount of time required to dry my long hair would increase because of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needn&#x27;t have worried.  The TRESemme Philips HP4990/05 Thermal Creations Hair Dryer actually seems to dry my hair FASTER than the old unit I used, although it is blowing cooler even at the highest heat setting!  I&#x27;m no expert, but it seems to me that this will be much healthier for my hair - especially considering I wash and dry my hair every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weight of the HP4990/05 is also a little lighter than my old dryer, making it easier to wield, but it doesn&#x27;t feel flimsy or cheap at all.  For those of us who spend a bit of time with our hair dryers, lighter is a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord is nice and long and gives me plenty of room to work - another plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The buttons are positioned well so that I can easily switch heat, speed, or access the cold shot button with my thumb on the same hand that is holding the dryer - no fumbling with the switches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another nice feature for me is that the barrel of the dryer stays pretty cool, no matter how long I&#x27;ve run the dryer at the highest heat setting.  This means less chance of a burned fingertip, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The HP4990/05 touts a feature they call &#x60;Ionic Conditioning&#x27;.  This was a new one on me.  Ionic Conditioning is supposed to keep your hair frizz-free and healthier.  I&#x27;ve been using the dryer for more than a month now and I can say that even with the colder weather in Nashville lately, my hair hasn&#x27;t fallen victim to the frizzies.  Is that from my hair product or the dryer?  Maybe a little of both, but I do believe I see benefit from the Ionic Conditioning feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, my acquisition of the TRESemme Philips HP4990/05 Thermal Creations Hair Dryer is much appreciated.  I would definitely recommend this dryer to others and if I were to lose mine, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy another of the same model.onditioning&#x27;.  This was a new one on me.

            <li> I have always used a cheap hair dryer (usually $15 or less) and can really tell the difference with this one.  This dryer is much quieter and doesn&#x27;t generate nearly as much heat as my cheap one that I have been using.  It dries my hair quickly and does a nice job.  My only reason for not giving it a 5-star rating is the length of the dryer.  I have very short arms and the body of the dryer is so long that I have to hold my arm fully extended to get to my head.  I have very short hair and am placing the air close to my head.  Not a problem, just not ideal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter (age 14) has very long hair and is particular about it (shocking for a teenager, I know). She has also used the dryer multiple times and is very pleased.  She will never go back to using the cheap kind again ... she is spoiled with this one.  Her hair dries faster and she doesn&#x27;t get hot while using this -- both good things.</li>
            <li> coarse hair.  The nose of it is a little long, but the dryer isn&#x27;t heavy.  It dries my shoulder length hair about 7-8 minutes faster then my locally bought standard blow dryer.  I like the attachment that narrows the spout because it seems to make my hair less frizzy.  The only \\&quot;complaint\\&quot; I have is that the filter isn&#x27;t removable.  So it is difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> The TRESemme Thermal Creations Dryer dries my shoulder length hair quickly and easily.  It is easy to operate and has several options for speed and temperature plus an ion function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a heavy dryer.  It feels well built.  The cord is extra long compared to drug store brand hair dryers.  It&#x27;s incredibly loud compared to my generic hair dryer and I wear earplugs while using it.  The loud noise is a trade off with this dryer over quieter dryers as the TRESemme dryer dries hair more quickly than quieter models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this dryer for a few weeks now, I recommend it.  It&#x27;s heavy and loud, but dries hair very quickly!</li>
            <li> This model is light, powerful, and comfortable in hand. I would recommend it over any other hair dryer in this price range.</li>
