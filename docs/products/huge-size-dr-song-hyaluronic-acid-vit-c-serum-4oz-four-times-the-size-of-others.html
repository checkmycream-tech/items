            <li>This product has worked for my skin, I love using this, I love hearing my husband tell my I look stunning..</li>
            <li>I have used better though</li>
            <li>Four times the size of most Hyaluronic Acid &amp; Vitamin C Serums.</li>
            <li>The formula is more on the watery side.</li>
            <li>It is refreshing for me so any issue with the water content or ingredients, I have not complaints whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I love this serum.  </li>
            <li>I know they suggest you use a fancy moisturizer, but I just use it with a basic Aveda moisturizer and it turns it into the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>My skin is softer and complexion is much better.</li>
            <li>I have better tone and texture.</li>
            <li>Used mostly as a moisturizer, hyaluronic acid can hold up to 3,000 times its weight in water.</li>
            <li>I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.  </li>
            <li>My face looked cleaner, brighter, fresher, hydrated, and more even toned.</li>
            <li>My complexion was calmer and I had more of a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>I also looked more awake</li>
            <li>I love this product that I received to review.</li>
            <li>Did I say I LOVE IT????</li>
            <li>This serum seems to help protect my skin from irritation and lock in more moisture.</li>
            <li>My skin feels softer, looks more even toned.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this serum.  </li>
            <li>I was impressed to receive an email with explicit instructions on how to use the serum -- I often have questions about how to use facial products in conjunction with my prescription Renova cream and the instructions explained this and more.  </li>
            <li>really liked that Dr Song&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum was lightweight and was a cool gel like material.  </li>
            <li>The serum went on smooth and did make my face feel more hydrated</li>
            <li>This allows you feel free to share or just make it more of a value because you don&#x27;t have to  purchase so often.  </li>
            <li>So far this is a great serum.</li>
            <li>There is also a significant difference with the fine lines on the sides of my nose that used to bother the living bejezzuz out of me!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hyaluronic acid is safe for even the most sensitive of skin types, making it a popular ingredient for many skin care</li>
            <li>After a week of use, I was noticing a more significant improvement.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>With such amazing benefits, results, and superior customer service</li>
            <li>With such amazing benefits, results, and superior customer service</li>
            <li>Song strongly recommends that you perform a skin patch test before fully using the product to minimize risk of an allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li>would strongly recommend this product, Dr Song Hyaluronic Acid Serum to anyone suffering from acne, acne scars, age spots, freckles, sun spots, wrinkles, crow’s feet, fine lines, and anyone looking toimprove their skin quality, even skin tone, and reduce signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Instantly plump fine lines while reducing the appearance of wrinkles gradually&lt;br /&gt;Add</li>
            <li>Now that I am 53, I look for products to help reduce my fine lines and wrinkles and improve my complexion.</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic Acid + Vit C serum is light and does not have a strong scent.</li>
            <li>Its a clear serum with a light pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I received the package, I was astounded to see how huge it was.</li>
            <li>Huge size, does not seem to work as well as the others on the market.</li>
            <li>Another thing I want to add is that this has NO fillers or parabens, and is a light weight,</li>
            <li>This would be a great present for someone you love.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I received an email from the Dr Song staff thanking me for my purchase and provided detailed directions</li>
            <li>Overall a great addition to my skincare routine.</li>
            <li>...so far so good.</li>
            <li>Song&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum was super easy to use.  </li>
            <li>so I would be able to use my new product correctly and to achieve top results.  </li>
            <li>thank you for the advice as the original bottle was a gift from my sister and had none of those instructions.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>oN mY fACE aRE gETTING sMALLER. lOVING tHIS pRODUCT aLREADY!</li>
            <li>Hopefully that this lunch price stays this way a little longer so that I can purchase more this week at this great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li>I also really liked that this product had a glass dropper which made applying the product easy and helps reduce extra product from being wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In this case, I definitely think it&#x27;s better to be safe than sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If exfoliation is what you need, this is a mild formula.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure there is vinegar in it, it smells like pure vinegar.</li>
            <li>It is good, if you like it to dry faster which it does.</li>
            <li>As it spreads on the skin it is very light, not heavy at all.  </li>
            <li>I want to talk about my personal use, how I applied it, how I liked it, how it worked...</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li>it is worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>/&gt;I am very pleased with the results and I will continue to use this product, Dr Song&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum, as I feel I can actually reach possible goals of better looking skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am very pleased with the results and I will continue to use this product, Dr Song&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum, as I feel I can actually reach possible goals of better looking skin.  </li>
            <li>It is really good for my skin to keep the water in, I highly recommend it.my oily skin finally say goodbye to me.</li>
            <li>Right away my skin felt tighter and toned.  </li>
            <li>I think the Hyaluronic acid pulled the moisturizer right into my skin and kept it there.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This comes in a very large bottle with a dropper.</li>
            <li>product, Dr Song&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum, came in a huge, beautiful, dark blue, glass bottle.  </li>
            <li>Great value, alleviated dry skin in just a few days.</li>
            <li>Although water is the first ingredient listed on the bottle I did not find it watery at all; in fact it kept the integrity of its shape,</li>
            <li>Have been using this for last couple of months and my skin looks better and healthier.</li>
            <li>Shipping was really fast!</li>
            <li>So I am always interested in trying skincare products that help me reduce or eliminate these skin issues instead of just hiding them with makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ten minutes was perfect, my face had completely dried by then, and was ready to be moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You can feel safe purchasing this product on Amazon as Dr Song will refund your money if you are unsatisfied with your product regardless of how much is left.  </li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>It comes in a beautiful clear, dark blue, glass bottle with a easy to use squeeze dispenser.</li>
            <li>Have been using for a couple of weeks and my skin is less flakey, maybe more smooth.</li>
            <li>The original product was like a gel, it was clear and had virtually NO scent.</li>
            <li>I loved the applicator, I can control just how little or how much I want to apply.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s always best to be cautious since Hyaluronic Acid can cause serious adverse effects if not applied properly.  </li>
            <li>I have only been using this product for a short time, I  can&#x27;t say that I am seeing amazing results yet</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>Fast drying.  </li>
            <li>but it feels like it really works</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
            <li>Song believes in their product so much that they offer a 365 day 100%</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles to get rid of</li>
            <li>It really holds the moisture.  </li>
            <li>I purchased two bottles, and noticed that they were both cloudy and had a very unmistakeable bacterial smell in both when opened.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>I applied it and noticed a small difference but not as much as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>It did was watery (I should have paid more attention to the previous reviews) and did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>iTS wORKING pRETTY wELL sO fAR.</li>
            <li>Upon application, it does nothing, no tingling or whatsoever, so I think this is more on the hydration side and less on abrasive chemicals.</li>
            <li>The one thing that made this one better than what I&#x27;d used previously was the</li>
            <li>My skin has more of a bounce, less saggy than before and no breakouts or redness or irritation like you get with some of the others.</li>
            <li>I would like to start off by saying that this is not the first product I&#x27;ve bought/used from the Dr. Song line, but is my first experience with THIS specific item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used hyaluronic acid products before and was stoked to find a product that was so inexpensive with decent reviews.</li>
            <li>The bottle was a very pretty midnight blue color with a silver label.  </li>
            <li>It is of high quality.  </li>
            <li>and their high quality customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>They are selling highly diluted Hacid.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve become pretty familiar with Dr Song Medical products and have tried several.</li>
            <li>This serum is thicker than other hyaluronic serums I&#x27;ve used in the past, which I like because I feel like I&#x27;m able to get more of it on my face (rather than it running between my fingers).</li>
            <li>I apply my alcohol free toner and while it is still wet</li>
            <li>If you calculate the quantity versus the price, this one is worth it and could last you for months depending how often you use it.</li>
            <li>So as Dr Song recommends you should always perform a skin patch test even if you normally don&#x27;t have skin allergies.  </li>
            <li>I can say that it is nourishing and that is enough proof to me that a product is worth spending money on.</li>
            <li>I knew right away that this product would easily last me a while.  </li>
            <li>my face is just bone &amp; skin as I am quite slim.&lt;br /&gt;Bought a few more bottles recently and received an email saying that using once a day is enough and to store it away from sun light and heat....</li>
            <li>It stayed that way for the rest of the night and for the first time in my adult life, I had to admit that my skin wasn&#x27;t bouncing back as it has done my whole life</li>
            <li>live in the Midwest and winter</li>
            <li>I fear I may have just purchased some very clear water in a bottle.  </li>
            <li>Their Amazon page even says you can return the item even if it&#x27;s empty and still get a full refund!&lt;br</li>
            <li>As expected, I didn&#x27;t have a negative reaction and was able to proceed with the full application.  </li>
            <li>The serum was crystal clear and is administered with a dropper.  </li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid should be clear; my bottles were not.</li>
            <li>soon as it arrived in the mail I was pleasantly surprised, I knew this was a 4oz bottle from the description</li>
            <li>It did take a few days to have that smooth affect but its visible and weather</li>
            <li>for all skin types including sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel like I am constantly re-buying the product every couple weeks, which adds up fast.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for several weeks now and am absolutely amazed at how well it is working.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it as directed for nearly 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>The under eye puffiness and dark circles have improved tremendously.  </li>
            <li>It feels like there is nothing at all - no tight mask feeling etc...  </li>
            <li>This makes it much easier to apply and control, and much easier to be less wasteful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The directions are extremely easy to understand, and only has a few step for the application process.</li>
            <li>intense moisture to dry skin</li>
            <li>the next morning my skin feels very soft and supple.</li>
            <li>had it perform as expected and in line with other brands, and I haven&#x27;t found a significant performance difference with brands in general.</li>
            <li>However, the serum was much colder than I had expected.  </li>
            <li>I recently had the opportunity to review Dr. Song Hyaluronic Acid With Vitamin C and so far it is my favorite.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin and it has a calming effect on the red spots on my face.</li>
            <li>I love using this serum, as it has significantly evened out my skin tone and allowed my crazy dry skin to retain moisture!</li>
            <li>After the serum has dried it is recommended to apply a moisturizer right away.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and a little bit goes a long way so this bottle should last a while.</li>
            <li>I also liked that this serum wasn’t watery, thick, greasy, or heavy.  </li>
            <li>little goes a long way and you will definitely get your money’s worth out this product.  </li>
            <li>As recommended I made sure to wash my face and pat dry before applying a thin layer of Dr Song&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum.</li>

            <li> Great customer communication from this company also.  </li>
            <li> But really great price</li>
            <li> I was impressed with how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li> This is a good brand.</li>
            <li> I received the Dr. Song product free for review and was impressed with the size of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> but I feel like this one was not as good.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good to know that we need to use a moisturizer after 5-10</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good functionality.</li>
            <li> This one was good on value and the consistency of the product.</li>
            <li> good exfoliation</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of the hyaluronic acids and this is definately a good one.</li>
            <li> Dr. Song&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum is just as good as all his products.</li>
            <li> I keep it in the fridge and feels so good in the am.</li>
            <li> line of products are really good.</li>
            <li> Why change something that was so good?</li>
            <li> This is basically a super moisturizer, but doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy, which is perfect for combination skin like me.  </li>
            <li> I was very impressed with their quick follow up</li>
            <li> Love love love it!!!  </li>
            <li> Amazing results.</li>
            <li> Goes on really nice.</li>

            <li> I also really liked that this product, Dr Song’s Hyaluronic Acid Serum, has no fillers or parabens.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received this product to review in exchange for my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I combined it with a good skin conditioner and it was soo much better.</li>
            <li> the texture is nice on the face, but have not seen any visible changes yet.</li>
            <li> Dr. Songs line is definitely a sure thing if you want beautiful smooth skin.</li>
            <li> After about 5-10mins a apply my normal mouisturizer, and I had impressive results.</li>
            <li> This has a nice plumping effect and gives the skin a very smooth look.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a fantastic value for a good product.</li>
            <li> think for the price its a good fit for vitamin c serum.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved the original.</li>
            <li> They made a huge mistake with this one!</li>
            <li> but once I received it; it immediately seemed like I got more BANG for my buck</li>
            <li> My skin felt better to the touch.</li>
            <li> This product has worked for my skin, I love using this, I love hearing my husband tell my I look stunning..</li>
            <li> This product has worked for my skin, I love using this, I love hearing my husband tell my I look stunning..</li>
            <li> I have used better though</li>
            <li> Four times the size of most Hyaluronic Acid &amp; Vitamin C Serums.</li>
            <li> The formula is more on the watery side.</li>
            <li> It is refreshing for me so any issue with the water content or ingredients, I have not complaints whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  </li>
            <li> I know they suggest you use a fancy moisturizer, but I just use it with a basic Aveda moisturizer and it turns it into the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> My skin is softer and complexion is much better.</li>
            <li> I have better tone and texture.</li>
            <li> Used mostly as a moisturizer, hyaluronic acid can hold up to 3,000 times its weight in water.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.  </li>
            <li> My face looked cleaner, brighter, fresher, hydrated, and more even toned.</li>
            <li> My complexion was calmer and I had more of a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li> I also looked more awake</li>
            <li> I love this product that I received to review.</li>
            <li> Did I say I LOVE IT????</li>
            <li> This serum seems to help protect my skin from irritation and lock in more moisture.</li>
            <li> My skin feels softer, looks more even toned.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this serum.  </li>
            <li> I was impressed to receive an email with explicit instructions on how to use the serum -- I often have questions about how to use facial products in conjunction with my prescription Renova cream and the instructions explained this and more.  </li>
            <li> really liked that Dr Song&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum was lightweight and was a cool gel like material.  </li>
            <li> The serum went on smooth and did make my face feel more hydrated</li>
            <li> This allows you feel free to share or just make it more of a value because you don&#x27;t have to  purchase so often.  </li>
            <li> So far this is a great serum.</li>
            <li> There is also a significant difference with the fine lines on the sides of my nose that used to bother the living bejezzuz out of me!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hyaluronic acid is safe for even the most sensitive of skin types, making it a popular ingredient for many skin care</li>
            <li> After a week of use, I was noticing a more significant improvement.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> With such amazing benefits, results, and superior customer service</li>
            <li> With such amazing benefits, results, and superior customer service</li>
            <li> Song strongly recommends that you perform a skin patch test before fully using the product to minimize risk of an allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li> would strongly recommend this product, Dr Song Hyaluronic Acid Serum to anyone suffering from acne, acne scars, age spots, freckles, sun spots, wrinkles, crow’s feet, fine lines, and anyone looking toimprove their skin quality, even skin tone, and reduce signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Instantly plump fine lines while reducing the appearance of wrinkles gradually&lt;br /&gt;Add</li>
            <li> Now that I am 53, I look for products to help reduce my fine lines and wrinkles and improve my complexion.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic Acid + Vit C serum is light and does not have a strong scent.</li>
            <li> Its a clear serum with a light pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I received the package, I was astounded to see how huge it was.</li>
            <li> Huge size, does not seem to work as well as the others on the market.</li>
            <li> Another thing I want to add is that this has NO fillers or parabens, and is a light weight,</li>
            <li> This would be a great present for someone you love.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I received an email from the Dr Song staff thanking me for my purchase and provided detailed directions</li>
            <li> Overall a great addition to my skincare routine.</li>
            <li> ...so far so good.</li>
            <li> Song&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum was super easy to use.  </li>
            <li> so I would be able to use my new product correctly and to achieve top results.  </li>
            <li> thank you for the advice as the original bottle was a gift from my sister and had none of those instructions.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> oN mY fACE aRE gETTING sMALLER. lOVING tHIS pRODUCT aLREADY!</li>
            <li> Hopefully that this lunch price stays this way a little longer so that I can purchase more this week at this great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I love having more soft skin.extion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li> I also really liked that this product had a glass dropper which made applying the product easy and helps reduce extra product from being wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In this case, I definitely think it&#x27;s better to be safe than sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If exfoliation is what you need, this is a mild formula.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure there is vinegar in it, it smells like pure vinegar.</li>
            <li> It is good, if you like it to dry faster which it does.</li>
            <li> As it spreads on the skin it is very light, not heavy at all.  </li>
            <li> I want to talk about my personal use, how I applied it, how I liked it, how it worked...</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> it is worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &amp;</li>
            <li> (I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> As a result, hyaluronic acid serums help deliver powerful hydration to the skin in one step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am very pleased with the results and I will continue to use this product, Dr Song&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum, as I feel I can actually reach possible goals of better looking skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am very pleased with the results and I will continue to use this product, Dr Song&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum, as I feel I can actually reach possible goals of better looking skin.  </li>
            <li> It is really good for my skin to keep the water in, I highly recommend it.my oily skin finally say goodbye to me.</li>
            <li> Right away my skin felt tighter and toned.  </li>
            <li> I think the Hyaluronic acid pulled the moisturizer right into my skin and kept it there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This comes in a very large bottle with a dropper.</li>
            <li> product, Dr Song&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum, came in a huge, beautiful, dark blue, glass bottle.  </li>
            <li> Great value, alleviated dry skin in just a few days.</li>
            <li> Although water is the first ingredient listed on the bottle I did not find it watery at all; in fact it kept the integrity of its shape,</li>
            <li> Have been using this for last couple of months and my skin looks better and healthier.</li>
            <li> Shipping was really fast!</li>
            <li> So I am always interested in trying skincare products that help me reduce or eliminate these skin issues instead of just hiding them with makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ten minutes was perfect, my face had completely dried by then, and was ready to be moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You can feel safe purchasing this product on Amazon as Dr Song will refund your money if you are unsatisfied with your product regardless of how much is left.  </li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> It comes in a beautiful clear, dark blue, glass bottle with a easy to use squeeze dispenser.</li>
            <li> Have been using for a couple of weeks and my skin is less flakey, maybe more smooth.</li>
            <li> The original product was like a gel, it was clear and had virtually NO scent.</li>
            <li> I loved the applicator, I can control just how little or how much I want to apply.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s always best to be cautious since Hyaluronic Acid can cause serious adverse effects if not applied properly.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a short time, I  can&#x27;t say that I am seeing amazing results yet</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> Fast drying.  </li>
            <li> but it feels like it really works</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
            <li> Song believes in their product so much that they offer a 365 day 100%</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles to get rid of</li>
            <li> It really holds the moisture.  </li>
            <li> I purchased two bottles, and noticed that they were both cloudy and had a very unmistakeable bacterial smell in both when opened.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> I applied it and noticed a small difference but not as much as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> It did was watery (I should have paid more attention to the previous reviews) and did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li> iTS wORKING pRETTY wELL sO fAR.</li>
            <li> Upon application, it does nothing, no tingling or whatsoever, so I think this is more on the hydration side and less on abrasive chemicals.</li>
            <li> The one thing that made this one better than what I&#x27;d used previously was the</li>
            <li> My skin has more of a bounce, less saggy than before and no breakouts or redness or irritation like you get with some of the others.</li>
            <li> I would like to start off by saying that this is not the first product I&#x27;ve bought/used from the Dr. Song line, but is my first experience with THIS specific item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used hyaluronic acid products before and was stoked to find a product that was so inexpensive with decent reviews.</li>
            <li> The bottle was a very pretty midnight blue color with a silver label.  </li>
            <li> It is of high quality.  </li>
            <li> and their high quality customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> They are selling highly diluted Hacid.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become pretty familiar with Dr Song Medical products and have tried several.</li>
            <li> This serum is thicker than other hyaluronic serums I&#x27;ve used in the past, which I like because I feel like I&#x27;m able to get more of it on my face (rather than it running between my fingers).</li>
            <li> I apply my alcohol free toner and while it is still wet</li>
            <li> If you calculate the quantity versus the price, this one is worth it and could last you for months depending how often you use it.</li>
            <li> So as Dr Song recommends you should always perform a skin patch test even if you normally don&#x27;t have skin allergies.  </li>
            <li> I can say that it is nourishing and that is enough proof to me that a product is worth spending money on.</li>
            <li> I knew right away that this product would easily last me a while.  </li>
            <li> my face is just bone &amp; skin as I am quite slim.&lt;br /&gt;Bought a few more bottles recently and received an email saying that using once a day is enough and to store it away from sun light and heat....</li>
            <li> It stayed that way for the rest of the night and for the first time in my adult life, I had to admit that my skin wasn&#x27;t bouncing back as it has done my whole life</li>
            <li> live in the Midwest and winter</li>
            <li> I fear I may have just purchased some very clear water in a bottle.  </li>
            <li> Their Amazon page even says you can return the item even if it&#x27;s empty and still get a full refund!&lt;br</li>
            <li> As expected, I didn&#x27;t have a negative reaction and was able to proceed with the full application.  </li>
            <li> The serum was crystal clear and is administered with a dropper.  </li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid should be clear; my bottles were not.</li>
            <li> soon as it arrived in the mail I was pleasantly surprised, I knew this was a 4oz bottle from the description</li>
            <li> It did take a few days to have that smooth affect but its visible and weather</li>
            <li> for all skin types including sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel like I am constantly re-buying the product every couple weeks, which adds up fast.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for several weeks now and am absolutely amazed at how well it is working.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it as directed for nearly 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> The under eye puffiness and dark circles have improved tremendously.  </li>
            <li> It feels like there is nothing at all - no tight mask feeling etc...  </li>
            <li> This makes it much easier to apply and control, and much easier to be less wasteful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The directions are extremely easy to understand, and only has a few step for the application process.</li>
            <li> intense moisture to dry skin</li>
            <li> the next morning my skin feels very soft and supple.</li>
            <li> had it perform as expected and in line with other brands, and I haven&#x27;t found a significant performance difference with brands in general.</li>
            <li> However, the serum was much colder than I had expected.  </li>
            <li> I recently had the opportunity to review Dr. Song Hyaluronic Acid With Vitamin C and so far it is my favorite.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin and it has a calming effect on the red spots on my face.</li>
            <li> I love using this serum, as it has significantly evened out my skin tone and allowed my crazy dry skin to retain moisture!</li>
            <li> After the serum has dried it is recommended to apply a moisturizer right away.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and a little bit goes a long way so this bottle should last a while.</li>
            <li> I also liked that this serum wasn’t watery, thick, greasy, or heavy.  </li>
            <li> little goes a long way and you will definitely get your money’s worth out this product.  </li>
            <li> As recommended I made sure to wash my face and pat dry before applying a thin layer of Dr Song&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum.</li>
            <li> hits us pretty hard.</li>
            <li> When I came home I looked in the mirror and my face was red, puffy and really dry.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve read a lot of the reviews; Both the positive and the negative, I would like to talk about my experience with Dr. Songs Hyaluronic Acid With Vitamin C Serum and try to cover every aspect.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hyaluronic acid serums keep the skin soft, supple, firm, and moisturized, which help prevent breakouts and signs of aging on the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Before, I had to be extra careful about what makeup products to use, as I always suffer from dry patches.</li>
            <li> So sad when the Seller, who is also the manufacturer, feels the need to downgrade an honest review in order to protect their ability to sell you cheap, Chinese crap.  </li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid is one of the very few anti-aging products that I have used and clearly know its working.  </li>
            <li> I wear make up or not with Dr. Songs products I don&#x27;t worry about acne or rough dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite sure I received a bad batch.</li>
            <li> Whoa, add a few drops to your daily moisturizer,  and bam!</li>
            <li> It has absolutely no moisture enhancing or clarifying effect on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions and after spreading it thinly on my face, I let t dry and then applied my normal moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> A little bit also goes a long ways I noticed.</li>
            <li> Not slimy at all compared to my other serums.</li>
            <li> , this alone is a complement to the product because; especially in the winter my skin is extremely hard to keep hydrated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Improve appearance of dark under eye circles&lt;br /&gt;Safe</li>
            <li> After seeing the results I wanted to continue by following the directions, I mean why stop at just hydrated skin?...</li>
            <li> In addition, my dark spots and acne scars seemed less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> After washing my face, I applied a small amount of Dr. Song&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin C Serum, let it dry, and applied moisturizer immediately after.</li>
            <li> Slightly fuller which I like otherwise</li>
            <li> I suffer from acne, acne scars, dark spots, and uneven skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I already recommended it to a few of my friends.</li>
            <li> I have been using it at bedtime for a few weeks now and my complexion is improving.</li>
            <li> For me, it was a waste of money and will be returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not effective as previous brands I purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a vital element for me, because I hate spending money on products that barely last a month.  </li>
            <li> Indeed it is a generous portion, and very little is needed.</li>
            <li> Your no better off if you don&#x27;t give it a shot like myself.</li>
            <li> Your no better off if you don&#x27;t give it a shot like myself.</li>
            <li> I had bought a small bottle of this and my husband started using it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually have skin allergies, but I followed directions and completed the skin patch test anyways.  </li>
            <li> I apply it to my face after washing at night, then wait about 10 minutes and apply moisturizer (usually Argan oil).  </li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid is a common ingredient found in skin care products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so thick and silky.  </li>

            <li> Not to mention the artificially inflated reviews.  </li>
            <li> There is a very, very faint acid-like smell, but this product is a dud for me.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about any of their products.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> happy with this product</li>
            <li> I really like this product, I&#x27;ve read a lot of the reviews; Both the positive and the negative, I would like to talk about my experience with Dr. Songs Hyaluronic Acid With Vitamin C Serum and try to cover every aspect. I would like to start off by saying that this is not the first product I&#x27;ve bought/used from the Dr. Song line, but is my first experience with THIS specific item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as it arrived in the mail I was pleasantly surprised, I knew this was a 4oz bottle from the description but once I received it; it immediately seemed like I got more BANG for my buck (And who doesn&#x27;t want that). It comes in a beautiful clear, dark blue, glass bottle with a easy to use squeeze dispenser. The directions are extremely easy to understand, and only has a few step for the application process. Although water is the first ingredient listed on the bottle I did not find it watery at all; in fact it kept the integrity of its shape, A rather not to thin *not to thick jell like texture. Another thing I want to add is that this has NO fillers or parabens, and is a light weight, non greasy formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not I want to talk about my personal use, how I applied it, how I liked it, how it worked... Because that&#x27;s what we all care about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting off... I loved the applicator, I can control just how little or how much I want to apply. I started off by using this as a stand alone product (without moisturizing after). The serum went on smooth and did make my face feel more hydrated, this alone is a complement to the product because; especially in the winter my skin is extremely hard to keep hydrated. After seeing the results I wanted to continue by following the directions, I mean why stop at just hydrated skin?... After about 5-10mins a apply my normal mouisturizer, and I had impressive results. My skin felt radiant, glowing even. My skin felt better to the touch. After continuing this treatment every night, I wake up feeling refreashed with a flawless complextion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend trying this out, it couldn&#x27;t hurt. Your no better off if you don&#x27;t give it a shot like myself. This product has worked for my skin, I love using this, I love hearing my husband tell my I look stunning.. And I love having more soft skin.extion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend trying this out, it couldn&#x27;t hurt. Your no better off if you don&#x27;t give it a shot like myself. This product has worked for my skin, I love using this, I love hearing my husband tell my I look stunning.. And I love having more soft skin.</li>
            <li> This is a good brand. I have used better though</li>
            <li> Easy to apply. Fast drying.  Great under any foundation. Four times the size of most Hyaluronic Acid &amp; Vitamin C Serums. This allows you feel free to share or just make it more of a value because you don&#x27;t have to  purchase so often.  This would be a great present for someone you love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I received the Dr. Song product free for review and was impressed with the size of the bottle.  The company did not skimp.  The bottle was a very pretty midnight blue color with a silver label.  The serum was crystal clear and is administered with a dropper.  As it spreads on the skin it is very light, not heavy at all.  It feels like there is nothing at all - no tight mask feeling etc...  I followed the directions and after spreading it thinly on my face, I let t dry and then applied my normal moisturizer.  Within days, I noticed a difference to my skin.  It appears earthier and clearer.  I have read reviews that say that the product can be mixed with eye cream for around the eyes, so this is something I will give a try.  I am pleases with this product.  It is of high quality.  However, I would follow the directions as I have also read that in order to work it should be used in correlation with your moisturizer. it is worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;BOTTOM217e28e1b787e1ce1b6be8efd594f690&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;Tomoson.com&amp;lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> (I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the package, I was astounded to see how huge it was. If you calculate the quantity versus the price, this one is worth it and could last you for months depending how often you use it. For me, I have always used it every night prior to my moisturizer. The formula is more on the watery side. Not slimy at all compared to my other serums. It is good, if you like it to dry faster which it does. Or sometimes, you can&#x27;t help but wonder about the water content. Upon application, it does nothing, no tingling or whatsoever, so I think this is more on the hydration side and less on abrasive chemicals. It is refreshing for me so any issue with the water content or ingredients, I have not complaints whatsoever. It is what it is and I&#x27;m just thankful I have enough to last me for awhile.</li>
            <li> Great value, alleviated dry skin in just a few days.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a short time, I  can&#x27;t say that I am seeing amazing results yet but I have very deep wrinkles so I will continue to use as my skin is softer and I am hopeful!</li>
            <li> Love the large size and price. Goes on really nice. I use this product every morning and use the 20% Vitamin C serum every night. I recommended this product to my sister and she loves it as well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this serum before but I feel like this one was not as good. It was basically water mixed with glycerin. I just threw the bottle out because it wasn&#x27;t doing what it did before. Not purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for last couple of months and my skin looks better and healthier. Slightly fuller which I like otherwise my face is just bone &amp; skin as I am quite slim.&lt;br /&gt;Bought a few more bottles recently and received an email saying that using once a day is enough and to store it away from sun light and heat....thank you for the advice as the original bottle was a gift from my sister and had none of those instructions.&lt;br /&gt;Also it&#x27;s good to know that we need to use a moisturizer after 5-10 mins.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a fantastic value for a good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used C serum for over a year now and I&#x27;m convinced of it&#x27;s good functionality. This C serum was bought when I decided I wanted to refill my smaller travel containers. The one thing that made this one better than what I&#x27;d used previously was the consistency-- it&#x27;s a bit of a gel rather than a watery liquid. This makes it much easier to apply and control, and much easier to be less wasteful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had it perform as expected and in line with other brands, and I haven&#x27;t found a significant performance difference with brands in general. This one was good on value and the consistency of the product.</li>
            <li> noticably clearer and brighter skin  some lightening of &amp;#34;age spot&amp;#34;  good exfoliation</li>
            <li> After using for about 4 weeks now, my skin is brighter and softer along my face and neck. Good product.</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  It makes my skin radiant and minimizes my pores.  I know they suggest you use a fancy moisturizer, but I just use it with a basic Aveda moisturizer and it turns it into the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the results this product gave me, also with the customer support!  My skin is softer and complexion is much better. I already recommended it to a few of my friends.</li>
            <li> iTS wORKING pRETTY wELL sO fAR. i&#x27;VE aLREADY nOTICED tHAT mY pORES oN mY fACE aRE gETTING sMALLER. lOVING tHIS pRODUCT aLREADY!</li>
            <li> This is basically a super moisturizer, but doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy, which is perfect for combination skin like me.  If you have combination skin, this is a godsend. seriously.</li>
            <li> This comes in a very large bottle with a dropper. Its a clear serum with a light pleasant smell. It goes on smoothly and a little bit goes a long way so this bottle should last a while. I have tried a lot of the hyaluronic acids and this is definately a good one. I have better tone and texture. My skin has more of a bounce, less saggy than before and no breakouts or redness or irritation like you get with some of the others. This won&#x27;t change your face overnight but after using it over a month I can definitely see results.</li>
            <li> Wanted to like this for the price, but ended up returning it. Not effective as previous brands I purchase.</li>
            <li> Dr. Song&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum is just as good as all his products. Dr. Songs line is definitely a sure thing if you want beautiful smooth skin. It did take a few days to have that smooth affect but its visible and weather I wear make up or not with Dr. Songs products I don&#x27;t worry about acne or rough dry skin. I have my family members using his products also and they are now seeing great results. Beautiful skin starts with quality products. Hopefully that this lunch price stays this way a little longer so that I can purchase more this week at this great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  thank you&lt;br /&gt;  G.Kelley</li>
            <li> just started using this - but it feels like it really works - I am anxious to see the results !~</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do much. Also, I spilled a small amount on beige carpet, wiped it off, then found a stain there that&#x27;s proving to be very hard to remove.</li>
            <li> It is really good for my skin to keep the water in, I highly recommend it.my oily skin finally say goodbye to me. I will buy it again definitely .</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid is one of the very few anti-aging products that I have used and clearly know its working.  Best thing of all, it won&#x27;t break the bank!</li>
            <li> I keep it in the fridge and feels so good in the am. Skin feels tighter and use it with my dermaroĺler. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid is a common ingredient found in skin care products. Used mostly as a moisturizer, hyaluronic acid can hold up to 3,000 times its weight in water. As a result, hyaluronic acid serums help deliver powerful hydration to the skin in one step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic acid serums keep the skin soft, supple, firm, and moisturized, which help prevent breakouts and signs of aging on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic acid is safe for even the most sensitive of skin types, making it a popular ingredient for many skin care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instantly plump fine lines while reducing the appearance of wrinkles gradually&lt;br /&gt;Add intense moisture to dry skin&lt;br /&gt;Instant glowing complexion&lt;br /&gt;Improve appearance of dark under eye circles&lt;br /&gt;Safe for all skin types including sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This line of products are really good. I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about any of their products. I washed my face and used a vitamin c serum followed by their hyaluronic serum and then the rose water. I have seen the change in my skin since I have been using this products.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I had bought a small bottle of this and my husband started using it. So I decided to buy the family size. Shipping was really fast!</li>
            <li> ...so far so good. Goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.  I suffer from acne, acne scars, dark spots, and uneven skin tone.  I hide behind pounds of concealer and foundation to help disguise these skin flaws.  So I am always interested in trying skincare products that help me reduce or eliminate these skin issues instead of just hiding them with makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately after I placed my order on Amazon I received an email from the Dr Song staff thanking me for my purchase and provided detailed directions so I would be able to use my new product correctly and to achieve top results.  I was very impressed with their quick follow up and their high quality customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product, Dr Song&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum, came in a huge, beautiful, dark blue, glass bottle.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how big the bottle was.  I knew right away that this product would easily last me a while.  This is a vital element for me, because I hate spending money on products that barely last a month.  I feel like I am constantly re-buying the product every couple weeks, which adds up fast.  I also really liked that this product had a glass dropper which made applying the product easy and helps reduce extra product from being wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr Song strongly recommends that you perform a skin patch test before fully using the product to minimize risk of an allergic reaction.  I don&#x27;t usually have skin allergies, but I followed directions and completed the skin patch test anyways.  As expected, I didn&#x27;t have a negative reaction and was able to proceed with the full application.  However, it&#x27;s always best to be cautious since Hyaluronic Acid can cause serious adverse effects if not applied properly.  So as Dr Song recommends you should always perform a skin patch test even if you normally don&#x27;t have skin allergies.  In this case, I definitely think it&#x27;s better to be safe than sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr Song&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum was super easy to use.  As recommended I made sure to wash my face and pat dry before applying a thin layer of Dr Song&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum. Dr Song&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum recommends that you leave the serum on for ten minutes to fully soak into your skin.  After the serum has dried it is recommended to apply a moisturizer right away.  Ten minutes was perfect, my face had completely dried by then, and was ready to be moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked that Dr Song&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum was lightweight and was a cool gel like material.  However, the serum was much colder than I had expected.  I also liked that this serum wasn’t watery, thick, greasy, or heavy.  Right away my skin felt tighter and toned.  I also noticed that my face looked brighter and fresher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple days is when I started to notice a difference.  My face looked cleaner, brighter, fresher, hydrated, and more even toned. In addition, my dark spots and acne scars seemed less noticeable.  After a week of use, I was noticing a more significant improvement.  My complexion was calmer and I had more of a healthy glow.  I also looked more awake and well rested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way and you will definitely get your money’s worth out this product.  I could definitely see this product easily lasting five or six months.  I also really liked that this product, Dr Song’s Hyaluronic Acid Serum, has no fillers or parabens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr Song believes in their product so much that they offer a 365 day 100% no hassle money back guarantee.  You can feel safe purchasing this product on Amazon as Dr Song will refund your money if you are unsatisfied with your product regardless of how much is left.  Their Amazon page even says you can return the item even if it&#x27;s empty and still get a full refund!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would strongly recommend this product, Dr Song Hyaluronic Acid Serum to anyone suffering from acne, acne scars, age spots, freckles, sun spots, wrinkles, crow’s feet, fine lines, and anyone looking toimprove their skin quality, even skin tone, and reduce signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the results and I will continue to use this product, Dr Song&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum, as I feel I can actually reach possible goals of better looking skin.  With such amazing benefits, results, and superior customer service I fully recommend this product and this brand.their skin quality, even skin tone, and reduce signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the results and I will continue to use this product, Dr Song&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum, as I feel I can actually reach possible goals of better looking skin.  With such amazing benefits, results, and superior customer service I fully recommend this product and this brand.</li>
            <li> I think this is one of the best products I have ever used!!</li>
            <li> I love this product that I received to review. I have been using this product for over a month and have had very good results with this product. I wash my face with a scrub than apply and the next morning my skin feels very soft and supple. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Whoa, add a few drops to your daily moisturizer,  and bam! Amazing results.</li>
            <li> I received this product to review in exchange for my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in the Midwest and winter hits us pretty hard. I went out one day running errands, it was really, really cold( like below zero with windshield). When I came home I looked in the mirror and my face was red, puffy and really dry. It stayed that way for the rest of the night and for the first time in my adult life, I had to admit that my skin wasn&#x27;t bouncing back as it has done my whole life and I needed to do something about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had received the Dr Song Hyaluronic Acid with vitamin C and after reading about how it actually holds moisture into the skin, I knew that now was the time to take it out and give it a try. I applied it and noticed a small difference but not as much as I would have liked. I combined it with a good skin conditioner and it was soo much better. I think the Hyaluronic acid pulled the moisturizer right into my skin and kept it there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do want to specify that this product is actually made for anti-aging, not for moisturizing your skin. I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles to get rid of so I cant say it will work miracles on wrinkles but just seeing the improvement of how my skin feels and looks I can say that it is nourishing and that is enough proof to me that a product is worth spending money on.</li>
            <li> Now that I am 53, I look for products to help reduce my fine lines and wrinkles and improve my complexion. I&#x27;ve become pretty familiar with Dr Song Medical products and have tried several. I recently had the opportunity to review Dr. Song Hyaluronic Acid With Vitamin C and so far it is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Hyaluronic Acid + Vit C serum is light and does not have a strong scent. I was impressed with how easy it is to use. After washing my face, I applied a small amount of Dr. Song&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin C Serum, let it dry, and applied moisturizer immediately after. I have been using it at bedtime for a few weeks now and my complexion is improving. It doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin and it has a calming effect on the red spots on my face. I will continue to use this product and recommend it to my friends and family!</li>
            <li> Indeed it is a generous portion, and very little is needed. If exfoliation is what you need, this is a mild formula. Have been using for a couple of weeks and my skin is less flakey, maybe more smooth. I will continue to use the product.</li>
            <li> I love using this serum, as it has significantly evened out my skin tone and allowed my crazy dry skin to retain moisture! I use it in the mornings and at night under my repair cream and I could not be happier with my results. Before, I had to be extra careful about what makeup products to use, as I always suffer from dry patches. There is also a significant difference with the fine lines on the sides of my nose that used to bother the living bejezzuz out of me! I’m so happy with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> Love love love it!!!  Did I say I LOVE IT????</li>
            <li> A great product for face</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I am very happy with all my purchases from Dr Song.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> I tried without one .didn&#x27;t see results till I combined the two.awesome.i think for the price its a good fit for vitamin c serum.</li>
            <li> So far this is a great serum. After I was my face I apply my alcohol free toner and while it is still wet I apply this serum. I let it soak in and then apply my Dr. Song benzoyl peroxide gel. After everything dries I apply my moisturizer. This serum seems to help protect my skin from irritation and lock in more moisture.</li>
            <li> the texture is nice on the face, but have not seen any visible changes yet. this is something to use for a while before noticing any changes. i intend to do just that</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several weeks now and am absolutely amazed at how well it is working.  My skin feels softer, looks more even toned.  The under eye puffiness and dark circles have improved tremendously.  The best results for any eye product I have ever tried.  I will continue to use Dr. Song and recommend anyone to give it try.  You will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this serum.  It&#x27;s so thick and silky.  I apply it to my face after washing at night, then wait about 10 minutes and apply moisturizer (usually Argan oil).  It really holds the moisture.  Great customer communication from this company also.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This has a nice plumping effect and gives the skin a very smooth look.  A little bit also goes a long ways I noticed. Overall a great addition to my skincare routine.</li>
            <li> Used it twice. It did was watery (I should have paid more attention to the previous reviews) and did absolutely nothing.  I can&#x27;t find it.  I think I threw it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my order.  The product arrived on time.  I was impressed to receive an email with explicit instructions on how to use the serum -- I often have questions about how to use facial products in conjunction with my prescription Renova cream and the instructions explained this and more.  This serum is thicker than other hyaluronic serums I&#x27;ve used in the past, which I like because I feel like I&#x27;m able to get more of it on my face (rather than it running between my fingers).</li>
            <li> I am so incredibly unhappy about this product. I absolutely loved the original. Why they changed it, I don&#x27;t know... I wish they wouldn&#x27;t have because they lost  a customer, actually 4 customers. The original product was like a gel, it was clear and had virtually NO scent. The new product is like water, it is cloudy and smells horrible. I&#x27;m going to do a review on youtube so people can see the difference. I&#x27;m pretty sure there is vinegar in it, it smells like pure vinegar. If it isn&#x27;t broke..... Why change something that was so good? They made a huge mistake with this one! Just horrible.</li>
            <li> I fear I may have just purchased some very clear water in a bottle.  There is a very, very faint acid-like smell, but this product is a dud for me.  It has absolutely no moisture enhancing or clarifying effect on my skin.  I have been using it as directed for nearly 2 weeks. It does not tingle when applied or sting even when coming into contact with a break in the skin.  For me, it was a waste of money and will be returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  So sad when the Seller, who is also the manufacturer, feels the need to downgrade an honest review in order to protect their ability to sell you cheap, Chinese crap.  Not to mention the artificially inflated reviews.  No way this product does anything for anyone.  They are selling highly diluted Hacid.  With the \\&quot;introductory sale\\&quot; price that has gone on for months and months.  Also, BEWARE:  took me several emails to the seller and then finally Amazon intervention before I was refunded as per this Seller&#x27;s 100% satisfaction guarantee. AND it does not come in a box as pictured.  Try Earth Science Hacid instead.</li>
            <li> Huge size, does not seem to work as well as the others on the market. But really great price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite sure I received a bad batch. I&#x27;ve used hyaluronic acid products before and was stoked to find a product that was so inexpensive with decent reviews. I purchased two bottles, and noticed that they were both cloudy and had a very unmistakeable bacterial smell in both when opened. Hyaluronic acid should be clear; my bottles were not. I have no doubt that there was bacterial contamination in these bottles, and therefore have not applied any to my face. Therefore, I cannot tell you about the effectiveness of this product.</li>
