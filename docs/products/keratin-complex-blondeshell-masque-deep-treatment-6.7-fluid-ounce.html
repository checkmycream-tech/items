    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Does a wonderful job of toning and turning your hair into silk!</li>
            <li>Great product for damaged hair!</li>
            <li>And for those things, it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Great product and packaging</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>Great customer service, another reason to buy from them again.</li>
            <li>Great toning conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Very nice hair masque.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for fine hair and blondes!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>I would prefer if this mask smelled better, but it does what it says: making cooler blondes or even brunettes look their best by removing any warm tones/brassiness from your hair and nourishes it.</li>
            <li>And I have tried MANY!  </li>
            <li>But the smell is not as appealing.</li>
            <li>Love this products.</li>
            <li>It also has no sodium chloride, so it&#x27;s safe for those of us who have had the Keratin Infusion done at the salon</li>
            <li>Works exceptionally well on blonde hair.</li>
            <li>This is awesome!,,,  I have dark hair but crave blonde highlights.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner made my dry frizzy hair so smooth, more so than any hair mask I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>I love this product - I am a natural blonde /grey and it keeps my hair super smooth and shiney.</li>
            <li>-Light purple product, not true toning as with the shampoo&lt;br /&gt;-Perfumed, not unpleasant but quite strong</li>
            <li>It also seems to make my grey roots that start to show in between colorings llok better.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t very conditioning &amp;</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This adds so much moisture to your hair and makes growing your hair out so much easier.</li>
            <li>For real.  </li>
            <li>Good product - it toned down my brassy blonde color.</li>
            <li>I use the Blondeshell Keratin Complex regular shampoo and conditioner because they do a great job of helping preserve the results of salon keratin treatments and because they really work to help take the brassiness out of my highlighted hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought this deep conditioning masque for times when my hair is feeling very damaged or to add a bit more keratin to my hair when it&#x27;s been a while since my last treatment.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The scent/smell could be better tho, smells a little bleachy</li>
            <li>If your hair gets too brassy like mine does from being in the sun all the time (I live in Nevada), then this is the answer for you.  </li>
            <li>For young looking hair I give this 5 stars!</li>
            <li>This conditioner works very well and brightens the blonde.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t advise using it as a regular conditioner, unless you have super duper dry hair all the time.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve used better and worse</li>
    </ol>

            <li> , I&#x27;ve used better and worse</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for dried out bleach blondes who need to de-frizz and tone.</li>
            <li> I have blonde dry hair and this helps repair and maintain my unruly hair.</li>
            <li> My only caution is this: if your hair doesn&#x27;t truly need a deep conditioning treatment...if it isn&#x27;t really dry, this can be too heavy.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my hair conditioned and at the same time does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m tempted to try other brands instead.</li>
            <li> The purple hue also toned down my brassiness.  </li>

            <li> I have that textured hair that frizzes up the minute there is even the slightest bit of moisture in the air. This is a great product. It keeps my hair conditioned and at the same time does not weigh it down. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> -Light purple product, not true toning as with the shampoo&lt;br /&gt;-Perfumed, not unpleasant but quite strong&lt;br /&gt;-Decent conditioner, I&#x27;ve used better and worse</li>

            <li> I use it instead of conditioner and I also do a weekly mask. My hair has improved a lot. I&#x27;ll keep buying it. Great customer service, another reason to buy from them again.</li>
            <li> Great product for damaged hair! I have blonde dry hair and this helps repair and maintain my unruly hair. The scent/smell could be better tho, smells a little bleachy</li>
            <li> Product (from Flosale) arrived damaged -- do not buy.</li>
            <li> Love this products. Makes your hair shiny and blonde highlights look refreshed and shiny</li>
            <li> Great toning conditioner.  If your hair gets too brassy like mine does from being in the sun all the time (I live in Nevada), then this is the answer for you.  It also has no sodium chloride, so it&#x27;s safe for those of us who have had the Keratin Infusion done at the salon</li>

At least it can be for me.  I wouldn&#x27;t advise using it as a regular conditioner, unless you have super duper dry hair all the time.  But for those times that you&#x27;ve fried your hair with styling or the sun, it works like a charm.  Usually with just one use.</li>

            <li> This is awesome!,,,  I have dark hair but crave blonde highlights.  This makes my hair so radiant.  For real.  Just saying.</li>
