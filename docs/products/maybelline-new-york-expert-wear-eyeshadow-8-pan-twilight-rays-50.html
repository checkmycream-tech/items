            <li>This is my favorite eyeshadow palette.</li>
            <li>absolutely love it, buying more than one.</li>
            <li>I love colours but the quality is not what I would expect from Maybelline.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think I will be able to continue using this.</li>
            <li>I love this palette.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I found it here!</li>
            <li>I love all the Fall colors, and all of these work perfectly with each other to create really lovely effects.</li>
            <li>it goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>the shadows easily to put into a magnetic palette.</li>
            <li>Easy application&lt;</li>
            <li>the colors are perfect for my hazel eyes and dark hair</li>
            <li>But the product was fine.</li>
            <li>Nice and has all the colors that i will ever use, i am not a big makeup fan and this pallet has nice neutral colors.</li>
            <li>This product is really small... but works great!</li>
            <li>For this most part the colors are ok but there are a few that are so bright and metallic that I am scared to even try to wear them.</li>
            <li>But, overall it&#x27;s worth the cost and is a great natural look which I love!</li>
            <li>The color density is excellent, the price is good -- you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It creates a really nice natural look and the color lasts</li>
            <li>Some are matt and some have a touch of sparkle, so it is so much fun to play around with them for every day or even special occasions.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and was exactly as listed!</li>
            <li>but its smaller :P, fast shipping &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>and I continue to use this every day even though I have higher end shadows at my fingertips!</li>
            <li>I like the small size and the colors a very good for me, I took it on a trip and it was great to have all the colors in one small pack.</li>
            <li>Great for everyday wear</li>
            <li>I rarely throw eyeshadows away</li>
            <li>This colors are perfect for blue or green eyes, the summerish, fallish colors are just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>Though these colors are quite pretty in the pan, they don&#x27;t quite do it for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pretty colors for fall/winter.</li>
            <li>I like the product, it is pretty small but its good for in your bag or purse.</li>
            <li>I love every single color</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very quite shimmery....</li>
            <li>i was very disapointed when i received my package.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like no matter how much i dig my brush or even my finger in the shadow</li>
            <li>The green is earthy with a nice iridescence.  </li>
            <li>The colors are really nice, but you have to use a lot of the product for a few of the colors.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>One of the colours, the very top right is an insipid limey green, which probably doesnt matter much as half of the powder is missing.&lt;br /&gt;Poor</li>
            <li>/&gt;That being said, once the colors are actually on they have nice pigmentation and are really long lasting.</li>
            <li>I had to go through the online because I live in a dorm, and I cannot go to out to the drug store.</li>
            <li>This is obviously a very old palette.</li>
            <li>The first time I purchased it I got it from a local store in my area.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve basically been using the end of my brush to scrape some powder loose and then picking up the fallout since that&#x27;s the only way I&#x27;ve been able to really pick up enough color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I could have plenty of color choices and have only one so as not to take up so much space in my makeup bag.  </li>
            <li>the package is really small which is just fine based on the price.  </li>
            <li>color payoff was only good in about half of the shadows and even in those it was quite chalky and not easy to blend.</li>

            <li> not only were the eyeshadows broken and not usable</li>
            <li> It also arrived without the paper packaging which I was not happy about.</li>
            <li> but they had also spread around other items and ruined them with the coloured dust :-(</li>
            <li> Am a little disappointed</li>

            <li> Product looks nothing like the one in the picture. It&#x27;s not what I was expecting at all. This is obviously a very old palette. It has no pigmentation whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Loved this pallet. Nice and has all the colors that i will ever use, i am not a big makeup fan and this pallet has nice neutral colors. They also look nice when i wear them.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because it contained so many colors that work for me.  I wanted something to have in my travel case so I could have plenty of color choices and have only one so as not to take up so much space in my makeup bag.  It has both matte and sparkly colors so great for any occasion!  Price was good too!</li>
            <li> Love them. Used them for years. Cannot find in stores.</li>
            <li> Arrived with the security lapel opened. Interior plastic lid was scratched and smeared so obviously someone had returned it before.  One of the colours, the very top right is an insipid limey green, which probably doesnt matter much as half of the powder is missing.&lt;br /&gt;Poor quality shimmery powders that do not colour well, nor do they stay on for more than a minute. I have used plenty of Maybelline in my time but I do NOT recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like the product, it is pretty small but its good for in your bag or purse. The colors are really nice, but you have to use a lot of the product for a few of the colors. It works well with blue eyes.</li>
            <li> Very good cosmetic. Makeup excellent, durable and has nice range of colors. I recommend it to everyone. I love the brand</li>
            <li> This product is really small... but works great! It is was it says... crease proof and it&#x27;s pigmented! Great for everyday wear</li>
            <li> Though these colors are quite pretty in the pan, they don&#x27;t quite do it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color payoff was only good in about half of the shadows and even in those it was quite chalky and not easy to blend.

            <li> Nice smooth color.  Good for the price.</li>
            <li> I just love maybelline!!! It&#x27;s great!!! The color stays for hours and thats what we All women need. So buy it!!!</li>
            <li> I love the colors for this. But it&#x27;s smaller than I expected so that sucks. Also, the brushes aren&#x27;t very good so you&#x27;ll definetly need your own. But, overall it&#x27;s worth the cost and is a great natural look which I love!</li>

            <li> This is my favorite eyeshadow palette. The first time I purchased it I got it from a local store in my area.

            <li> I did not like this shadow at all. I rarely throw eyeshadows away but I don&#x27;t think I will be able to continue using this. It&#x27;s like no matter how much i dig my brush or even my finger in the shadow it does not come out or even show on my skin. So I&#x27;ll pass on this one.</li>
            <li> I like the small size and the colors a very good for me, I took it on a trip and it was great to have all the colors in one small pack.</li>
            <li> 1. Came early&lt;br /&gt;2. Perfect neutrals for any occasion&lt;br /&gt;3. Somewhat inexpensive for eight colors&lt;br /&gt;4. Sparkle and matte&lt;br /&gt;5. Easy application&lt;br /&gt;6. PERFECT</li>
            <li> I love these colors! They&#x27;re really soft and pack a lot of color with not a whole lot of powder. I don&#x27;t use the applicators, I find that a brush is much more effective.</li>
            <li> This product was TINY!!! For this price I expected a bigger pallet. I waited a week for this tiny thing. I am kinda disappointed</li>
            <li> The colors are great. I love this palette.</li>
            <li> I think that this set is especially beautiful for brown or hazel eyes. I love all the Fall colors, and all of these work perfectly with each other to create really lovely effects. They blend very nicely! Some are matt and some have a touch of sparkle, so it is so much fun to play around with them for every day or even special occasions. The color density is excellent, the price is good -- you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
