            <li>Very beautiful and classy!!</li>
            <li>This is a great way to push long hair out of your face -- a perfectly beautiful headband -- feminine but not over the top.  </li>
            <li>Its cute though</li>
            <li>Quality is okay -</li>
            <li>It is much more bulky and &amp;#34;child&amp;#34; looking.</li>
            <li>I will probably buy more for myself or gifts.</li>

            <li>We really love the headband.</li>
            <li>I got many compliments on it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Ok, I can understand why some people were upset that it was not as pictured.  </li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t complain considering the price :)</li>
            <li>Very 1920&#x27;s Great Gatsby.</li>
            <li>Took too long to get here, but its a great deal!</li>
            <li>Very cute but came unsewed the First time I wore it</li>
            <li>so they don&#x27;t look like floating rhinestones as pictured, but the black adds great contrast against my hair and with the bright sparkly stones.</li>
            <li>The picture looks more freestyle and elegant while what i received was pretty but looked like something out of a cookie cutter factory...</li>
            <li>Cute, but broke quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty and comfy!</li>
            <li>Very pretty!</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>So pretty, love this item.  </li>
            <li>I got this in less than two weeks which was great since I ended up being able to wear it to a special event.</li>
            <li>If you want this item for a special occasion, I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li>It is true that the stones are not as organically placed.  </li>
            <li>very pretty for a special occasion</li>
            <li>Gems fall of quickly.</li>
            <li>It is very pretty</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty</li>
            <li>This piece is very pretty.</li>
            <li>Bought the white one first and it was gorgeous.</li>
            <li>Pretty, but it broke after wearing it in my hair all day!</li>
            <li>This item was a great accessory to my little daughter&#x27;s dress on her school dance.</li>
            <li>It was cheap but it seems to be cute enough that no one will notice how it&#x27;s made.  </li>
            <li>I really get excited when i  saw the picture, but when i recieved it, is easy to see that is not the same, it has less stones, it doesnt look as elegant, and the material is very cheap.</li>
            <li>This piece is a little snug on my adult noggin, but fits my 8 year old perfect.</li>
            <li>I had higher expectations.  </li>
            <li>This is a great accessory for both long and short hair.</li>
            <li>Product look exactly like picture shown, took about 2 weeks to arrive.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s its really pretty.</li>
            <li>It is so sparkly and pretty.</li>
            <li>Really pretty</li>
            <li>Broke the first time I used</li>
            <li>Pretty</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was hair</li>
            <li>Pretty princess sometimes I like to be a girly girl</li>
            <li>I had been looking for a headband for my New Years Eve formal party for about a month and all I could find were very juvenile/girlish headbands, or headbands that were cheap looking.</li>
            <li>The black netting of the headband itself is kind of falling apart.</li>
            <li>I really need to have something to wear in 2 days</li>
            <li>It looks much nicer in the picture than what I received.</li>
            <li>I have light blonde hair</li>
            <li>Very fancy &amp; vintage looking.</li>
            <li>It is much more durable than I expected.</li>
            <li>I really do like this headband</li>
            <li>I would have been very disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You have to be careful to make sure not to get your hair tangled in the diamonds though.</li>
            <li>It really dresses up your hair style.</li>
            <li>but it was the cheap thread they used to sew the jewels on, and the jewels were sewed on crooked.</li>
            <li>and this headband make me feel that way I received so much compliment on it, one of my co-worker wanted</li>
            <li>When I saw this one, the first thing I liked about it was they elastic band is just long enough that it doesn&#x27;t take up the majority of the space on your head (if that makes sense..??)</li>
            <li>I gave this a 3 because i got many compliments on it, but the headband broke easily after only a few hours of wear.  </li>
            <li>Rhinestones are a bit loose but easily tightened.</li>
            <li>So beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;It looks like a flat tiara, so pretty, looks very pricey</li>
            <li>First of all what I expected was It to be exactly like in the picture</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty headband but the rhinestones are in a different configuration than in the pic.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t mind that so much, but when I finally did receive it, it wasn&#x27;t quite the same as in the picture, and as soon as I went to try it on literally right after opening, it broke.</li>
            <li>My daughter is the head drum major in her high school band and needed a headband that would stand out.</li>
            <li>I wore my hair in an up-do similar to the picture, but I did also try it on with my hair down and it seemed to stay in place and looked very nice without making me look like a little girl.</li>
            <li>, I just have a hard time with headband staying on even the regular kind tend to give me a headache</li>
            <li>I really like this- nice quality, rhinestones are sparkly but it runs a little small.</li>
            <li>One stone was loose in the package when I got it;  another 2 fell off the first day I wore it.  </li>
            <li>The gemstone section of the headband has lots of loose strings, and the gemstones aren&#x27;t secured very well - some are turned sideways.</li>
            <li>The stones are actually attached to a white netting material and they are in a very symmetrical pattern instead of being more randomly placed like the picture.</li>
            <li>The other thing is, the gems are really sparkly, without looking tacky and they are secured onto the headband on a piece of &amp;#34;mesh-like&amp;#34; material, so it still allows your hair to show thru.</li>
            <li>A little large on the head.  </li>

            <li> This is definitely not what i expected, BUT it is useable.  </li>
            <li> Poor quality and not even worth the couple bucks</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thin that i really like was the elastic.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love it, but it was uncomfortable, and some of the stones were missing when it arrived.</li>
            <li> Hard to see this from far away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shipping was a lot faster than expected.</li>
            <li> The head band is not as wide as the one shown.  </li>
            <li> but it took 2 moré weeks than expected delivery date and</li>
            <li> did look at the other reviews before purchasing, so</li>
            <li> and I feel like I have to be very careful not to break it</li>
            <li> She has dark brown hair</li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t get me wrong, but i really was hoping it would look like the picture.  </li>
            <li> Her uniform has black in it</li>
            <li> so we went ahead and bought the black one too.</li>
            <li> rhinestones on black netting with elastic band under hairline at nape of neck.</li>
            <li> The black mesh is a bit stringy.</li>
            <li> It is just black elastic surrounding it</li>
            <li> Really tight on my head...</li>
            <li> She is rough on headbands and broke the black one by pulling too hard.</li>
            <li> It has a little give</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t what I thought it would be a little to flimsy.</li>
            <li> kinda reminds me of the stuff the little round cheeses come in but black and a narrow knit.  </li>
            <li> I have an average to small sized head and this fits a little tight.</li>
            <li> When looking closely, I can see that there are 2 missing jewels.</li>
            <li> and i got compliments on it, so at least other people like it.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews and it seems to be common for this company.</li>
            <li> when I took it out of the bag 2 stores fell, if you have in mind what you pay for then you won&#x27;t be disappointed because they are pretty</li>
            <li> but I believe that patience is a virtue, so if u need give your self at least 3 weeks to get it.</li>
            <li> But shoddy workmanship.</li>
            <li> Just not very great as the company is shipping their product with missed parts.</li>
            <li> It is unlikely that anyone can pull off this head band past the age of 15.</li>
            <li> I must also say it&#x27;s a very delicate piece because of the intricate details.</li>
            <li> Too bad - I like to look like a princess!  </li>

            <li> Was falling apart the momment i got it</li>
            <li> The gemstone section of the headband has lots of loose strings, and the gemstones aren&#x27;t secured very well - some are turned sideways.</li>
            <li> I wore it as a headband for a flapper-style headband. It was perfect! Stretchy and flexible, so comfortable to wear for our Great Gatsby party.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty headband but the rhinestones are in a different configuration than in the pic.  The picture looks more freestyle and elegant while what i received was pretty but looked like something out of a cookie cutter factory...no variation in the pattern.  It&#x27;s also on a netting type of material...kinda reminds me of the stuff the little round cheeses come in but black and a narrow knit.  It has a little give but that&#x27;s all even with the elastic on the back.  Where it connects to the elastic is a bit picky because  of how the netting was attached.  I really need to have something to wear in 2 days so I&#x27;ll hang on to it.  If I had longer I may have decided to return it.</li>
            <li> Looks beautiful on my daughter!</li>
            <li> Really tight on my head... Two beads started falling out and the headband falls off my head too. Its cute though</li>
            <li> I really like this- nice quality, rhinestones are sparkly but it runs a little small. I have an average to small sized head and this fits a little tight.</li>
            <li> Quality is okay - I&#x27;ve only worn it twice- it has held up well. Great addition to an outfit that needs sparkle but maybe the neckline doesn&#x27;t allow for it.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful and classy!! I got a lot of compliments on this piece. I would recommend this product. I must also say it&#x27;s a very delicate piece because of the intricate details.</li>
            <li> Well as others have said, it looks different than in the picture. It is much more bulky and &amp;#34;child&amp;#34; looking. It seems like a child&#x27;s dress up headband. It is unlikely that anyone can pull off this head band past the age of 15.</li>
            <li> My daughter is the head drum major in her high school band and needed a headband that would stand out. Bought the white one first and it was gorgeous. Her uniform has black in it so we went ahead and bought the black one too. She has dark brown hair and they both looked beautiful. She is rough on headbands and broke the black one by pulling too hard. I have no issues buying another one. Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> So pretty, love this item.  Bought for a gift.  Great Customer Service.  I will probably buy more for myself or gifts.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not what i expected, BUT it is useable.  It is fairly similar to the picture but not what i was hoping for.  I had higher expectations.  It is very pretty, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but i really was hoping it would look like the picture.  I wore it as soon as i got it and i got compliments on it, so at least other people like it.</li>
            <li> It looks much nicer in the picture than what I received. The black netting of the headband itself is kind of falling apart. I would not recommend buying this item at all.</li>
            <li> rhinestones on black netting with elastic band under hairline at nape of neck. I have light blonde hair so they don&#x27;t look like floating rhinestones as pictured, but the black adds great contrast against my hair and with the bright sparkly stones. Very fancy &amp; vintage looking. love it!</li>
            <li> Took too long to get here, but its a great deal! Rhinestones are a bit loose but easily tightened. Fantastic price!</li>
            <li> So beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;It looks like a flat tiara, so pretty, looks very pricey but it&#x27;s not. If you want a fancy looking headpiece or looking for a retro style headpiece like the great Gatsby or Downton Abbey this is the piece for you! So happy with it,, I will use this many more times. I received so many compliments</li>
            <li> Gems fall of quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a great accessory for both long and short hair. Love it.</li>
            <li> This is remarkable quality for the price. It is much more durable than I expected. It does not have stones all the way around.</li>
            <li> This piece is a little snug on my adult noggin, but fits my 8 year old perfect. It looks very nice and the stones are adhered very securely. She wears it often and gets many compliments.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter-in-law for x-mas! She loved it! I would recommend this to anyone who wears headbands a lot and likes to be stylish!</li>
            <li> Diamonds are gorgeous! It&#x27;s so dressy! I love it. The black mesh is a bit stringy. I had to trim some strings, then it was perfect :)</li>
            <li> Love it! It&#x27;s very pretty and comfy!</li>
            <li> Love love love. This head band can be used for a wedding or anywhere you just want to jazz up your look. The price is good too. It took awhile to get to me but I believe that patience is a virtue, so if u need give your self at least 3 weeks to get it.</li>
            <li> I really do like this headband but it is not the headband shown in the picture. The stones are actually attached to a white netting material and they are in a very symmetrical pattern instead of being more randomly placed like the picture.I would have given it four stars but a stone popped out while I was sliding it out of the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did look at the other reviews before purchasing, so I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be getting the shown headband. I&#x27;m glad I did otherwise I would have been very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was a lot faster than expected. I got this in less than two weeks which was great since I ended up being able to wear it to a special event.</li>
            <li> The product is nice for the price. Just didn&#x27;t like how the lack of quality control. When looking closely, I can see that there are 2 missing jewels. Hard to see this from far away. Just not very great as the company is shipping their product with missed parts. I read other reviews and it seems to be common for this company. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This item was a great accessory to my little daughter&#x27;s dress on her school dance. We really love the headband.</li>
            <li> First of all what I expected was It to be exactly like in the picture but what I got was one that looked different The rhinestones do not flare out like the image they are just stuck together into one piece......</li>
            <li> It was cheap but it seems to be cute enough that no one will notice how it&#x27;s made.  A little large on the head.  Decorative not functional.</li>
            <li> Product look exactly like picture shown, took about 2 weeks to arrive. Only con is that when I put head band on is it gets caught in my hair and pulls it.other than that&#x27;s its really pretty.</li>
            <li> This item took forever to ship. I didn&#x27;t mind that so much, but when I finally did receive it, it wasn&#x27;t quite the same as in the picture, and as soon as I went to try it on literally right after opening, it broke. Poor quality and not even worth the couple bucks</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a headband for my New Years Eve formal party for about a month and all I could find were very juvenile/girlish headbands, or headbands that were cheap looking. When I saw this one, the first thing I liked about it was they elastic band is just long enough that it doesn&#x27;t take up the majority of the space on your head (if that makes sense..??) The other thing is, the gems are really sparkly, without looking tacky and they are secured onto the headband on a piece of &amp;#34;mesh-like&amp;#34; material, so it still allows your hair to show thru. On a side note, the NYE party we went to was a &#x27;Gatsby&#x27; party and this headband fit in perfectly with my flapper dress!! I got many compliments on it and I plan to wear it again in a wedding this summer. I wore my hair in an up-do similar to the picture, but I did also try it on with my hair down and it seemed to stay in place and looked very nice without making me look like a little girl. I love it!</li>
            <li> The head band is not as wide as the one shown.  It is just black elastic surrounding it and my daughter could have made a nicer one with her glue gun.  As I&#x27;m writing this, I&#x27;m thinking that I&#x27;m going to return it.</li>
            <li> It broke the minute I put it on! And no my head aint fat!</li>
            <li> For the price this us very beautiful and elegant.can be worn anywhere. Shipment arrived after a month but I was not in a hurry so it worked out</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Very pretty! Awesome price!!</li>
            <li> She really loved this headband! She said she feels like she&#x27;s Taylor Swift and it was wayyyyyyyyyyyyy toooo far-fetched. LOL</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pretty and I get a lot of complements on it but there are a lot of flyaway strings coming off and I feel like I have to be very careful not to break it</li>
            <li> Ok, I can understand why some people were upset that it was not as pictured.  It is true that the stones are not as organically placed.  Mine are in 4 diamond shaped patterns.  That said, for the price you can&#x27;t beat it!  It is so sparkly and pretty.</li>
            <li> I gave this a 3 because i got many compliments on it, but the headband broke easily after only a few hours of wear.  It looks like it is just superglued or something.  I will try to put it back together with needle and thread.</li>
            <li> Very cute but came unsewed the First time I wore it....aaaand the jewels fell off. Boo.</li>
            <li> Really nice. Some of the stones fell out but I can&#x27;t complain considering the price :) Really pretty</li>
            <li> Cute, but broke quickly.</li>
            <li> Good deal, but some of the beads have already came off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful! But..... Not what the picture shows. Mine has 4 oval clusters of rhinestones.  Very 1920&#x27;s Great Gatsby. I will still put it to good use. It can also be played off as glamorous Boho. I saw some celebs on line wearing them with T shirts and flairs.</li>
            <li> I really get excited when i  saw the picture, but when i recieved it, is easy to see that is not the same, it has less stones, it doesnt look as elegant, and the material is very cheap. I dont know if I eill use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thin that i really like was the elastic.</li>
            <li> Broke the first time I used</li>
            <li> Purchased these for daughters wedding.  Beautiful &amp; a fabulous value.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t what I thought it would be a little to flimsy.</li>
            <li> very pretty for a special occasion</li>
            <li> Pretty, but it broke after wearing it in my hair all day! Not fixable.</li>
            <li> Beautiful headband and great delivery, I just have a hard time with headband staying on even the regular kind tend to give me a headache so I was hoping that this one would be different. But I will defiantly still find a way around to use it because it&#x27;s so beautiful.</li>
            <li> This piece is very pretty. You have to be careful to make sure not to get your hair tangled in the diamonds though. It really dresses up your hair style. Good Buy!</li>
            <li> Stones fall off.  One stone was loose in the package when I got it;  another 2 fell off the first day I wore it.  Too bad - I like to look like a princess!  But shoddy workmanship.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to push long hair out of your face -- a perfectly beautiful headband -- feminine but not over the top.  I love it !!</li>
            <li> Pretty but it took 2 moré weeks than expected delivery date and when I took it out of the bag 2 stores fell, if you have in mind what you pay for then you won&#x27;t be disappointed because they are pretty</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy! I got this a month before my Gatsby prom theme, and it took way longer for it to come. Also, the material latches onto your hair causing it to tug and pull on it when you wear it.</li>
            <li> This item was shredding when I pulled it out of the packaging. At first I thought it was hair but it was the cheap thread they used to sew the jewels on, and the jewels were sewed on crooked. If you want this item for a special occasion, I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love it, but it was uncomfortable, and some of the stones were missing when it arrived. I had to return it.</li>
            <li> I received this beautiful head band yesterday. It&#x27;s very elegant! My husband and I are going out on a dinner date and I will wear it for that occasion. I would recommend this to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michelle Khumalo</li>
            <li> Pretty princess sometimes I like to be a girly girl and this headband make me feel that way I received so much compliment on it, one of my co-worker wanted but I like having my own style I told her any way lol...</li>
