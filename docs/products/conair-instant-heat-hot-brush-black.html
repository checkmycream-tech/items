            <li>The adjustable heat is good for not burning hair or fingers, my hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice for smoothing the frizzies and styling your hair.  </li>

            <li>I have he many.</li>
            <li>Love my Conair Curling Iron/comb....</li>
            <li>Most stores don&#x27;t even stock it as it&#x27;s too inexpensive for them to bother with.</li>
            <li>Most curling brushes don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>They are perfect for short hair</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this brand and model for many years.  </li>
            <li>Maybe when my hair&#x27;s longer it will work better for me.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I got the 3/4&amp;#34; though.</li>
            <li>But it got me thnking, I started to wonder if this was healthy for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Many heat settings</li>
            <li>Damp hair works too, it just takes longer with more passes of the brush through the hair.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find this online as I have looked in about every store that carries hair supplies, stores where I have bought curling brushes for years.</li>
            <li>Many heat temp selections</li>
            <li>, I JUST LOVE IT, IT IS SIMPLE AND JUST PERFECT FOR ME!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>This is definitely the best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>was glad to find one with a brush in three quarter inch size.</li>
            <li>- so be sure to have one on hand.</li>
            <li>snaller barell 3/4 barell works better to curl hair.</li>
            <li>so I though the 3/4 inch will work better.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like using a curling iron, but with the clip it does provide more control and has more effect on the hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not supposed to burn a countertop, but I&#x27;m not so sure..</li>
            <li>I know most people probably use this brush for getting that blow out look or just creating volume or waves, but I use it for getting CURLS.</li>
            <li>I WILL CONTINUE MY SEARCH FOR A BETTER ONE.</li>
            <li>but I am sure Amazon has one in another brand.</li>
            <li>you shouldn&#x27;t wrap hair around it any more than twice, but it still gets caught.  </li>
            <li>It is&lt;br /&gt;much better than the one I replaced.</li>
            <li>I only wish they still made these curling irons, They are the best, and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li>I found I was able to order on Amazon so ordered two.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed using it (for about 2 weeks), and it worked well until it was accidentially knocked off and fell on the floor.  </li>
            <li>This is a favorite, I use it often.</li>
            <li>Love this item.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many curling brushes Over the years.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t even think of touching it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been so pleased that I ordered a 2d to keep in my always-packed travel carry-on.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love the shut-off feature.</li>
            <li>I love this curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I am able to hold my hair against the brush part as the dryer blows on it.  </li>
            <li>Have not been able to find this product in the stores.</li>
            <li>Always was able to find it but for some reason, cannot any more.</li>
            <li>Used this in several countries in Europe and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>The best brush it heats instantly</li>
            <li>I love love love this heat brush</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t use the brush unless I put the power strip on top of my dresser</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Hopefully it will be many years before I need another one.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>What more is their</li>
            <li>It was necessary to have a unit that would work in all of Europe, which I can attest to that it functioned perfectly.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>The Hot Stick by Coniar is well made, has great features and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good item, but come on Conair, read the reviews and get it right.</li>
            <li>Conair is a great company, and this curling iron works great, as do all of their other products.  </li>
            <li>But with my hot brush I get thru my hair with ease!!!</li>
            <li>I certainly was in great need of a new curling iron and this one works great.</li>
            <li>It curls very easily, and brushes out smoothly.</li>
            <li>I will recommend it to anyone looking for a good hot brush.</li>
            <li>I recommended the hot air brush to a friend and she is also delighted with the product.</li>
            <li>I had one of these hot air brushes for almost 20 years and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Good, consistent heat and a variety of settings.</li>
            <li>This hot brush is a good alternative.</li>
            <li>Great for around the hair line and not hard on the hair.</li>
            <li>I love the brush, easy to hold, heats very quickly, also love variable heat settings.</li>
            <li>It does heat up quickly and curls the ends nicely.  </li>
            <li>When you find something that good, at a good price, why not have an extra on hand?   </li>
            <li>Had the same kind before and worked great.  </li>
            <li>and it works great so far!</li>
            <li>I use it after I&#x27;ve blown my hair out and it provides perfect loose curls/waves that stay for hours.</li>
            <li>Gets good and hot but easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>I like this curlling iron just fine, but it turns off by itself after so many minutes, which could be a plus for some people.  </li>
            <li>I had an older model of this curling iron that I loved and had for many years.  </li>
            <li>Glad to have found this available.  </li>
            <li>My hair is still somewhat fried from a perm I had about a year ago and was hoping this would smooth it better than it does.</li>
            <li>So far, it works great.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for soft curls or smoothing out hair in the morning.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I bought two.</li>
            <li>This one is excellent, reasonably priced, and I love the quick heat feature for fast touchups</li>
            <li>It is incredibly easy to use.</li>
            <li>It handles easily and does not burn her thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>This Conair hot brush was great on my first use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to work with.</li>

            <li>I have never used one before and it is easy to get used to.</li>
            <li>The controls are easy to decipher.</li>
            <li>Easy for me to use with my arthritic hands.</li>
            <li>It seems well made and is easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>I found it excellent and attempted to purchase another one in the UK as a back up after about 5 years without success.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It does NOT tangle and snarl up in the hair easily...</li>
            <li>Heats very quickly and the cord doesn&#x27;t tangle.</li>
            <li>Works well, but BELIEVE the reviews about how easy it is to burn yourself.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast(no waiting for it to heat up) and so easy to use.</li>
            <li>But this was a great add on item and very well worth what I paid for it.</li>
            <li>Heats very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to order</li>
            <li>Compact and easy to travel.</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly and you can control the heat with the gauge on the handle.  </li>
            <li>This model doesn&#x27;t have as strong an air flow</li>
            <li>This Conair model has a 25-number dial that lets you regulate the precise heat setting for your hair type (and instructions that tell you which hair types/lengths respond best to which settings); a heat indicator that flashes on/off until the brush is ready to use (and it heats up very quickly, another plus); and is very comfortable to hold and use (no fancy contour shapes that look stylish but don&#x27;t really fit a hand, or if they do fit when you pick them up, become unwieldy as they&#x27;re turned in use -- just a nice, narrow shaft that works in any position).  </li>
            <li>I was glad to see it was available at Amazon because it&#x27;s a reliable product, and one I&#x27;m familiar with using.  </li>
            <li>Gets as warm or hot as wanted and in 90 seconds.</li>
            <li>Since I discovered the Conair hot brush I am not planning to switch to a different brand because it just works perfectly for me, the size, the shape and the way it works; it is what I need.  </li>
            <li>It also snarls my fine hair.</li>
            <li>but but this still works out just fine for my use.</li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and don&#x27;t do well with a curling iron.  </li>
            <li>my hair is extremely fine -</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>Works fine for everything I bought it for...just brushing through the hair or specifically curling the ends up or under.</li>
            <li>Almost instantly hot the barrel is the perfect size for my short hair</li>
            <li>Quick to heat up - love the varied heat settings plus the boost heat button.</li>
            <li>best results do not use the hot brush with wet hair, my hair using this brush is shine &amp; looks free of static or frizz!!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Very good, all that could be expected</li>
            <li>It was the right size for my length and also very light to carry during my trip.  </li>
            <li>so I was really happy to find it again after my last one died.</li>
            <li>It has multiple heat settings for styling and the auto off is great feature.</li>
            <li>Finally found a curling iron that does all that it promises at a great price.  </li>
            <li>She loves it because it&#x27;s light weight</li>
            <li>that means it takes the brush over 1.5 minutes before the indicator light stops blinking.  </li>
            <li>that means it takes the brush over 1.5 minutes before the indicator light stops blinking.  </li>
            <li>My relaxed hair gets smooth and shiny, some body but no bounce.</li>
            <li>I have short hair and it does not tangle at all, the teeth in the iron gives you a great style and holds the curl in your hair.  </li>
            <li>flashing light could be a bit brighter.  </li>
            <li>i also enjoy the dual voltage for traveling abroad .</li>
            <li>This works great for styling my Mom&#x27;s short thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>This is important as we sometimes travel to Europe.</li>
            <li>This nonetheless works well just brushing through the hair to smooth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soooo cheap.</li>
            <li>but it was so cheap I did.</li>
            <li>This curling brush is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I have used many different curling brushes over the years and this one is the best, so far.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product..</li>
            <li>Great for shorter hair because the tines are short.</li>
            <li>I have short hair and it works great.</li>
            <li>So far So good.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>, swivel cord, numerous settings, packaging good,  as described,  would reccomend,  excellant iron for the price, what more can i say</li>
            <li>The first had issues with the ON button not working after a while, but I liked how quickly this heated</li>
            <li>jut pulls right through and leaves a cute bouncy curl.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does get hot!!  </li>
            <li>and sure enough there it was, lucky for me!!!</li>
            <li>I love love love this hot brush, it&#x27;s extremely easy to use, gets hot very quickly and gives my hair so much volume</li>
            <li>I love this hot brush.</li>
            <li>I owned a Conair Hot Brush for many years, so this replacement purchase was a no-brainer.</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying using this Hot Brush</li>
            <li>I love this hot brush.</li>
            <li>I have been using Hot Brush by Conair for many years.</li>
            <li>I love the hot brush iron because it catches my layered hair just the way I want it too.  </li>
            <li>, it should be OK, but be aware, it&#x27;s NOT 3/4&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a good curling iron for my fine short hair</li>
            <li>I have very fine, straight hair and don&#x27;t need a lot of heat</li>
            <li>They need to make it so the &#x27;combs&#x27; come out to clean.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used a hot brush, I already own a rod.</li>
            <li>A curling brush isn&#x27;t a huge item in anybody&#x27;s life; that said, no one wants one that&#x27;s more of a nuisance than a help.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice if you could see the actual temperature the iron is heating up to instead of just number settings, but I guess for $10 I cant complain too much and am glad it works for others. :)</li>
            <li>Heats fast, easy to hold without burning fingers.&lt;br /&gt;Better than curling iron because it grips the hair easily.  </li>
            <li>I am always in a hurry in the mornings getting ready for work and this curling tool is very fast and effective</li>
            <li>This product gives me great body and lift so that I can fluff up and spike my hair.  </li>
            <li>It softly lifts and adds a nice wave.</li>
            <li>good product I always buy the same one.</li>
            <li>Loved it with my short hair.</li>
            <li>She has short hair, so it&#x27;s good because it doesn&#x27;t burn her scalp.</li>
            <li>The curling brushes I have had do not do much curling so was not even sure I should trust what others said and buy this,  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Having multiple heat choices is a really good feature.</li>
            <li>You also have I think it was about 20 different heat settings too, so it&#x27;s even good for wigs.</li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t think it would be possible to produce good results with the design of this curling iron because I thought the heat wouldn&#x27;t transfer to my hair without a heated clamp to help.  </li>
            <li>I also tried the larger barrel but didn&#x27;t get results this good.</li>
            <li>Good brush, just wished it would last longer -</li>
            <li>I love this hot brush because the temperature is adjustable and it is easy to use and very dependable.</li>
            <li>The writings rubbed off after the first use and the handle feels like it could break easily.</li>
            <li>If you follow the directions it comes with, it&#x27;s actually pretty easy not to tangle.</li>
            <li>Too easy to touch hot spot in process of styling.  </li>
            <li>I am 100% natural with very fine, dense, shoulder length hair, and wear my hair straight styled most of the time.</li>
            <li>The hot brush heats fully within a minute, and the adjustable heat setting works well on my fine hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and shoulder-length, and this thing works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I ordered it and it arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>It heats up quickly (and turns off by itself).  </li>
            <li>Extremely happy with both fast delivery and the actual product.</li>
            <li>This small hot brush is perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>It heats quickly and the auto shut off is almost a must for me.  </li>
            <li>Heats up quickly....</li>
            <li>It heats up extremely quickly.  </li>
            <li>I like how it heats up quickly and also has the burst feature.</li>
            <li>It heats quickly.</li>
            <li>My hair stayed frizzy and lost its shape quickly.  </li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and I use it every day.</li>
            <li>Heats really quick.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li>so it works well for me to give a quick styling.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li>heats up quick</li>
            <li>Thank you for the quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I quickly returned it and ordered this one.  </li>
            <li>Super hair curler.  </li>
            <li>but I use high and it does not seem to damage my hair after using it for many months now.</li>
            <li>That chrome barrel gets very hot and will burn your fingers if you touch it.  </li>
            <li>That chrome barrel gets very hot and will burn your fingers if you touch it.  </li>
            <li>Heats up  very fast!</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this hot brush.  </li>
            <li>I honestly have no clue why this curls so much better for me than any other wand or iron.</li>
            <li>Delivered very fast!</li>
            <li>I love the new model.  </li>
            <li>I find that it is easy to use and curls my hair much easier than using a blow dryer and brush.</li>
            <li>Its good for the price and does all that is advertised, but you have to be careful with the tip - you can still get burnt regardless of the \\&quot;cool tip\\&quot; feature.</li>
            <li>Heats up very quickly and is ready to go in a minute.</li>
            <li>Thanks for your fast, easy service!</li>
            <li>had it at #15 heat, and that was way too hot!</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li>It gets hot!</li>
            <li>This has a very quick heating and I love that there are multiple temperature settings.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, nice effect, works as expected.</li>
            <li>I have medium length hair that is fine and straight.  </li>
            <li>but my hair is so baby fine that the teeth make it work really well without leaving marks like a curling iron does.</li>
            <li>Great little item for the price.  </li>
            <li>If you use this size brush for curling this is a great little tool.</li>
            <li>This is a great little curling iron.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s remarkable that companies manage to make things a little less good each year in spite of their easy access to consumer comments and concerns.  </li>
            <li>This is a perfect product for anyone with fine, thin hair!  </li>
            <li>It is simple and effective.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the Conair BC84SCS Instant Heat 3/4\\&quot; Hot Brush.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 86-year-old mother, who has had countless curling brush/irons over the years, and she is thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li>Has a wide variety of heat settings, which is good.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about it.</li>
            <li>The wide range of temperature is a really good feature.</li>
            <li>This hot brush iron is so sweet.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with this curling iron as I have a torn rotator and can&#x27;t use both hands to fix hair in the back of my head.  </li>
            <li>Best part is, the curls last much longer compared to the regular curling irons.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t like it as much as my old one ( handled better and my hair wouldn&#x27;t slip out of it), but this</li>
            <li>I could not find anything I liked as well in the stores locally</li>
            <li>This is such a great tool for my fine and flat hair.  </li>
            <li>exactly what I needed; heats up fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Before getting this Conair hot brush I used to have a very old one from Braun, but they do not make it any more.</li>
            <li>But so many others have been fine and lasted a long time.</li>
            <li>Good price and got here before expected!</li>
            <li>The price if right.  </li>
            <li>Right?  </li>
            <li>Conair does curling irons right.  </li>
            <li>It stays in place and puts in just the right amount of churls.  </li>
            <li>The price was just right.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right size and doesn&#x27;t overcurl my hair.</li>
            <li>The brush is easy to use and helps me style my fine hair for every day without a lot of the fuss and time a regular curling iron hairdo requires.</li>
            <li>This hot brush works better on relaxed hair and does not get to the roots, but it gives my hair a silky soft feeling after I&#x27;m done using it.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it was exactly the same and works perfectly.</li>
            <li>MY original just broke after at least 10 years, so I was able to find the same model on Amazon for a great price.</li>
            <li>bought the 1 1/4 inch brush and liked the convenience of it, but the brush was simply too large to wrap my hair around.  </li>
            <li>wear my hair in a short style and its very fine</li>
            <li>I had a lot of difficulty picking between the two sizes for my first purchase and quickly began to wonder if the smaller brush (closer to the size of my curling iron) might not be a better choice for me.  </li>
            <li>Got this hot brush to take to Europe, but I can also use it right here at home.  </li>
            <li>In addition, Amazon&#x27;s price and super fast shipping just can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>On my old model with the removable tip, the bristles could be slid out of the tracks that hold them and easily cleaned.</li>
            <li>It heats up super fast and you can adjust the temperature setting.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While this contains a great deal of personal information, I am sharing it because there are others that may be facing similar problems.</li>
            <li>For years I have struggled with my fine and naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It heats up very fast, gets as hot as you want and gives me just the amount of curl that I want.</li>
            <li>I bought two of these hot sticks, one for each of my daughters.</li>
            <li>I like a hot brush that gets hot and this one has 25 settings.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable too!  </li>
            <li>About 8 months ago I purchased a Helen of Troy hot brush.</li>
            <li>I was able to only find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these hot brushes for years</li>
            <li>All features are exactly as described in the product review, including the auto-off component--a safety feature for users of any age.</li>
            <li>Funny</li>
            <li>and I have lost them while traveling, so I need to replace on occasion, but have not been able to find in local stores,</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conairs website has this but for a much higher price.</li>
            <li>I wondered if I would have better results with a smaller brush.  </li>
            <li>Everything pertains to both hot brush sizes.  </li>
            <li>This brush does not get as hot as I would like it to</li>
            <li>With this hot brush, the curl stays put all day.</li>
            <li>I have had several of these Conair brushes and love them.</li>
            <li>It is partly my fault for not realizing the difference between a hot brush and a hot air brush.</li>
            <li>CAN&#x27;T FIND THIS HOT BRUSH ANYWHERE IN STORES</li>
            <li>, I use a bigger curling iron on top where my hair is longer.  </li>
            <li>my first one lasted for years.  </li>
            <li>This one also seems to pull my hair out more than the solid ones.</li>
            <li>This hot brush came without a box.</li>
            <li>I bought this hot brush specifically to take to Europe and use on their 220 currency.  </li>
            <li>I think it would even be better to buy a bigger brush head for the bangs if that was an option.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything including hot rollers, curlformers, wands, irons, flexi rods, hot flexi rods, spoolies, perms, and every crunching gel, mousse, cream, or spray known to man.</li>
            <li>I first purchased one of these in America whilst on holiday after the one I took with me stopped working</li>
            <li>Hopefully it will last for many years.</li>
            <li>Super-quick heatup, love the swivel cord, brushes hold hair in place while curling (I have short hair).</li>
            <li>First of all, Amazon got this to me within two day&#x27;s time via Amazon Prime.  </li>
            <li>The minute I turned on this hot brush, it immediately started to heat up.  </li>
            <li>Does get hot.  </li>
            <li>Heats up fast!  </li>
            <li>Use this hot brush all the time.</li>
            <li>The Conair  Heat  Hot  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this hot brush since 2008</li>
            <li>The bristles help to hold my hair onto the hot part of the wand.</li>
            <li>We purchased the hot stick for our up coming trip to Europe.</li>
            <li>my 3rd of this kind, definitely my favorite  for bangs and short hair, does not work with too long hair, tangles too easily</li>
            <li>Thanks for the super fast delivery</li>
            <li>This hot brush works very well on my fine, but full head of white hair.</li>
            <li>I get better curls with a flat hot iron then this product.  </li>
            <li>When I want more volume than a flat iron can give me, I use this hot brush.</li>
            <li>Only thing I would have loved to see in this product is a better brush, this brush is not bad at all, but my hair slip out of it while curling as the teeth are smaller than expected.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and the curls stay in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Great seller and quick response.</li>
            <li>I love that it has such a large range of heat levels too.</li>
            <li>I like it much better than a flat iron</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you are in the market for a hot brush!  </li>
            <li>I have short, hard to curl hair and this one works perfectly.</li>
            <li>If you have long hair, it tends to get snarled, but if you are careful, you can get some beautiful curls.</li>
            <li>This Conair appears very well made, heats up to any of the 21 heat settings in under one minute, has an extra feature which allows you to boost the heat and the bristles appear made of a better and stronger material.</li>
            <li>my personal opinion if you want nice, soft and shine hair do not use hair dryer...</li>
            <li>bought for size-really wanted regular 3/4\\&quot; curling iron--really like conair style-it does good for styling-have to hold longer because not solid heating surface</li>
            <li>And on the rare times that I do, I just kind of shake the brush a little and gently tug it away from my hair</li>
            <li>It heats super fast, has many settings for heat needed depending upon hair type, and after a few minutes of experimenting I was glad I bought the hot brush style instead of a regular curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I really do like the Conair Hot Brush.</li>
            <li>There is an on/off button with red or green indicator light, turbo heat on/off button, a turbo heat indicator light, comfortable textured handle, chrome barrel, plastic bristles, and a cool tip.  </li>
            <li>The delivery was fast, the items were packaged well, and the hot brush works according to description.</li>
            <li>this is because a brush has a different kind of open bristles with distinct balls at tips.</li>
            <li>It took a few tries to find the heat setting that works best but has worked very well.</li>
            <li>It can be easy to get your hair tangled, but just don&#x27;t wrap the hair around tightly, and don&#x27;t wrap any hair over itself, and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>But if I had had the large barrelled hot brush and the cream, life would have been so much easier.</li>
            <li>This hot brush works very well for my short hair and heats very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It is hard to find a good &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; curling iron that gets hot.</li>
            <li>so you would not be able to dry your hair with it</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly, has 25 heat settings and gives soft curls.</li>
            <li>I ordered the 3/4-inch hot brush for myself and after experimenting a few times, liked it so much I ordered the 1-1/4-inch as a gift for a friend</li>
            <li>I love my new curling iron, its lightweight and heats up instantly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for touch ups, but when I used it on my hair that I didn&#x27;t blow dry, it didn&#x27;t give enough control.  </li>
            <li>I have fine permed hair, so I have to be cautious  multiple issues.  </li>
            <li>This particular one is perfect...size, controls, settings are all exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>My hair is short, straight, fine and thinning.</li>
            <li>Conair has a comfortable handle to use and the instant heat makes it very convenient.</li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>They work really well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are 25 heat settings so you can go from gentle to blast.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t rave about it too much.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>and I really like how fast they heat up.</li>
            <li>Fast heat up.</li>
            <li>Brush prongs save your fingers from burning and make the whole thing easier to use even for the uncoordinated.</li>
            <li>After about one year, one of them doesn&#x27;t heat up as much, so I&#x27;ll have to replace it, but</li>
            <li>still works great...and it heats up REALLY fast.  </li>
            <li>I thought this would do the trick, but it really didn&#x27;t work at all for me.  </li>
            <li>Works very well, shuts off after a reasonable period of time if you get distracted.  </li>
            <li>I do not shampoo my hair each day and the volume stays in my hair very well.  </li>
            <li>That information is easily available at various online sites.  </li>
            <li>I do not shampoo my hair each day and the volume stays in my hair very well.  </li>
            <li>That information is easily available at various online sites.  </li>
            <li>and she says it works really well.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>thanks again.</li>
            <li>I really need a 1/2 inch barrel but can&#x27;t seem to come up with one with dual voltage.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and curls hair well .</li>
            <li>I had just returned a curling brush that was 3x as much as this one.  </li>
            <li>I only wish it wasnt just available as an &amp;#34;add</li>
            <li>I really like the automatic shut off also.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t take as much dexterity to use as a curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I can get my hair done much faster</li>
            <li>and I really like the 30-second heat time.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>the teeth became very brittle and kept falling off.  </li>
            <li>The product works very well.  </li>
            <li>I can make waves or curls depending on how much hair I place around the barrel.</li>
            <li>This give my hair so much body</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>It really does suit my needs</li>
            <li>It heats up so fast.</li>
            <li>This curling iron really helps me do that.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I like these so much that I have them in two sizes.</li>
            <li>Not as straightening as a flat iron, but does a pretty nice job without the damaging effect of a flat iron.</li>
            <li>I wanted to replace my very old hot brush before it died.  </li>
            <li>Bought this to replace a similar model originally purchased in the 1980&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Based on the other reviews it does replace that process for many users, but didn&#x27;t for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love all the heat settings because the heat in other countries is hotter</li>
            <li>Great for my short hair-this is my backup since it took so long to find one that works well and saw others did the same thing.</li>
            <li>multiple heat settings, can get close to root area, no rest prongs to get in the way unwinds clean without tangling</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;d recommend is directions on how to clean it.</li>
            <li>Also, even though my hair is fine and not all that long, I find that it does tangle the hair</li>
            <li>It is ready for use within seconds of turning the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; switch and you choose the heat temperature for your own hair type (easy or difficult to take curl).</li>
            <li>Like many of us seniors, it was loosing it&#x27;s teeth from so much heating up and cooling down.  </li>
            <li>It is easy for her to use; she has limited mobility, and this works well.</li>
            <li>Same results, but much faster.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair super shiny as the barrel is ceramic.  </li>
            <li>A friend of mine has that one, but it&#x27;s too small to be effective with my hair length.</li>
            <li>, my old iron got hot when plugged in.</li>
            <li>This might be ok for people with fine, thin hair, but NOT for girls with thicker hair.</li>
            <li>But hey, my hair was super shiny after I used it, if it didnt hurt so bad it might have acutally felt good!</li>
            <li>I think the hot hair brush does a very good job on short or hair that comes half way down your neck.  </li>
            <li>Love the turbo feature that speeds up the heating process to less than one minute.</li>
            <li>It takes longer but the reult is more fullness and less drying.</li>
            <li>the cord has become shorter, and the bristles are more brittle and less rubbery so that they don&#x27;t hold the hair quite as well</li>
            <li>I especially like how quickly this model heats up, and the automatic shut-off feature is another plus.</li>
            <li>Love the two attachments as my older one had only the smaller attachment.</li>
            <li>It did require a converter unless we were lucky enough to be in a place that also had 110 currency...like our cruise boat on the Rhine.</li>
            <li>This one works better than any I&#x27;ve ever had, including one 4 times more expensive from a beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>It is quick and I don&#x27;t get burned (unlike what happens with a traditional curling iron)</li>
            <li>You can heat it up quick or regular time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of brands, and I just can&#x27;t find a hot brush that is hot enough to curl my hair.  </li>
            <li>This is the perfect appliance for my hair, works better than traditional curling iron or flat iron for my thick, curly hair with a few wiry grays.</li>
            <li>I have tried regular curling irons (1 inch and 1.5 inch); the curls are good but they don&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It does not heat up so high that it fries my hair...</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The brush helps hold fine hair without slipping out like others do.</li>
            <li>originally bought the 1 1/4 inch Instant Heat Hot Brush because I had allowed myself to be convinced by watching a demonstration of a similar product on television that the size would work well for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Begin with clean, dry hair.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised that it took that much heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was surprised that it took that much heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I really like it for a soft touch around the edges</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if your hair prefers a professional level of heat (325-450) to hold a curl all day in very curly hair.</li>
            <li>But actually I wanted a hot air brush, not this, because I have very short hair, but i was mistaken when i ordered hot brush instead of hot air brush.</li>
            <li>So apparently I don&#x27;t think I know how to use a hot brush cause my hair keeps getting tangled in it.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for many years, they do eventually not heat as well after a few years</li>
            <li>It worth use it combined with the bigger size, for differente hair lenght.</li>
            <li>This Conair hot brush has so much quality built in at a sper low price.  </li>
            <li>, so I didnt have much trouble ordering it. :-)</li>
            <li>I have pretty straight hair and every now and then like a different look.</li>
            <li>and I could have curls more round and softer.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly, gives you soft curls and waves with no dents like a regular curling iron sometimes does.</li>
            <li>Right size for short hair</li>
            <li>the plug right next to you</li>
            <li>I have curly chin length hair and the 3/4&amp;#34; works well to quickly tame the frizz of my top layer and still retain the curl.</li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t live up to all this, I&#x27;ll let you know.</li>
            <li>and when I needed a new one I could not find one in any store.</li>
            <li>It is my opinion that women over 40 do not look as lovely in long hairdos but in spite of what I think there are a lot who do wear it long.</li>
            <li>Just be careful even the first minute or two because the metal between the plastic &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; also gets hot.  </li>
            <li>I have always used Hot Rollers and a curling iron (which is out of the question now that it&#x27;s short).</li>
            <li>I debated getting an exact replacement curling brush since my Sasson had performed well for several years.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this accidentally last year while looking for a hot air blowdryer brush.</li>
            <li>I ordered the smaller size and it does exactly what I want.  </li>
            <li>brushes work and are designed exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>This is my third hot brush</li>
            <li>I have gone through several of these hot brushes.  </li>
            <li>This one just doesn&#x27;t seem to heat up nearly as hot as the larger one.  </li>
            <li>I was actually looking for hot air one with dual voltage (to use for my vacation) and mistakenly bought this product.  </li>
            <li>I have used hot air brush for years because I cannot hold a brush and hairdryer at the same time.  </li>
            <li>When I did a search, I thought it would bring up only hot air curling brushes, but instead this one came up and it is not a hot-air curling brush.  </li>
            <li>It is a hot brush similar to a curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as ordered; solid product</li>
            <li>I have used the Instant Heat Hot Brush before.  </li>
            <li>Definitely would recommend this hot brush.</li>
            <li>I should explain that a great deal of my styling failure is due to user error.</li>
            <li>I am still unable to get a full curl in my hair using this brush, but it makes some cute, old-fashioned ringlets on the bottom ~3 inches of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I like this hot brush very much, but the small piece of plastic that serves as the stand really gets in the way.  </li>
            <li>I saw a commercial for a similar product priced around $200, so I went on Amazon and found this &amp;#34;curling iron&amp;#34; for less than a 1/10, and from a reputable brand!  </li>
            <li>My fine hair has little body and this curler gives me lift and curl.  </li>
            <li>As always one has to be careful because it does get very hot.</li>
            <li>No sense in returning it since it would cost just as much as the new product to ship it back and get a replacement.</li>
            <li>I have short hair (does not cover my ears) which is very fine, but also thick and straight.  </li>
            <li>Very hard to use and does not curl hair effectively.  </li>
            <li>I have very short, stubborn hair which has been a little challenging to style.  </li>
            <li>It was in a clear plastic bag.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the roller-effect that curling irons get (read: the old lady hair styles).</li>
            <li>My professional ones were plugged in about 50-60 hours per week and they each lasted about 10 years.</li>
            <li>I plan on ordering at least one more to put away for the day when this one bites the dust.  </li>
            <li>bought this for my 84 year old mother.  </li>
            <li>fortunately the \\&quot;missing from the shelves</li>
            <li>It is  much too big for me,....</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s o.k.,</li>
            <li>so I was surprised to see that they still had this one.  </li>
            <li>That is what I REALLY need with my short hair.</li>
            <li>Really like the brush feature which makes it easier to roll and manage the hair than a regular curling wand.  </li>
            <li>and I nearly melted.</li>
            <li>It works well with my straight medium short hair.  </li>
            <li>I am a 30 year old woman and I am ashamed to admit...</li>
            <li>I am getting ready to use it now for a second time</li>
            <li>I bought this because i just got my shoulder length hair permed and this helps take out some of the perm curl and give me a natural curl.</li>
            <li>Old one just wore out.  </li>
            <li>Bought this to replace the one I had that died of old age.  </li>
            <li>The old one was over 15 years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep using the old one.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t come in a box so don&#x27;t be surprised.  </li>
            <li>and it makes my hair incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>and I on&#x27;t get soft curls with those.</li>
            <li>My old one died and this is just like my old one.  </li>
            <li>Granted, I&#x27;m comparing a $100 flat iron to a $10 curling iron,, but I have used drugstore curling irons (e.g. Revlon) successfully too, and unfortunately, this product just didn&#x27;t get hot enough to hold a style.</li>
            <li>First off I want to say that I have very thin, very fine, wavy</li>
            <li>And oh yes, this brush also cools down rather quickly,</li>
            <li>Edit review March 27, 2015 --- I had to retire this hot brush because the cord began to be loose where it joins the body of the device.  </li>
            <li>Recently bought the Conair Instant Heat 3/4 Hot Brush.</li>
            <li>This is the second Conair Hot Brush that I have purchased over the last 11 years.</li>
            <li>I was hoping I would find another one similar, and I found the exact same one!!!!</li>
            <li>With regular curling irons, I was always burning myself,  The hot brush has eliminated that entirely while still &amp;#34;catching&amp;#34; my hair.</li>
            <li>Will stick to regular curling iron, would return but was so cheap not worth paying shipping to return.</li>
            <li>the power key did not work properly however, the seller was willing to replace I don&#x27;t want to replace</li>
            <li>Have larger hot brush but needed smaller one too.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m one of the few people who uses a curling brush instead of a curling iron, and it is very hard to find a good one at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>old one lasted a long long time until it finally died.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t expect to find another and at a fantastic price.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is you have to be careful and only touch the end because it will burn your finger if you touch the middle of the brush especially if it is on a higher temperature.  </li>
            <li>For my short, straight, fine, thick hair I have settled on a heat setting of 17 which Conair&#x27;s chart considers medium-high.  </li>
            <li>For my short, straight, fine, thick hair I have settled on a heat setting of 17 which Conair&#x27;s chart considers medium-high.  </li>
            <li>Only thing I didn&#x27;t like about the new one was,it didn&#x27;t have a built-in stand to keep it from laying directly on the counter.</li>
            <li>I have medium volume straight long hair</li>
            <li>this is coming from someone with long straight hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just remember to be careful when using the hot brush.  </li>
            <li>Just remember to be careful when using the hot brush.  </li>
            <li>Last time, I went to Ulta and pad about $40 for one, only to realize it was NOT dual voltage and barely got hot.  </li>
            <li>so do I really want to go through the hassle of returning it to Amazon, ordering a new one (which I can&#x27;t predict how long it will last?)  </li>
            <li>I like the new one even though its slightly different.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hot enough and you don&#x27;t need to leave on long.</li>
            <li>I purchased this hot brush after my other one died.  </li>
            <li>This hot brush still heats up really fast, but there are problems that I did not have with the same Conair item that I purchased a few years ago:  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not easy to clean between it&#x27;s bristles, but inexpensive enough to buy several at a time and ditch one when the mood hits for a new one.</li>
            <li>First I spritzed with water and towel dried, to avoid scorching; if hair is slightly damp it works better, I think; if too wet, it&#x27;ll scorch and burn</li>
            <li>It heats fast and does the job in minimal time.  </li>
            <li>but it was over ten years old and just gave up one day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But for me it is bothersome because when I&#x27;m ready to curl my hair it is not ready because it has turned off.</li>
            <li>The brush did absolutely nothing for her hair after I spent forever trying to make it work for her hair.</li>
            <li>I like it better than a curling iron because with a curling iron, my thin hair tends to come out of the clamp.</li>
            <li>This is the third hot brush I&#x27;ve used and used up over the years and still love the design - I know it will not last forever, everything breaks or gets broken in it&#x27;s limited lifetime</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t curl as well as I remember from a previous hot brush.  </li>
            <li>It took me over half an hour to use it the first time and my hair would get tangled, but I got the hang of it in a while.</li>
            <li>My other one still works, just takes longer to heat because it has so much build up from hair spray on it.  </li>
            <li>It is working well, little slow warm up.</li>
            <li>and they are more likely to damage thin hair.  </li>
            <li>One major flaw that I think will have me sending it back is that the tip is not removable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m replacing an old one (same brand) which doesn&#x27;t always work, but the tines on the new one are very rough and scratch both my scalp and hands</li>
            <li>I have long, medium texture hair with natural wave and this brush</li>
            <li>The spikes on this brush are so short that they can barely grasp my hair.  </li>
            <li>Previously, I&#x27;ve burned my scalp or my fingers with a brush that had only one temperature -- SUPER HOT; or found that the brushes whose temperatures could be regulated either didn&#x27;t ever get quite hot enough, or had no indicator to let me know when the desired heat setting had been reached, or were uncomfortable to hold and/or use.</li>
            <li>the heating my burn my hair, and secondly, ladies please, if you know for sure ur hair is thin and flat, don&#x27;t even try this!  </li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is that I am not delighted with the location of the heat controller (YES, it can even be adjusted to the heat needed for your particular hair!), although it is stiff enough that it doesn&#x27;t get easily knocked off your setting...which is definitely a plus!  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine and thin and I feel curling brushes are easier on my hair and easier for me to use.</li>
            <li>These types of curling irons definitely won&#x27;t be replacing my conventional curling iron, but it does a decent job of straightening or adding a bit of a twist to the ends.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Someone told me about a small barrelled hot brush and a little &amp;#34;Ion Straightening Solutions Jojoba Flat Iron Cream&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>I have used these for years to get a little body and curl in my straight hair.</li>
            <li>Always i use hot brushes take little long time but is better.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more awkward to use than my old one</li>

            <li> The adjustable heat is good for not burning hair or fingers, my hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nice for smoothing the frizzies and styling your hair.  </li>
            <li> Even the &amp;#34;cool tip&amp;#34; gets warm.</li>

            <li> I have he many.</li>
            <li> Love my Conair Curling Iron/comb....</li>
            <li> Most stores don&#x27;t even stock it as it&#x27;s too inexpensive for them to bother with.</li>
            <li> Most curling brushes don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> and I love them.</li>
            <li> They are perfect for short hair</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this brand and model for many years.  </li>
            <li> Maybe when my hair&#x27;s longer it will work better for me.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I got the 3/4&amp;#34; though.</li>
            <li> But it got me thnking, I started to wonder if this was healthy for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Many heat settings</li>
            <li> Damp hair works too, it just takes longer with more passes of the brush through the hair.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to find this online as I have looked in about every store that carries hair supplies, stores where I have bought curling brushes for years.</li>
            <li> Many heat temp selections</li>
            <li> , I JUST LOVE IT, IT IS SIMPLE AND JUST PERFECT FOR ME!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> was glad to find one with a brush in three quarter inch size.</li>
            <li> - so be sure to have one on hand.</li>
            <li> snaller barell 3/4 barell works better to curl hair.</li>
            <li> so I though the 3/4 inch will work better.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using a curling iron, but with the clip it does provide more control and has more effect on the hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not supposed to burn a countertop, but I&#x27;m not so sure..</li>
            <li> I know most people probably use this brush for getting that blow out look or just creating volume or waves, but I use it for getting CURLS.</li>
            <li> I WILL CONTINUE MY SEARCH FOR A BETTER ONE.</li>
            <li> but I am sure Amazon has one in another brand.</li>
            <li> you shouldn&#x27;t wrap hair around it any more than twice, but it still gets caught.  </li>
            <li> It is&lt;br /&gt;much better than the one I replaced.</li>
            <li> I only wish they still made these curling irons, They are the best, and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li> I found I was able to order on Amazon so ordered two.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using it (for about 2 weeks), and it worked well until it was accidentially knocked off and fell on the floor.  </li>
            <li> This is a favorite, I use it often.</li>
            <li> Love this item.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many curling brushes Over the years.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even think of touching it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been so pleased that I ordered a 2d to keep in my always-packed travel carry-on.</li>

            <li> I love this curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I am able to hold my hair against the brush part as the dryer blows on it.  </li>
            <li> Have not been able to find this product in the stores.</li>
            <li> Always was able to find it but for some reason, cannot any more.</li>
            <li> Used this in several countries in Europe and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> The best brush it heats instantly</li>
            <li> I love love love this heat brush</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use the brush unless I put the power strip on top of my dresser</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will be many years before I need another one.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> What more is their</li>
            <li> It was necessary to have a unit that would work in all of Europe, which I can attest to that it functioned perfectly.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> The Hot Stick by Coniar is well made, has great features and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good item, but come on Conair, read the reviews and get it right.</li>
            <li> Conair is a great company, and this curling iron works great, as do all of their other products.  </li>
            <li> But with my hot brush I get thru my hair with ease!!!</li>
            <li> I certainly was in great need of a new curling iron and this one works great.</li>
            <li> It curls very easily, and brushes out smoothly.</li>
            <li> I will recommend it to anyone looking for a good hot brush.</li>
            <li> I recommended the hot air brush to a friend and she is also delighted with the product.</li>
            <li> I had one of these hot air brushes for almost 20 years and loved it.  </li>
            <li> Good, consistent heat and a variety of settings.</li>

            <li> I love the brush, easy to hold, heats very quickly, also love variable heat settings.</li>
            <li> It does heat up quickly and curls the ends nicely.  </li>
            <li> When you find something that good, at a good price, why not have an extra on hand?   </li>
            <li> Had the same kind before and worked great.  </li>
            <li> and it works great so far!</li>
            <li> I use it after I&#x27;ve blown my hair out and it provides perfect loose curls/waves that stay for hours.</li>
            <li> Gets good and hot but easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> I like this curlling iron just fine, but it turns off by itself after so many minutes, which could be a plus for some people.  </li>
            <li> I had an older model of this curling iron that I loved and had for many years.  </li>
            <li> Glad to have found this available.  </li>
            <li> My hair is still somewhat fried from a perm I had about a year ago and was hoping this would smooth it better than it does.</li>
            <li> So far, it works great.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for soft curls or smoothing out hair in the morning.</li>

            <li> It handles easily and does not burn her thinning hair.  </li>

            <li> Easy for me to use with my arthritic hands.</li>
            <li> It seems well made and is easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> I found it excellent and attempted to purchase another one in the UK as a back up after about 5 years without success.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It does NOT tangle and snarl up in the hair easily...</li>
            <li> Heats very quickly and the cord doesn&#x27;t tangle.</li>
            <li> Works well, but BELIEVE the reviews about how easy it is to burn yourself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast(no waiting for it to heat up) and so easy to use.</li>
            <li> But this was a great add on item and very well worth what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Heats very quickly.</li>
            <li> Easy to order</li>
            <li> Compact and easy to travel.</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly and you can control the heat with the gauge on the handle.  </li>
            <li> This model doesn&#x27;t have as strong an air flow</li>
            <li> This Conair model has a 25-number dial that lets you regulate the precise heat setting for your hair type (and instructions that tell you which hair types/lengths respond best to which settings); a heat indicator that flashes on/off until the brush is ready to use (and it heats up very quickly, another plus); and is very comfortable to hold and use (no fancy contour shapes that look stylish but don&#x27;t really fit a hand, or if they do fit when you pick them up, become unwieldy as they&#x27;re turned in use -- just a nice, narrow shaft that works in any position).  </li>
            <li> I was glad to see it was available at Amazon because it&#x27;s a reliable product, and one I&#x27;m familiar with using.  </li>
            <li> Gets as warm or hot as wanted and in 90 seconds.</li>
            <li> Since I discovered the Conair hot brush I am not planning to switch to a different brand because it just works perfectly for me, the size, the shape and the way it works; it is what I need.  </li>
            <li> It also snarls my fine hair.</li>
            <li> but but this still works out just fine for my use.</li>
            <li> It works fine.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and don&#x27;t do well with a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> my hair is extremely fine -</li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> Works fine for everything I bought it for...just brushing through the hair or specifically curling the ends up or under.</li>
            <li> Almost instantly hot the barrel is the perfect size for my short hair</li>
            <li> Quick to heat up - love the varied heat settings plus the boost heat button.</li>
            <li> best results do not use the hot brush with wet hair, my hair using this brush is shine &amp; looks free of static or frizz!!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Very good, all that could be expected</li>
            <li> It was the right size for my length and also very light to carry during my trip.  </li>
            <li> so I was really happy to find it again after my last one died.</li>
            <li> It has multiple heat settings for styling and the auto off is great feature.</li>
            <li> Finally found a curling iron that does all that it promises at a great price.  </li>
            <li> She loves it because it&#x27;s light weight</li>
            <li> that means it takes the brush over 1.5 minutes before the indicator light stops blinking.  </li>
            <li> that means it takes the brush over 1.5 minutes before the indicator light stops blinking.  </li>
            <li> My relaxed hair gets smooth and shiny, some body but no bounce.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and it does not tangle at all, the teeth in the iron gives you a great style and holds the curl in your hair.  </li>
            <li> flashing light could be a bit brighter.  </li>
            <li> i also enjoy the dual voltage for traveling abroad .</li>
            <li> This works great for styling my Mom&#x27;s short thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> This is important as we sometimes travel to Europe.</li>
            <li> This nonetheless works well just brushing through the hair to smooth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soooo cheap.</li>
            <li> but it was so cheap I did.</li>
            <li> This curling brush is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I have used many different curling brushes over the years and this one is the best, so far.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product..</li>
            <li> Great for shorter hair because the tines are short.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and it works great.</li>
            <li> So far So good.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> , swivel cord, numerous settings, packaging good,  as described,  would reccomend,  excellant iron for the price, what more can i say</li>
            <li> The first had issues with the ON button not working after a while, but I liked how quickly this heated</li>
            <li> jut pulls right through and leaves a cute bouncy curl.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does get hot!!  </li>
            <li> and sure enough there it was, lucky for me!!!</li>
            <li> I love love love this hot brush, it&#x27;s extremely easy to use, gets hot very quickly and gives my hair so much volume</li>
            <li> I love this hot brush.</li>
            <li> I owned a Conair Hot Brush for many years, so this replacement purchase was a no-brainer.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying using this Hot Brush</li>
            <li> I love this hot brush.</li>
            <li> I have been using Hot Brush by Conair for many years.</li>
            <li> I love the hot brush iron because it catches my layered hair just the way I want it too.  </li>
            <li> , it should be OK, but be aware, it&#x27;s NOT 3/4&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a good curling iron for my fine short hair</li>
            <li> I have very fine, straight hair and don&#x27;t need a lot of heat</li>
            <li> They need to make it so the &#x27;combs&#x27; come out to clean.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used a hot brush, I already own a rod.</li>
            <li> A curling brush isn&#x27;t a huge item in anybody&#x27;s life; that said, no one wants one that&#x27;s more of a nuisance than a help.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice if you could see the actual temperature the iron is heating up to instead of just number settings, but I guess for $10 I cant complain too much and am glad it works for others. :)</li>
            <li> Heats fast, easy to hold without burning fingers.&lt;br /&gt;Better than curling iron because it grips the hair easily.  </li>
            <li> I am always in a hurry in the mornings getting ready for work and this curling tool is very fast and effective</li>
            <li> This product gives me great body and lift so that I can fluff up and spike my hair.  </li>
            <li> It softly lifts and adds a nice wave.</li>
            <li> good product I always buy the same one.</li>
            <li> Loved it with my short hair.</li>
            <li> She has short hair, so it&#x27;s good because it doesn&#x27;t burn her scalp.</li>
            <li> The curling brushes I have had do not do much curling so was not even sure I should trust what others said and buy this,  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Having multiple heat choices is a really good feature.</li>
            <li> You also have I think it was about 20 different heat settings too, so it&#x27;s even good for wigs.</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t think it would be possible to produce good results with the design of this curling iron because I thought the heat wouldn&#x27;t transfer to my hair without a heated clamp to help.  </li>
            <li> I also tried the larger barrel but didn&#x27;t get results this good.</li>
            <li> Good brush, just wished it would last longer -</li>
            <li> I love this hot brush because the temperature is adjustable and it is easy to use and very dependable.</li>
            <li> The writings rubbed off after the first use and the handle feels like it could break easily.</li>
            <li> If you follow the directions it comes with, it&#x27;s actually pretty easy not to tangle.</li>
            <li> Too easy to touch hot spot in process of styling.  </li>
            <li> I am 100% natural with very fine, dense, shoulder length hair, and wear my hair straight styled most of the time.</li>
            <li> The hot brush heats fully within a minute, and the adjustable heat setting works well on my fine hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and shoulder-length, and this thing works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> I ordered it and it arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> It heats up quickly (and turns off by itself).  </li>
            <li> Extremely happy with both fast delivery and the actual product.</li>
            <li> This small hot brush is perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> It heats quickly and the auto shut off is almost a must for me.  </li>
            <li> Heats up quickly....</li>
            <li> It heats up extremely quickly.  </li>
            <li> I like how it heats up quickly and also has the burst feature.</li>
            <li> It heats quickly.</li>
            <li> My hair stayed frizzy and lost its shape quickly.  </li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and I use it every day.</li>
            <li> Heats really quick.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li> so it works well for me to give a quick styling.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li> heats up quick</li>
            <li> Thank you for the quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I quickly returned it and ordered this one.  </li>
            <li> Super hair curler.  </li>
            <li> but I use high and it does not seem to damage my hair after using it for many months now.</li>
            <li> That chrome barrel gets very hot and will burn your fingers if you touch it.  </li>
            <li> That chrome barrel gets very hot and will burn your fingers if you touch it.  </li>
            <li> Heats up  very fast!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this hot brush.  </li>
            <li> I honestly have no clue why this curls so much better for me than any other wand or iron.</li>
            <li> Delivered very fast!</li>
            <li> I love the new model.  </li>
            <li> I find that it is easy to use and curls my hair much easier than using a blow dryer and brush.</li>
            <li> Its good for the price and does all that is advertised, but you have to be careful with the tip - you can still get burnt regardless of the \\&quot;cool tip\\&quot; feature.</li>
            <li> Heats up very quickly and is ready to go in a minute.</li>
            <li> Thanks for your fast, easy service!</li>
            <li> had it at #15 heat, and that was way too hot!</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li> It gets hot!</li>
            <li> This has a very quick heating and I love that there are multiple temperature settings.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, nice effect, works as expected.</li>
            <li> I have medium length hair that is fine and straight.  </li>
            <li> but my hair is so baby fine that the teeth make it work really well without leaving marks like a curling iron does.</li>
            <li> Great little item for the price.  </li>
            <li> If you use this size brush for curling this is a great little tool.</li>
            <li> This is a great little curling iron.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s remarkable that companies manage to make things a little less good each year in spite of their easy access to consumer comments and concerns.  </li>
            <li> This is a perfect product for anyone with fine, thin hair!  </li>
            <li> It is simple and effective.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Conair BC84SCS Instant Heat 3/4\\&quot; Hot Brush.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 86-year-old mother, who has had countless curling brush/irons over the years, and she is thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li> Has a wide variety of heat settings, which is good.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about it.</li>
            <li> The wide range of temperature is a really good feature.</li>
            <li> This hot brush iron is so sweet.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with this curling iron as I have a torn rotator and can&#x27;t use both hands to fix hair in the back of my head.  </li>
            <li> Best part is, the curls last much longer compared to the regular curling irons.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like it as much as my old one ( handled better and my hair wouldn&#x27;t slip out of it), but this</li>
            <li> I could not find anything I liked as well in the stores locally</li>
            <li> This is such a great tool for my fine and flat hair.  </li>
            <li> exactly what I needed; heats up fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Before getting this Conair hot brush I used to have a very old one from Braun, but they do not make it any more.</li>
            <li> But so many others have been fine and lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> Good price and got here before expected!</li>
            <li> The price if right.  </li>
            <li> Right?  </li>
            <li> Conair does curling irons right.  </li>
            <li> It stays in place and puts in just the right amount of churls.  </li>
            <li> The price was just right.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right size and doesn&#x27;t overcurl my hair.</li>
            <li> The brush is easy to use and helps me style my fine hair for every day without a lot of the fuss and time a regular curling iron hairdo requires.</li>
            <li> This hot brush works better on relaxed hair and does not get to the roots, but it gives my hair a silky soft feeling after I&#x27;m done using it.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it was exactly the same and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> MY original just broke after at least 10 years, so I was able to find the same model on Amazon for a great price.</li>
            <li> bought the 1 1/4 inch brush and liked the convenience of it, but the brush was simply too large to wrap my hair around.  </li>
            <li> wear my hair in a short style and its very fine</li>
            <li> I had a lot of difficulty picking between the two sizes for my first purchase and quickly began to wonder if the smaller brush (closer to the size of my curling iron) might not be a better choice for me.  </li>
            <li> Got this hot brush to take to Europe, but I can also use it right here at home.  </li>
            <li> In addition, Amazon&#x27;s price and super fast shipping just can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> On my old model with the removable tip, the bristles could be slid out of the tracks that hold them and easily cleaned.</li>
            <li> It heats up super fast and you can adjust the temperature setting.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While this contains a great deal of personal information, I am sharing it because there are others that may be facing similar problems.</li>
            <li> For years I have struggled with my fine and naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It heats up very fast, gets as hot as you want and gives me just the amount of curl that I want.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these hot sticks, one for each of my daughters.</li>
            <li> I like a hot brush that gets hot and this one has 25 settings.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable too!  </li>
            <li> About 8 months ago I purchased a Helen of Troy hot brush.</li>
            <li> I was able to only find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these hot brushes for years</li>
            <li> All features are exactly as described in the product review, including the auto-off component--a safety feature for users of any age.</li>
            <li> Funny</li>
            <li> and I have lost them while traveling, so I need to replace on occasion, but have not been able to find in local stores,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conairs website has this but for a much higher price.</li>
            <li> I wondered if I would have better results with a smaller brush.  </li>
            <li> Everything pertains to both hot brush sizes.  </li>
            <li> This brush does not get as hot as I would like it to</li>
            <li> With this hot brush, the curl stays put all day.</li>
            <li> I have had several of these Conair brushes and love them.</li>
            <li> It is partly my fault for not realizing the difference between a hot brush and a hot air brush.</li>
            <li> CAN&#x27;T FIND THIS HOT BRUSH ANYWHERE IN STORES</li>
            <li> , I use a bigger curling iron on top where my hair is longer.  </li>
            <li> my first one lasted for years.  </li>
            <li> This one also seems to pull my hair out more than the solid ones.</li>
            <li> This hot brush came without a box.</li>
            <li> I bought this hot brush specifically to take to Europe and use on their 220 currency.  </li>
            <li> I think it would even be better to buy a bigger brush head for the bangs if that was an option.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything including hot rollers, curlformers, wands, irons, flexi rods, hot flexi rods, spoolies, perms, and every crunching gel, mousse, cream, or spray known to man.</li>
            <li> I first purchased one of these in America whilst on holiday after the one I took with me stopped working</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will last for many years.</li>
            <li> Super-quick heatup, love the swivel cord, brushes hold hair in place while curling (I have short hair).</li>
            <li> First of all, Amazon got this to me within two day&#x27;s time via Amazon Prime.  </li>
            <li> The minute I turned on this hot brush, it immediately started to heat up.  </li>
            <li> Does get hot.  </li>
            <li> Heats up fast!  </li>
            <li> Use this hot brush all the time.</li>
            <li> The Conair  Heat  Hot  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this hot brush since 2008</li>
            <li> The bristles help to hold my hair onto the hot part of the wand.</li>
            <li> We purchased the hot stick for our up coming trip to Europe.</li>
            <li> my 3rd of this kind, definitely my favorite  for bangs and short hair, does not work with too long hair, tangles too easily</li>
            <li> Thanks for the super fast delivery</li>
            <li> This hot brush works very well on my fine, but full head of white hair.</li>
            <li> I get better curls with a flat hot iron then this product.  </li>
            <li> When I want more volume than a flat iron can give me, I use this hot brush.</li>
            <li> Only thing I would have loved to see in this product is a better brush, this brush is not bad at all, but my hair slip out of it while curling as the teeth are smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and the curls stay in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Great seller and quick response.</li>
            <li> I love that it has such a large range of heat levels too.</li>
            <li> I like it much better than a flat iron</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you are in the market for a hot brush!  </li>
            <li> I have short, hard to curl hair and this one works perfectly.</li>
            <li> If you have long hair, it tends to get snarled, but if you are careful, you can get some beautiful curls.</li>
            <li> This Conair appears very well made, heats up to any of the 21 heat settings in under one minute, has an extra feature which allows you to boost the heat and the bristles appear made of a better and stronger material.</li>
            <li> my personal opinion if you want nice, soft and shine hair do not use hair dryer...</li>
            <li> bought for size-really wanted regular 3/4\\&quot; curling iron--really like conair style-it does good for styling-have to hold longer because not solid heating surface</li>
            <li> And on the rare times that I do, I just kind of shake the brush a little and gently tug it away from my hair</li>
            <li> It heats super fast, has many settings for heat needed depending upon hair type, and after a few minutes of experimenting I was glad I bought the hot brush style instead of a regular curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I really do like the Conair Hot Brush.</li>
            <li> There is an on/off button with red or green indicator light, turbo heat on/off button, a turbo heat indicator light, comfortable textured handle, chrome barrel, plastic bristles, and a cool tip.  </li>
            <li> The delivery was fast, the items were packaged well, and the hot brush works according to description.</li>
            <li> this is because a brush has a different kind of open bristles with distinct balls at tips.</li>
            <li> It took a few tries to find the heat setting that works best but has worked very well.</li>
            <li> It can be easy to get your hair tangled, but just don&#x27;t wrap the hair around tightly, and don&#x27;t wrap any hair over itself, and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> But if I had had the large barrelled hot brush and the cream, life would have been so much easier.</li>
            <li> This hot brush works very well for my short hair and heats very quickly.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find a good &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; curling iron that gets hot.</li>
            <li> so you would not be able to dry your hair with it</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly, has 25 heat settings and gives soft curls.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 3/4-inch hot brush for myself and after experimenting a few times, liked it so much I ordered the 1-1/4-inch as a gift for a friend</li>
            <li> I love my new curling iron, its lightweight and heats up instantly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for touch ups, but when I used it on my hair that I didn&#x27;t blow dry, it didn&#x27;t give enough control.  </li>
            <li> I have fine permed hair, so I have to be cautious  multiple issues.  </li>
            <li> This particular one is perfect...size, controls, settings are all exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> My hair is short, straight, fine and thinning.</li>
            <li> Conair has a comfortable handle to use and the instant heat makes it very convenient.</li>
            <li> Fast service.</li>
            <li> They work really well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are 25 heat settings so you can go from gentle to blast.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t rave about it too much.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> and I really like how fast they heat up.</li>
            <li> Fast heat up.</li>
            <li> Brush prongs save your fingers from burning and make the whole thing easier to use even for the uncoordinated.</li>
            <li> After about one year, one of them doesn&#x27;t heat up as much, so I&#x27;ll have to replace it, but</li>
            <li> still works great...and it heats up REALLY fast.  </li>
            <li> I thought this would do the trick, but it really didn&#x27;t work at all for me.  </li>
            <li> Works very well, shuts off after a reasonable period of time if you get distracted.  </li>
            <li> I do not shampoo my hair each day and the volume stays in my hair very well.  </li>
            <li> That information is easily available at various online sites.  </li>
            <li> I do not shampoo my hair each day and the volume stays in my hair very well.  </li>
            <li> That information is easily available at various online sites.  </li>
            <li> and she says it works really well.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> thanks again.</li>
            <li> I really need a 1/2 inch barrel but can&#x27;t seem to come up with one with dual voltage.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and curls hair well .</li>
            <li> I had just returned a curling brush that was 3x as much as this one.  </li>
            <li> I only wish it wasnt just available as an &amp;#34;add</li>
            <li> I really like the automatic shut off also.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t take as much dexterity to use as a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I can get my hair done much faster</li>
            <li> and I really like the 30-second heat time.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> the teeth became very brittle and kept falling off.  </li>
            <li> The product works very well.  </li>
            <li> I can make waves or curls depending on how much hair I place around the barrel.</li>
            <li> This give my hair so much body</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> It really does suit my needs</li>
            <li> It heats up so fast.</li>
            <li> This curling iron really helps me do that.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I like these so much that I have them in two sizes.</li>
            <li> Not as straightening as a flat iron, but does a pretty nice job without the damaging effect of a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I wanted to replace my very old hot brush before it died.  </li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a similar model originally purchased in the 1980&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on the other reviews it does replace that process for many users, but didn&#x27;t for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love all the heat settings because the heat in other countries is hotter</li>
            <li> Great for my short hair-this is my backup since it took so long to find one that works well and saw others did the same thing.</li>
            <li> multiple heat settings, can get close to root area, no rest prongs to get in the way unwinds clean without tangling</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;d recommend is directions on how to clean it.</li>
            <li> Also, even though my hair is fine and not all that long, I find that it does tangle the hair</li>
            <li> It is ready for use within seconds of turning the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; switch and you choose the heat temperature for your own hair type (easy or difficult to take curl).</li>
            <li> Like many of us seniors, it was loosing it&#x27;s teeth from so much heating up and cooling down.  </li>
            <li> It is easy for her to use; she has limited mobility, and this works well.</li>
            <li> Same results, but much faster.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair super shiny as the barrel is ceramic.  </li>
            <li> A friend of mine has that one, but it&#x27;s too small to be effective with my hair length.</li>
            <li> , my old iron got hot when plugged in.</li>
            <li> This might be ok for people with fine, thin hair, but NOT for girls with thicker hair.</li>
            <li> But hey, my hair was super shiny after I used it, if it didnt hurt so bad it might have acutally felt good!</li>
            <li> I think the hot hair brush does a very good job on short or hair that comes half way down your neck.  </li>
            <li> Love the turbo feature that speeds up the heating process to less than one minute.</li>
            <li> It takes longer but the reult is more fullness and less drying.</li>
            <li> the cord has become shorter, and the bristles are more brittle and less rubbery so that they don&#x27;t hold the hair quite as well</li>
            <li> I especially like how quickly this model heats up, and the automatic shut-off feature is another plus.</li>
            <li> Love the two attachments as my older one had only the smaller attachment.</li>
            <li> It did require a converter unless we were lucky enough to be in a place that also had 110 currency...like our cruise boat on the Rhine.</li>
            <li> This one works better than any I&#x27;ve ever had, including one 4 times more expensive from a beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> It is quick and I don&#x27;t get burned (unlike what happens with a traditional curling iron)</li>
            <li> You can heat it up quick or regular time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of brands, and I just can&#x27;t find a hot brush that is hot enough to curl my hair.  </li>
            <li> This is the perfect appliance for my hair, works better than traditional curling iron or flat iron for my thick, curly hair with a few wiry grays.</li>
            <li> I have tried regular curling irons (1 inch and 1.5 inch); the curls are good but they don&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It does not heat up so high that it fries my hair...</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The brush helps hold fine hair without slipping out like others do.</li>
            <li> originally bought the 1 1/4 inch Instant Heat Hot Brush because I had allowed myself to be convinced by watching a demonstration of a similar product on television that the size would work well for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Begin with clean, dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised that it took that much heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it took that much heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I really like it for a soft touch around the edges</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if your hair prefers a professional level of heat (325-450) to hold a curl all day in very curly hair.</li>
            <li> But actually I wanted a hot air brush, not this, because I have very short hair, but i was mistaken when i ordered hot brush instead of hot air brush.</li>
            <li> So apparently I don&#x27;t think I know how to use a hot brush cause my hair keeps getting tangled in it.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for many years, they do eventually not heat as well after a few years</li>
            <li> It worth use it combined with the bigger size, for differente hair lenght.</li>
            <li> This Conair hot brush has so much quality built in at a sper low price.  </li>
            <li> , so I didnt have much trouble ordering it. :-)</li>
            <li> I have pretty straight hair and every now and then like a different look.</li>
            <li> and I could have curls more round and softer.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly, gives you soft curls and waves with no dents like a regular curling iron sometimes does.</li>
            <li> Right size for short hair</li>
            <li> the plug right next to you</li>
            <li> I have curly chin length hair and the 3/4&amp;#34; works well to quickly tame the frizz of my top layer and still retain the curl.</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t live up to all this, I&#x27;ll let you know.</li>
            <li> and when I needed a new one I could not find one in any store.</li>
            <li> It is my opinion that women over 40 do not look as lovely in long hairdos but in spite of what I think there are a lot who do wear it long.</li>
            <li> Just be careful even the first minute or two because the metal between the plastic &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; also gets hot.  </li>
            <li> I have always used Hot Rollers and a curling iron (which is out of the question now that it&#x27;s short).</li>
            <li> I debated getting an exact replacement curling brush since my Sasson had performed well for several years.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this accidentally last year while looking for a hot air blowdryer brush.</li>
            <li> I ordered the smaller size and it does exactly what I want.  </li>
            <li> brushes work and are designed exactly the same.  </li>
            <li> This is my third hot brush</li>
            <li> I have gone through several of these hot brushes.  </li>
            <li> This one just doesn&#x27;t seem to heat up nearly as hot as the larger one.  </li>
            <li> I was actually looking for hot air one with dual voltage (to use for my vacation) and mistakenly bought this product.  </li>
            <li> I have used hot air brush for years because I cannot hold a brush and hairdryer at the same time.  </li>
            <li> When I did a search, I thought it would bring up only hot air curling brushes, but instead this one came up and it is not a hot-air curling brush.  </li>
            <li> It is a hot brush similar to a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as ordered; solid product</li>
            <li> I have used the Instant Heat Hot Brush before.  </li>
            <li> Definitely would recommend this hot brush.</li>
            <li> I should explain that a great deal of my styling failure is due to user error.</li>
            <li> I am still unable to get a full curl in my hair using this brush, but it makes some cute, old-fashioned ringlets on the bottom ~3 inches of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I like this hot brush very much, but the small piece of plastic that serves as the stand really gets in the way.  </li>
            <li> I saw a commercial for a similar product priced around $200, so I went on Amazon and found this &amp;#34;curling iron&amp;#34; for less than a 1/10, and from a reputable brand!  </li>
            <li> My fine hair has little body and this curler gives me lift and curl.  </li>
            <li> As always one has to be careful because it does get very hot.</li>
            <li> No sense in returning it since it would cost just as much as the new product to ship it back and get a replacement.</li>
            <li> I have short hair (does not cover my ears) which is very fine, but also thick and straight.  </li>
            <li> Very hard to use and does not curl hair effectively.  </li>
            <li> I have very short, stubborn hair which has been a little challenging to style.  </li>
            <li> It was in a clear plastic bag.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the roller-effect that curling irons get (read: the old lady hair styles).</li>
            <li> My professional ones were plugged in about 50-60 hours per week and they each lasted about 10 years.</li>
            <li> I plan on ordering at least one more to put away for the day when this one bites the dust.  </li>
            <li> bought this for my 84 year old mother.  </li>
            <li> fortunately the \\&quot;missing from the shelves</li>
            <li> It is  much too big for me,....</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s o.k.,</li>
            <li> so I was surprised to see that they still had this one.  </li>
            <li> That is what I REALLY need with my short hair.</li>
            <li> Really like the brush feature which makes it easier to roll and manage the hair than a regular curling wand.  </li>
            <li> and I nearly melted.</li>
            <li> It works well with my straight medium short hair.  </li>
            <li> I am a 30 year old woman and I am ashamed to admit...</li>
            <li> I am getting ready to use it now for a second time</li>
            <li> I bought this because i just got my shoulder length hair permed and this helps take out some of the perm curl and give me a natural curl.</li>
            <li> Old one just wore out.  </li>
            <li> Bought this to replace the one I had that died of old age.  </li>
            <li> The old one was over 15 years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using the old one.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t come in a box so don&#x27;t be surprised.  </li>
            <li> and it makes my hair incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> and I on&#x27;t get soft curls with those.</li>
            <li> My old one died and this is just like my old one.  </li>
            <li> Granted, I&#x27;m comparing a $100 flat iron to a $10 curling iron,, but I have used drugstore curling irons (e.g. Revlon) successfully too, and unfortunately, this product just didn&#x27;t get hot enough to hold a style.</li>
            <li> First off I want to say that I have very thin, very fine, wavy</li>
            <li> And oh yes, this brush also cools down rather quickly,</li>
            <li> Edit review March 27, 2015 --- I had to retire this hot brush because the cord began to be loose where it joins the body of the device.  </li>
            <li> Recently bought the Conair Instant Heat 3/4 Hot Brush.</li>
            <li> This is the second Conair Hot Brush that I have purchased over the last 11 years.</li>
            <li> I was hoping I would find another one similar, and I found the exact same one!!!!</li>
            <li> With regular curling irons, I was always burning myself,  The hot brush has eliminated that entirely while still &amp;#34;catching&amp;#34; my hair.</li>
            <li> Will stick to regular curling iron, would return but was so cheap not worth paying shipping to return.</li>
            <li> the power key did not work properly however, the seller was willing to replace I don&#x27;t want to replace</li>
            <li> Have larger hot brush but needed smaller one too.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m one of the few people who uses a curling brush instead of a curling iron, and it is very hard to find a good one at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> old one lasted a long long time until it finally died.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t expect to find another and at a fantastic price.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is you have to be careful and only touch the end because it will burn your finger if you touch the middle of the brush especially if it is on a higher temperature.  </li>
            <li> For my short, straight, fine, thick hair I have settled on a heat setting of 17 which Conair&#x27;s chart considers medium-high.  </li>
            <li> For my short, straight, fine, thick hair I have settled on a heat setting of 17 which Conair&#x27;s chart considers medium-high.  </li>
            <li> Only thing I didn&#x27;t like about the new one was,it didn&#x27;t have a built-in stand to keep it from laying directly on the counter.</li>
            <li> I have medium volume straight long hair</li>
            <li> this is coming from someone with long straight hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just remember to be careful when using the hot brush.  </li>
            <li> Just remember to be careful when using the hot brush.  </li>
            <li> Last time, I went to Ulta and pad about $40 for one, only to realize it was NOT dual voltage and barely got hot.  </li>
            <li> so do I really want to go through the hassle of returning it to Amazon, ordering a new one (which I can&#x27;t predict how long it will last?)  </li>
            <li> I like the new one even though its slightly different.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hot enough and you don&#x27;t need to leave on long.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hot brush after my other one died.  </li>
            <li> This hot brush still heats up really fast, but there are problems that I did not have with the same Conair item that I purchased a few years ago:  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy to clean between it&#x27;s bristles, but inexpensive enough to buy several at a time and ditch one when the mood hits for a new one.</li>
            <li> First I spritzed with water and towel dried, to avoid scorching; if hair is slightly damp it works better, I think; if too wet, it&#x27;ll scorch and burn</li>
            <li> It heats fast and does the job in minimal time.  </li>
            <li> but it was over ten years old and just gave up one day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But for me it is bothersome because when I&#x27;m ready to curl my hair it is not ready because it has turned off.</li>
            <li> The brush did absolutely nothing for her hair after I spent forever trying to make it work for her hair.</li>
            <li> I like it better than a curling iron because with a curling iron, my thin hair tends to come out of the clamp.</li>
            <li> This is the third hot brush I&#x27;ve used and used up over the years and still love the design - I know it will not last forever, everything breaks or gets broken in it&#x27;s limited lifetime</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t curl as well as I remember from a previous hot brush.  </li>
            <li> It took me over half an hour to use it the first time and my hair would get tangled, but I got the hang of it in a while.</li>
            <li> My other one still works, just takes longer to heat because it has so much build up from hair spray on it.  </li>
            <li> It is working well, little slow warm up.</li>
            <li> and they are more likely to damage thin hair.  </li>
            <li> One major flaw that I think will have me sending it back is that the tip is not removable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m replacing an old one (same brand) which doesn&#x27;t always work, but the tines on the new one are very rough and scratch both my scalp and hands</li>
            <li> I have long, medium texture hair with natural wave and this brush</li>
            <li> The spikes on this brush are so short that they can barely grasp my hair.  </li>
            <li> Previously, I&#x27;ve burned my scalp or my fingers with a brush that had only one temperature -- SUPER HOT; or found that the brushes whose temperatures could be regulated either didn&#x27;t ever get quite hot enough, or had no indicator to let me know when the desired heat setting had been reached, or were uncomfortable to hold and/or use.</li>
            <li> the heating my burn my hair, and secondly, ladies please, if you know for sure ur hair is thin and flat, don&#x27;t even try this!  </li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is that I am not delighted with the location of the heat controller (YES, it can even be adjusted to the heat needed for your particular hair!), although it is stiff enough that it doesn&#x27;t get easily knocked off your setting...which is definitely a plus!  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine and thin and I feel curling brushes are easier on my hair and easier for me to use.</li>
            <li> These types of curling irons definitely won&#x27;t be replacing my conventional curling iron, but it does a decent job of straightening or adding a bit of a twist to the ends.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Someone told me about a small barrelled hot brush and a little &amp;#34;Ion Straightening Solutions Jojoba Flat Iron Cream&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> I have used these for years to get a little body and curl in my straight hair.</li>
            <li> Always i use hot brushes take little long time but is better.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more awkward to use than my old one</li>
            <li> I have an inverted bob, a little past chin length on the sides, fine hair but lots of it.</li>
            <li> So much easier to use than a regular curling iron and safer for shaky old women like me.</li>
            <li> My other one was so old</li>
            <li> Sadly the Conair curling I had, for many years was no longer working, so I ordered another type,&lt;br /&gt;that was, just worthless, cheap and didn&#x27;t work worth</li>
            <li> Still I have had a hard time styling my hair with hot air brush.  </li>
            <li> My hair is SUPER thin, even though it looks thicker than it actually is, and when I used this to brush my hair it just scrapes my scalp.  </li>
            <li> Since the picture on the package itself showed tight curls and it says right on there that you can achieve tight curls</li>
            <li> you need hair long enough to roll around it</li>
            <li> It also gives me volume that nothing else has ever given my flat lifeless</li>
            <li> I hope this one last as long.  </li>
            <li> I believe it takes just as long to curl my hair as with a regular curling iron but the curls hold all day with this appliance and that makes all the difference!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although the last a long time, I purchased two just to have them on hand.</li>
            <li> I have to flat iron it</li>
            <li> Highly recommended also the delivery service although expensive was first class arriving after 6 days.</li>
            <li> It has a &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; heating mode and it will turn itself off if left on for too long!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using curling brushes every day for a very long time, &amp; I&#x27;ve finally found one that has everything I&#x27;ve been looking for.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and I have less problem with tangling and disengaging my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a retired hairdresser and I was reluctant to purchase less than a professional product.</li>
            <li> and it heats in half the time of my old one...thus saving electricity.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second I want to say that I am a complete moron when it comes to styling my own hair.</li>
            <li> Works really well on my hard to curl hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is somewhat wiry and 2 inches long with a tendency to not hold a curl.</li>
            <li> But tangled in my long hair.</li>
            <li> Takes too long to figure out how work it.</li>
            <li> does not work on long hair.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know how I lived with out it for so long.</li>
            <li> Works well and curls hold all day long.  </li>
            <li> I have long, layered, hair.</li>
            <li> This purchase was a replacement for one I had for a long time.</li>
            <li> Brush lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> prefer to have one that has a small stand to keep the hot iron off of surfaces when I put it down.  </li>
            <li> So i have very tight curly hair naturally, and i don&#x27;t like using flat irons as they clamp the hair together</li>
            <li> For the people who complained that the lights are hard to see, just shadow the lights with your hand to see if they&#x27;re on or off, easy peasy.</li>
            <li> A tip I found is blow dry your hair but not completely and than finish drying it with the brush.  </li>
            <li> This one was no exception - not hot enough.  </li>
            <li> Use on DRY hair !  </li>
            <li> Of course, it&#x27;s out of warranty - only cost less than $10</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to blow dry my hair, nor do I like to walk around with wet hair courting colds.</li>
            <li> It stays in my suitcase all the time because it is dual current and works in the US and other foreign countries.  </li>
            <li> It only takes less than 15 mins to get my hair done now</li>
            <li> But hey it was at least 10 years old!</li>
            <li> As it gets some length on it between haircuts it lays down completely flat on my head.  </li>
            <li> now lay down flat.  </li>
            <li> Usually I use my SuperStar flat iron to curl by flipping the ends, it never causes damage or fries my hair and the the curls and style will last all day with those.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the last one died too soon; the on-switch quit turning it on.  </li>
            <li> I use it every day and have only had to replace it a few times.  </li>
            <li> Be careful not to touch the metal is can</li>
            <li> And you need to be careful to avoid tangling the hair in the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li> Curling brushes are getting harder and harder to find.  </li>
            <li> I only takes a few seconds to curl.  </li>
            <li> Works just as well as expected.  </li>
            <li> This 3/4&amp;#34; will not wrap my hair, even though a 1 1/2&amp;#34; open round brush will.</li>
            <li> Tried a few different brands paid up to $30 and nothing works well.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Daily use does wear them out after a few years</li>
            <li> You have to be careful.  </li>
            <li> Need to be careful or it will burn your fingers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t provide enough control for thick, coarse hair&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> and I think the iron will be a sticky unusable mess before too long.</li>
            <li> It is less harful to my hair than using the curler sets as you do not leave it in the hair very long.</li>
            <li> It curled my hair very little compared to my regular conair curling iron.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other brand.</li>
            <li> So I will have to make due with this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of curing irons.  </li>
            <li> Have had other brands curling brush irons, but this one does not tangle my hair.  </li>
            <li> would never use any other brush.</li>
            <li> careful NOT to burn your hair when use this product!</li>
            <li> My Mom needed my help in replacing her hot brush and I&#x27;m the closest computer genius (so sad).  </li>
            <li> I have only used it twice in the past year.</li>
            <li> I got the back of my hair cut short and was having a difficult time using the flat iron in that area.  </li>
            <li> A few weeks after I started using this product, a few of the words on the handle started melting off, what remained read \\&quot;Instant Con\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is the you have to be careful not to get burned at the tip when inserting hair.  </li>
            <li> You should NOT try and use it like a conventional curling iron because your hair WILL get tangled.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to help with certain parts of my hair that like to curl in weird directions.  </li>
            <li> The controls are intuitive and aren&#x27;t subject to being inadvertently shut off while using the brush (unlike other curling irons.)</li>
            <li> Like the previous reviewer says, this is NOT Hot Air Hair Brush.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the same one I had &amp; died; was having hard time finding in stores &amp; then went on line to Conair....</li>
            <li> Will keep because it&#x27;s not worth the expense of returning.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I did not get much use from this product.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would eliminate the need to blow-with-a-brush my thick short hair.  </li>
            <li> She is mixed, and has thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is so straight trying to get it to wrap around a curling brush was next to impossible, but when I used this one it wrapped around with no problems and the curls stayed for three days.  </li>
            <li> but I will see down the road how it holds up.</li>
            <li> I just put a little water on my hair then do styling which usually takes only a few minutes with this iron</li>
            <li> When it stopped working I had another brand that I had previously purchased but did not like.  </li>
            <li> I had one previously and wore it out.  </li>
            <li> and I will be buying another when I need it&lt;br /&gt;much cheaper than previous curling brushes I have bought</li>
            <li> one cost me less than$11</li>
            <li> I use it on medium heat to style and curl my slightly damp hair.  </li>
            <li> seems to heat even faster than previous models, a plus for me.</li>
            <li> When I used it it did nothing for my hair and also there was black stuff coming out in my hair.  </li>
            <li> not really good for short hair.  </li>
            <li> It prevents a tight hold on the rolled hair.</li>
            <li> it curls up too tight.  </li>
            <li> The nylon bristles have little tips so your hair doesn&#x27;t fall out while styling.</li>
            <li> I get lots of volume, the cowlicks on the crown of my head are controlled, I don&#x27;t have curls or waves, but the little tag ends of hair around my ears and nape of my neck</li>
            <li> It would work on women that prefer just a little curl.</li>
            <li> Smooths out while adding some curl to hair that was a little over-processed by a perm.</li>
            <li> The one thing I would like is a little longer cord to work with.</li>
            <li> I just got my hair cut (after having waist length hair all my life) and was having trouble styling it.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> and then it died a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I re-buy them every few years as does my Mom</li>
            <li> And when you use it, its hard to grab the tip of the hair while curling/rolling it coz their is no grip or clip to grab the hair, so you have to use your other hand and manually hold the tip of the hair while rolling it.</li>
            <li> It can be used as easily to tame the hair as to curl it...</li>
            <li> cause I have very thick coarse hair, plus getting those hard to reach places are pain in the butt.</li>
            <li> Maybe if I did some extra work on my hair it wouldnt hurt so bad, but I&#x27;d need to have extra time.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid with the predominance of mop hairdos these days short hair equipment would be discontinued or at least harder to find</li>
            <li> This is the only brush ill ever buy and believe me.....</li>
            <li> It heats up almost instantly and the cord never gets twisted.  </li>
            <li> But unfortunately it  doesn&#x27;t provide enough control to replace that.  </li>
            <li> I was unable to find this product on stores locally, so I turned to Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Usually whenever I do my hair</li>
            <li> Auto shut off/turbo heat in less 1 minute !!</li>
            <li> Hard to find item.</li>
            <li> I would have a hard time locating them again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time finding one of these that does the trick...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone - you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> it gets harder and harder to turn it on, it is like there is a bad wire connection.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not adept at using this tool, but it has done nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Ihave thick, course hair and</li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s basically just a clipless iron with bristles</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s impossible to find one in my local stores</li>
            <li> She uses it everyday and doesn&#x27;t have one complaint about it!!</li>
            <li> Not happy, Not thrilled with the length of the plastic bristles.</li>
            <li> i have Black Hair soft and shine but when use Hair dryer looks terrible like lion hair!!</li>
            <li> Brush curling wands are very hard to find.</li>
            <li> I have one with tines that are twice that length for my very thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Add that I&#x27;m not a great stylist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Again, I&#x27;m not a great stylist (no patience) and this is a breeze to use.</li>
            <li> My hair is really thin</li>
            <li> I did find that, even though I have thin hair, I had to put the setting to the highest and push the \\&quot;boost\\&quot; button.  </li>
            <li> I have had Chemo, which made the my hair problems worse and also suffer with an autoimmune disease that causes my hair to thin and causes bald areas.  </li>
            <li> This brush allows me the ability to cover the areas that are the worst and give my hair a much fuller</li>
            <li> If you mess up your curl one time, it is impossible to fix it.</li>
            <li> Even those of us who are all thumbs when it comes to this sort of thing can achieve dramatic results.</li>
            <li> You never have a bad hair day with this little tool.....</li>
            <li> I was not all wrong, but after I used it a couple of times</li>
            <li> Needless to say I bought her 2 of them, 1 to take home and 1 to leave at my home.</li>
            <li> After reading &amp;#34;favorable&amp;#34; reviews, I thought this would be perfect...not for me, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> and I was not happy with the results!</li>
            <li> How wrong I was.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely inconvenient to use on my wavy hair, and I feel that if I keep using it, it will make my hair quality worse.</li>
            <li> It is sad that I can&#x27;t contact anyone because of the time limit.  </li>
            <li> I ended up donating mine to Goodwill after a week of failed attempts at styles.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to catch your hair to roll it and curl or style with it....very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s disappointing, but it does &amp;#34;some good&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Way to small for anyone - very disappointed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nearly impossible for me to get the curls that I want.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> ~ I&#x27;m very rarely disappointed with anything I purchase from them.    </li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> and so I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was WRONG!!</li>
            <li> I hate curling my hair and using curling rods.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> It is really annoying!!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product.  Fast service.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these hot sticks, one for each of my daughters. They work really well. If you have long hair, it tends to get snarled, but if you are careful, you can get some beautiful curls.</li>
            <li> I just got my hair cut (after having waist length hair all my life) and was having trouble styling it. Someone told me about a small barrelled hot brush and a little &amp;#34;Ion Straightening Solutions Jojoba Flat Iron Cream&amp;#34;). Oh, my gosh, where have you been all my life! I have always used Hot Rollers and a curling iron (which is out of the question now that it&#x27;s short). But if I had had the large barrelled hot brush and the cream, life would have been so much easier.</li>
            <li> My hair is short, straight, fine and thinning. It doesn&#x27;t hold a curl. Curling irons must be set to &amp;#34;fry&amp;#34; to get a bend that lasts longer than an hour. Add that I&#x27;m not a great stylist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever bought next to my Chi dryer. It is incredibly easy to use. The nylon bristles have little tips so your hair doesn&#x27;t fall out while styling. I just run it through, section by section, with a rolling movement. It takes about 3 minutes and it looks great. It doesn&#x27;t have the roller-effect that curling irons get (read: the old lady hair styles). It softly lifts and adds a nice wave. I add a spritz of liquid texturizer and I&#x27;m out the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 25 heat settings so you can go from gentle to blast. It heats up within 30 seconds. The controls are intuitive and aren&#x27;t subject to being inadvertently shut off while using the brush (unlike other curling irons.) You can use it close to the scalp because the bristles protect against burns.&lt;br /&gt;It is foolproof. Again, I&#x27;m not a great stylist (no patience) and this is a breeze to use.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore....so I was thrilled when I found it here.  Works like a charm I purchased it to replace one I had for several years.</li>
            <li> tried another brand and this one i have used for years so I was really happy to find it again after my last one died.</li>
            <li> I love this hot brush. I have been using the same one for years. The only thing that keeps changing is the packaging. This is the only brush ill ever buy and believe me.....I have he many.</li>
            <li> VERY QUICK HEAT UP AND RELIABLE COMPANY!</li>
            <li> Unit was perfect for about 2 months and then died.</li>
            <li> Love my Conair Curling Iron/comb....it&#x27;s the same one I had &amp; died; was having hard time finding in stores &amp; then went on line to Conair....and sure enough there it was, lucky for me!!!</li>
            <li> I really do like the Conair Hot Brush. I like a hot brush that gets hot and this one has 25 settings. I will recommend it to anyone looking for a good hot brush. It also, turns itself off if you forget to . I like that feature! The price is reasonable too!  I ordered two!</li>
            <li> It is working well, little slow warm up. But actually I wanted a hot air brush, not this, because I have very short hair, but i was mistaken when i ordered hot brush instead of hot air brush.</li>
            <li> The price if right.  It is simple and effective.  As always one has to be careful because it does get very hot.</li>
            <li> I love the brush, easy to hold, heats very quickly, also love variable heat settings.</li>
            <li> I like this hot brush very much, but the small piece of plastic that serves as the stand really gets in the way.  It prevents a tight hold on the rolled hair. I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;d like to try to cut or break it off. It is really annoying!!</li>
            <li> I owned a Conair Hot Brush for many years, so this replacement purchase was a no-brainer. Conair hair care products are dependable and cost-effective. I especially like how quickly this model heats up, and the automatic shut-off feature is another plus. The brush is easy to use and helps me style my fine hair for every day without a lot of the fuss and time a regular curling iron hairdo requires. You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this product. In addition, Amazon&#x27;s price and super fast shipping just can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Recently bought the Conair Instant Heat 3/4 Hot Brush. It is everything I&#x27;d hoped for, and more! It heats up very quickly, has a great adjustment for temperature, doesn&#x27;t tangle, and is very comfortable to hold. It curls very easily, and brushes out smoothly. I feel like I should buy a spare. When you find something that good, at a good price, why not have an extra on hand?   I would recommend this to anyone with short to medium hair. You never have a bad hair day with this little tool.....</li>
            <li> I had an older model of this curling iron that I loved and had for many years.  When it stopped working I had another brand that I had previously purchased but did not like.  So, I found the Conair on Amazon at a great price.  I ordered it and it arrived quickly.  I love the new model.  It lets you know when the iron is heated and works just great!</li>
            <li> I prefer a curling iron with teeth because it makes styling my short hair easier. This particular one is perfect...size, controls, settings are all exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I debated getting an exact replacement curling brush since my Sasson had performed well for several years.  I needed a second one for office touch-ups.  Conair has a comfortable handle to use and the instant heat makes it very convenient. The bristles are soft and I have less problem with tangling and disengaging my hair.  Thinking about getting another Conair to replace the Sasson @home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a retired hairdresser and I was reluctant to purchase less than a professional product. About 8 months ago I purchased a Helen of Troy hot brush. It took several minutes to heat and almost immediately the bristles began to break off. My professional ones were plugged in about 50-60 hours per week and they each lasted about 10 years. This Conair appears very well made, heats up to any of the 21 heat settings in under one minute, has an extra feature which allows you to boost the heat and the bristles appear made of a better and stronger material. If it doesn&#x27;t live up to all this, I&#x27;ll let you know.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this item for years and finally had to replace it. Most stores don&#x27;t even stock it as it&#x27;s too inexpensive for them to bother with. I was able to only find it on Amazon. Most curling brushes don&#x27;t work. This one has longer bristles that are spaced closer together for easier use. I can&#x27;t rave about it too much.  The best curling brush on the market. Perfect for anyone who has a problem using both arms in doing their hair.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying using this Hot Brush it gives a great curl. I would recommend it to anyone. Easy to use and the curls stay in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Great seller and quick response. Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> This is the second Conair Hot Brush that I have purchased over the last 11 years. It has multiple heat settings for styling and the auto off is great feature. The combs last through the various styling products used. Tolerates any travel conditions including trips to the gym. I recommend this product and I&#x27;m considering purchasing a back-up in case Conair stops manufacturing this one!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Conair BC84SCS Instant Heat 3/4\\&quot; Hot Brush. I was happy with the description of the item and the speedy delivery, price was great, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these hot brushes for years and I love them. They are perfect for short hair and I really like how fast they heat up. I haven&#x27;t seen them in stores for years so I was happy to find that Amazon has them.</li>
            <li> Just perfect. Right size for short hair and it heats in half the time of my old one...thus saving electricity.Great product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hot brush after my other one died.  Had the same kind before and worked great.  I have short, hard to curl hair and this one works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this curling iron.  I have medium length hair that is fine and straight.  I need a curling iron with teeth and it&#x27;s impossible to find one in my local stores so I checked out Amazon and was thrilled to find the Conair curling iron.  It heats up quickly (and turns off by itself).  I plan on ordering at least one more to put away for the day when this one bites the dust.  I am so happy I checked out Amazon ~ I&#x27;m very rarely disappointed with anything I purchase from them.    Update:  The above mentioned curling iron stopped working - no warning, no slowing up heating.  Nothing.  Just. stopped. working.  Of course, it&#x27;s out of warranty - only cost less than $10 so do I really want to go through the hassle of returning it to Amazon, ordering a new one (which I can&#x27;t predict how long it will last?)  paying for postage both ways?  I don&#x27;t think so.....I will however, contact Conair re: their inferior product and will continue to seek out curling iron with brushes.  I am so disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this brand and model for many years.  I use it every day and have only had to replace it a few times.  For the money you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> Finally found a curling iron that does all that it promises at a great price.  The adjustable heat is good for not burning hair or fingers, my hair has never looked better. Somehow it also curls to where your hair will look thicker. The brush helps hold fine hair without slipping out like others do.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. It is the second time I get one. Before getting this Conair hot brush I used to have a very old one from Braun, but they do not make it any more. Since I discovered the Conair hot brush I am not planning to switch to a different brand because it just works perfectly for me, the size, the shape and the way it works; it is what I need.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t curl as well as I remember from a previous hot brush.  That&#x27;s my fault, not the fault of the product.  Maybe when my hair&#x27;s longer it will work better for me.  I am glad I got the 3/4&amp;#34; though.</li>
            <li> Fast heat up. Brush prongs save your fingers from burning and make the whole thing easier to use even for the uncoordinated.</li>
            <li> So apparently I don&#x27;t think I know how to use a hot brush cause my hair keeps getting tangled in it. And when my hair gets tangled in it I start screaming and panacking and yank the cord out so my hair doesn&#x27;t burn off like that one youtube video..... ::sigh::</li>
            <li> I purchased this accidentally last year while looking for a hot air blowdryer brush. At first I was annoyed at my stupidity, then I was thrilled! I have long, medium texture hair with natural wave and this brush styles it beautifully. I use it after I&#x27;ve blown my hair out and it provides perfect loose curls/waves that stay for hours. I have one for home and one for my office. It heats up very fast and is perfect for quick touch ups. After about one year, one of them doesn&#x27;t heat up as much, so I&#x27;ll have to replace it, but at this price, who cares? Also, I brought this to Europe and the UK with me and it worked perfectly with a plug converter! Btw, this is for the larger size barrel, not the 0.75 inch. A friend of mine has that one, but it&#x27;s too small to be effective with my hair length.</li>
            <li> I bought this over a year ago...still works great...and it heats up REALLY fast.  If I were to lose it during travel, I&#x27;d definitely buy this same one again.</li>
            <li> Does everything features listed...Auto shut off/turbo heat in less 1 minute !!&lt;br /&gt;for best results do not use the hot brush with wet hair, my hair using this brush is shine &amp; looks free of static or frizz!!&lt;br /&gt;This my personal opinion if you want nice, soft and shine hair do not use hair dryer...i have Black Hair soft and shine but when use Hair dryer looks terrible like lion hair!! Always i use hot brushes take little long time but is better.&lt;br /&gt;When i saw this brush with Dual Voltage $9.99 and free shipping!!  I bought two and  now i ordered one more!!</li>
            <li> This makes a great \\&quot;girl\\&quot; gift for home or travel use. Easy to use, turns itself off and gives a great \\&quot;curl\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 86-year-old mother, who has had countless curling brush/irons over the years, and she is thrilled with it.  It handles easily and does not burn her thinning hair.  All features are exactly as described in the product review, including the auto-off component--a safety feature for users of any age.</li>
            <li> I got the back of my hair cut short and was having a difficult time using the flat iron in that area.  I thought this would do the trick, but it really didn&#x27;t work at all for me.  I had to return it.</li>
            <li> I use this curler every day.  It&#x27;s perfect for hair that is 1-3 inches in length.  It heats up almost instantly and the cord never gets twisted.  I&#x27;ve been using various sized Conair hot brushes for the past 8-10 years.</li>
            <li> bought this for my 84 year old mother.  She loves it because it&#x27;s light weight and it grabs her fine hair nicely.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom has a birthday present and she LOVES it! She uses it everyday and doesn&#x27;t have one complaint about it!! Plus it only took two days for it to ship! I would recommend it to anyone!!</li>
            <li> Use it everyday.  It heats fast and does the job in minimal time.  So much easier to use than a regular curling iron and safer for shaky old women like me.</li>
            <li> Extremely happy with both fast delivery and the actual product. I recommended the hot air brush to a friend and she is also delighted with the product.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a similar model originally purchased in the 1980&#x27;s. This is the perfect appliance for my hair, works better than traditional curling iron or flat iron for my thick, curly hair with a few wiry grays.</li>
            <li> sent back did not like it</li>
            <li> I had one of these hot air brushes for almost 20 years and loved it.  I dropped it and it broke.  I like the new one even though its slightly different. Love the two attachments as my older one had only the smaller attachment. This model doesn&#x27;t have as strong an air flow so you would not be able to dry your hair with it but it&#x27;s nice for smoothing the frizzies and styling your hair.  Ihave thick, course hair and it works well for me.</li>
            <li> good product I always buy the same one.</li>
            <li> I love this hot brush because the temperature is adjustable and it is easy to use and very dependable. Another great feature is the cord rotates.</li>
            <li> A few weeks after I started using this product, a few of the words on the handle started melting off, what remained read \\&quot;Instant Con\\&quot;.  Funny Right?  But it got me thnking, I started to wonder if this was healthy for my hair.  I dont think the plates are ceramic, so the heating my burn my hair, and secondly, ladies please, if you know for sure ur hair is thin and flat, don&#x27;t even try this!  My hair is SUPER thin, even though it looks thicker than it actually is, and when I used this to brush my hair it just scrapes my scalp.  I swear, I have got headaches after everytime I use it!!  Maybe if I did some extra work on my hair it wouldnt hurt so bad, but I&#x27;d need to have extra time.  But hey, my hair was super shiny after I used it, if it didnt hurt so bad it might have acutally felt good!</li>
            <li> Works very well, shuts off after a reasonable period of time if you get distracted.  My hair never tangles in it (but it is fairly short).  Many heat settings but I use high and it does not seem to damage my hair after using it for many months now.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for many years, they do eventually not heat as well after a few years and I have lost them while traveling, so I need to replace on occasion, but have not been able to find in local stores, fortunately the \\&quot;missing from the shelves items\\&quot; can be found on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The hot brush heats fully within a minute, and the adjustable heat setting works well on my fine hair. It does everything I need it to do.</li>
            <li> I have been looking everywhere for this curling brush,I owned one but it was over ten years old and just gave up one day.&lt;br /&gt;I wear my hair in a short style and its very fine but I like to have some curl to it,a regular curling iron does not give e a curl that hods in my hair,this however does. I don&#x27;t know why or how but it does.... It doesn&#x27;t tangle in my hair jut pulls right through and leaves a cute bouncy curl.&lt;br /&gt;Conairs website has this but for a much higher price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m replacing an old one (same brand) which doesn&#x27;t always work, but the tines on the new one are very rough and scratch both my scalp and hands and so I&#x27;m disappointed. I&#x27;ll have to try using some sandpaper on it.</li>
            <li> Edit review March 27, 2015 --- I had to retire this hot brush because the cord began to be loose where it joins the body of the device.  I&#x27;ve just placed my order for the 3/4&amp;#34; brush once again because I like this specific brush so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought the 1 1/4 inch Instant Heat Hot Brush because I had allowed myself to be convinced by watching a demonstration of a similar product on television that the size would work well for my hair.  I was not all wrong, but after I used it a couple of times I wondered if I would have better results with a smaller brush.  I have short hair (does not cover my ears) which is very fine, but also thick and straight.  As it gets some length on it between haircuts it lays down completely flat on my head.  I need height and volume, but don&#x27;t want curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the 1 1/4 inch brush and liked the convenience of it, but the brush was simply too large to wrap my hair around.  I had a lot of difficulty picking between the two sizes for my first purchase and quickly began to wonder if the smaller brush (closer to the size of my curling iron) might not be a better choice for me.  I ordered the smaller size and it does exactly what I want.  I get lots of volume, the cowlicks on the crown of my head are controlled, I don&#x27;t have curls or waves, but the little tag ends of hair around my ears and nape of my neck now lay down flat.  Oh, and did I mention that I don&#x27;t like to spend a lot of time fussing with my hair?  This small hot brush is perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both brushes work and are designed exactly the same.  Everything pertains to both hot brush sizes.  There is an on/off button with red or green indicator light, turbo heat on/off button, a turbo heat indicator light, comfortable textured handle, chrome barrel, plastic bristles, and a cool tip.  Begin with clean, dry hair.  Damp hair works too, it just takes longer with more passes of the brush through the hair.  Styling products can be used on the hair.  Hair should only be wrapped around the brush twice so longer hair will require moving the brush along the length of the hair, beginning at the end.  Trust me, you don&#x27;t want those plastic bristles to get tangled in your hair.  There is a temperature guide for the 25 possible heat settings, but you have to be prepared to experiment.  For my short, straight, fine, thick hair I have settled on a heat setting of 17 which Conair&#x27;s chart considers medium-high.  I was surprised that it took that much heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turbo Heat is a feature which provides a constant amount of heat, no fluctuations caused because of power changes you have no control over.  I turn on the brush and turn on the Turbo Heat at the same time and for the setting of #17 that means it takes the brush over 1.5 minutes before the indicator light stops blinking.  That 30 second heat-up they talk about is for the lowest heat setting number with Turbo Heat not turned on.  If you turn the brush on and allow it to come up to heat, then turn on the Turbo Heat it will go through the entire heat-up time all over again.  Turn them both on at the same time if you are going to use Turbo Heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really happy with this product.  I do not shampoo my hair each day and the volume stays in my hair very well.  If I want to refresh the style, I simply heat up the brush and run it through my hair as if I am simply brushing it.  That actually brings the volume back.  I tried today to change the style from the styling of yesterday and it actually did work.  This product has dual voltage ability, but you must buy an adapter that configures to the plug you will be using.  That information is easily available at various online sites.  I don&#x27;t know if I will keep the larger brush or pass it along to one of my daughters or granddaughters.  Just remember to be careful when using the hot brush.  That chrome barrel gets very hot and will burn your fingers if you touch it.  Even the &amp;#34;cool tip&amp;#34; gets warm.Hair should only be wrapped around the brush twice so longer hair will require moving the brush along the length of the hair, beginning at the end.

            <li> Quick to heat up - love the varied heat settings plus the boost heat button. Be careful not to touch the metal is can burn.&lt;br /&gt;The cord rotates along with your twisting motion in curling -great!  Works well for shorter hair cuts.&lt;br /&gt;My old one lasted a long long time until it finally died.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t expect to find another and at a fantastic price. I&amp;#34;m going to buy another to keep for future use and for travel.</li>
            <li> Use it every morning  If I put my hair on curlers ovenight it curls up too tight.  This is perfect to make it lay the way I want to.  Heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> It is  much too big for me,....I need to return it if possible.....thank you</li>
            <li> I like this curlling iron just fine, but it turns off by itself after so many minutes, which could be a plus for some people.  But for me it is bothersome because when I&#x27;m ready to curl my hair it is not ready because it has turned off.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Met my expectations</li>
            <li> A good, cheap curling brush.  No complaints for the price.</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered.  I had one previously and wore it out.  I like it much better than a flat iron</li>
            <li> I had a curling brush by Conair that I have used for years and it finally quit working. I was hoping I would find another one similar, and I found the exact same one!!!! I love this hot brush. I have had medium length hair and now have short hair and I use this brush all the time. I love that it has such a large range of heat levels too. Very happy to have found a replacement for my brush! I highly recommend this to anyone - you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Actually what I wanted</li>
            <li> This Conair hot brush was great on my first use.  The second time I tried to use it though, it would not turn on so I had to send it back to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have relaxed afro kinky hair. This hot brush works better on relaxed hair and does not get to the roots, but it gives my hair a silky soft feeling after I&#x27;m done using it. My relaxed hair gets smooth and shiny, some body but no bounce. The writings rubbed off after the first use and the handle feels like it could break easily. And you need to be careful to avoid tangling the hair in the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, despite the negatives, I still think it&#x27;s a good buy. It does what it says it can do. It heats up quickly, has 25 heat settings and gives soft curls. It is what you could expect for the price. I would buy it again because it comes in handy and I know now what I would be getting.</li>
            <li> Does everything as advertized. Love the turbo feature that speeds up the heating process to less than one minute.</li>
            <li> Great machine.&lt;br /&gt;Also good service.</li>
            <li> It curled my hair very little compared to my regular conair curling iron. It would work on women that prefer just a little curl.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter and she says it works really well.</li>
            <li> I think the hot hair brush does a very good job on short or hair that comes half way down your neck.  I like the different heat settings and the surge button.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is you have to be careful and only touch the end because it will burn your finger if you touch the middle of the brush especially if it is on a higher temperature.  A tip I found is blow dry your hair but not completely and than finish drying it with the brush.  It takes longer but the reult is more fullness and less drying.</li>
            <li> Just the right size and wonderful for travel.</li>
            <li> I love my new curling iron, its lightweight and heats up instantly.  I used it for overseas travel because of the conversion it has.  I will now continue to use it at home.  Great little item for the price.  I have short hair and it does not tangle at all, the teeth in the iron gives you a great style and holds the curl in your hair.  Easy to work with.</li>
            <li> not really good for short hair.  you need hair long enough to roll around it</li>
            <li> This curling iron, with its brush, does what no other can do and that is-the perfect curl. I won&#x27;t use any other brand.</li>
            <li> Loved it with my short hair.</li>
            <li> Curling brushes are getting harder and harder to find.  I try to buy the Conair brand, that is why I bought this one.  So far it&#x27;s o.k., prefer to have one that has a small stand to keep the hot iron off of surfaces when I put it down.  This hairbrush does not come with a stand.  I probably will not buy this one again unless it&#x27;s the only one left to buy!</li>
            <li> I am trying to let my hair grow out from a very short hair style. This hot brush works very well on my fine, but full head of white hair.I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is my second one of these. The first had issues with the ON button not working after a while, but I liked how quickly this heated and it&#x27;s configuration, so I decided to try another.</li>
            <li> My other one was so old so I was surprised to see that they still had this one.  My other one still works, just takes longer to heat because it has so much build up from hair spray on it.  They need to make it so the &#x27;combs&#x27; come out to clean.  It heats quickly and the auto shut off is almost a must for me.  I only use it on the bangs but my hair is so baby fine that the teeth make it work really well without leaving marks like a curling iron does.</li>
            <li> This brush does not get as hot as I would like it to but it straighens my hair enough.  The directions that came with it were not for the bush so I had to figure out how to use it on my own.  I use it almost every day.</li>
            <li> I had one of these combs for several years, and left in a hotel room on a recent trip.  I was glad to see it was available at Amazon because it&#x27;s a reliable product, and one I&#x27;m familiar with using.  Has a wide variety of heat settings, which is good.</li>
            <li> bought for size-really wanted regular 3/4\\&quot; curling iron--really like conair style-it does good for styling-have to hold longer because not solid heating surface</li>
            <li> Easy to use, nice effect, works as expected. It worth use it combined with the bigger size, for differente hair lenght.</li>
            <li> I have been using Hot Brush by Conair for many years. It&#x27;s a great curling iron. I like that it has bristles because it makes it easy to style your hair.</li>
            <li> MY original just broke after at least 10 years, so I was able to find the same model on Amazon for a great price. Mine was heavier and the newer ones are a lighter plastic, but still works great. Heats up  very fast!</li>
            <li> This is a great size for shorter hair.  I had purchased a larger one that didn&#x27;t work well.  I have never used one before and it is easy to get used to.</li>
            <li> This brush is nothing fancy and it doesn&#x27;t need to be. It works very well. My hair is somewhat wiry and 2 inches long with a tendency to not hold a curl. With this hot brush, the curl stays put all day. The controls are easy to decipher. For the people who complained that the lights are hard to see, just shadow the lights with your hand to see if they&#x27;re on or off, easy peasy. NO complaints with this purchase. I love it.</li>
            <li> Great hot brush! My sister bought 1 of these years ago and then it died a few weeks ago. She looked everywhere and couldn&#x27;t find one like it. I looked on Amazon and there it was! Needless to say I bought her 2 of them, 1 to take home and 1 to leave at my home. She was so surprised and both work perfectly. It&#x27;s so nice to be able to find something like this at Amazon. If you use this size brush for curling this is a great little tool. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to find this online as I have looked in about every store that carries hair supplies, stores where I have bought curling brushes for years. My hair is fine and thin and I feel curling brushes are easier on my hair and easier for me to use. I have had several of these Conair brushes and love them. I guess people just are not using the curling brushes anymore so stores are not carrying them.  I hope They don&#x27;t totally stop making them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The service was great. Thanks for your fast, easy service!</li>
            <li> This Conair hot brush has so much quality built in at a sper low price.  Even auto-shut-off!&lt;br /&gt;Great size for short to median hair or just curly styles.  Many heat temp selections so&lt;br /&gt;gentle on hair.  Use on DRY hair !  Heats fast, easy to hold without burning fingers.&lt;br /&gt;Better than curling iron because it grips the hair easily.  Same results, but much faster.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair super shiny as the barrel is ceramic.  Nothing else on the market that has this much&lt;br /&gt;quality at such a low, low price.&lt;br /&gt;VERY, VERY SATISFIED CUSTOMER !!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s remarkable that companies manage to make things a little less good each year in spite of their easy access to consumer comments and concerns.  This hot brush still heats up really fast, but there are problems that I did not have with the same Conair item that I purchased a few years ago:  the cord has become shorter, and the bristles are more brittle and less rubbery so that they don&#x27;t hold the hair quite as well and they are more likely to damage thin hair.  It&#x27;s a good item, but come on Conair, read the reviews and get it right.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly....flashing light could be a bit brighter.  I have curly chin length hair and the 3/4&amp;#34; works well to quickly tame the frizz of my top layer and still retain the curl.</li>
            <li> the wife likes it, thank you. would buy another one if this one should ware out........thanks again. good product, good price</li>
            <li> It is partly my fault for not realizing the difference between a hot brush and a hot air brush. No air coming out of this one. But even on low heat settings this implement can burn your hand. It also snarls my fine hair. Wish I kept the box for sending it back.</li>
            <li> I use it when I need bigger curls.  If you don&#x27;t want to spend the money on the perfecter this might give you a simmilar result.</li>
            <li> After reading &amp;#34;favorable&amp;#34; reviews, I thought this would be perfect...not for me, unfortunately. I followed the instructions for use and I was not happy with the results!</li>
            <li> I really need a 1/2 inch barrel but can&#x27;t seem to come up with one with dual voltage. The paperwork included notes a1/2 inch with a model number CD60 but I can&#x27;t zero in on it. That is what I REALLY need with my short hair. Again I need dual voltage.So I will have to make due with this.</li>
            <li> Best hot stick ever. Good price and got here before expected!</li>
            <li> Very good, all that could be expected</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandma, and it&#x27;s great. She has short hair, so it&#x27;s good because it doesn&#x27;t burn her scalp.</li>
            <li> multiple heat settings, can get close to root area, no rest prongs to get in the way unwinds clean without tangling</li>
            <li> Since what i was looking for was a similar brush with HOT AIR, which is what I had for years until it died, this hot stick was useless to me and I burn my fingers everytime I try to roll up my hair.</li>
            <li> CAN&#x27;T FIND THIS HOT BRUSH ANYWHERE IN STORES, I JUST LOVE IT, IT IS SIMPLE AND JUST PERFECT FOR ME!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this!  I re-buy them every few years as does my Mom and we use them almost every day. The best curling iron in the world and works on both european and US voltage so perfect for traveling!!</li>
            <li> This curling iron is awesome!  I bought it for a trip to Italy because it was described as dual voltage.  It worked perfectly in Europe.  But now I&#x27;m also using it in place of my regular curling iron at home.  It heats up extremely quickly.  And it shuts off if left on for a while.  This is definitely the best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Replaced my travel curling iron.  Works out well.&lt;br /&gt;I was glad to find one with a brush in three quarter inch size.</li>
            <li> This is my third hot brush and I really like it for a soft touch around the edges, I use a bigger curling iron on top where my hair is longer.  I only have one problem with it, it only seems to last 2 years after that it gets harder and harder to turn it on, it is like there is a bad wire connection.  i also enjoy the dual voltage for traveling abroad .</li>
            <li> Awesome curling brush and well built.  I like how it heats up quickly and also has the burst feature. This should last me longer than the Revlon I purchased and have since tossed out!</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and curls hair well . great price and quality.&lt;br /&gt;Hard to find in stores had one before for over 7 years.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered 2 - so be sure to have one on hand. snaller barell 3/4 barell works better to curl hair.</li>
            <li> hair gets tangled in it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of curing irons.  Conair does curling irons right.  Really like the brush feature which makes it easier to roll and manage the hair than a regular curling wand.  Have had other brands curling brush irons, but this one does not tangle my hair.  Gets good and hot but easy to handle.  Like having options for the different heat settings.</li>
            <li> Replaces one that burned out</li>
            <li> great product.  my first one lasted for years.  has all the features I want.</li>
            <li> I have medium volume straight long hair so I though the 3/4 inch will work better.  How wrong I was.  The spikes on this brush are so short that they can barely grasp my hair.  Very hard to use and does not curl hair effectively.  I get better curls with a flat hot iron then this product.  Not recommended.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a good curling iron for my fine short hair but it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the solid one I have. This one also seems to pull my hair out more than the solid ones. It also doesn&#x27;t curl my hair as well as the solid irons do. But it does work and others may find it works for them.</li>
            <li> Great value for money  works well and I will be buying another when I need it&lt;br /&gt;much cheaper than previous curling brushes I have bought</li>
            <li> I have gone through several of these hot brushes.  My only complaint is that the last one died too soon; the on-switch quit turning it on.  But so many others have been fine and lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron! It has a &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; heating mode and it will turn itself off if left on for too long!</li>
            <li> This works great for styling my Mom&#x27;s short thinning hair.  I only takes a few seconds to curl.  It heats quickly.</li>
            <li> I love the hot brush iron because it catches my layered hair just the way I want it too.  Works great!</li>
            <li> Works just as well as expected.  My hair is really thin but but this still works out just fine for my use.</li>
            <li> This hot brush came without a box. It was in a clear plastic bag. I think I got what someone else returned. Not happy, Not thrilled with the length of the plastic bristles. They should be longer. Will keep because it&#x27;s not worth the expense of returning.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace one that did not have a dual voltage and I nearly melted. This is important as we sometimes travel to Europe. This curling brush has a lot of settings and works great.  It seems a bit flimsy to hold but I will see down the road how it holds up.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would eliminate the need to blow-with-a-brush my thick short hair.  But unfortunately it  doesn&#x27;t provide enough control to replace that.  It&#x27;s good for touch ups, but when I used it on my hair that I didn&#x27;t blow dry, it didn&#x27;t give enough control.  My hair stayed frizzy and lost its shape quickly.  I don&#x27;t like using a curling iron, but with the clip it does provide more control and has more effect on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Based on the other reviews it does replace that process for many users, but didn&#x27;t for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Adjustable heat settings&lt;br /&gt;Good for touch ups&lt;br /&gt;Probably not damaging to hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t provide enough control for thick, coarse hair&lt;br /&gt;Does not seal the cuticle, hence doesn&#x27;t stop the frizzies</li>
            <li> this is my favorite hair styling tool!!</li>
            <li> With regular curling irons, I was always burning myself,  The hot brush has eliminated that entirely while still &amp;#34;catching&amp;#34; my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this hot brush specifically to take to Europe and use on their 220 currency.  It worked beautifully.  It did require a converter unless we were lucky enough to be in a place that also had 110 currency...like our cruise boat on the Rhine.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush in two sizes. I find that it is easy to use and curls my hair much easier than using a blow dryer and brush. My hair is finally textured and this brush does the job for me.</li>
            <li> I saw a commercial for a similar product priced around $200, so I went on Amazon and found this &amp;#34;curling iron&amp;#34; for less than a 1/10, and from a reputable brand!  My hair is fine and shoulder-length, and this thing works pretty well.  These types of curling irons definitely won&#x27;t be replacing my conventional curling iron, but it does a decent job of straightening or adding a bit of a twist to the ends.&lt;br /&gt;This thing takes some practice, though.  You should NOT try and use it like a conventional curling iron because your hair WILL get tangled.  I am still unable to get a full curl in my hair using this brush, but it makes some cute, old-fashioned ringlets on the bottom ~3 inches of my hair.  Straightening is a bit easier than curling.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the design is the combing nubs - my hair sticks to them and tangles almost instantly.  The silicone/plasticky nubs are a hair trap.</li>
            <li> Got this hot brush to take to Europe, but I can also use it right here at home.  Talk about convenient!</li>
            <li> This is the third one I bought, I have one in each of two homes and one in my travel bag.  Love it.  Gets as warm or hot as wanted and in 90 seconds.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be thinner, even though it gave the circumference in the ad.</li>
            <li> Great as straightener when you need to get close to the root without burning ur scalp with a hot comb. But tangled in my long hair. So wont be using for curling. Will stick to regular curling iron, would return but was so cheap not worth paying shipping to return.</li>
            <li> I love love love this hot brush, it&#x27;s extremely easy to use, gets hot very quickly and gives my hair so much volume</li>
            <li> Takes too long to figure out how work it.</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed; heats up fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> My  hair is currently ultra short, like Jamie Lee Curtis&#x27;. This 3/4&amp;#34; will not wrap my hair, even though a 1 1/2&amp;#34; open round brush will. I see now this is because a brush has a different kind of open bristles with distinct balls at tips. This nonetheless works well just brushing through the hair to smooth it. Not as straightening as a flat iron, but does a pretty nice job without the damaging effect of a flat iron. First I spritzed with water and towel dried, to avoid scorching; if hair is slightly damp it works better, I think; if too wet, it&#x27;ll scorch and burn hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had it at #15 heat, and that was way too hot! I lightly cupped hand around bristles, and I&#x27;m still holding an ice cube!! I will try it on #8 or #9 and test with a tip of paper. It&#x27;s not supposed to burn a countertop, but I&#x27;m not so sure..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord swivels easily, and that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> It works well with my straight medium short hair.  It stays in place and puts in just the right amount of churls.  Automatically turns off if I forget.  Lots of variation on heat intensity.</li>
            <li> I used to have a similar curling brush and I loved it, but this one is not quite as nice. One major flaw that I think will have me sending it back is that the tip is not removable. When you use styling products in your hair (even those intended to be used with heat styling tools), a sticky residue will begin to build up on the iron. On my old model with the removable tip, the bristles could be slid out of the tracks that hold them and easily cleaned. On this model, it&#x27;s not possible to remove them and I think the iron will be a sticky unusable mess before too long.</li>
            <li> This curling brush is great. I had just returned a curling brush that was 3x as much as this one.  It had bristles that fell off and burned my hand. This brush has none of those issues.  It is great. It heats up super fast and you can adjust the temperature setting. I only wish it wasnt just available as an &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34;. Im an amazon junkie though, so I didnt have much trouble ordering it. :-)</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with certain parts of my hair that like to curl in weird directions.  It also is wonderful to use to give some more volume under your bangs.  I think it would even be better to buy a bigger brush head for the bangs if that was an option.  It heats up quickly and I use it every day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this curling brush.  I had one like it for years and it finally gave out.  The only thing I&#x27;d recommend is directions on how to clean it.</li>
            <li> I use this almost every day.&lt;br /&gt;It does the job.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this hot brush.  I have shorter, fine hair and the 3/4&amp;#34; size works great.  Great purchase.</li>
            <li> I had one of these and it broke. I love it! The brush portion assists with short hair and adds body.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Conair and Amazon!</li>
            <li> Hard to find item. Does a great job curling my hair. I can control the temp. Get&#x27;s the job done.</li>
            <li> I was unable to find this product on stores locally, so I turned to Amazon.  Glad to have found this available.  Easy for me to use with my arthritic hands.</li>
            <li> First off I want to say that I have very thin, very fine, wavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second I want to say that I am a complete moron when it comes to styling my own hair. It&#x27;s nearly impossible for me to get the curls that I want. I&#x27;ve tried everything including hot rollers, curlformers, wands, irons, flexi rods, hot flexi rods, spoolies, perms, and every crunching gel, mousse, cream, or spray known to man. And none of those have given me the look I want. I should explain that a great deal of my styling failure is due to user error. I am a 30 year old woman and I am ashamed to admit... I have no idea what I&#x27;m doing with any of those things. (even after watching countless tutorials)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But FINALLY i have something that gives me the look I want. ... nice bouncy curls that last!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no clue why this product isn&#x27;t all over youtube or the rest of the internet. Like no one is talking about it... which baffles me. It&#x27;s soooo cheap. You can find it at practically any store, and it works miracles!! I admit it does take some practice to master but I&#x27;m telling you if I can do it, literally anyone else can. I know most people probably use this brush for getting that blow out look or just creating volume or waves, but I use it for getting CURLS. Since the picture on the package itself showed tight curls and it says right on there that you can achieve tight curls, that is what I aimed to do. And I did! It can be easy to get your hair tangled, but just don&#x27;t wrap the hair around tightly, and don&#x27;t wrap any hair over itself, and you&#x27;ll be fine. If you follow the directions it comes with, it&#x27;s actually pretty easy not to tangle. And on the rare times that I do, I just kind of shake the brush a little and gently tug it away from my hair and then it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I like about this is the ability for do-overs. I have a Conair curling iron that only gives you one shot. If you mess up your curl one time, it is impossible to fix it. But that isn&#x27;t the case with this brush. I honestly have no clue why this curls so much better for me than any other wand or iron. I mean it&#x27;s basically just a clipless iron with bristles but it just works so well. It also gives me volume that nothing else has ever given my flat lifeless hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the look lasts all day! No hair spray needed! I am so happy I found this. It&#x27;s my holy grail!</li>
            <li> This hot brush works very well for my short hair and heats very quickly.  I really like the automatic shut off also.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about it. It&#x27;s more awkward to use than my old one and I keep burning my fingers.</li>
            <li> I hate curling my hair and using curling rods.  The curling brushes I have had do not do much curling so was not even sure I should trust what others said and buy this,  but it was so cheap I did. This curling brush is fantastic.  My hair is so straight trying to get it to wrap around a curling brush was next to impossible, but when I used this one it wrapped around with no problems and the curls stayed for three days.  Of course they got looser as the days passed, but the curl still looked nice.  I am getting ready to use it now for a second time so if I have any complaints I will add on later.  So far So good.</li>
            <li> Conair makes the best brush on the market.  It works for me because I have arthritis in my hands and it doesn&#x27;t take as much dexterity to use as a curling iron.  I can get my hair done much faster and it lasts all day.  Wish they made one with 1/2-inch barrel for when my hair is shorter, but will continue to buy this product if they keep making it.</li>
            <li> THIS ITEM DOESN&#x27;T DO ANYTHING FOR MY HAIR.  I WISH I HAD NEVER BOUGHT IT.  I WILL CONTINUE MY SEARCH FOR A BETTER ONE.</li>
            <li> I got this item for one of my daughters for christmas. She is mixed, and has thick, curly hair. I read many great reviews for this item, and decied it sounded like what we needed. I was WRONG!! The brush did absolutely nothing for her hair after I spent forever trying to make it work for her hair. This might be ok for people with fine, thin hair, but NOT for girls with thicker hair. I was very disappointed with this product!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite curling iron ever!!  My fine hair has little body and this curler gives me lift and curl.  It&#x27;s not easy to clean between it&#x27;s bristles, but inexpensive enough to buy several at a time and ditch one when the mood hits for a new one.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 3/4-inch hot brush for myself and after experimenting a few times, liked it so much I ordered the 1-1/4-inch as a gift for a friend and she is very happy with it.  It heats super fast, has many settings for heat needed depending upon hair type, and after a few minutes of experimenting I was glad I bought the hot brush style instead of a regular curling iron.  The delivery was fast, the items were packaged well, and the hot brush works according to description.</li>
            <li> the power key did not work properly however, the seller was willing to replace I don&#x27;t want to replace but i I don&#x27;t want to take another chance.</li>
            <li> my 3rd of this kind, definitely my favorite  for bangs and short hair, does not work with too long hair, tangles too easily</li>
            <li> Perfect for someone who wants some curl. It seems well made and is easy to handle.  So far, so good.</li>
            <li> Does a good job and I really like the 30-second heat time.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped but will use it occasionally. My hair is still somewhat fried from a perm I had about a year ago and was hoping this would smooth it better than it does.</li>
            <li> It took a few tries to find the heat setting that works best but has worked very well.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m one of the few people who uses a curling brush instead of a curling iron, and it is very hard to find a good one at a reasonable price.  This one works better than any I&#x27;ve ever had, including one 4 times more expensive from a beauty supply store. This one heats up VERY fast and makes great curls.  I just wish I&#x27;d learned how to shop online much earlier instead of running around all over trying to find what I needed!</li>
            <li> Just returned from S. Africa and this worked perfect but you do need a converter which I got from Coach but I am sure Amazon has one in another brand. I love all the heat settings because the heat in other countries is hotter so I used it on #9.</li>
            <li> I got the 1 1/4 inch one and it was great. This one just doesn&#x27;t seem to heat up nearly as hot as the larger one.  That&#x27;s disappointing, but it does &amp;#34;some good&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Like the previous reviewer says, this is NOT Hot Air Hair Brush.  I was actually looking for hot air one with dual voltage (to use for my vacation) and mistakenly bought this product.  I decided to give it try as I never used iron brush before and this has great reviews.  Now I am very happy about my mistake because I love this product.  I have used hot air brush for years because I cannot hold a brush and hairdryer at the same time.  Still I have had a hard time styling my hair with hot air brush.  However, I have no problem styling my hair using this iron brush. It is very easy to use.  I just put a little water on my hair then do styling which usually takes only a few minutes with this iron (whereas it takes forever using air brush)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium length hair so got 0.75 inch one.  It was the right size for my length and also very light to carry during my trip.  I used this in Japan and no issue using over there.</li>
            <li> Way to small for anyone - very disappointed</li>
            <li> product is great. Shipping was speedy. Will use again!</li>
            <li> When I did a search, I thought it would bring up only hot air curling brushes, but instead this one came up and it is not a hot-air curling brush.  It is a hot brush similar to a curling iron.  It does heat up quickly and curls the ends nicely.  The problem with this product is that you have to be careful to not grab any metal near the end of the brush when you&#x27;re trying to wrap the brush around the bristles.  It does get hot!!  Also, even though my hair is fine and not all that long, I find that it does tangle the hair and it gets caught in the bristles.  Instructions state you shouldn&#x27;t wrap hair around it any more than twice, but it still gets caught.  For that reason, I can only curl the ends.  I&#x27;d recommend this product only for use on very short hair.</li>
            <li> Have been using the product for 2 weeks and it does the job well.  The only negative is the you have to be careful not to get burned at the tip when inserting hair.  Otherwise, I am extremely happy with this product</li>
            <li> I order this by reading comments but this product does not curl your hair or straighten it. does not work on long hair.</li>
            <li> I certainly was in great need of a new curling iron and this one works great. It is&lt;br /&gt;much better than the one I replaced.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. It works fine. It is hard to find a good &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; curling iron that gets hot. This does the trick.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for over 8 years . The last time I went to WalMart to get&lt;br /&gt;another one I found they did not sell them anymore. I came home looked on my computer&lt;br /&gt;and there they were. I ordered 2 in case I would have a hard time locating them again.&lt;br /&gt;I would never use any other brush. They are wonderful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Too easy to touch hot spot in process of styling.  Finished look is not even.</li>
            <li> This is what my mom wanted for Christmas.  I do not know how well it works, but I&#x27;m hoping it works well!</li>
            <li> I only wish they still made these curling irons, They are the best, and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li> I bought this because i just got my shoulder length hair permed and this helps take out some of the perm curl and give me a natural curl.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a curling iron for a while. Tried a few different brands paid up to $30 and nothing works well.&lt;br /&gt;This one cost me less than$11 and it does what is supposed to. Overall I~m really happy!!!!</li>
            <li> The brush works well.  I did find that, even though I have thin hair, I had to put the setting to the highest and push the \\&quot;boost\\&quot; button.  I thought it would curl faster, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> I first purchased one of these in America whilst on holiday after the one I took with me stopped working I found it excellent and attempted to purchase another one in the UK as a back up after about 5 years without success. I found I was able to order on Amazon so ordered two. They are excellent, great value and control my hair a treat. Highly recommended also the delivery service although expensive was first class arriving after 6 days.</li>
            <li> I had this one before and I like the curl it gives and the settings for different temps.that it has.</li>
            <li> After having read all the reviews on this product, I purchased one. I enjoyed using it (for about 2 weeks), and it worked well until it was accidentially knocked off and fell on the floor.  It broke into several pieces.  Needless to say, I did not get much use from this product.</li>
            <li> I have used many different curling brushes over the years and this one is the best, so far. It heats up very fast, gets as hot as you want and gives me just the amount of curl that I want. There are settings to select the degree of heat that you want to curl your hair with. Hopefully it will last for many years. I am so happy that I ordered it.</li>
            <li> This is a favorite, I use it often. It is quick and I don&#x27;t get burned (unlike what happens with a traditional curling iron)</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> This is my second one.  Old one just wore out.  the teeth became very brittle and kept falling off.  But hey it was at least 10 years old!</li>
            <li> I do not start my day with out this hair care product. Great for around the hair line and not hard on the hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace the one I had that died of old age.  I hope this one last as long.  The old one was over 15 years.  So far, it works great.</li>
            <li> These are about the 4th and 5th ones I&#x27;ve had.  Daily use does wear them out after a few years so I bought two.  I was afraid with the predominance of mop hairdos these days short hair equipment would be discontinued or at least harder to find so I bought two.It is my opinion that women over 40 do not look as lovely in long hairdos but in spite of what I think there are a lot who do wear it long.</li>
            <li> The product works very well.  Curls hold great.  I wish it came in 1and1/2 inch barrel.</li>
            <li> I use this for styling my medium length hair. I can make waves or curls depending on how much hair I place around the barrel. It also makes my hair shiny.</li>
            <li> Works really well on my hard to curl hair.  Couldn&#x27;t find anything like it at the stores.  Highly recommend.  Also bought the larger style.  Heats really quick.</li>
            <li> Good, consistent heat and a variety of settings.</li>
            <li> Good price.  Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I am always in a hurry in the mornings getting ready for work and this curling tool is very fast and effective</li>
            <li> This is the only brush that truly works on my hair.  I have fine hair and don&#x27;t do well with a curling iron.  This give my hair so much body and it&#x27;s so easy to use.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It works very well. You can heat it up quick or regular time. Has a lot of different heat settings.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Mom, she loves it. It is easy for her to use; she has limited mobility, and this works well.</li>
            <li> The Hot Stick by Coniar is well made, has great features and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> just the size i wanted</li>
            <li> It is an excellent product. It really does suit my needs and I don&#x27;t know how I lived with out it for so long.</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time finding one of these that does the trick...this one does!  I have fine permed hair, so I have to be cautious  multiple issues.  It does NOT tangle and snarl up in the hair easily...excellent!  It does not heat up so high that it fries my hair...wonderful!  It can be used as easily to tame the hair as to curl it...great!  The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is that I am not delighted with the location of the heat controller (YES, it can even be adjusted to the heat needed for your particular hair!), although it is stiff enough that it doesn&#x27;t get easily knocked off your setting...which is definitely a plus!  Highly recommend if you are in the market for a hot brush!  I&#x27;ll be buying the 1&amp;#34; next.</li>
            <li> These curling irons last forever, and even when they do go out, they don&#x27;t to out all the way.  Mine currently only turns on by using the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; button now but still acts as though it was on the regular setting.  I&#x27;ve had this for about 4 years before this happened and am still happily using it the way it is.  Great for the price.</li>
            <li> Works Great. Thanks for the super fast delivery</li>
            <li> Works well and curls hold all day long.  I believe it takes just as long to curl my hair as with a regular curling iron but the curls hold all day with this appliance and that makes all the difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having multiple heat choices is a really good feature.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not adept at using this tool, but it has done nothing for me. It is extremely inconvenient to use on my wavy hair, and I feel that if I keep using it, it will make my hair quality worse.</li>
            <li> This is a great hot iron.  Heats up quickly.  Feels sturdy.  The price was just right.  I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> This is such a great tool for my fine and flat hair.  I use it on medium heat to style and curl my slightly damp hair.  It drys the hair in the shape I actually want it to go adding body and curl. The brush picks up the hair very easily and it stays wound around the barrel. Blow drying was damaging my hair and was always a hit or miss styling process.  Love this item.  Great value.</li>
            <li> Super-quick heatup, love the swivel cord, brushes hold hair in place while curling (I have short hair).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many curling brushes Over the years. This is right up there with the best of them. Heats very quickly and the cord doesn&#x27;t tangle. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Immediate results.. Fantastic product..</li>
            <li> Works well, but BELIEVE the reviews about how easy it is to burn yourself. Don&#x27;t even think of touching it.</li>
            <li> Throw away your curling iron and the burns that accompany it! The heat stick curls hair, never burning it or you. Even those of us who are all thumbs when it comes to this sort of thing can achieve dramatic results. Buy this!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the Helen of Troy 1517 brush iron--1 inch barrel is too big.  I like the conair 3/4 inch brush.  It&#x27;s just the right size and doesn&#x27;t overcurl my hair.</li>
            <li> Love it!  It&#x27;s fast(no waiting for it to heat up) and so easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used a hot brush, I already own a rod. I would suggest for first time users to wait for it to fully heat up and it usually takes some getting used to. It took me over half an hour to use it the first time and my hair would get tangled, but I got the hang of it in a while. the time and the effort paid off and it gave me gorgeous natural-looking curls that even stayed there overnight.....this is coming from someone with long straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;However, I brought it for the dual voltage, which I have yet to test out.&lt;br /&gt;Overall incredible value for the money.</li>
            <li> First of all, Amazon got this to me within two day&#x27;s time via Amazon Prime.  The minute I turned on this hot brush, it immediately started to heat up.  Just be careful even the first minute or two because the metal between the plastic &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; also gets hot.  I have very short, stubborn hair which has been a little challenging to style.  This product gives me great body and lift so that I can fluff up and spike my hair.  Probably should have purchased another one to save for the future.  I love it.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect product for anyone with fine, thin hair!  I still have to keep my hair short and highlighted - my hair is extremely fine - but this is the only product that gives me the lift that I need.  I have had Chemo, which made the my hair problems worse and also suffer with an autoimmune disease that causes my hair to thin and causes bald areas.  This brush allows me the ability to cover the areas that are the worst and give my hair a much fuller look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this contains a great deal of personal information, I am sharing it because there are others that may be facing similar problems.</li>
            <li> A curling brush isn&#x27;t a huge item in anybody&#x27;s life; that said, no one wants one that&#x27;s more of a nuisance than a help.  I&#x27;ve been using curling brushes every day for a very long time, &amp; I&#x27;ve finally found one that has everything I&#x27;ve been looking for.  Previously, I&#x27;ve burned my scalp or my fingers with a brush that had only one temperature -- SUPER HOT; or found that the brushes whose temperatures could be regulated either didn&#x27;t ever get quite hot enough, or had no indicator to let me know when the desired heat setting had been reached, or were uncomfortable to hold and/or use. This Conair model has a 25-number dial that lets you regulate the precise heat setting for your hair type (and instructions that tell you which hair types/lengths respond best to which settings); a heat indicator that flashes on/off until the brush is ready to use (and it heats up very quickly, another plus); and is very comfortable to hold and use (no fancy contour shapes that look stylish but don&#x27;t really fit a hand, or if they do fit when you pick them up, become unwieldy as they&#x27;re turned in use -- just a nice, narrow shaft that works in any position).  And oh yes, this brush also cools down rather quickly, another plus when you&#x27;re waiting to pack it.  I&#x27;ve been so pleased that I ordered a 2d to keep in my always-packed travel carry-on.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to blow dry my hair, nor do I like to walk around with wet hair courting colds. This hot brush is a good alternative. The wide range of temperature is a really good feature. Its good for the price and does all that is advertised, but you have to be careful with the tip - you can still get burnt regardless of the \\&quot;cool tip\\&quot; feature.</li>
            <li> I have long, layered, hair. This item does the job, but on some occasions, my hair would get tangled when I try to release/unroll it. And when you use it, its hard to grab the tip of the hair while curling/rolling it coz their is no grip or clip to grab the hair, so you have to use your other hand and manually hold the tip of the hair while rolling it. Time consuming!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful NOT to burn your hair when use this product! Better yet, find a better product!!!</li>
            <li> This has a very quick heating and I love that there are multiple temperature settings. I have very fine, straight hair and don&#x27;t need a lot of heat so it works well for me to give a quick styling. Great for shorter hair because the tines are short. Love it.</li>
            <li> This hot brush iron is so sweet. It heats up so fast. Once you turn it on hit the turbo button and it is like instant heat. You also have I think it was about 20 different heat settings too, so it&#x27;s even good for wigs.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  Gives hair lots of body.  Does get hot.  You have to be careful.  But this was a great add on item and very well worth what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I had one of these for sometime and when I needed a new one I could not find one in any store. I was so happy to find it on amazon.</li>
            <li> Excellent  curling iron.</li>
            <li> Exceeds expectations.</li>
            <li> Received this in 2/13 and it is now 9/13 and the curling brush has gone up and no longer works.  It is sad that I can&#x27;t contact anyone because of the time limit.  I think the curling brush should have lasted longer than that.</li>
            <li> Great item!! Heats up fast!  Best part about this item is that I don&#x27;t have to keep changing curling irons, depending on which country I am visiting.  It stays in my suitcase all the time because it is dual current and works in the US and other foreign countries.  How does it know?</li>
            <li> Have larger hot brush but needed smaller one too. Works fine. Heats very quickly. It&#x27;s just what I wanted, and was a good value too.</li>
            <li> It broke after 4 months of use.  No sense in returning it since it would cost just as much as the new product to ship it back and get a replacement.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Love the shut-off feature.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product.  It was not what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I bought this item in October 2008 and it is now January 2009 and it already doesn&#x27;t work.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am replacing a similar Conair hair curling device. I like the product and this year&#x27;s model seems to heat even faster than previous models, a plus for me.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron.  The ability to adjust the heat level is wonderful, as it can be adjusted to how my hair is behaving and feeling.  That way I do not fry my hair and my head trying to get a good curl.  I am able to hold my hair against the brush part as the dryer blows on it.  That is a plus for short hair.  My hairdresser got carried away and trimmed my short hair shorter, so I needed a brush curling iron where I could hold my hair against the brush without burning myself.  wonderful product.  I have one in the house and one in the camper.</li>
            <li> Easier to use than curling iron with my weakened shoulder.  Cord swivels so it doesn&#x27;t get tangled when rolling hair on brush.  Smooths out while adding some curl to hair that was a little over-processed by a perm.</li>
            <li> For years I have struggled with my fine and naturally curly hair.  I never tried a curling iron like this because iit doesn&#x27;t clamp onto your hair.  I just didn&#x27;t think it would be possible to produce good results with the design of this curling iron because I thought the heat wouldn&#x27;t transfer to my hair without a heated clamp to help.  But it works!  Somehow this curling iron smoothed my hair out and also flipped the ends under leaving a hair style I was happy with.  I&#x27;m extremely happy with this purchase.  I also tried the larger barrel but didn&#x27;t get results this good.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find one in any of the stores around here!  I have had one just like it for more than 10 years and it is wearing out!  Like many of us seniors, it was loosing it&#x27;s teeth from so much heating up and cooling down.  It is perfect.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Wife loved it and thats all that&#x27;s important.</li>
            <li> So i have very tight curly hair naturally, and i don&#x27;t like using flat irons as they clamp the hair together and that burns off the hair.  I use this to get my hair to loosen the curl and still have a smooth look, and this does the job wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Brush curling wands are very hard to find. This one is excellent, reasonably priced, and I love the quick heat feature for fast touchups</li>
            <li> My Mom needed my help in replacing her hot brush and I&#x27;m the closest computer genius (so sad).  Easy to order and when arrived...my Mom was happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...and isn&#x27;t that what it&#x27;s all about.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly.  I like the feature that I can dial the heat setting I like best and works dual voltage.</li>
            <li> This is a great little curling iron.  It has several settings for heat density which ensures you won&#x27;t burn hair, hands or ears!  I am thrilled with this curling iron as I have a torn rotator and can&#x27;t use both hands to fix hair in the back of my head.  This curling iron really helps me do that.</li>
            <li> Have not been able to find this product in the stores. Always was able to find it but for some reason, cannot any more. Although the last a long time, I purchased two just to have them on hand. Hopefully the company will continue to make them and they will be sold by Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> heats up quick, swivel cord, numerous settings, packaging good,  as described,  would reccomend,  excellant iron for the price, what more can i say</li>
            <li> Great heat, great maneuverability - very pleased with this item!</li>
            <li> It is very hard to catch your hair to roll it and curl or style with it....very disappointed.  Try another.</li>
            <li> This purchase was a replacement for one I had for a long time. Only thing I didn&#x27;t like about the new one was,it didn&#x27;t have a built-in stand to keep it from laying directly on the counter. Other than that, it was exactly the same and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Exactly what the wife wanted, she&#x27;s happy, nuff said.</li>
            <li> The automatic shutoff is a must</li>
            <li> Used this in several countries in Europe and it worked perfectly. Heats up very quickly and is ready to go in a minute.</li>
            <li> The best brush it heats instantly it&#x27;s hot enough and you don&#x27;t need to leave on long.</li>
            <li> Works fine for everything I bought it for...just brushing through the hair or specifically curling the ends up or under.</li>
            <li> Exactly as ordered; solid product</li>
            <li> I wanted to replace my very old hot brush before it died.  I&#x27;ve tried a number of brands, and I just can&#x27;t find a hot brush that is hot enough to curl my hair.  This one was no exception - not hot enough.  I&#x27;ll keep using the old one.</li>
            <li> Use this hot brush all the time. Easy to use works well!</li>
            <li> I recommend this instant heat curling brush. It is ready for use within seconds of turning the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; switch and you choose the heat temperature for your own hair type (easy or difficult to take curl). I also appreciate the auto off if left on by accident. The one thing I would like is a little longer cord to work with.</li>
            <li> Heats quickly and works great.  I have very fine hair and am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Was very glad to see these. Cannot find them in stores anymore!</li>
            <li> Product heats up quickly and puts in a good curl.  My hair did not,get caught in the teeth.</li>
            <li> I gave it one star for delivery. The product does not work well.</li>
            <li> I really am impressed with this. I have short hair and it works great. Great service from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It heats up quickly, gives you soft curls and waves with no dents like a regular curling iron sometimes does. The Conair  Heat  Hot  Brush lasts a long time. You get a lot of bang for your buck. I wouldn&#x27;t ever want to be without it! It&#x27;s that good!</li>
            <li> Does work tangels shair</li>
            <li> Works as promised.  25 settings.  Doesn&#x27;t come in a box so don&#x27;t be surprised.  Good value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this hot brush since 2008 and I&#x27;m just now getting around to reviewing it. I have an inverted bob, a little past chin length on the sides, fine hair but lots of it. It&#x27;s also color-treated. When I want more volume than a flat iron can give me, I use this hot brush. I like it better than a curling iron because with a curling iron, my thin hair tends to come out of the clamp. Not with this brush! The bristles help to hold my hair onto the hot part of the wand. The 3/4&amp;#34; is the perfect size to add volume and bounce.</li>
            <li> Need to be careful or it will burn your fingers.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what it looked like and will need to return. The &amp;#34;tines&amp;#34; or whatever they are called are too short. I have one with tines that are twice that length for my very thick hair.  Cannot find them anywhere!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without this!! Usually whenever I do my hair I have to flat iron it and it takes hours cause I have very thick coarse hair, plus getting those hard to reach places are pain in the butt. But with my hot brush I get thru my hair with ease!!! It only takes less than 15 mins to get my hair done now cause it brushes and heats all together and it makes my hair incredibly soft. I love love love this heat brush best purchase I ever made</li>
            <li> I have used these for years to get a little body and curl in my straight hair. It is less harful to my hair than using the curler sets as you do not leave it in the hair very long. Compact and easy to travel.</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking it was a &amp;#34;3/4&amp;#34; inch as advertised, but it&#x27;s actually closer to 1/2&amp;#34;. Also the cord is VERY short. I couldn&#x27;t use the brush unless I put the power strip on top of my dresser, it&#x27;s that short!!&lt;br /&gt;If you use it in a bathroom w/the plug right next to you, it should be OK, but be aware, it&#x27;s NOT 3/4&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have pretty straight hair and every now and then like a different look. I have tried regular curling irons (1 inch and 1.5 inch); the curls are good but they don&#x27;t last long and I on&#x27;t get soft curls with those. This is a great product for soft curls or smoothing out hair in the morning. Best part is, the curls last much longer compared to the regular curling irons. Only thing I would have loved to see in this product is a better brush, this brush is not bad at all, but my hair slip out of it while curling as the teeth are smaller than expected. With loner teeth I guess this would be an ideal product for me :)</li>
            <li> Love it. Easy to use and works great. And it was a bargain</li>
            <li> This is the third hot brush I&#x27;ve used and used up over the years and still love the design - I know it will not last forever, everything breaks or gets broken in it&#x27;s limited lifetime but I hope they never stop making this model. It fits my needs to a &amp;#34;T&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I works great and I use it every day. Thank you for the quick delivery. I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I wanted a dryer - not a curling iron - and think the name is misleading!! Am returning.</li>
            <li> Good brush, just wished it would last longer - and I&#x27;d give it a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> I loved the idea of this curling brush, and the size. However, it just didn&#x27;t get got enough to curl or allow a curl to stay for my 4A/B hair. I am 100% natural with very fine, dense, shoulder length hair, and wear my hair straight styled most of the time. Usually I use my SuperStar flat iron to curl by flipping the ends, it never causes damage or fries my hair and the the curls and style will last all day with those. I got this because I thought it would be a nice option and I could have curls more round and softer. Granted, I&#x27;m comparing a $100 flat iron to a $10 curling iron,, but I have used drugstore curling irons (e.g. Revlon) successfully too, and unfortunately, this product just didn&#x27;t get hot enough to hold a style. On the highest heat setting, it felt like the temperature only got to about 285. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if your hair prefers a professional level of heat (325-450) to hold a curl all day in very curly hair. I ended up donating mine to Goodwill after a week of failed attempts at styles. It would be nice if you could see the actual temperature the iron is heating up to instead of just number settings, but I guess for $10 I cant complain too much and am glad it works for others. :)</li>
            <li> Great for my short hair-this is my backup since it took so long to find one that works well and saw others did the same thing. Hopefully it will be many years before I need another one.</li>
            <li> Almost instantly hot the barrel is the perfect size for my short hair I love it I just have to remember to hit the on bottom, my old iron got hot when plugged in.</li>
            <li> My old one died and this is just like my old one.  Love it.</li>
            <li> It does the job at a good price,simple and heats up.What more is their</li>
            <li> We purchased the hot stick for our up coming trip to Europe. It was necessary to have a unit that would work in all of Europe, which I can attest to that it functioned perfectly.</li>
            <li> Good iron.It gets hot!</li>
            <li> Sadly the Conair curling I had, for many years was no longer working, so I ordered another type,&lt;br /&gt;that was, just worthless, cheap and didn&#x27;t work worth a darn. I then ordered thsi Conair product.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like it as much as my old one ( handled better and my hair wouldn&#x27;t slip out of it), but this&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;curling iron&amp;#34; works well and I wish I had stuck with Conair to begin with!</li>
            <li> The best product EVER! on time shipping</li>
            <li> Conair is a great company, and this curling iron works great, as do all of their other products.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and was as described.  I  have used this model for years and this is my 3rd.  Last time, I went to Ulta and pad about $40 for one, only to realize it was NOT dual voltage and barely got hot.  I quickly returned it and ordered this one.  I didn&#x27;t make that mistake this time.</li>
            <li> Great item! Delivered very fast! Fantastic! I didn&#x27;t think I would like this, but I wanted to try this anyways and it works great so far!</li>
            <li> I loved it so much I bought two. my hair does not slipp out of this plastic brush and does not get tangled like a bristle one.</li>
            <li> I have used the Instant Heat Hot Brush before.  Never found one I liked better so I keep going back to this brand.</li>
            <li> I like these so much that I have them in two sizes.</li>
            <li> Super hair curler.  It twists with the cord so you don&#x27;t get all tangled up and works great.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have found this curing brush.  It heats up very quickly and you can control the heat with the gauge on the handle.  I had this same brush for quite awhile and accidently dropped it and broke the tip.  I could not find anything I liked as well in the stores locally and I was thrilled when I located it on Amazon.  Definitely would recommend this hot brush.</li>
            <li> I have only used it twice in the past year. When I used it it did nothing for my hair and also there was black stuff coming out in my hair.  I think it was melted plastic...</li>
