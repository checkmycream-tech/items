            <li>I use it as a jewelry case and love it.</li>

            <li>and I LOVE this one.</li>
            <li>I would buy it in a heartbeat :)</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!!!!!</li>
            <li>The case is cute and light.</li>
            <li>it was very useful and had many compartments</li>
            <li>There is plenty of room for all of her makeup in one easy place.  </li>
            <li>Plenty of room and easy to carry</li>
            <li>Very handy, yet compact enough to sit on a grooming table.  </li>
            <li>Love this LARGE makeup case!  </li>
            <li>I was super excited about the price.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s plenty of storage, and I love the fact that the print is made to look like real fur, not just tan with spots.</li>
            <li>the case is ok but doesn&#x27;t have as much space as I thought it did.</li>
            <li>Tons of compartments due to a great design.</li>
            <li>Before my purchase, I had reviewed many Train Case&#x27;s of similar design, but just wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the description.</li>
            <li>Product shipped quickly and it arrived in plenty of time for Christmas.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and easy</li>
            <li>It is sturdy enough to have survived 2 little brothers&#x27; abuse and still going strong,  Would make an excellent gift for girls of all ages.</li>
            <li>Nice size, not too big, yet</li>
            <li>Nice I just wish it was bigger</li>
            <li>It did seem to take a lot longer for the shipping but it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>so if you are using it for simple things then it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I bought this and a red one for my neices who love makeup.</li>
            <li>It would be ok if it was only the price of the case</li>
            <li>Love the way it can sit on a dresser and open up.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>This will work great if u have a few make up or jewelry assessments but not recommended for a make up artist or professional.</li>
            <li>nicely made case, mirror is a little too small.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The case is flimsy, the clasp are really plastic made to look metal and when you open it the drawer do not even fit in the trays</li>
            <li>I received my train case well ahead of schedule, through UPS, which also surprised me, and made the shipping price well worth it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>and i really like it.</li>
            <li>VERY ROOMY.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It holds everything and is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Better than I expected and what the pictures look like.</li>
            <li>and they really like it.</li>
            <li>Very spacious.</li>
            <li>only one true downside to this is that the top drawer can get a little stuck at times.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very cheap and doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li>;  Why would I order another one if the first one only lasted 15 months.  </li>
            <li>the drawers are big enough for a full size brush.  </li>
            <li>The drawers can come out if you pull to far, but I don&#x27;t really think it is that big of deal.</li>
            <li>Bought this item for a 13 year old girl who loves it and carries it whenever she visits.  </li>
            <li>I chose this rating because it do not have a long enough space for my neckalace to hang all the way down, other than that great jewlry box.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as big as her other one and won&#x27;t fit eyeshadow sets like we have with 12+ colors and a mirror.</li>
            <li>Not big enough for a fellow makeup lovers collection, but large enoough to transport a chunk of the collection with you.</li>
            <li>Much nicer than ones I&#x27;ve seen in local stores for a similar price.</li>
            <li>I even read the reviews and thought the negative one&#x27;s were from negativ  people, but they were from people who like quality, not crap.</li>
            <li>Other than the fact that I wanted something a little bit bigger I love it.  </li>
            <li>The drawers are too small to actually hold any larger items, it would be better if there was one less drawer and the remaining ones were larger.</li>

            <li> It does the job but the brush holders aren&#x27;t long enough..</li>
            <li> my brushes are constantly getting crushed when closing the case.  </li>
            <li> The leopard is a little yellow, but it definitely grew on me.</li>
            <li> It is big enough to hold all my eye shadows but small enough that I can carry it around with me.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;can not fit anything larger than individual makeup  into case</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just big enough, sturdy, has a lock and comes with keys and a small mirror.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice a case for them, but I was a little disappointed that the leapard print and faux grain were actually stickers.</li>
            <li> Just wish a little bigger</li>
            <li> It waste of my time to try send back</li>
            <li> Its such waste my time and money.</li>
            <li> Only problem is it&#x27;s a little small.  </li>
            <li> Although apprehensive since some people left negative feedback I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li> it will mess up the \\&quot;velvet\\&quot; on the inside.</li>
            <li> Has lots of little shelves and compartments.</li>
            <li> a few extras come</li>
            <li> Very was disappointed in the longevity of the product.  </li>
            <li> This case sucks.</li>
            <li> I apologize for the broken case.</li>
            <li> Poor customer service and poorly made cosmetic case.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately a year has already passed and we cannot offer a replacement.</li>
            <li> My daughter dances and it fits all her make up, false eyelashes, brushes etc and then some!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a piece of crap!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love it! There is enough room for all of my cosmetics and makeup tools</li>
            <li> I received my train case well ahead of schedule, through UPS, which also surprised me, and made the shipping price well worth it. It was in excellent condition and was everything I&#x27;d hoped for when I bought it. There&#x27;s plenty of storage, and I love the fact that the print is made to look like real fur, not just tan with spots. This was an excellent experience and I would shop from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I got this for all my makeup  I love it .</li>
            <li> The case is cute and light. Only problem is it&#x27;s a little small.  This will work great if u have a few make up or jewelry assessments but not recommended for a make up artist or professional.</li>
            <li> fits all of my makeup and brushes and a few extras come s in handy when I travel which I am always doing</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as big as I thought it would be.. I still love it though. Now I need a bigger one my nail polish collection is growing lol</li>
            <li> For the price I paid for this product, I feel like I purchased a cardboard box trimmed in plastic.  Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Worked great at first and held the things I needed it to but it&#x27;s very cheap and doesn&#x27;t last long so if you are using it for simple things then it&#x27;s okay. It&#x27;s still a piece of crap!</li>
            <li> Love it. It&#x27;s just big enough, sturdy, has a lock and comes with keys and a small mirror. I got this as a birthday present and I&#x27;m not at all dissapointed. The leopard is a little yellow, but it definitely grew on me. Not big enough for a fellow makeup lovers collection, but large enoough to transport a chunk of the collection with you. PERFECT for vacations.</li>
            <li> I bought this and a red one for my neices who love makeup. I was super excited about the price. It&#x27;s a nice a case for them, but I was a little disappointed that the leapard print and faux grain were actually stickers. Other than that, it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> i love my box!! its perfect and magically fits all my make up!! Plus its cute and easy to travel with!</li>
            <li> Awesome! Wife loves it. There is plenty of room for all of her makeup in one easy place.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The reason why I giving this one star is because when I order one. It came on time but it got damaged on the box and I opened the box and check the case it look nice but it got several damage to it. I tried to send it back but it tells me &amp;#34;No Longer Eligible For Return&amp;#34;. It waste of my time to try send back so I can get the money back....Its such waste my time and money.</li>
            <li> It does the job but the brush holders aren&#x27;t long enough.. my brushes are constantly getting crushed when closing the case.  The drawers are too small to actually hold any larger items, it would be better if there was one less drawer and the remaining ones were larger.</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for daughter that loves leopard.  This was a perfect gift, bigger than picture, love that it locks. Just a beautiful piece!</li>
            <li> it was very useful and had many compartments&lt;br /&gt;velvet insides, drawers come all the way out which is good. two thumbs up</li>
            <li> This case sucks. It is poorly made with cheap materials. The case is flimsy, the clasp are really plastic made to look metal and when you open it the drawer do not even fit in the trays so they fall into the box. I even read the reviews and thought the negative one&#x27;s were from negativ  people, but they were from people who like quality, not crap.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift but wanted to keep it for myself.  Loved it when it came.  I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> I Love it! It is the Perfect size and love the doors. It is very sturdy and a great price!</li>
            <li> the case is ok but doesn&#x27;t have as much space as I thought it did. It would be ok if it was only the price of the case but because I got it posted&lt;br /&gt;internationally it cast me a lot to get it and I was happy to pay that for what I thought was a good case but for what It is not I would not have paid a lot for it.</li>
            <li> I dont ever want to put any makeup in here. it will mess up the \\&quot;velvet\\&quot; on the inside. i use it for my jewlery and i really like it. i hang my earings on the doors and use the drawers for my feather earrings and what not...only one true downside to this is that the top drawer can get a little stuck at times.</li>
            <li> VERY NICE, KEEP ALL OF MY COSMETICS ORGANIZED. LOVE THE PRINT. VERY ROOMY. RECEIVED ON TIME. WILL KEEP YOU IN MIND FOR FUTURE PURCHASES.</li>
            <li> Received the train case as promised. Very was disappointed in the longevity of the product.  I bought this in June 2013 and this month it fell apart.  You would thank the company would be happy to replace it or give me some kind of credit for a new one but their reply was &amp;#34;Thank you for contacting us. I apologize for the broken case. Unfortunately a year has already passed and we cannot offer a replacement. If you would like another case, please feel free to order another one! &amp;#34;  Why would I order another one if the first one only lasted 15 months.  No thank you!  Poor customer service and poorly made cosmetic case.</li>
            <li> Although apprehensive since some people left negative feedback I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. The size is great. Tons of compartments due to a great design. Plus you cannot beat the prices. Much nicer than ones I&#x27;ve seen in local stores for a similar price.</li>
            <li> We got this for our daughter to hold some art supplies -- mostly markers and pens -- and it works perfectly. To top it off, it&#x27;s very cute and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a christmas gift and I think my daughter will love it. Well made and the compartment sizes are, perfect for her needs. Thanks so much</li>
            <li> nicely made case, mirror is a little too small.&lt;br /&gt;with the drawers in the bottom there is no room for brushes or hairspray&lt;br /&gt;can not fit anything larger than individual makeup  into case</li>
            <li> Love this LARGE makeup case!  My daughter dances and it fits all her make up, false eyelashes, brushes etc and then some!  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Purchased this case for my daughter. She absolutely loves it. It is the perfect size for all of her make up.</li>
            <li> Bought this item for a 13 year old girl who loves it and carries it whenever she visits.  It is sturdy enough to have survived 2 little brothers&#x27; abuse and still going strong,  Would make an excellent gift for girls of all ages.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my make-up and when it arrived and I examined my purchase, I was MORE than happy with my choice!! Before my purchase, I had reviewed many Train Case&#x27;s of similar design, but just wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the description. The expandable compartments...the pull-out drawers...and the locking feature gives me the space and features I was looking for. I HIGHLY recommend this product! It is suitable for home-use or travel - whichever you&#x27;ll be needing it for - it will get the job done!! :)</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase it arrived 3 days before the arrival date and everything was as described in description I use it as a jewelry case and love it.</li>
            <li> Nice size, not too big, yet the drawers are big enough for a full size brush.  I show Champion Persian Cats, and this is for all of their grooming products.  Very handy, yet compact enough to sit on a grooming table.  It is stable and not tippy when the extensions are pulled out.  Cleans up nicely with a damp cloth on the exterior, and a lint roller on the interior.</li>
            <li> I love this make-up case. It is big enough to hold all my eye shadows but small enough that I can carry it around with me. There are so many draws and holders for my brushes!</li>
            <li> Beautiful Cosmetic Case!! Bought it for my niece for Christmas, but I&#x27;m thinking of getting one for myself.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter for Christmas (her pick). She LOVED it! It&#x27;s a good size, Has lots of little shelves and compartments. Product shipped quickly and it arrived in plenty of time for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Love love this! I think my husband is more happy than I am because now my makeup is all nice and organized.</li>
            <li> Ordered for Granddaughter who does dance competitions. Package arrived on time &amp; was packed well so no damage.  It made for a very happy Granddaughter when she opened it which makes this Grandma happy too.</li>
            <li> Just wish a little bigger</li>
            <li> Nice I just wish it was bigger</li>
            <li> Bought this case for my daughter who was going off to college and had a great deal of make up.  Holds a lot and well organized.  Also, nice size to be kept in a dorm room.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with various make up cases and I LOVE this one. It holds everything and is very sturdy. The drawers can come out if you pull to far, but I don&#x27;t really think it is that big of deal. This is awesome if you love your make up organized, plenty of room</li>
            <li> Very nice box. Was a gift so i guess my sister likes it</li>
            <li> Awesome choice. The shipping was fast and easy</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because it do not have a long enough space for my neckalace to hang all the way down, other than that great jewlry box.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love!!!!! Better than I expected and what the pictures look like. Super fast shipping!!!!!</li>
            <li> I like it. I&#x27;m a dance mom and have all of her smaller makeup pieces and jewelry in it. It&#x27;s not as big as her other one and won&#x27;t fit eyeshadow sets like we have with 12+ colors and a mirror. I wish I could get a larger version to go with it! I would buy it in a heartbeat :)</li>
            <li> Other than the fact that I wanted something a little bit bigger I love it.  It did seem to take a lot longer for the shipping but it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> This was a purchase for my coworker who retired in December 2012. She loves leopard print so this was a wonderful gift idea. Plenty of room and easy to carry</li>
            <li> Very nice case. I gave to someone as a gift and they really like it. Love the way it can sit on a dresser and open up. Very spacious. Thank you.</li>
