            <li>Nice,  </li>
            <li>But this is a nice scent</li>
            <li>But it is better not to buy.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve had better</li>
            <li>the smell had a more manly smell to it.</li>
            <li>Or, treat it with respect if money is tight and you wanna smell great!</li>
            <li>Cheap.</li>
            <li>Good product fast shipping thanks</li>
            <li>The bottle is cool too.</li>
            <li>Smell is good but doesnt last.</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s worth it - plan on spraying much more than you would a high end cologne.</li>
            <li>This smells great, just like the Cuba Royal original &amp; Paco Rabanne 1 Million, although not nearly as strong.</li>
            <li>Went to a major department store and compared the 2 scents, I liked the Pure Gold</li>
            <li>a long, long time.but the semell very good</li>
            <li>I Really Like It..!</li>
            <li>my first thought was uhhhh</li>
            <li>The real deal is more refined &amp; sophisticated with some polished floral notes that are missing here!</li>
            <li>As for the positive, well .... if that donate to someone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several compliments, &amp; will purchase this again - the natural, masculine fragrance is good for any occasion.</li>
            <li>The cologne is pretty good smell but don&#x27;t last that long on you</li>
            <li>Comes very close to the real thing, and at this price is a steal.</li>
            <li>Way too much vanilla for me.</li>
            <li>Long lasting and nice aroma.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Not really, but in a way it has that sweet smell of like flowers, almost like a bubble gum scent like One Million.</li>
            <li>I ordered this because I bought the real One Million, and wanted to use this as a back up.</li>

            <li> It does not last long at all  one hour tops .</li>
            <li> The dry down is a little linear here as well!  </li>
            <li> non the less.</li>
            <li> so you must put on a few times to stay on you</li>
            <li> You can pour over at least a bucket of liquid still in a moment will not smell.</li>

            <li> Long lasting and nice aroma. If your downstairs, and this is being used upstairs, you will smell it immediately!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Good product fast shipping thanks</li>
            <li> It smells very very good</li>
            <li> Comes very close to the real thing, and at this price is a steal.</li>
            <li> i ordered it because a friend told me it smells good. i did a review and saw this one and it said it had the fragrance at a fraction of the price. its good for what i paid for it.</li>
            <li> This smells great, just like the Cuba Royal original &amp; Paco Rabanne 1 Million, although not nearly as strong. I wish it lasted longer also. The bottle is cool too. For the price, it&#x27;s worth it - plan on spraying much more than you would a high end cologne. I recommend this if you do not wish to spend over $25 for an &amp;#34;upper-tier&amp;#34; scent. I&#x27;ve had several compliments, &amp; will purchase this again - the natural, masculine fragrance is good for any occasion.</li>
            <li> Wonderful..! Smell â˜º I Really Like It..!</li>
            <li> The cologne is pretty good smell but don&#x27;t last that long on you so you must put on a few times to stay on you so people can  smell it on you but over all is good smell.</li>
            <li> The value received for this fragrance is superb. Additionally, the aroma of the cologne is nice and lasts. Additionally, the vendor is helpful if there are any questions or concerns.</li>
            <li> Smell is good but doesnt last.</li>
            <li> excellent quality product, a very good option for all those interested in the products of its class, Good Holiday reinteradas times for those interested.</li>
            <li> excellent and satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last all day but can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> This is a very interesting cologne&lt;br /&gt;Very nice.  is great. smells  this one here is not real.&lt;br /&gt; and this item is not last a long, long time.but the semell very good&lt;br /&gt;you can wear this everywhere&lt;br /&gt;  Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Went to a major department store and compared the 2 scents, I liked the Pure Gold it was as good as 1 Million name brand. Longevity was 5-7 hours.</li>
            <li> Cheap. You can pour over at least a bucket of liquid still in a moment will not smell. As for the positive, well .... if that donate to someone. But it is better not to buy.</li>
            <li> Nice,  but I&#x27;ve had better</li>
            <li> I purchased this and Lomani&#x27;s version, to close to call! The real deal is more refined &amp; sophisticated with some polished floral notes that are missing here! The punch your nose in burst in the beginning is all here though!  The dry down is a little linear here as well!  If you&#x27;re wanting a 100% match to Paco Rabanne you&#x27;re not going to get it with the versions! You&#x27;re also not going to be disappointed with this purchase! Leave it in the car or gym bag! Or, treat it with respect if money is tight and you wanna smell great!</li>
            <li> It does not last long at all  one hour tops . I think you need to shake the bottle before you put it on the cologne is not blended correctly in my view. You pay for what you get</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I bought the real One Million, and wanted to use this as a back up. Well, this arrived today and I sprayed it, my first thought was uhhhh is this for females? But I gave it about 5 minutes and gave it another smell on my skin and the smell had a more manly smell to it. Does it smell like One Million? Not really, but in a way it has that sweet smell of like flowers, almost like a bubble gum scent like One Million. But this is a nice scent non the less. Would recommend for casual use.</li>
            <li> Way too much vanilla for me. Even the wife said Ugh!</li>
            <li> l like this..is a present for my husvand...</li>
