            <li>Its smells really good.</li>
            <li>This is a good product and it help my hair.</li>
            <li>but I have to say this stuff smells really good</li>
            <li>It smells good but too greasy.</li>
            <li>I use a good amount all on my scalp while massaging it in, to help stimulate my scalp and to help my hair grow longer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see very many men leave reviews of these products</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I love ORS products!</li>
            <li>It also is nice for maintaining waves and for beginning wavers.</li>
            <li>But it DOES kind of suck that it&#x27;s petroleum based instead of cream based.</li>
            <li>so for my hair is doing good for my hair better for me  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s alot more lightweight than grease, it gives your hair a light shine and it smells great.</li>
            <li>I also use it for my lips and it is the most amazing lip moisturizer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>it makes the skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>It also has a very light coconut smell.</li>
            <li>Great Product, I would certainly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Ok so let me say that i love just about every ORS product out there.</li>
            <li>Not saying i wasnt satisfied because i am.</li>
            <li>i really love this stuff.</li>
            <li>it smells great, it&#x27;s really helping my damaged hair.</li>
            <li>Nothing works better than this on my corse and relaxed hair .</li>
            <li>I love this coconut oil</li>
            <li>I love how the product isn&#x27;t over priced.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>My scalp has never been better.</li>
            <li>Voila, healthy scalp and hair.</li>
            <li>I love it and is still using it.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Have not received it yet but love this product.</li>
            <li>This is more of a lubricant based instead of oil.</li>
            <li>But again,  i only use it a couple times a month and yes  it does smell great!</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re just looking for a good moisturizer for waves, you&#x27;re in the right place.</li>
            <li>Smells good and is very soothing.</li>
            <li>The only fairly good thing about it is that it holds my curls nicely and makes them pop</li>
            <li>I find the best thing you can do for hair growth is eating a diet that&#x27;s high in healthy fats and vitamins and low in processed, sodium or sugar filled</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good scalp conditioner and tried this one, and so far, it works fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light and not at all</li>
            <li>Same product, great price.</li>
            <li>I have dandruff and it gets rid of it and keeps my scalp and hair smooth.</li>
            <li>It is extremely light and does not leave your hands greasy or your hair greasy.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this was a light weight product</li>
            <li>I use it lightly.</li>
            <li>Its not extremely greasy, it smells nice, and its easy to wash from your hands.</li>
            <li>Thought this item was in cream form, as my hair texture only does good with&lt;br /&gt;cream form items.</li>
            <li>So worth the purchase, it makes your hair so shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>great smell and not super greasy like carrot oil.</li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>but hey maybe I just didnt used it right??</li>
            <li>far as a root stimulation, I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s bull.</li>
            <li>It weighs my hair down a lot but besides that, it&#x27;s pretty good</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t grow any faster if I use it, but I think it does help keep my hair strong, which leads to less breakage, meaning fewer trims, and thus more length retention.</li>
            <li>I think it also helps to keep my hair healthy and does add shine for the next day or so after using it.  </li>
            <li>Really does help thicken hair.</li>
            <li>The real difference I have noticed, though, is in my skin.</li>
            <li>but I have really curly frizzy hair &amp; this</li>
            <li>Other than that I love this product</li>
            <li>This product is simply great, it cured my dry scalp issue after just a few months</li>
            <li>Just a small dab will do and it makes your hair nice and shiny</li>
            <li>I also find that using this on my scalp really gets rid of dandruff (normally I have to use t-gel type stuff with coal tar in it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yyou only need very little, so it&#x27;s good for quite a while.</li>
            <li>, organic root make my head Soft and the cream is very perfume just as I like</li>
            <li>Massage it into my scalp and some on my ends, sleep on it over night and wash it out as normal shampooing in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live with out</li>
            <li>It stays better than plain Vaseline or eucerin and my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li>So I am a female who is transitioning to natural and this oil is very very greasy.</li>
            <li>For those with very dry scalp however, you might need to apply it more than once a week as the hair (at least mine) absorbs it quite quickly.</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>I use it on my three year old son&#x27;s hair and it works.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy and does not leave a residue.</li>
            <li>so if you&#x27;re going for all natural</li>
            <li>Skin and hair feel soft and silky</li>
            <li>I actually didn&#x27;t realize until now that this isn&#x27;t even real coconut oil its just a coconut oil product..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure the other people who have wrote reviews use this product the same as myself, but for what i use it for I love it!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this once so far, so I haven&#x27;t noticed anything yet.</li>
            <li>I dry my hair like normal with a towel at the end of the shower.  </li>
            <li>but the greasiness weighs my hair down too much.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure the other people who have wrote reviews use this product the same as myself, but for what i use it for I love it!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once so far, so I haven&#x27;t noticed anything yet.</li>
            <li> I dry my hair like normal with a towel at the end of the shower.  </li>
            <li> but the greasiness weighs my hair down too much.</li>
            <li> I use it as a deep conditioner all over my hair, or a very small amount to help smooth my hair and keep fly-aways and frizz down.</li>
            <li> It does make my hair and scalp softer and not as dry (I have wavy dry and frizzy hair, especially in humidity that i straighten a lot)</li>
            <li> When I tried this product it made my hair even more thicker ( which is not a good feeling when you already have thick hair),it also made it greasy</li>
            <li> my only complaint is that it makes my hair very greasy-feeling and heavy (my hair is currently bleach damaged, mid-back, and wavy).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t rub it through your entire head like any other hair cream.</li>
            <li> I have chronically dry skin</li>
            <li> It moisturize well damaged and dry hair.</li>
            <li> If you have dry ends then do it on your ends too.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, and this product keeps it moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> I use it at night on dry, unwashed hair either once a week or once every other week.  </li>
            <li> I received the product on time and it was as I had expected it.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, down to my butt and curly.</li>
            <li> But then I saw the uses for coconut oil for other parts of the body.</li>
            <li> i just rinse my hair on the other days and use the towel to get rid of any excess oil.  </li>
            <li> Im an black male and with curly somewhat thick hair</li>
            <li> This product is: GREASY AND IT DOES WEIGHT DOWN HAIR(for about 30mins).</li>
            <li> I Just ordered the WEN hair products and since using that stuff for the past week its leaving my hair really dry.</li>
            <li> and now I dont even have to shampoo everyday anymore.</li>
            <li> Product isn&#x27;t greasy and does not feel heavy.</li>
            <li> Take a small amount and rub it in your hands to melt it a little bit then put it on your scalp.</li>
            <li> Now of course this product contains petroleum so I would suggest just using it for your ends and rubbing a little bit in your hands so that you can distribute it from your roots to tips, never put in on your scalp because it will clog your pores!</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair,and a very dry scalp!</li>
            <li> All the bad reviews are probably from people either using too much of the product or using the product too often</li>
            <li> It says to use a small amount, but yea, when I tried it just seemed pointless.  </li>
            <li> I think there were even tiny beads in it which looked weird....</li>
            <li> It says on the bottle to use a small amount.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> But it was sticky and hard to apply.</li>
            <li> but when I was in the shower I noticed its really hard to take off and</li>
            <li> was thick</li>
            <li> THEY MEAN SMALL!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t recommend this stuff enough, they just seem to be marketing for the wrong uses!!</li>
            <li> Was so gross feeling on my hair, it felt so oily and fatty was so nasty!  </li>
            <li> but the grease is annoying and gross.</li>
            <li> Useless for color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I used to have horrible dry scalp problems.  </li>
            <li> After one use I had crazy oily nasty hair for 4 days or so.</li>
            <li> it feels like waxed and after word it&#x27;s makes me hair feel horrible</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great stuff. Yyou only need very little, so it&#x27;s good for quite a while. I also use it after swimming on my arms and legs - it makes the skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> great product. Smells good and is very soothing. Worth the money</li>
            <li> Now of course this product contains petroleum so I would suggest just using it for your ends and rubbing a little bit in your hands so that you can distribute it from your roots to tips, never put in on your scalp because it will clog your pores! Other than that I love this product</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. great smell and not super greasy like carrot oil.</li>
            <li> Ok so let me say that i love just about every ORS product out there. When i got this product, i wasnt expecting basically grease. Not saying i wasnt satisfied because i am. I honestly didnt know what i was expecting lol. But it&#x27;s alot more lightweight than grease, it gives your hair a light shine and it smells great. I use it on my three year old son&#x27;s hair and it works. Oh and it works well on itchy scalp too. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> arrived in good conditions and smells delicious.&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> Thought this item was in cream form, as my hair texture only does good with&lt;br /&gt;cream form items. Will not be using this item for my hair. Came in good condition&lt;br /&gt;and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> i really love this stuff. it smells great, it&#x27;s really helping my damaged hair. it also doesn&#x27;t effect my dyed hair color at all. my only complaint is that it makes my hair very greasy-feeling and heavy (my hair is currently bleach damaged, mid-back, and wavy). but that only means if i go out of the house with it on my hair i just toss it up into a bun.</li>
            <li> Nothing works better than this on my corse and relaxed hair . Its Seems to be greasy but don&#x27;t judges it at the way that product looks .&lt;br /&gt;I use it only at night , my hair absorbs the products and gets hold , body and shine ,in the morning . I tried all the \\&quot;creme de cheveux\\&quot; by Organics Roots Stimulator ; I Like Hair repair cream and I appreciate a lot the Hair fertilizer (so moisturizing). For a cheaper prize, for me it is the best .&lt;br /&gt;Just Try , You will not regret .</li>
            <li> So worth the purchase, it makes your hair so shiny and smooth. It is not heavy and does not leave a residue.</li>
            <li> I love this coconut oil I keep buying it over and over and over! It works really good on my daughters hair. And its growing it as well! I love how the product isn&#x27;t over priced. So I don&#x27;t mind buying  3-5 of them at a time... I will be trying the carrot oil next!!!!</li>
            <li> I got this product because it has been recommended for my hair. After one use I had crazy oily nasty hair for 4 days or so. But then I saw the uses for coconut oil for other parts of the body. I have chronically dry skin and I always lotion then seal with a petrolatum product. This works amazing! It stays better than plain Vaseline or eucerin and my skin is so soft. I also use it for my lips and it is the most amazing lip moisturizer I have ever used. It&#x27;s so light and not at all sticky. also stays on for longer than anything else. I put it on before bed and my lips are still insist in the morning. Can&#x27;t recommend this stuff enough, they just seem to be marketing for the wrong uses!!</li>
            <li> Im an black male and with curly somewhat thick hair and I wear a short cut with waves. I don&#x27;t see very many men leave reviews of these products so I feel obligated to do so. This product is simply great, it cured my dry scalp issue after just a few months and now I dont even have to shampoo everyday anymore. It also is nice for maintaining waves and for beginning wavers. So if you&#x27;re just looking for a good moisturizer for waves, you&#x27;re in the right place. Its not extremely greasy, it smells nice, and its easy to wash from your hands.</li>
            <li> Great Product, I would certainly recommend this product.  It is ideal for my daughter&#x27;s hair and keeps it neat and moist.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Been using it for years. Hard to find in stores so I searched it up on Amazon. Same product, great price. Really does help thicken hair.</li>
            <li> So I am a female who is transitioning to natural and this oil is very very greasy. I put my hand in my hair and its coated with oil and I really don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m heavy handed. It also has sulfates and petroleum  (which I read after I bought it) so if you&#x27;re going for all natural this is not the product for you. The only fairly good thing about it is that it holds my curls nicely and makes them pop but the grease is annoying and gross.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t help my hair out at all , i did try it for two months and nothing happened. wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product</li>
            <li> I was very happy to received this product. Its smells really good. It makes my roots just &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; its helps with hair dye damages. I had dyed my hair three times and it my roots feel and look great. But it was sticky and hard to apply.</li>
            <li> It looked like Vaseline when I got it. It weighs my hair down a lot but besides that, it&#x27;s pretty good</li>
            <li> Out of all the products I used for my hair this works. I have dandruff and it gets rid of it and keeps my scalp and hair smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once so far, so I haven&#x27;t noticed anything yet. But it DOES kind of suck that it&#x27;s petroleum based instead of cream based.</li>
            <li> No longer need conditioner.  Whenever I use shampoo, I put a quarter size dab on my finger and massage it in my hair.  I let it sit for a couple of minutes and then run some water through it.  I dry my hair like normal with a towel at the end of the shower.  My scalp has never been better. I used to have horrible dry scalp problems.  Now, I shampoo and use this once every couple 2-3 days.  i just rinse my hair on the other days and use the towel to get rid of any excess oil.  Voila, healthy scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> this is great on my hair roots thank you</li>
            <li> Wonderful consistency and works wonder with my curly frizzy hair.  I put on after wash/condition and leave in.  Just a small dab will do and it makes your hair nice and shiny</li>
            <li> I started using this product for my skin and hair about two years ago. I absolutely love it! I use it as a deep conditioner all over my hair, or a very small amount to help smooth my hair and keep fly-aways and frizz down. The real difference I have noticed, though, is in my skin. I have very dry skin, and this product keeps it moisturized all day. It also makes me smell like the beach instead of like vaseline, which is always a plus. I also find that using this on my scalp really gets rid of dandruff (normally I have to use t-gel type stuff with coal tar in it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as a root stimulation, I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s bull. My hair doesn&#x27;t grow any faster if I use it, but I think it does help keep my hair strong, which leads to less breakage, meaning fewer trims, and thus more length retention. I find the best thing you can do for hair growth is eating a diet that&#x27;s high in healthy fats and vitamins and low in processed, sodium or sugar filled foods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I have chest-length 2a hair, type iii thickness.</li>
            <li> I do not like using oils, and grease on my hair, but this product is awesome. It is extremely light and does not leave your hands greasy or your hair greasy. It also has a very light coconut smell. Very Good product.</li>
            <li> The coconut oils is too heave for my hair but it&#x27;s just a personal opinion. It moisturize well damaged and dry hair.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live with out this product does wonders.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and it help my hair. I love it and is still using it. I will  keep using it</li>
            <li> This product is: GREASY AND IT DOES WEIGHT DOWN HAIR(for about 30mins). I have very thick hair,and a very dry scalp! When I tried this product it made my hair even more thicker ( which is not a good feeling when you already have thick hair),it also made it greasy ( for about a week).I must say that the product DOES have a great smell, I also loved it when it melted a bit. This would be great for thinning,weak hair!</li>
            <li> Me I thing this is the very best thing I have fine so for my hair is doing good for my hair better for me  I love it</li>
            <li> Have not received it yet but love this product.</li>
            <li> This is more of a lubricant based instead of oil. Beware leaves you oily and doesn&#x27;t seem to penetrate the hair cuticle.</li>
            <li> Skin and hair feel soft and silky</li>
            <li> I actually bought this product from a beauty store. I got it because it smells great but once I got home I used it and I didn&#x27;t mind that is was thick but when I was in the shower I noticed its really hard to take off and it feels like waxed and after word it&#x27;s makes me hair feel horrible but hey maybe I just didnt used it right??</li>
            <li> Product isn&#x27;t greasy and does not feel heavy. I was looking for a good scalp conditioner and tried this one, and so far, it works fine. For those with very dry scalp however, you might need to apply it more than once a week as the hair (at least mine) absorbs it quite quickly.</li>
            <li> Was so gross feeling on my hair, it felt so oily and fatty was so nasty!  It says to use a small amount, but yea, when I tried it just seemed pointless.  I think there were even tiny beads in it which looked weird....</li>
            <li> This is just way too GREASY for me. I have long hair, down to my butt and curly. I was hoping this was a light weight product but the greasiness weighs my hair down too much.</li>
            <li> I was looking for coconut oil &amp; I saw this stuff in the African American hair products section. I&#x27;m a white girl but I have really curly frizzy hair &amp; this is the only coconut oil I could find. I actually didn&#x27;t realize until now that this isn&#x27;t even real coconut oil its just a coconut oil product.. but I have to say this stuff smells really good and it does not leave my hair greasy. I don&#x27;t put this stuff on my roots I just put it mid shaft to the ends of my hair and it makes it shine and covers up the frizz. I Just ordered the WEN hair products and since using that stuff for the past week its leaving my hair really dry. I&#x27;ve been using this product to cover up the dryness.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.</li>
            <li> Useless for color treated hair.</li>
            <li> Very nice hair oil. I received the product on time and it was as I had expected it. I would by this product again</li>
            <li> I like the product , I received it in indicate time , organic root make my head Soft and the cream is very perfume just as I like</li>
            <li> I love ORS products! I use about twice a week when I go for my protective styles. It says on the bottle to use a small amount. THEY MEAN SMALL! Take a small amount and rub it in your hands to melt it a little bit then put it on your scalp. If you have dry ends then do it on your ends too. Don&#x27;t rub it through your entire head like any other hair cream. The product will make your hair greasy. All the bad reviews are probably from people either using too much of the product or using the product too often</li>
            <li> It smells good but too greasy. I use it lightly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure the other people who have wrote reviews use this product the same as myself, but for what i use it for I love it!  I do not use it as a daily hair product.  I use it at night on dry, unwashed hair either once a week or once every other week.  Massage it into my scalp and some on my ends, sleep on it over night and wash it out as normal shampooing in the morning.  I use a good amount all on my scalp while massaging it in, to help stimulate my scalp and to help my hair grow longer. It does make my hair and scalp softer and not as dry (I have wavy dry and frizzy hair, especially in humidity that i straighten a lot) I think it also helps to keep my hair healthy and does add shine for the next day or so after using it.  But again,  i only use it a couple times a month and yes  it does smell great!</li>
