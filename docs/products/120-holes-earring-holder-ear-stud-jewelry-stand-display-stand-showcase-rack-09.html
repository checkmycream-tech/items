    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>worked wonderful</li>
            <li>It was in great shape..</li>
            <li>I really love it!!</li>
            <li>I loved this earring holder.</li>
            <li>Loved it, just what I needed for my stud earings.  </li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>Earring holder is nice to have to hold post earrings</li>
            <li>Love it helps me keep all my earings nice and organized.</li>
            <li>very cheap quality,</li>
            <li>&amp; I love it.</li>
            <li>and I wish I would have ordered more.  </li>
            <li>but this holder is not for dangle earrings but post probably you can get more on.</li>
            <li>I may buy more</li>
            <li>I love that is transparent, but it came in broken&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li>Took some effort on my part, but I was able to drill out them out myself,</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Delivered promptly, does the job, cute way to display your earrings.</li>
            <li>Was really excited to get this!</li>
            <li>It fit all my earrings perfectly and isn&#x27;t too big.</li>
            <li>but it probably won&#x27;t fit as many.</li>
            <li>It does it&#x27;s job perfectly though, despite the ugliness.</li>
            <li>this price I am not returning it, used super glue and fix it myself</li>
            <li>So, in conclusion, PERFECT for small stud earrings but will not hold many dangly or larger post earrings.</li>
            <li>It works great for small stud earrings</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t order it expecting anything pretty.</li>
            <li>I will most likely get some more in the future, thank you so much</li>
            <li>It IS a little smaller than I thought it would be but it works great for what I needed.</li>
            <li>so you I can see my whole collection at a glance.  </li>
            <li>It came fairly fast and was packed suffecently.</li>
            <li>So it really is up to you how you want to use it.</li>
            <li>so I can have them ready to go with me.</li>
            <li>Stores my earrings very neatly.</li>
            <li>i a lot smaller than i expected but still good product</li>
            <li>Other reviews say it &amp;#34;wasn&#x27;t color that was stated in post&amp;#34;, well it has a Brown protective layer (sticker) on it that is easily removed.</li>
            <li>Other then that it&#x27;s fine,</li>
            <li>The only big problem is that it peels off which is really cheap looking.</li>
            <li>Not meant for big, wide, or earrings that dangle, if you want to get the most out of it.</li>
            <li>I had my maintenance man put wire across from the first hole to the last hole in that row</li>
            <li>it will probably come with a piece of brown and a piece of clear film on it to protect the acrylic from scratching.</li>
            <li>I thought it had another piece on it since it looked frosty (whereas the photo looks clear) but it just seems to be the finish and not something that will peel off.</li>
            <li>These work really well for my earrings, including the tiny studs i have.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve put some larger earrings and dangly earrings near the bottom though.</li>
            <li>Just like other reviews have stated, it&#x27;s really meant for stud earrings.</li>

            <li> Just like other reviews have stated, it&#x27;s really meant for stud earrings.</li>
            <li> I have my small wardrobe of earrings in it all ready.</li>
            <li> it was smaller then expected and a beige color with rips at the bottom</li>
            <li> Package arrived earlier than expected.</li>

            <li> Hard to put posts on it especially if you have any length in your nails.</li>
            <li> but I was hoping to also use it for a few dangly post earrings</li>
            <li> so I can sell a few in my wheelchair.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that this earring holder is small - look at the dimensions when ordering.  </li>
            <li> This works for me to take out a few of my earrings at least 9 to 11</li>
            <li> Keeping in mind that it is just a very ugly brown stand, it&#x27;s exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Very small but suits Tue purpose.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with what I got but thankful that it still works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m terrible about reading product dimensions.</li>

            <li> worked wonderful my mom has alot of earrings I will most likely get some more in the future, thank you so much</li>
            <li> Not exactly the size I thought I was buying. Very small but suits Tue purpose.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. Hard to put posts on it especially if you have any length in your nails.</li>
            <li> Was really excited to get this! Disappointed with what I got but thankful that it still works. The only big problem is that it peels off which is really cheap looking. Other then that it&#x27;s fine,</li>
            <li> It took a while to receive the product but it came eventually &amp; I love it.</li>
            <li> I have my small wardrobe of earrings in it all ready. I really love it!! It keeps my earrings where I want them</li>
            <li> Earring holder is nice to have to hold post earrings so you I can see my whole collection at a glance.  Keep in mind that this earring holder is small - look at the dimensions when ordering.  Does it job for me and I wish I would have ordered more.  Vendor shipped item sooner than expected!</li>
            <li> i a lot smaller than i expected but still good product</li>
            <li> Looks bigger in their photo. But I like it works like it&#x27;s supposed to. Also it arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m terrible about reading product dimensions. I was expecting an earring holder about the size of a piece of copy paper but it&#x27;s only about 6&amp;#34; tall. It works great for small stud earrings but I was hoping to also use it for a few dangly post earrings but it probably won&#x27;t fit as many. FYI it will probably come with a piece of brown and a piece of clear film on it to protect the acrylic from scratching. I thought it had another piece on it since it looked frosty (whereas the photo looks clear) but it just seems to be the finish and not something that will peel off. So, in conclusion, PERFECT for small stud earrings but will not hold many dangly or larger post earrings.</li>
            <li> It came fairly fast and was packed suffecently. I had my maintenance man put wire across from the first hole to the last hole in that row and then did the same in every fourth row. It helps a bit but this holder is not for dangle earrings but post probably you can get more on. This works for me to take out a few of my earrings at least 9 to 11 so I can sell a few in my wheelchair. So it really is up to you how you want to use it. I may buy more so I can have them ready to go with me.</li>
            <li> I love that is transparent, but it came in broken&lt;br /&gt;for this price I am not returning it, used super glue and fix it myself</li>
            <li> it was smaller then expected and a beige color with rips at the bottom but it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RE painted it blue</li>
            <li> Package arrived earlier than expected. It was in great shape.. Other reviews say it &amp;#34;wasn&#x27;t color that was stated in post&amp;#34;, well it has a Brown protective layer (sticker) on it that is easily removed. It IS a little smaller than I thought it would be but it works great for what I needed. I love this!</li>
            <li> Some of the holes were not all the way drilled out.  Took some effort on my part, but I was able to drill out them out myself,</li>
            <li> I loved this earring holder. It fit all my earrings perfectly and isn&#x27;t too big. Love it.</li>
            <li> Love it helps me keep all my earings nice and organized.</li>
            <li> It was cracked in two places when I opened the package - it is now duct taped together...</li>
            <li> Keeping in mind that it is just a very ugly brown stand, it&#x27;s exactly what I expected. Don&#x27;t order it expecting anything pretty. It does it&#x27;s job perfectly though, despite the ugliness. Just like other reviews have stated, it&#x27;s really meant for stud earrings. I&#x27;ve put some larger earrings and dangly earrings near the bottom though. Stores my earrings very neatly. I like it.</li>
            <li> Item appears larger in picture. very cheap quality, but I guess for the price that&#x27;s what you get.</li>
            <li> Delivered promptly, does the job, cute way to display your earrings. My daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> These work really well for my earrings, including the tiny studs i have.</li>
            <li> Loved it, just what I needed for my stud earings.  Doesn&#x27;t work well with other earings.</li>
            <li> Holds all my stud earrings. Not meant for big, wide, or earrings that dangle, if you want to get the most out of it. Keeps my earrings organized!</li>
