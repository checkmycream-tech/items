            <li>Great bobby pins</li>
            <li>I needed this to use with a wig and it&#x27;s working great.</li>
            <li>Will order more for sure!!!    </li>
            <li>These pins are of good quality and arrived on time.</li>
            <li>These are good bobby pins.  </li>
            <li>I have needed Longer Pins for my hair a year now; and I&#x27;m happy to be able to put up my hair and have it stay there.</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>Super happy with the pins.</li>
            <li>Bobby pins always had waves on top part of the pins so the pins won&#x27;t slip out.</li>
            <li>But its still my favorite pin in market for securing my hair.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re definitely better than the ones you get at walmart or something</li>
            <li>Just love them for so many uses.</li>
            <li>First time in years that I have been able to locate these babies!  </li>
            <li>Just some good old bobby pins, and two sizes!</li>
            <li>Please feel free to reply to this comment, if you have any questions.</li>
            <li>Super strong hold.    </li>
            <li>Original:  &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;  </li>
            <li>But these are true to its reviews.</li>
            <li>good for children only</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and I have so many now with this pack of 50, that they should last awhile.</li>
            <li>The large pins are the best for thick buns.</li>
            <li>Worth buy them.</li>
            <li>They are super strong and grip hair really nice and tight.  </li>
            <li>there was such a difference in bobby pins, but these are far superior to any I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something to pick your way out of handcuffs with, though, these are exactly what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li>and I really love that they come in two different sizes.  </li>
            <li>4 of the large pins are enough to secure the bun all day even during exercise.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re pretty much one use only.  </li>
            <li>FYI: these bobby pins are the cheaper kind where the little balls on the tips are made of plastic that slip off, not a single piece of metal.</li>
            <li>No matter what direction my hair are on, they will keep them there secure and tight.  </li>
            <li>I really like these...and am buying a 2nd set...</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t appear to have bent out of shape or lost paint, and none of them have lost their soft end tips.</li>
            <li>Finally i&#x27;m able to try different hairstyles everyday.</li>
            <li>The pins are strong enough, but the black paint start falling off after three days, so...</li>

            <li> I have thick asian hair with lot of waves.</li>
            <li> If that happens, the pins snag the hair along and not very smooth to get it bun.</li>
            <li> They are black</li>
            <li> These type of pins are no good, because they took a short cut in manufacturring.</li>
            <li> Modern manufacture, with the intent of cutting cost must have&lt;br /&gt;eliminated</li>
            <li> They were too small for me.</li>
            <li> I have thick, waist length hair and wear a bun required for work.</li>
            <li> If you open them even a little bit, they stay in that position, which is really annoying.  </li>
            <li> I try very hard to test all features before giving my unbiased opinion to users.</li>
            <li> I think they were fake</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have needed Longer Pins for my hair a year now; and I&#x27;m happy to be able to put up my hair and have it stay there. Thank you</li>
            <li> overpriced.  Buy these locally or at your supermarket</li>
            <li> These pins are of good quality and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> These type of pins are no good, because they took a short cut in manufacturring. Bobby pins always had waves on top part of the pins so the pins won&#x27;t slip out. It is not a decoration. Those waves were put in the design for a reason. Modern manufacture, with the intent of cutting cost must have&lt;br /&gt;eliminated the waves. Sounds like man&#x27;s idea. They have no idea why those waves are put in because they never use them. I have been looking for&lt;br /&gt;long pins with waves for my cignon and couls not find them at the store, until I found them on line from out of USA.</li>
            <li> Update2:  &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;  The paint started chipping off with daily use. It doesn&#x27;t bother me as long as paint doesn&#x27;t chip from corners. If that happens, the pins snag the hair along and not very smooth to get it bun. I have no option than to discard it if that happens. But its still my favorite pin in market for securing my hair. Super strong hold.    Update1:  &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;  I also ordered curved jumbo pins from Diane. You can find my review for that at:    https://www.amazon.com/review/R18LMPH9P6FQ97/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rdp_perm    Original:  &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;  I have tried numerous types of pins to hold bun on my head. I have thick asian hair with lot of waves. When i ordered these, i thought may be i&#x27;m wasting my time and money again. But these are true to its reviews. They are super strong and grip hair really nice and tight.  Finally i&#x27;m able to try different hairstyles everyday. No matter what direction my hair are on, they will keep them there secure and tight.  Super happy with the pins. Will order more for sure!!!    **[...].

            <li> Boy!  I had no idea there was such a difference in bobby pins, but these are far superior to any I&#x27;ve ever used. They don&#x27;t snag my hair and stay put!!</li>
            <li> Works well For its purpose.</li>
            <li> great product definately would buy again</li>
            <li> But the smaller ones are THE BOMB DIGGIDY!&lt;br /&gt;I just wish they only sold the smaller ones&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re definitely better than the ones you get at walmart or something</li>
            <li> I really like these...and am buying a 2nd set...</li>
            <li> Love them! Worth buy them.</li>
            <li> These bobby pins get the job done but they&#x27;re pretty much one use only.  If you open them even a little bit, they stay in that position, which is really annoying.  They&#x27;re pretty mediocre but still usable.</li>
            <li> Just some good old bobby pins, and two sizes!</li>
            <li> The pins are strong enough, but the black paint start falling off after three days, so...</li>
            <li> What can I say they&#x27;re bobby pins!!!</li>
            <li> FYI: these bobby pins are the cheaper kind where the little balls on the tips are made of plastic that slip off, not a single piece of metal. If you&#x27;re looking for something to pick your way out of handcuffs with, though, these are exactly what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> I think they were fake</li>
            <li> Great bobby pins and I really love that they come in two different sizes.  They are black so they blend well with my hair so they cannot be seen when I leave them in.  They are easy to use and I have so many now with this pack of 50, that they should last awhile.</li>
            <li> good for children only</li>
            <li> First time in years that I have been able to locate these babies!  Just love them for so many uses.</li>
            <li> These are good bobby pins.  They don&#x27;t appear to have bent out of shape or lost paint, and none of them have lost their soft end tips.</li>
            <li> They were too small for me.</li>
            <li> The large pins are the best for thick buns. I have thick, waist length hair and wear a bun required for work. 4 of the large pins are enough to secure the bun all day even during exercise.</li>
            <li> Lots of pins. Two different sizes. I needed this to use with a wig and it&#x27;s working great.</li>
