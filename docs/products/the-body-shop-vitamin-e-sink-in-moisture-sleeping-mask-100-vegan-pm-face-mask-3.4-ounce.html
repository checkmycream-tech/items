            <li>I am very impressed with the results, it has made my complexion so even toned.</li>
            <li>This mask was wonderful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think this is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>the body shop goods have a wonderful affection to my skin....</li>
            <li>Good item!</li>
            <li>Good product!</li>
            <li>Great moisturizing mask.</li>
            <li>This mask has been great for my needs.</li>
            <li>good for the face... keep my face always in wet...love it....</li>
            <li>It is good , but not as imagined</li>
            <li>I cannot know for sure whether it is used before or not!</li>
            <li>and I am loving the results</li>
            <li>I will say that I use a sonic face brush so that might play into why this was so effective for me.</li>
            <li>and I rinsed with warm water to remove any excess.</li>
            <li>First off, this does a great job of moisturizing your skin.</li>
            <li>In the end I did what the instructions said to do (wipe or rinse it off) and noticed my skin seemed to be pretty happy.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>and I was able to see the difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Okay so I have combination skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products, but they don&#x27;t work for my skin.</li>
            <li>just love it</li>
            <li>And I still love it and would like to keep using it.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, and it is pretty moisten, so it is a good product.</li>
            <li>Now the smell isn&#x27;t too great (reminds me of an older woman&#x27;s perfume)</li>
            <li>used to use Biotherm Aquasource Non-Stop Emergency Hydration Mask; it was good, but not as intense as this one.</li>
            <li>Gel/lotion like consistency, spreads easily and doesn&#x27;t run off the face.</li>
            <li>Cool, Creamy and Refreshing.....</li>
            <li>It is a great product, I only used it twice</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it as my daily moisturizer and it made my skin looks great.</li>
            <li>it, it&#x27;s reasonably priced and you just might like the results you get !!!</li>
            <li>Yummy rich Vitamin E cream.</li>
            <li>Nice and soft, lightly scented.  </li>
            <li>It saves my time to clean every night.</li>
            <li>My skin gets extremely dry in the winter and this worked really great.</li>
            <li>It makes the skin feel very soft and is a nice alternative to the peel-off and clay masks.</li>
            <li>One should note that there is a mild burning sensation right after you apply this.</li>
            <li>I use it as a daily moisturizer and my face feels amazing.</li>
            <li>but the results are well worth it.</li>
            <li>but I think the product itself is worth 4 stars.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes well all over, but is especially great when you have just a little dry patch to smooth.  </li>
            <li>The scent is the same as the rest of the Vitamin E collection (light and powdery) but thankfully it&#x27;s not as strong as the lotions.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a struggle to find products that are effective for my skin type but also gentle enough not to cause me a problem.</li>
            <li>It smells light, and feminine.. not heavy by any means.</li>
            <li>Good for the skin, I use it every night, just as a regular scream, and next day, I wake up with a fresh face.</li>
            <li>, I have super sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This is also good for those who just got off the plane, especially after a long flight.</li>
            <li>I use this &amp; the Vitamin E INTENSE MOISTURIZER</li>
            <li>I am one of those people that enjoy things that are combined together (all except shampoo and conditioner) and this facial mask doubles as a night cream and daytime moisturizer as well as a mask you can use a couple times a week.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it as anything but a night cream because it leaves your face VERY shiny for awhile.</li>
            <li>It is really convenient and moisture.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a nice treat for when my skin is feeling dried out.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product and have been using it for about two weeks now, I only use this product at night but it has made a HUGE difference, I have very sensitive skin and have been using another product (</li>
            <li>Meaningful Beauty)for year, now I feel stupid having paid that much for a skincare system when this stuff has made my skin feel and look so much better in just weeks!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great that they didn&#x27;t load this product with a super-strong and disgusting fragrance, but this is hardly a good alternative.</li>
            <li>Works okay-- a little pricey for something that smells like this.</li>
            <li>It left my skin super soft, redness is gone and</li>
            <li>I actually could tell the difference right away</li>
            <li>An item that cannot live without.</li>
            <li>(I have super dry skin, btw.)</li>
            <li>the picture looks pretty big, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>and actually the label does not look exactly as the image of the product (which is shown here and on The Body Shop website).</li>
            <li>Your face stays hydrated for hours and when you wake up in the morning, your face feels supple and soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>It delivers moisture as promised and my skin is soft.</li>
            <li>Absorbs really well and the moisturizing effect is deep and penetrating.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin baby soft</li>
            <li>It really does &amp;#34;sink in&amp;#34; if you leave it on long enough (and do not apply too much).</li>
            <li>My skin gets extremely dry in winter months and need intense hydration and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I use a tiny bit of bare minerals powder normally to even out skin tone</li>
            <li>This lead to even more acne than I normally have, which I was not happy about, since I&#x27;d finally got my skin cleared up.    </li>
            <li>This wreaks havoc on your skin if you&#x27;re not careful.      </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy; the shine more like, a thin film of something almost plastic-feeling (must be the all the glycerin?).</li>
            <li>I would recommend this mask for those with dry skin who need deep and intense moisturizing.</li>
            <li>When I first moved to my current location, in the dead of winter</li>
            <li>is what I use right now: (although I see more in the line I would like to try now)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s really impractical, because I don&#x27;t like wearing a ton of make-up, and usually prefer to just dot foundation and/or concealer under my eyes or in problem spots.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, and in the winter especially my cheeks and chin get very, very dry.</li>
            <li> In winter when my skin is driest, no other product I&#x27;ve tried works as well as this one!&lt;br /&gt;Applied before bedtime, when I wake up there&#x27;s a slight sheen on my skin, but it feels hydrated.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish the Body Shop hadn&#x27;t discontinued the everyday Vitamin E daily face lotion of this same product line because this mask isn&#x27;t a substitute for it</li>
            <li> my dry patches are significantly less dry.</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of time outside, as I take the bus to work, and have to walk a few blocks to &amp; from the bus stop each day.</li>
            <li> Sort of like a dusty closet, really</li>
            <li> no less, I discovered that spring that the intense cold and wind had prompted my skin to begin producing excess oils to protect itself.</li>
            <li> I just bought the product from this deal with some other stuffs, and Amazon put everything into a box.</li>
            <li> texture is odd, sort of gelatinous and there are no instructions  for use.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER,...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, the texture IS odd,...</li>
            <li> I live in Iowa, where we have extreme heat, humidity, and winds in the summer contrasted by extreme cold, no humidity, and winds in the winter.</li>
            <li> I usually leave it on for a long time, until my skin completely sucks and absorbs it in.</li>
            <li> Initially I gave this product a poor review (3 stars).&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conversely, when I forgot to apply it on one occasion I realized that WITHOUT it the next morning the skin on my face looked like thin crumpled plastic wrap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Yes, you can literally see and feel how the skin sucks in the mask, eventually leaving only a thin layer of film.</li>
            <li> If I put this on in the morning though, it forces me to lay on the make up all over, or it&#x27;s just too weird for me to go outside.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 5 years and still using it.</li>
            <li> I then wash it off and apply my usual skincare routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product has the consistency of a thick moisturizer</li>
            <li> And I mean combination.</li>
            <li> - almost musty (not pleasant for a goodnight kiss with the bf after washing up).</li>
            <li> It smells really weird.</li>
            <li> Whenever my skin dries up badly, I use it.</li>

            <li> I live in Iowa, where we have extreme heat, humidity, and winds in the summer contrasted by extreme cold, no humidity, and winds in the winter. This wreaks havoc on your skin if you&#x27;re not careful.      I spend a lot of time outside, as I take the bus to work, and have to walk a few blocks to &amp; from the bus stop each day. When I first moved to my current location, in the dead of winter no less, I discovered that spring that the intense cold and wind had prompted my skin to begin producing excess oils to protect itself. This lead to even more acne than I normally have, which I was not happy about, since I&#x27;d finally got my skin cleared up.    This moisturizer provides a barrier between my skin and the wind, protecting me from the elements, and reduces my skin&#x27;s urge to produce those excess oils. I use it as a daily moisturizer and my face feels amazing.</li>
            <li> Cool, Creamy and Refreshing.....I use this &amp; the Vitamin E INTENSE MOISTURIZER and I am loving the results</li>
            <li> I am one of those people that enjoy things that are combined together (all except shampoo and conditioner) and this facial mask doubles as a night cream and daytime moisturizer as well as a mask you can use a couple times a week. It smells light, and feminine.. not heavy by any means. Your face stays hydrated for hours and when you wake up in the morning, your face feels supple and soft. I bought two of these and it should last the entire winter.</li>
            <li> Good for the skin, I use it every night, just as a regular scream, and next day, I wake up with a fresh face.</li>
            <li> Yummy rich Vitamin E cream. Leaves skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing mask.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.  Nice and soft, lightly scented.  Moisturizes well all over, but is especially great when you have just a little dry patch to smooth.  It really does &amp;#34;sink in&amp;#34; if you leave it on long enough (and do not apply too much).</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and have been using it for about two weeks now, I only use this product at night but it has made a HUGE difference, I have very sensitive skin and have been using another product (Meaningful Beauty)for year, now I feel stupid having paid that much for a skincare system when this stuff has made my skin feel and look so much better in just weeks!! I actually could tell the difference right away but after a couple of weeks using this at night and using the Vitamin C cream (with SPF 30 ) by Body Shop for daytime and finish with the Vitamin E face mist. I am very impressed with the results, it has made my complexion so even toned. I use a tiny bit of bare minerals powder normally to even out skin tone but today I went to put it on and didn&#x27;t even need it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I use right now: (although I see more in the line I would like to try now)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin E Sink in moisture mask- (Evening)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C Daily cream with SPF30 (Use Daily)- [[ASIN:B003UYMZUG The Body Shop Moisturizer 1 69 Fluid]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin E face mist-(Daily)  [[ASIN:B000HJT1CW The Body Shop Vitamin 3 3 Fluid]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin E Illuminating cream:(Daily)  [[ASIN:B001L8ZUZA The Body Shop Illuminating 1 7 Fluid]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, it&#x27;s reasonably priced and you just might like the results you get !!!</li>
            <li> Works okay-- a little pricey for something that smells like this. Can&#x27;t use the rest of it as it smells like an ancient persons perfume.</li>
            <li> This mask has the consistency and feel of a regular moisturizer. It makes the skin feel very soft and is a nice alternative to the peel-off and clay masks.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, and it is pretty moisten, so it is a good product. But after using it ,I get some acnes.I do not know why.</li>
            <li> Initially I gave this product a poor review (3 stars).&lt;br /&gt;The texture is odd, sort of gelatinous and there are no instructions  for use.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER,...I&#x27;ve changed my mind.  In winter when my skin is driest, no other product I&#x27;ve tried works as well as this one!&lt;br /&gt;Applied before bedtime, when I wake up there&#x27;s a slight sheen on my skin, but it feels hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;Conversely, when I forgot to apply it on one occasion I realized that WITHOUT it the next morning the skin on my face looked like thin crumpled plastic wrap. (Not pretty)&lt;br /&gt;Again, the texture IS odd,...but the results are well worth it.</li>
            <li> First off, this does a great job of moisturizing your skin. I have combination skin, and in the winter especially my cheeks and chin get very, very dry. This does take care of it. It&#x27;s gel-based and non greasy.    Complaints:  1) I wouldn&#x27;t use it as anything but a night cream because it leaves your face VERY shiny for awhile. It&#x27;s not greasy; the shine more like, a thin film of something almost plastic-feeling (must be the all the glycerin?). It&#x27;s really impractical, because I don&#x27;t like wearing a ton of make-up, and usually prefer to just dot foundation and/or concealer under my eyes or in problem spots. If I put this on in the morning though, it forces me to lay on the make up all over, or it&#x27;s just too weird for me to go outside.  2) It smells really weird. Sort of like a dusty closet, really - almost musty (not pleasant for a goodnight kiss with the bf after washing up). It&#x27;s great that they didn&#x27;t load this product with a super-strong and disgusting fragrance, but this is hardly a good alternative.</li>
            <li> the picture looks pretty big, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I wish the Body Shop hadn&#x27;t discontinued the everyday Vitamin E daily face lotion of this same product line because this mask isn&#x27;t a substitute for it</li>
            <li> we still not to have it I am waiting staff for 2 month.</li>
            <li> This product has the consistency of a thick moisturizer so I was on the fence about leaving it on or wiping it off. In the end I did what the instructions said to do (wipe or rinse it off) and noticed my skin seemed to be pretty happy. It&#x27;s not something I use regularly but it&#x27;s a nice treat for when my skin is feeling dried out. The scent is the same as the rest of the Vitamin E collection (light and powdery) but thankfully it&#x27;s not as strong as the lotions.</li>
            <li> It is a great product, I only used it twice and I was able to see the difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I just bought the product from this deal with some other stuffs, and Amazon put everything into a box. Everything else seems to be alright but only this product arrived unsealed and just the jar itself. I cannot know for sure whether it is used before or not! Also, it looks kind of dirty and actually the label does not look exactly as the image of the product (which is shown here and on The Body Shop website). When I spend 22 bucks for only 100ml of this product, I do not expect this situation! Should I return it or not?</li>
            <li> Okay so I have combination skin. And I mean combination. I&#x27;ve got eczema, psoriasis, redness, acne of all shapes and sizes. It&#x27;s a struggle to find products that are effective for my skin type but also gentle enough not to cause me a problem. Mineral oil is my enemy and I am religious about reading labels. This mask was wonderful. Now the smell isn&#x27;t too great (reminds me of an older woman&#x27;s perfume) but I think the product itself is worth 4 stars. Gel/lotion like consistency, spreads easily and doesn&#x27;t run off the face. I will say that I use a sonic face brush so that might play into why this was so effective for me. It sunk into my skin as promised (10-12 minutes) and I rinsed with warm water to remove any excess. Directions say tissue but I prefer to rinse. It left my skin super soft, redness is gone and my dry patches are significantly less dry. One should note that there is a mild burning sensation right after you apply this. However, it does go away after just a moment or two and I even fanned my face to speed things up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is a wonderful product. It delivers moisture as promised and my skin is soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it as my daily moisturizer and it made my skin looks great. I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 5 years and still using it. I have tried many products, but they don&#x27;t work for my skin. (I have super dry skin, btw.) So this is IT for me. An item that cannot live without.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money. No any use to improve my skin and if there is zero star, I choose zero star.</li>
            <li> good for the face... keep my face always in wet...love it.... the body shop goods have a wonderful affection to my skin.... just love it</li>
            <li> I was looking for the mask which could be used without washing it off. That&#x27;s what I got!!It is what you can see on its instruction.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 years. And I still love it and would like to keep using it. It is really convenient and moisture. It saves my time to clean every night. Good item!</li>
            <li> It is good , but not as imagined</li>
            <li> Absorbs really well and the moisturizing effect is deep and penetrating. My skin gets extremely dry in winter months and need intense hydration and moisturizing. This mask has been great for my needs. I usually leave it on for a long time, until my skin completely sucks and absorbs it in. Yes, you can literally see and feel how the skin sucks in the mask, eventually leaving only a thin layer of film. I then wash it off and apply my usual skincare routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use Biotherm Aquasource Non-Stop Emergency Hydration Mask; it was good, but not as intense as this one. I would recommend this mask for those with dry skin who need deep and intense moisturizing. This is also good for those who just got off the plane, especially after a long flight. Whenever my skin dries up badly, I use it. Good product!</li>
            <li> I like the concept of this product, I have used it twice but has irritated my skin, I have super sensitive skin.  I will give it another try because it does feel softer after applying it and the redness does go away after a while</li>
            <li> Makes my skin baby soft</li>
            <li> My skin gets extremely dry in the winter and this worked really great.</li>
