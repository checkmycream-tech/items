            <li>I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume.</li>

            <li>Such a beautiful smell!</li>
            <li>It came right on time and my sister loved her gift</li>
            <li>It also arrived very quickly, so I was completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>My GF had a sample of this and said how much she had liked it</li>
            <li>It smells great and last along time.  </li>
            <li>, thought I&#x27;d get something cheap to replace a D&amp;G perfume I wanted.  </li>
            <li>but I am really loving this new scent.</li>
            <li>Buy it right now!</li>
            <li>On my friend it had a sweet, young, sophisticated smell, on me it almost smelled cheap...</li>
            <li>I get lots of compliments when I wear Bella Belara, due to its light, pleasant fragrance that doesn&#x27;t assault the senses.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what i wanted and was at a killer price!</li>
            <li>and she was right.</li>
            <li>This perfume was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>This smells like some cheap old person perfume.  </li>
            <li>I love romantic smells</li>
            <li>I have worn other perfumes that smell good as well, but for some reason this particular perfume is the one that gets noticed...</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Do not buy this unless your an old grandma or want to buy something to wear to work instead of out having fun.  </li>
            <li>So I love it on other people, but not on myself.</li>
            <li>Smells like pure alcohol very little scent to enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s scent is like powerful roses mixed with tacky gross stuff.</li>
            <li>It is not strong or over powering and for the price, I felt it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I love the  fregrance but it is so weak it only lasts for 10-15 min</li>

            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not worth it</li>
            <li> I can find perfumes and body sprays that I like just as well for less money.</li>
            <li> However, at least a little bit of Bella goes a long way, so a bottle lasts a while.</li>
            <li> However, it is a little pricey.</li>
            <li> Shame on you vendor.&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy again for this Eau De Parfum and waste of money.</li>
            <li> The smell is subtle but stays with you throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve known it was a bad decision to buy something before actually smelling it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really bad.  </li>
