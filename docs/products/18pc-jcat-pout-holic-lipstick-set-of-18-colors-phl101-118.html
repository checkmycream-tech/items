            <li>I put it on and wow, the staying power is impressive.</li>
            <li>Great product I have dark skin and the colors show up great!</li>
            <li>The good news is that a lot of the colors are super pigmented and I didn&#x27;t find them to be oily.</li>
            <li>Okay, I love this assortment because it gave me a lot of options to play with.</li>
            <li>I just started getting into lipstick and these were a big help in letting me know what worked best.</li>
            <li>Of course I have my favorites in the collection, but I am so glad I ordered them.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a pretty good investment if you like playing with makeup</li>
            <li>The lipstick colors are great, but the only reason I gave it 3 stars is because the lipstick breaks off as soon as you use it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m excited to start wearing these lipsticks .theres</li>
            <li>Other wise most of the colors are true.</li>
            <li>Good, solid colors.</li>
            <li>I think it ultimately will save me money because I know which colors are good for me.</li>
            <li>The lighter colors are a bit patchy but other colors are great</li>
            <li>but they are super fun to play around with.</li>
            <li>For the price though you are getting a lipstick for $2.00 while getting the individual ones are like $4.00 or more.</li>
            <li>literally exactly as I saw it online.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing this entire set and giving the more bolder colors away to those</li>
            <li>a whole rainbow an it beats goin to find them in the store !</li>
            <li>She loves doing face makeup for different characters and she needed good quality lipstick in different colors.</li>
            <li>Rouge Artist Intense.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li>They are creamy with a matte look and the colors are very pigmented.</li>
            <li>This are amazing the pigmentation and long lasting</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to experiment and get some fun colors, definitely consider this set.</li>
            <li>That said, I had a lot of problems with the lipstick breaking off at the base of its tube and the lighter colors took more applications to look good.</li>
            <li>Smaller than normal size, but these are not samples.</li>
            <li>The lipsticks are smaller than a normal lipstick and generally lower quality</li>
            <li>The colors here were vibrant, as shown in the pictures, and long lasting.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for high quality, long lasting lipstick, go for a brand name.</li>

            <li> I applied several different colors and the lipstick just falls apart, making a mess.</li>
            <li> Amazon must have taken the feedback to heart because it&#x27;s carefully packed now.  </li>
            <li> I have received full lipstick, but 18 have reached 15 broken and unusable, should improve when packing delicate things like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> The bad news is that the yellow lipstick broke and some of the metallic ones might be a little patchy.</li>
            <li> I was concerned because some reviewers said some of their lipsticks were broken.  </li>
            <li> Some of them were broken but I can still use them.</li>
            <li> I like the lip stick, one of the purples arrived broken</li>
            <li> I received some lipsticks broken.</li>
            <li> none were broken!  </li>
            <li> So obsessed with these colors.</li>

            <li> Good, solid colors. Smaller than normal size, but these are not samples. Only found one broken, but that is a rare possibility even at the store. Will do for the girl trying to express herself</li>
            <li> Love! loved every shade, they all show up beautifully.</li>
            <li> I received the lipsticks today and yay none were broken!  I was concerned because some reviewers said some of their lipsticks were broken.  Amazon must have taken the feedback to heart because it&#x27;s carefully packed now.  Great deal-- get it!</li>
            <li> Great colors.Creamy,covers well.So happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I ordered one in MCM to give it a try and I am impressed. It is matte but not drying. Color is definitely (for the one I have) spot on, literally exactly as I saw it online. I put it on and wow, the staying power is impressive. It really is a nice product. There isn&#x27;t a scent I could smell so that&#x27;s nice. The packaging is like that of NYX which I dislike but I can deal with. I will be purchasing this entire set and giving the more bolder colors away to those I know will wear it well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a lipstick lover with various kinds of high-end lipsticks I would put this one some where between Melt Cosmetics and Make Up Forever Rouge Artist Intense.</li>
            <li> Some of them were broken but I can still use them.</li>
            <li> I like the lip stick, one of the purples arrived broken that&#x27;s why I gave this 4 stars. Thanks for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I have received full lipstick, but 18 have reached 15 broken and unusable, should improve when packing delicate things like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter for her birthday. She loves doing face makeup for different characters and she needed good quality lipstick in different colors. The colors here were vibrant, as shown in the pictures, and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Got these and I&#x27;m excited to start wearing these lipsticks .theres a whole rainbow an it beats goin to find them in the store !</li>

            <li> Okay, I love this assortment because it gave me a lot of options to play with. I think it ultimately will save me money because I know which colors are good for me. The quality of each lipstick differs depending on what type it is (metallic vs matte). That said, I had a lot of problems with the lipstick breaking off at the base of its tube and the lighter colors took more applications to look good. The lipsticks are smaller than a normal lipstick and generally lower quality but they are super fun to play around with. I just started getting into lipstick and these were a big help in letting me know what worked best. If you&#x27;re looking to experiment and get some fun colors, definitely consider this set.
