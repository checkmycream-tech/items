            <li>These things are great for guys and when combined with dove men it is the perfect wash tool to use</li>
            <li>The Axe Detailer isn&#x27;t rocket science, just brilliant marketing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to report that I&#x27;ve been using my Axe Detailer for over two months, and it&#x27;s held up incredibly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, the Axe Detailer Shower Tool is a joy to use.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, is a great showering tool that I tempted to buy another in case</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, is a great showering tool that I tempted to buy another in case</li>
            <li>An attractive yet practical shower tool, minimalistic but hardy design.</li>
            <li>Softer scrub side great for sunburned skin.</li>
            <li>The Axe Detailer Shower Tool is an attractive shower decoration.</li>
            <li>Shower Tool is a great concept, but the execution is way off.</li>
            <li>This was a great scrubber.</li>
            <li>These are great for guys or even gals  </li>
            <li>All in all, a great \\&quot;shower</li>
            <li>Everything was great.</li>
            <li>I think this \\&quot;detailer\\&quot; is great.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t recommend using if you got sun burns though.  LoL.</li>
            <li>the two surfaces are great for men who have a lot to scrub off</li>
            <li>The loofa mesh side works up a great lather, and gets a good scrub going.  </li>
            <li>Forget the brand image -- this product is remarkably adept at cleaning your body!</li>
            <li>Easy to grip and cleans great, definately recommmend!</li>
            <li>I gave it a good workout and it stood up to the test.  </li>
            <li>Whatever shower gel product I&#x27;ve used has worked fairly well, although I&#x27;ve always wished they could improve it.  </li>
            <li>it also looks like a good buy.     </li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Mesh side takes the place of the puff he used before to get a good lather going.  </li>
            <li>Not as good for the environment vs. a loofah since it is man-made, while a loofah is a plant.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>I think this is a good manly version of the shower tool.</li>
            <li>Scrubber is good.  </li>
            <li>It works well, looks good and does the job.  </li>
            <li>Good quality materials and a good price.</li>
            <li>Lathe side and scrub side in a handheld size good grip form, what else can I say?</li>
            <li>good palm grip size.</li>
            <li>Feels good on the feet though.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Appearance wise, this is a hit</li>
            <li>Makes good lather.  </li>
            <li>i got these for a family member and they loved them.</li>
            <li>and I loved the color.</li>
            <li>These have been very effective and nice to have in the shower.</li>
            <li>It looks great and has the pieces needed to scrub more than just your \\&quot;balls\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>great gift for my husband much more manly then puffs I use</li>
            <li>I love it !</li>
            <li>They lather pretty well, not the best.</li>
            <li>God I love Axe!</li>
            <li>Love these shower tool&#x27;s - and everyone I give one of these to as a gift also loves them!</li>
            <li>Works fine and your get four for a great price.</li>
            <li>For years the women in our household have been buying shower sponges, but they just never seemed to be that effective to me.  </li>
            <li>is a nice finishing tool.</li>
            <li>It has a nice lather, I like to use the rougher side as well.</li>
            <li>I use mine with a good body scrub and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>The puffy mesh side works wonderfully and really builds up a nice lather.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too abrasive but does do a nice job exfoliating.</li>
            <li>It rinses well and the cord to hang it from the faucet is a nice, handy, touch.</li>
            <li>He said the mesh side was even better than a puff because it retained more shower gel and still had a great</li>
            <li>And having a two-in-one product like the Axe Shower Tool is nice because</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice scrubber</li>
            <li>Just pick up your own and save the cash.</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>It has a nice design.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of like breaking in a pair of boat shoes,</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own Axe Detailer on it.</li>
            <li>So they did the nice thing and they&#x27;re sending me the rest.</li>
            <li>I thought these would be nice manly loofahs (and I guess they still are) but functionally, they&#x27;re lack-luster.</li>
            <li>In my opinion it is perfect - the gripper and ease of scrubbing yourself clean is just right.</li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li>The handle is comfortable and it does give a good scrub.</li>
            <li>I put mine the dishwasher every 2 monts to get it real clean.</li>
            <li>good item, feels clean after</li>
            <li>and I was sure they did a good job of getting me clean</li>
            <li>Great commercials, smart marketing department,</li>
            <li>This is also a concept used in many \\&quot;bath lines\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Btw, the product works fantastic!</li>
            <li>so she&#x27;s sure to see it.</li>
            <li>Okay, they use sex to sell it; I get that.</li>
            <li>but I think a washrag does a better job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>love them.</li>
            <li>so make sure you check that out.  </li>
            <li>, it does look considerably better hanging in the shower than the purple shower poof</li>
            <li>because it feels better in my hand, is easier to hold, and looks better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big-time shower sponge user and have been for many years.  </li>
            <li>Dove, Gillette, and Axe all have their versions (the Gillette one was the best, but they stopped making it), and they are all basically the same.</li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>I guess to sell more.</li>
            <li>and before I deep-sixed this thing, I decided to give it one more try.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be better off.</li>
            <li>I have not found a use for the &#x27;scrub side&#x27;, the lather side seems to do a better job for either scrubbing or lathering</li>
            <li>It saves time and precious shower storage space</li>
            <li>And I would love to buy again.</li>
            <li>I see no reason to get more of these.  </li>
            <li>The Salux cloth is much better for cleaning nooks and crannies like between the toes.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>Once your order has been submitted, make sure you give Amazon.com a call to confirm that your order will come in a pack of 4 (as mentioned in the product description).</li>
            <li>I like the look of the Axe brand better.</li>
            <li>These things are overpriced but my sons love them</li>
            <li>This was a better deal than buying one at a time.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love using this product...</li>
            <li>Overall, very happy.</li>
            <li>One satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>Soap is OK, and just that.  </li>
            <li>This has much more eye appeal than it does practicality.</li>
            <li>Girls- get one of these for your man, he will love it.</li>
            <li>Guys - pick one up, and you will love it.</li>
            <li>&#x27;The more you know...</li>
            <li>Does as described but more scratchy then over brands which I prefer.</li>
            <li>Would be better suited for cleaning car tires or farm animals.</li>
            <li>It requires around 3-5 times more soap to finish a shower with this thing.  </li>
            <li>I love to scratch</li>
            <li>when i try these  &amp;#34;Axe Detailer Shower&amp;#34; hurt&#x27;s me  especially at first time, however it&#x27;s getting softer when you re-use it many times.</li>
            <li>It would be ok if it didnt happen after 3 showers.</li>
            <li>so basically you have to use more soap.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you do not use this side on your junk.</li>
            <li>While I have not found the detailer part incredibly helpful in my scrubbing routine, I think the black sponge part has held up remarkably well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty abrasive and not too pleasant on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good,</li>
            <li>This item is well worth the money!!</li>
            <li>and it looks new and great.</li>
            <li>I love the grip that they have on the side, it makes it easy so hold on to.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>the more you use it - the more comfortable it becomes.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not using a scrubber or loofa with your body wash, you aren&#x27;t getting clean!  </li>
            <li>Rough scrub side indeed excellent for ground in dirt on hands, feet, etc.</li>
            <li>The axe shower tool is a great way to exfoliate your skin without buying a natural loofah.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much, I plan on getting a scrubbie for me.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re better than the cheaper versions made originally for us ladies.</li>
            <li>little man of a sponge will soak up your favorite manly body wash, and apply with greatest of ease while you still retain your badboy status.</li>
            <li>The grip makes it easy to scrub away and it doesn&#x27;t slip away.  </li>
            <li>The shower tool is easy to hang on to and after you&#x27;re finished, you can hang it on the shower head.  </li>
            <li>It is easier to hold than a standard puff, looks better hanging in the shower, and has a great scrubby pad built in.  </li>
            <li>It is easier to hold than a standard puff, looks better hanging in the shower, and has a great scrubby pad built in.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to hang onto, even when soapy, and lathers well.</li>
            <li>the rubber around the product makes it easy to grasp, squeeze out and hold.</li>
            <li>The Good: The Axe Detailer Shower Tool is great for exfoliating dead skin.</li>
            <li>Seems like they are designed to fall apart easily.</li>
            <li>but this thing is pretty nice.</li>
            <li>I think the product is fine</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want my girlfriend thinking I&#x27;m doing something gay every time I touch myself taking a shower, but this product is specifically designed for guys who have or want a girlfriend.</li>
            <li>Another sold customer for this fine product from Axe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It would be fine if you worked in a coal mine to scrub the coal dust off.</li>
            <li>Easy to handle and perfect for mens heavy scrubing.</li>
            <li>Honestly, when I first saw the commercial for this, my friends and I laughed, believing it to be nothing more than a glorified scrub for men.  </li>
            <li>Best to borrow the little woman&#x27;s skin brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>probably, but it will look cool and you can never be too clean :)</li>
            <li>Although the product isn&#x27;t perfect, it was exactly what I needed to get a deep clean.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t become a huge ball of mesh immediately.</li>
            <li>The grip is nice, but I don&#x27;t get much use out of the rougher scrub side.</li>
            <li>soft girly bright nylon sponges did not feel like they could get the job either.  </li>
            <li>soft girly bright nylon sponges did not feel like they could get the job either.  </li>
            <li>It also is attractive enough.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using this as your primary shower cloth.  </li>
            <li>However, the grip on dove&#x27;s version is not quite as comfortable for my hands.</li>
            <li>Ergonomic, comfortable to hold and use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Scrub side (red) is great for exfoliating, esp.</li>
            <li>Great scrub with 2 different types of scrubbing.</li>
            <li>scraper is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It is NOT of cheap quality.</li>
            <li>Wish it was available years ago.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to have the scrubbing/lathering sides, but too often the later side starts falling apart too soon.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this item paired with the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>These are well made and don&#x27;t seem to be the kind of item that readily needs to be replaced anytime soon.  </li>
            <li>AWESOME for getting off those dead skin cells from the bottoms of your feet.</li>
            <li>this is as light as they come if not even lighter so better not listen to those misleading reviews and give this a try, i guarantee you that it&#x27;s worth the buy.</li>
            <li>Good scrubber so far holding up well.</li>
            <li>It would look very nice in an all white shower.</li>
            <li>It did not appear to be very useful in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Very useful product, must have accessory for shower</li>
            <li>I enjoyed this shower tool from Axe very much.  </li>
            <li>make it easy to hold and better for applying pressure when you&#x27;re really scrubbing.    </li>
            <li>And Yaks fly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But is there anything truly unique about</li>
            <li>only kind my husband uses!</li>
            <li>Travel friendly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty ingenious, but my bottle doesn&#x27;t always stay in place.    </li>
            <li>Axe makes great conditioner called \\&quot;Pure Soft Conditioner\\&quot;</li>
            <li>no matter what my circumstances are now, I know that the detailer is going to get me clean.  </li>
            <li>I read many reviews on how nice this is and finally tested it out.  </li>
            <li>If you have rough skin this will exfoliate as good as anything you could buy not to mention the price is great!I am  extremely  satisfied with this product and reccomend it to anyone looking for a bath scrubber for men.</li>
            <li>The soft side is just a traditional synthetic loofah, but the tighter weave of the scrubbing side is a wonderful addition for rougher skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the shower tool for months now, alternating between it and a regular soap scrunchy, and honestly I like the scrunchy better.  </li>
            <li>can use bar or liquid soap, feel so clean after bath.</li>
            <li>For those who enjoy outdoor sports and/or frequent trips to the gym, this tool will come in handy for getting the sweat and grime off after a workout.&lt;br</li>
            <li>clean</li>
            <li>I do own a couple of these as they work well, but even with my weekly tossing em in the washing machine I don&#x27;t want to use the same one every day forever :)    </li>
            <li>This is basically a more manly pouf, the red scrubby on the front is nice, but I don&#x27;t suggest you scrubbin&#x27; ya privates with it</li>
            <li>The &#x60;directions&#x27; say it gets all those special places (if we all have them are they really so special?)</li>
            <li>If you can find the body wash in the special package it will come with an \\&quot;Axe Shower Hook-Up\\&quot; which is a suction cup thing that&#x27;ll hold your bottle to your shower wall.</li>
            <li>It has ring that keeps the two parts together that feels great in your hand under all circumstances moreso when its wet, slippery with soap, and rubbing it around yourself building up a lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The tool looked so cool</li>
            <li>Only they have outdone the Pet Rock people by making you buy 4 of these things, that are good for nothing but just hanging there, instead of just one.</li>
            <li>the mesh side works up a good lather and the red scrub side</li>
            <li>You know, actually this is a good idea.</li>
            <li>Asthetically, it is very homely looking, more like something you would scrub a car with.</li>
            <li>kinda cool -</li>
            <li>really I can&#x27;t imagine needing more than two of these within a year or even two years.  </li>
            <li>First of all, he can keep it nearby in the shower, easily hanging from the shower head with the attached rope.</li>
            <li>The handle section gives it a more masculine appeal, but honestly this is just like any normal bath scrubbing device.  </li>
            <li>This is strictly for those in the market for a super scrubber to use once in a while.</li>
            <li>The Axe Detailer Shower Tool is a perfect example of this as it is rather obviously just another lowly [[ASIN:B000GCAJB2 Foaming Shower Pouf]]... with a sex change.  </li>
            <li>Should&#x27;ve read the reviews first!</li>
            <li>I totally stole it from him as my legs get really ichy in the wintertime and the scrubby side felt great and worked wonderfully to get all the loose dry skin off.</li>
            <li>The tool itself fits perfectly in my palm and is simple to use (I&#x27;m male and have large hands, FYI).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thought I was getting a great deal for 4 of these but instead spent way too much just for 1.</li>
            <li>This 2-sided cleanser (red cushion scrub side and black mesh lather side) gets the job done quick, easy but most important, effectively.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The mesh material used to make it does a good job without being overly rough.</li>
            <li>It was worth it for me.</li>
            <li>Women won&#x27;t find this tool useful as a man would.</li>
            <li>/&gt;And, being honest here, when it comes to cleaning my \\&quot;private parts\\&quot;, fugheddaboudit!!&lt;br /&gt;Not even close.</li>
            <li>The marketing makes it seem useful, but the \\&quot;detailer\\&quot; is useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Summary: A man&#x27;s body is different and more rugged and therefore needs a different kind of tool to clean it.</li>
            <li>It dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend originally bought these and he really digs them.</li>
            <li>Right.</li>
            <li>and I would think it would get it right off.  </li>
            <li>And we all know loofahs are for girls, right?  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>It would be great for removing paint, tar, or glue from tougher parts of your body, but is very coarse for general shower use.</li>
            <li>but I suppose that the best analogy would be comparing it mildly browned toast - its firm enough</li>
            <li>Dove for Men has a version of this too - it&#x27;s just as good but for now only comes in a light blue color.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to scrub away as hard as you need to without worrying about the thing falling apart.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as attractive hanging against my blue and yellow tile.</li>
            <li>This makes it easier to hold, but compressible so that a good lather can be worked up from the black colored shower</li>
            <li>only the the handle which kind of resembls a tire is much easier to hold onto and keep a grip.</li>
            <li>The price is fair, and I like flipping it over for the coarse side for my feet - and the soft side for everywhere else.</li>
            <li>I really do feel more energized and clean, especially after I run / workout.  </li>
            <li>because it is most likely hanging from your shower head right now.  </li>
            <li>Well, this Axe Detailer Shower Tool has some excellent improvements--an easy-to-grip rubber handle and this extra stiff scrubber side that gets off the tougher dirt.  </li>
            <li>My husband uses this and likes it very much.......</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s not like sandpaper because that would hurt, but it is great for spots that are really hard to get off.  </li>
            <li>This means you wont get as clean as when its new.  </li>
            <li>Much better than a regular loofa.  </li>
            <li>Like most Axe products I&#x27;ve tried, this is a mixed bag.  </li>
            <li>The pouf side is surprisingly MUCH more abrasive than a regular shower pouf.  </li>
            <li>When you first use this body scrubber, you will notice just how aggressive it is.  </li>
            <li>So already I like this better than the traditional poof,</li>
            <li>I got my first one almost 2 years ago</li>
            <li>My first one looks like the day I got it.</li>
            <li>Thirty seconds into my first attempt at using this thing</li>
            <li>The first time using it, the mesh side is a bit</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy an Axe Detailer the first time I saw it.  </li>
            <li>see this for about 3 bucks each at Target and having used it, would most likely buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Elastic lanyard is pretty sturdy as well.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>It looks nice and works well, there&#x27;s not much to say about it.</li>
            <li>The mesh side does lather nice, but can be a bit rough on the skin as well.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I have always felt that these sponge scrubbers were kind of girly and for the most part weak.</li>
            <li>but honestly I can&#x27;t figure out what to do with the other leftovers.  </li>
            <li>soft and clean up all body.</li>
            <li>About only negative is that is best you use a body wash with an anti-bacteria quality</li>
            <li>About only negative is that is best you use a body wash with an anti-bacteria quality</li>
            <li>But, what really threw it over the top for me is the red scrubby pad on the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than this, I have no complaints and have happily changed my daily routine to include using this shower accessory.</li>
            <li>He uses the puff traditionally, and says the other side is great for his hands, or stubborn dirt spots.</li>
            <li>: Seems to require more soap than my older loofah to get proper lather.  </li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need to replace it when the mesh wears down, unless you own this product.    </li>
            <li>It is not nearly as easy or effective to use as a basic scrungee, it also took more liquid soap to lather up.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the big puffy shower things, which is really the only way to get good lather with modern liquid shower soaps and gels.  </li>
            <li>The other side,the really rough scrubber,works great for feet and hands and does clean skin that a normal wash cloth can&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if my skin is super sensitive or not, but it hurts to use this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thankfully, it is smaller than it appears in the pictures, so it is easy to hold and maneuver.  </li>
            <li>The Axe Detailer Shower Tool comes in an easy open package.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for getting dirt, oils, and, yes, green grass stains off of the soles of feet, toes, elbows, palms, and other tougher areas of the skin (it does tickle a bit!).  </li>
            <li>It is perfect for getting dirt, oils, and, yes, green grass stains off of the soles of feet, toes, elbows, palms, and other tougher areas of the skin (it does tickle a bit!).  </li>
            <li>A great replacement for the standard combo of shower poof and loofah, and takes up less space.</li>
            <li>A great replacement for the standard combo of shower poof and loofah, and takes up less space.</li>
            <li>Again, buy this if you can&#x27;t get dirt off using a regular cloth or loofa and want something to fine detail those spots.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s finally a decent shower gel sponge on the market for guys!  </li>
            <li>The tightness of the bundle wears of in about 6 months, but it&#x27;s pretty decent.</li>
            <li>The rubber disc is too large to fit comfortably in a regular sized hand.</li>
            <li>Very misleading title.</li>
            <li>The Axe Detailer Shower Tool really doesn&#x27;t miss a thing.</li>
            <li>I use this side to really scrub and exfoliate places (which already have suds from the loofa side) that can handle it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>why am I even thinking about this thing this much?</li>
            <li>When used with the AXE shower gel (or your choice really)</li>
            <li>Points radiate out to comfortably hold in the hand, along with a standard loop for post-wash hang-up to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It came with a pack of four for a reasonable price</li>
            <li>But you don&#x27;t really need AXE gel for this product.  </li>
            <li>Although he isn&#x27;t into the Axe body sprays as much as he used to be, my son was eager to try this product as soon as he saw it.</li>
            <li>It works very well for that purpose.  </li>
            <li>Works very well for the price.  </li>
            <li>and I was ready to toss it into the nearest trash receptacle.</li>
            <li>This is really a fancy version of a mesh sponge/loofah.</li>
            <li>If you are used to using loofahs then you will love the addition of a harder scrubbing section.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it would make that much of a difference</li>
            <li>I love it and anyone who does labor work like myself such as warehouse or construction work, you will really enjoy the rough side of the tool for your feet.</li>
            <li>Plus, I wonder do we really need another plastic bath accessory?  </li>
            <li>BUT, it doesn&#x27;t really remove calluses.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the fact that the loofah part of the Detailer is sewn in, it lasts MUCH longer without falling apart.</li>
            <li>mesh side lathers up real quick&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>and I love the rough scrubbing surface which is why I&#x27;m giving it five stars.</li>
            <li>This product is really a loofah.  </li>
            <li>This is a dupe, and is very misleading.</li>
            <li>because real men perfume themselves and use sandpaper on their elbows.  </li>
            <li>You can give two of shower tool to your family member like what i did, so they can thanks you when they use it too.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like these.</li>
            <li>I started getting into the Dr. Bronners liquid soaps, and you really need a loofah to apply them.</li>
            <li>The red side is more like a fuzzy, soft, spongey pillow.</li>
            <li>I approve of this product, and my ultimate goal is to have 7 bottles of different Axe Shower Gel, each on their own Axe Shower</li>
            <li>However, definitely try sticking with the tool even if the first few uses aren&#x27;t too pleasant.</li>
            <li>The most important thing however, is that it actually makes it easier for him to get off any dirt, grime or other stuff - and do it in record time.</li>
            <li>I like the addition of two sides, which is handy for scrubbing deep when using the rougher flat side to exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Of course, kitchen sponges have functioned like this for many years with one side for scrubbing and the other for lathering up.</li>
            <li>But, that is niether here-nor-there, the Detailer is an effective bathing tool, it doesn&#x27;t miss a thing, a soft mesh side for your general washing and a coarser side for the \\&quot;dirtier spots\\&quot; feet and hands and such.  </li>
            <li>Axe scrubber is so much better than the other brands.</li>
            <li>That makes things easy, allows it to dry off between uses,etc.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel like I am getting extra clean.</li>
            <li>While the Shower Tool is designed to be gripped, and each side is designed for the intensity of scrub desired, I&#x27;m more inclined for something more minimal and less (gender) overdetermined.  </li>
            <li>Recently, I had the chance to try one, and I guess the adage about how one shouldn&#x27;t judge a book by its cover (or in this case, a shower tool by its ad) is still true.  </li>
            <li>The stiff nylon sponge will easily scour off the grime of irregular bathing or a days&#x27; worth of work if you work a blue-collar job.</li>
            <li>Skin brushing (dry or wet) is very good for your overall health, as it assists you body&#x27;s natural detox process.</li>
            <li>The rougher side is great for buffing, not eliminating those trouble rough spots on your body, IE knees, elbows and soles of the feet.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t go back to regular loofas for sure.  </li>
            <li>but after a few uses you really get used to it and feel more</li>
            <li>Well satisfied with this product, will definitely buy these goodies next time I run out.</li>
            <li>,LUCKY I gave it 2 Stars, I guess I gave the extra star for Axe&#x27;s \\&quot;EFFORT\\&quot; to make</li>
            <li>Unfortunately those pieces don&#x27;t fit well enough together as one apparatus; it&#x27;s just too bulky and unwieldy to get into certain areas that you want to clean the most.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It looks a little more manly hanging in the shower and does give some scrubbing options.  </li>
            <li>They need mesh to expand a little more.</li>
            <li>Axe recommends you replace it every 4-6 weeks, I toss mine in the washing machine once a week with a little color safe bleach and some Tide.</li>
            <li>He likes the rubber grip it has that allows him to scrub hard and the buffing side is nice.</li>
            <li>There is a rough side on the detailer, perfect for hard to remove and stubborn dirt stains.. and a softer side for daily showers and</li>
            <li>The masculine design of the Axe Detailer Shower Tool is geared for manly men, though I wonder if guys would really want something like this.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t get the mountains of suds you would get with a normal pouf.</li>
            <li>normal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case</li>
            <li>After a few weeks it loosens up a bit and feels much better on the skin, like a loofa should.</li>
            <li>: Easier to grip than a normal loofah.  </li>
            <li>pros - the &#x27;soft&#x27; dark scrubber side leaves skin feeling cleaner and more exfoliated.  </li>
            <li>good marketing, not a great idea.  </li>
            <li>In short...a cheap synthetic loofa-wannabe will do the total job better than this will, will probably be a bit cheaper and you can just get one in black if you&#x27;re worried it doesn&#x27;t look manly enough.</li>
            <li>Multiple colors make it easy to differentiate for showers with multiple users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Same results except that this time my axe detailer went right into the trash.</li>
            <li>only thing they got right is, it&#x27;s a detail</li>
            <li>Salux or other brand flat nylon mesh cloths are superior IMHO for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The new Axe Detailer is just what is says it is...a \\&quot;shower</li>
            <li>Of course, the packaging tells you to buy a new one every month.  </li>
            <li>I think it is fantastic that someone finally came out with a male version of a bath puff.</li>
            <li>Strong, sturdy, and long lasting!</li>
            <li>The others don&#x27;t seem to last more than a few weeks, this one is very sturdy and &amp;#34;built for a man&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The shower tool&#x27;s red abrasive \\&quot;scrubbing\\&quot; surface is not much more effective at cleaning the body&#x27;s extremities than normal scrubbing alone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the price of these on Amazon is not super cheap, it is in line with a sale in a store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gone are the lovely pastels, replaced by a manly black and red.  </li>
            <li>Not only did it get his skin good and clean, but he has phoresis (dry, flaky skin) and the hard scrubbie side made his dry patches VERY, VERY, soft.</li>
            <li>I have seen similar nylon sponges made for women that behave like large cotton balls in everyway but this Axe brand tool truly is made for men because you WILL feel it.  </li>
            <li>The red side has the texture of a steel pan scrubber - only softer, and it works great for tough jobs, as advertised.  </li>
            <li>rubber outer edge is soft, and feels like the polyurethane that inflatable pool floats are made from more than the hard rubber of a car tire.  </li>
            <li>The soft side is soft enough not to feel like sand paper yet hard enough to give a good exfoliation.</li>
            <li>It sounds like a great idea, but this thing is just awkward to use.  </li>
            <li>Now Axe has developed a shower sponge with a sturdy grip.  </li>
            <li>Axe Body Detailing Shower tool is essentially a nylon sponge marketed for men and intended to be used with the Axe brand of body washes (the liquid soap alternative to the ubiquitous bar) but really any body wash will do.  </li>
            <li>I saw that this so-called \\&quot;shower tool\\&quot; had one part(a soft poof)for</li>
            <li>, overall I really like this \\&quot;detailing tool for bodies.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>So, overall I really like this \\&quot;detailing tool for bodies.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>, scrub side has scrubbing power of soft washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve all used those \\&quot;poofy\\&quot; scubbers that use shower gel instead of bar soap (at least many of us have).  </li>
            <li>As a shower scrubby, it is too rigid, does not conform to &#x27;body parts&#x27; comfortably, and is not comfortable to hold for a period of time in your hand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m soft now.</li>
            <li>far as quality goes, I like the material.</li>
            <li>It has 2 sides, a soft loofa and a scrubber loofa.</li>
            <li>The 4 pack offers a convenient buying method</li>
            <li>unless you&#x27;re an oompa loompa or have the grip strength of a 98 year old woman with arthritis who bathes in WD40, I can&#x27;t see how anyone could not grip this thing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Buy a regular shower scrubber, and an abrasive one if you really need it.  </li>
            <li>While you&#x27;re at it, buy some soap or shower gel that doesn&#x27;t play into our culture&#x27;s masculine insecurities to sell a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Axe -</li>
            <li>If you have tender or sensitive skin, then I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for those areas.</li>
            <li>In short, typical high energy teen with a love of the outdoors and sports.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A pack of 4 will last you 6 months, so right off the back</li>
            <li>Not only is it compact, but it has two sides (a soft side for the sensitive areas) and a rough part to clean the heels and palms.  </li>
            <li>Unlike some other reviewers here, I never had a problem with how they look, though they do have a distinctly feminine air about them, even if you don&#x27;t go for the pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the red and black motif, and the rough scrub side and gentle lather side gets the job done.</li>
            <li>The soft mesh are a dime a dozen at any wal-mart and the rough side does the exact job a hand towel can do.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;poofy\\&quot; side is little more than a big knot of mesh that could be purchased at my local \\&quot;Dollar-General\\</li>
            <li>Natural loofahs seem to work better but are usually hard to hold onto, especially when they&#x27;re loaded up with soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;For those with sensitive skin, you may not like the texture of the Axe Shower Tool in the beginning, but after a few uses, you&#x27;ll likely start to enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this and tried it and it feels pretty rough on my skin.</li>
            <li>The advertisement talks about a &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; side when both sides are pretty rough.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty rough.  </li>
            <li>first I thought I would have to add soap to the red pad to use it, but the lather from the poof behind it squeezes right through it, so if you&#x27;ve been using the rest of the tool, the scrubby is all soaped up and ready to go.  </li>
            <li>This is slightly more expensive than a $3 loofah, but lasts much longer.</li>
            <li>About the size of a grapefruit cut in half, it has two distinct features: a spongy coil of nylon for general cleaning and a multi-colored scrubber</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s in black and red, and not those fruity pink and violet colors that seem more suited to women.  </li>
            <li>Overall, the design of the tool is geared towards males, but its function is no more effective than any other loofah on the market.</li>
            <li>Plus, unlike a regular loofah, it seems like it would be less likely to have bacteria grow quickly since it isn&#x27;t a natural product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Title clearly says 4 pack and only received 1.</li>
            <li>I go through shower poofs so fast because they get big and stretched out.</li>
            <li>that you immediate feel it yet soft enough that it will yield to your skin.  </li>
            <li>Scrubber\\&quot; added to one side that allows you to really \\&quot;get in\\&quot; to those parts that you want to well, scrub harder at.  </li>
            <li>A rubber tire grip allows you to apply masculine force and direction to the problem while the red pad provides exfoliation for those men who need it.  </li>
            <li>Apparently.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t foam nearly as well as a standard loofah for a given amount of soap --</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use the scrubby side much because it&#x27;s too rough.</li>
            <li>but when I started to use the Axe Body shower tool and dried myself afterwards, I got into a level of cleanliness - a distinct smell and feel - that</li>
            <li>:  The lather side is a bit more scrubby, the scrub side of dove&#x27;s version is also a bit tougher, but still not great.  </li>
            <li>The poof part is fine, but just very small.  </li>
            <li>tool consists of a vinyl mesh faux loufah gathered and attached to a large rubber disc with a finer vinyl weave attached to the other side.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;fluff side\\&quot; is harsh, and doesn&#x27;t get where you need it too, easily</li>
            <li>The other side is soft, for more delicate areas.  </li>
            <li>At first the red side was very rough on my skin</li>
            <li>All in all a great product but a little expensive if you are used to buying 0.85 loofahs from Walmart.</li>
            <li>I thought I was just purchasing one, and even for the price, I didn&#x27;t think much of it because it was on par with all the other shower tools I looked at.</li>
            <li>It does create a nice lather with liquid soaps (which I dislike as they tend to leave a slimy residue) but it is no good for washing your back and a bit rough for your face.  </li>
            <li>The tough scrubber side is good for rubbing dead skin off your feet and ankles, or for scrubbing paint and stuff off your body, and that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>Axe detailer has two distinct parts -- the regular bath sponge part in black and the red \\&quot;detailer\\&quot; that is for the rougher parts of the body like feet and elbows.  </li>
            <li>I realized I won&#x27;t be able to use this everyday, its just too harsh.  </li>
            <li>I say that anyone who is a little interested in this product just needs to try it.</li>
            <li>P. Logue, 2008ad to use it, but the lather from the poof behind it squeezes right through it, so if you&#x27;ve been using the rest of the tool, the scrubby is all soaped up and ready to go.  </li>
            <li>One side is similar to a loofa, except much denser, and the other side is a rougher material for scrubbing.  </li>
            <li>Wow - I can&#x27;t believe it took this long for a product like this to be made.</li>
            <li>When you first use one of these tools, the loofa side is a bit harsh.</li>
            <li>He likes that there is a rough side along with the normal loofa.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;handest\\&quot; bit about the Detailer is the hard rubber that separates the hard and soft sides of the tool, this serves as and effective grip for washing, one you can&#x27;t get with a simple mesh thingy from a \\&quot;bath\\&quot; store.</li>
            <li>you guys can really get down and scrub your skin.</li>
            <li>The disc is so large that it does hot allow scrubbing behind or inside the ears.</li>
            <li>It actually does look very much like a car detailing tool, with the black and red color scheme and the \\&quot;tire\\&quot; ring around the outside edge.  </li>
            <li>They are also rather durable - as an experiment, I used the same scrub daily for over half a year, and only after did the soft side start to separate from the main shell.  </li>
            <li>Now I am rather active man who can build up a layer sweat with my outdoor work and can easily find an excuse not to shower everyday but</li>
            <li>I have big hands, but have had trouble gripping these things in the past...</li>

            <li> It isn&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li> Axe Recovery also smells VERY GOOD.  </li>
            <li> These things are great for guys and when combined with dove men it is the perfect wash tool to use</li>
            <li> The Axe Detailer isn&#x27;t rocket science, just brilliant marketing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to report that I&#x27;ve been using my Axe Detailer for over two months, and it&#x27;s held up incredibly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , the Axe Detailer Shower Tool is a joy to use.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great.</li>

            <li> Nevertheless, is a great showering tool that I tempted to buy another in case</li>
            <li> An attractive yet practical shower tool, minimalistic but hardy design.</li>
            <li> Softer scrub side great for sunburned skin.</li>
            <li> The Axe Detailer Shower Tool is an attractive shower decoration.</li>
            <li> Shower Tool is a great concept, but the execution is way off.</li>
            <li> This was a great scrubber.</li>
            <li> These are great for guys or even gals  </li>
            <li> All in all, a great \\&quot;shower</li>
            <li> Everything was great.</li>
            <li> I think this \\&quot;detailer\\&quot; is great.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t recommend using if you got sun burns though.  LoL.</li>
            <li> the two surfaces are great for men who have a lot to scrub off</li>
            <li> The loofa mesh side works up a great lather, and gets a good scrub going.  </li>
            <li> Forget the brand image -- this product is remarkably adept at cleaning your body!</li>
            <li> Easy to grip and cleans great, definately recommmend!</li>
            <li> I gave it a good workout and it stood up to the test.  </li>
            <li> Whatever shower gel product I&#x27;ve used has worked fairly well, although I&#x27;ve always wished they could improve it.  </li>
            <li> it also looks like a good buy.     </li>
            <li> This is a good product.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Mesh side takes the place of the puff he used before to get a good lather going.  </li>
            <li> Not as good for the environment vs. a loofah since it is man-made, while a loofah is a plant.</li>
            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good manly version of the shower tool.</li>
            <li> Scrubber is good.  </li>
            <li> It works well, looks good and does the job.  </li>
            <li> Good quality materials and a good price.</li>
            <li> Lathe side and scrub side in a handheld size good grip form, what else can I say?</li>
            <li> good palm grip size.</li>
            <li> Feels good on the feet though.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Appearance wise, this is a hit</li>
            <li> Makes good lather.  </li>
            <li> i got these for a family member and they loved them.</li>
            <li> and I loved the color.</li>
            <li> These have been very effective and nice to have in the shower.</li>
            <li> It looks great and has the pieces needed to scrub more than just your \\&quot;balls\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> great gift for my husband much more manly then puffs I use</li>
            <li> I love it !</li>
            <li> They lather pretty well, not the best.</li>
            <li> God I love Axe!</li>
            <li> Love these shower tool&#x27;s - and everyone I give one of these to as a gift also loves them!</li>
            <li> Works fine and your get four for a great price.</li>
            <li> For years the women in our household have been buying shower sponges, but they just never seemed to be that effective to me.  </li>
            <li> is a nice finishing tool.</li>
            <li> It has a nice lather, I like to use the rougher side as well.</li>
            <li> I use mine with a good body scrub and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> The puffy mesh side works wonderfully and really builds up a nice lather.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too abrasive but does do a nice job exfoliating.</li>
            <li> It rinses well and the cord to hang it from the faucet is a nice, handy, touch.</li>
            <li> He said the mesh side was even better than a puff because it retained more shower gel and still had a great</li>
            <li> And having a two-in-one product like the Axe Shower Tool is nice because</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice scrubber</li>
            <li> Just pick up your own and save the cash.</li>
            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> I liked it.</li>
            <li> It has a nice design.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of like breaking in a pair of boat shoes,</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own Axe Detailer on it.</li>
            <li> So they did the nice thing and they&#x27;re sending me the rest.</li>
            <li> I thought these would be nice manly loofahs (and I guess they still are) but functionally, they&#x27;re lack-luster.</li>
            <li> In my opinion it is perfect - the gripper and ease of scrubbing yourself clean is just right.</li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li> The handle is comfortable and it does give a good scrub.</li>
            <li> I put mine the dishwasher every 2 monts to get it real clean.</li>
            <li> good item, feels clean after</li>
            <li> and I was sure they did a good job of getting me clean</li>
            <li> Great commercials, smart marketing department,</li>
            <li> This is also a concept used in many \\&quot;bath lines\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Btw, the product works fantastic!</li>
            <li> so she&#x27;s sure to see it.</li>
            <li> Okay, they use sex to sell it; I get that.</li>
            <li> but I think a washrag does a better job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> love them.</li>
            <li> so make sure you check that out.  </li>
            <li> , it does look considerably better hanging in the shower than the purple shower poof</li>
            <li> because it feels better in my hand, is easier to hold, and looks better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big-time shower sponge user and have been for many years.  </li>
            <li> Dove, Gillette, and Axe all have their versions (the Gillette one was the best, but they stopped making it), and they are all basically the same.</li>
            <li> I LOVE</li>
            <li> I guess to sell more.</li>
            <li> and before I deep-sixed this thing, I decided to give it one more try.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be better off.</li>
            <li> I have not found a use for the &#x27;scrub side&#x27;, the lather side seems to do a better job for either scrubbing or lathering</li>
            <li> It saves time and precious shower storage space</li>
            <li> And I would love to buy again.</li>
            <li> I see no reason to get more of these.  </li>
            <li> The Salux cloth is much better for cleaning nooks and crannies like between the toes.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> Once your order has been submitted, make sure you give Amazon.com a call to confirm that your order will come in a pack of 4 (as mentioned in the product description).</li>
            <li> I like the look of the Axe brand better.</li>
            <li> These things are overpriced but my sons love them</li>
            <li> This was a better deal than buying one at a time.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love using this product...</li>
            <li> Overall, very happy.</li>
            <li> One satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Soap is OK, and just that.  </li>
            <li> This has much more eye appeal than it does practicality.</li>
            <li> Girls- get one of these for your man, he will love it.</li>
            <li> Guys - pick one up, and you will love it.</li>
            <li> &#x27;The more you know...</li>
            <li> Does as described but more scratchy then over brands which I prefer.</li>
            <li> Would be better suited for cleaning car tires or farm animals.</li>
            <li> It requires around 3-5 times more soap to finish a shower with this thing.  </li>
            <li> I love to scratch</li>
            <li> when i try these  &amp;#34;Axe Detailer Shower&amp;#34; hurt&#x27;s me  especially at first time, however it&#x27;s getting softer when you re-use it many times.</li>
            <li> It would be ok if it didnt happen after 3 showers.</li>
            <li> so basically you have to use more soap.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you do not use this side on your junk.</li>
            <li> While I have not found the detailer part incredibly helpful in my scrubbing routine, I think the black sponge part has held up remarkably well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty abrasive and not too pleasant on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good,</li>
            <li> This item is well worth the money!!</li>
            <li> and it looks new and great.</li>
            <li> I love the grip that they have on the side, it makes it easy so hold on to.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> the more you use it - the more comfortable it becomes.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not using a scrubber or loofa with your body wash, you aren&#x27;t getting clean!  </li>
            <li> Rough scrub side indeed excellent for ground in dirt on hands, feet, etc.</li>
            <li> The axe shower tool is a great way to exfoliate your skin without buying a natural loofah.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much, I plan on getting a scrubbie for me.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re better than the cheaper versions made originally for us ladies.</li>
            <li> little man of a sponge will soak up your favorite manly body wash, and apply with greatest of ease while you still retain your badboy status.</li>
            <li> The grip makes it easy to scrub away and it doesn&#x27;t slip away.  </li>
            <li> The shower tool is easy to hang on to and after you&#x27;re finished, you can hang it on the shower head.  </li>
            <li> It is easier to hold than a standard puff, looks better hanging in the shower, and has a great scrubby pad built in.  </li>
            <li> It is easier to hold than a standard puff, looks better hanging in the shower, and has a great scrubby pad built in.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to hang onto, even when soapy, and lathers well.</li>
            <li> the rubber around the product makes it easy to grasp, squeeze out and hold.</li>
            <li> The Good: The Axe Detailer Shower Tool is great for exfoliating dead skin.</li>
            <li> Seems like they are designed to fall apart easily.</li>
            <li> but this thing is pretty nice.</li>
            <li> I think the product is fine</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want my girlfriend thinking I&#x27;m doing something gay every time I touch myself taking a shower, but this product is specifically designed for guys who have or want a girlfriend.</li>
            <li> Another sold customer for this fine product from Axe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It would be fine if you worked in a coal mine to scrub the coal dust off.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle and perfect for mens heavy scrubing.</li>
            <li> Honestly, when I first saw the commercial for this, my friends and I laughed, believing it to be nothing more than a glorified scrub for men.  </li>
            <li> Best to borrow the little woman&#x27;s skin brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> probably, but it will look cool and you can never be too clean :)</li>
            <li> Although the product isn&#x27;t perfect, it was exactly what I needed to get a deep clean.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t become a huge ball of mesh immediately.</li>
            <li> The grip is nice, but I don&#x27;t get much use out of the rougher scrub side.</li>
            <li> soft girly bright nylon sponges did not feel like they could get the job either.  </li>
            <li> soft girly bright nylon sponges did not feel like they could get the job either.  </li>
            <li> It also is attractive enough.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using this as your primary shower cloth.  </li>
            <li> However, the grip on dove&#x27;s version is not quite as comfortable for my hands.</li>
            <li> Ergonomic, comfortable to hold and use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Scrub side (red) is great for exfoliating, esp.</li>
            <li> Great scrub with 2 different types of scrubbing.</li>
            <li> scraper is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It is NOT of cheap quality.</li>
            <li> Wish it was available years ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to have the scrubbing/lathering sides, but too often the later side starts falling apart too soon.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this item paired with the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> These are well made and don&#x27;t seem to be the kind of item that readily needs to be replaced anytime soon.  </li>
            <li> AWESOME for getting off those dead skin cells from the bottoms of your feet.</li>
            <li> this is as light as they come if not even lighter so better not listen to those misleading reviews and give this a try, i guarantee you that it&#x27;s worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Good scrubber so far holding up well.</li>
            <li> It would look very nice in an all white shower.</li>
            <li> It did not appear to be very useful in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Very useful product, must have accessory for shower</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this shower tool from Axe very much.  </li>
            <li> make it easy to hold and better for applying pressure when you&#x27;re really scrubbing.    </li>
            <li> And Yaks fly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But is there anything truly unique about</li>
            <li> only kind my husband uses!</li>
            <li> Travel friendly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty ingenious, but my bottle doesn&#x27;t always stay in place.    </li>
            <li> Axe makes great conditioner called \\&quot;Pure Soft Conditioner\\&quot;</li>
            <li> no matter what my circumstances are now, I know that the detailer is going to get me clean.  </li>
            <li> I read many reviews on how nice this is and finally tested it out.  </li>
            <li> If you have rough skin this will exfoliate as good as anything you could buy not to mention the price is great!I am  extremely  satisfied with this product and reccomend it to anyone looking for a bath scrubber for men.</li>
            <li> The soft side is just a traditional synthetic loofah, but the tighter weave of the scrubbing side is a wonderful addition for rougher skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the shower tool for months now, alternating between it and a regular soap scrunchy, and honestly I like the scrunchy better.  </li>
            <li> can use bar or liquid soap, feel so clean after bath.</li>
            <li> For those who enjoy outdoor sports and/or frequent trips to the gym, this tool will come in handy for getting the sweat and grime off after a workout.&lt;br</li>
            <li> clean</li>
            <li> I do own a couple of these as they work well, but even with my weekly tossing em in the washing machine I don&#x27;t want to use the same one every day forever :)    </li>
            <li> This is basically a more manly pouf, the red scrubby on the front is nice, but I don&#x27;t suggest you scrubbin&#x27; ya privates with it</li>
            <li> The &#x60;directions&#x27; say it gets all those special places (if we all have them are they really so special?)</li>
            <li> If you can find the body wash in the special package it will come with an \\&quot;Axe Shower Hook-Up\\&quot; which is a suction cup thing that&#x27;ll hold your bottle to your shower wall.</li>
            <li> It has ring that keeps the two parts together that feels great in your hand under all circumstances moreso when its wet, slippery with soap, and rubbing it around yourself building up a lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The tool looked so cool</li>
            <li> Only they have outdone the Pet Rock people by making you buy 4 of these things, that are good for nothing but just hanging there, instead of just one.</li>
            <li> the mesh side works up a good lather and the red scrub side</li>
            <li> You know, actually this is a good idea.</li>
            <li> Asthetically, it is very homely looking, more like something you would scrub a car with.</li>
            <li> kinda cool -</li>
            <li> really I can&#x27;t imagine needing more than two of these within a year or even two years.  </li>
            <li> First of all, he can keep it nearby in the shower, easily hanging from the shower head with the attached rope.</li>
            <li> The handle section gives it a more masculine appeal, but honestly this is just like any normal bath scrubbing device.  </li>
            <li> This is strictly for those in the market for a super scrubber to use once in a while.</li>
            <li> The Axe Detailer Shower Tool is a perfect example of this as it is rather obviously just another lowly [[ASIN:B000GCAJB2 Foaming Shower Pouf]]... with a sex change.  </li>
            <li> Should&#x27;ve read the reviews first!</li>
            <li> I totally stole it from him as my legs get really ichy in the wintertime and the scrubby side felt great and worked wonderfully to get all the loose dry skin off.</li>
            <li> The tool itself fits perfectly in my palm and is simple to use (I&#x27;m male and have large hands, FYI).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Thought I was getting a great deal for 4 of these but instead spent way too much just for 1.</li>
            <li> This 2-sided cleanser (red cushion scrub side and black mesh lather side) gets the job done quick, easy but most important, effectively.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The mesh material used to make it does a good job without being overly rough.</li>
            <li> It was worth it for me.</li>
            <li> Women won&#x27;t find this tool useful as a man would.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And, being honest here, when it comes to cleaning my \\&quot;private parts\\&quot;, fugheddaboudit!!&lt;br /&gt;Not even close.</li>
            <li> The marketing makes it seem useful, but the \\&quot;detailer\\&quot; is useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Summary: A man&#x27;s body is different and more rugged and therefore needs a different kind of tool to clean it.</li>
            <li> It dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend originally bought these and he really digs them.</li>
            <li> Right.</li>
            <li> and I would think it would get it right off.  </li>
            <li> And we all know loofahs are for girls, right?  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right</li>
            <li> It would be great for removing paint, tar, or glue from tougher parts of your body, but is very coarse for general shower use.</li>
            <li> but I suppose that the best analogy would be comparing it mildly browned toast - its firm enough</li>
            <li> Dove for Men has a version of this too - it&#x27;s just as good but for now only comes in a light blue color.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to be able to scrub away as hard as you need to without worrying about the thing falling apart.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as attractive hanging against my blue and yellow tile.</li>
            <li> This makes it easier to hold, but compressible so that a good lather can be worked up from the black colored shower</li>
            <li> only the the handle which kind of resembls a tire is much easier to hold onto and keep a grip.</li>
            <li> The price is fair, and I like flipping it over for the coarse side for my feet - and the soft side for everywhere else.</li>
            <li> I really do feel more energized and clean, especially after I run / workout.  </li>
            <li> because it is most likely hanging from your shower head right now.  </li>
            <li> Well, this Axe Detailer Shower Tool has some excellent improvements--an easy-to-grip rubber handle and this extra stiff scrubber side that gets off the tougher dirt.  </li>
            <li> My husband uses this and likes it very much.......</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s not like sandpaper because that would hurt, but it is great for spots that are really hard to get off.  </li>
            <li> This means you wont get as clean as when its new.  </li>
            <li> Much better than a regular loofa.  </li>
            <li> Like most Axe products I&#x27;ve tried, this is a mixed bag.  </li>
            <li> The pouf side is surprisingly MUCH more abrasive than a regular shower pouf.  </li>
            <li> When you first use this body scrubber, you will notice just how aggressive it is.  </li>
            <li> So already I like this better than the traditional poof,</li>
            <li> I got my first one almost 2 years ago</li>
            <li> My first one looks like the day I got it.</li>
            <li> Thirty seconds into my first attempt at using this thing</li>
            <li> The first time using it, the mesh side is a bit</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy an Axe Detailer the first time I saw it.  </li>
            <li> see this for about 3 bucks each at Target and having used it, would most likely buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Elastic lanyard is pretty sturdy as well.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> It looks nice and works well, there&#x27;s not much to say about it.</li>
            <li> The mesh side does lather nice, but can be a bit rough on the skin as well.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I have always felt that these sponge scrubbers were kind of girly and for the most part weak.</li>
            <li> but honestly I can&#x27;t figure out what to do with the other leftovers.  </li>
            <li> soft and clean up all body.</li>
            <li> About only negative is that is best you use a body wash with an anti-bacteria quality</li>
            <li> About only negative is that is best you use a body wash with an anti-bacteria quality</li>
            <li> But, what really threw it over the top for me is the red scrubby pad on the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than this, I have no complaints and have happily changed my daily routine to include using this shower accessory.</li>
            <li> He uses the puff traditionally, and says the other side is great for his hands, or stubborn dirt spots.</li>
            <li> : Seems to require more soap than my older loofah to get proper lather.  </li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t need to replace it when the mesh wears down, unless you own this product.    </li>
            <li> It is not nearly as easy or effective to use as a basic scrungee, it also took more liquid soap to lather up.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the big puffy shower things, which is really the only way to get good lather with modern liquid shower soaps and gels.  </li>
            <li> The other side,the really rough scrubber,works great for feet and hands and does clean skin that a normal wash cloth can&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if my skin is super sensitive or not, but it hurts to use this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thankfully, it is smaller than it appears in the pictures, so it is easy to hold and maneuver.  </li>
            <li> The Axe Detailer Shower Tool comes in an easy open package.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for getting dirt, oils, and, yes, green grass stains off of the soles of feet, toes, elbows, palms, and other tougher areas of the skin (it does tickle a bit!).  </li>
            <li> It is perfect for getting dirt, oils, and, yes, green grass stains off of the soles of feet, toes, elbows, palms, and other tougher areas of the skin (it does tickle a bit!).  </li>
            <li> A great replacement for the standard combo of shower poof and loofah, and takes up less space.</li>
            <li> A great replacement for the standard combo of shower poof and loofah, and takes up less space.</li>
            <li> Again, buy this if you can&#x27;t get dirt off using a regular cloth or loofa and want something to fine detail those spots.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s finally a decent shower gel sponge on the market for guys!  </li>
            <li> The tightness of the bundle wears of in about 6 months, but it&#x27;s pretty decent.</li>
            <li> The rubber disc is too large to fit comfortably in a regular sized hand.</li>
            <li> Very misleading title.</li>
            <li> The Axe Detailer Shower Tool really doesn&#x27;t miss a thing.</li>
            <li> I use this side to really scrub and exfoliate places (which already have suds from the loofa side) that can handle it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> why am I even thinking about this thing this much?</li>
            <li> When used with the AXE shower gel (or your choice really)</li>
            <li> Points radiate out to comfortably hold in the hand, along with a standard loop for post-wash hang-up to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It came with a pack of four for a reasonable price</li>
            <li> But you don&#x27;t really need AXE gel for this product.  </li>
            <li> Although he isn&#x27;t into the Axe body sprays as much as he used to be, my son was eager to try this product as soon as he saw it.</li>
            <li> It works very well for that purpose.  </li>
            <li> Works very well for the price.  </li>
            <li> and I was ready to toss it into the nearest trash receptacle.</li>
            <li> This is really a fancy version of a mesh sponge/loofah.</li>
            <li> If you are used to using loofahs then you will love the addition of a harder scrubbing section.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would make that much of a difference</li>
            <li> I love it and anyone who does labor work like myself such as warehouse or construction work, you will really enjoy the rough side of the tool for your feet.</li>
            <li> Plus, I wonder do we really need another plastic bath accessory?  </li>
            <li> BUT, it doesn&#x27;t really remove calluses.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the fact that the loofah part of the Detailer is sewn in, it lasts MUCH longer without falling apart.</li>
            <li> mesh side lathers up real quick&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> and I love the rough scrubbing surface which is why I&#x27;m giving it five stars.</li>
            <li> This product is really a loofah.  </li>
            <li> This is a dupe, and is very misleading.</li>
            <li> because real men perfume themselves and use sandpaper on their elbows.  </li>
            <li> You can give two of shower tool to your family member like what i did, so they can thanks you when they use it too.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like these.</li>
            <li> I started getting into the Dr. Bronners liquid soaps, and you really need a loofah to apply them.</li>
            <li> The red side is more like a fuzzy, soft, spongey pillow.</li>
            <li> I approve of this product, and my ultimate goal is to have 7 bottles of different Axe Shower Gel, each on their own Axe Shower</li>
            <li> However, definitely try sticking with the tool even if the first few uses aren&#x27;t too pleasant.</li>
            <li> The most important thing however, is that it actually makes it easier for him to get off any dirt, grime or other stuff - and do it in record time.</li>
            <li> I like the addition of two sides, which is handy for scrubbing deep when using the rougher flat side to exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of course, kitchen sponges have functioned like this for many years with one side for scrubbing and the other for lathering up.</li>
            <li> But, that is niether here-nor-there, the Detailer is an effective bathing tool, it doesn&#x27;t miss a thing, a soft mesh side for your general washing and a coarser side for the \\&quot;dirtier spots\\&quot; feet and hands and such.  </li>
            <li> Axe scrubber is so much better than the other brands.</li>
            <li> That makes things easy, allows it to dry off between uses,etc.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel like I am getting extra clean.</li>
            <li> While the Shower Tool is designed to be gripped, and each side is designed for the intensity of scrub desired, I&#x27;m more inclined for something more minimal and less (gender) overdetermined.  </li>
            <li> Recently, I had the chance to try one, and I guess the adage about how one shouldn&#x27;t judge a book by its cover (or in this case, a shower tool by its ad) is still true.  </li>
            <li> The stiff nylon sponge will easily scour off the grime of irregular bathing or a days&#x27; worth of work if you work a blue-collar job.</li>
            <li> Skin brushing (dry or wet) is very good for your overall health, as it assists you body&#x27;s natural detox process.</li>
            <li> The rougher side is great for buffing, not eliminating those trouble rough spots on your body, IE knees, elbows and soles of the feet.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t go back to regular loofas for sure.  </li>
            <li> but after a few uses you really get used to it and feel more</li>
            <li> Well satisfied with this product, will definitely buy these goodies next time I run out.</li>
            <li> ,LUCKY I gave it 2 Stars, I guess I gave the extra star for Axe&#x27;s \\&quot;EFFORT\\&quot; to make</li>
            <li> Unfortunately those pieces don&#x27;t fit well enough together as one apparatus; it&#x27;s just too bulky and unwieldy to get into certain areas that you want to clean the most.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It looks a little more manly hanging in the shower and does give some scrubbing options.  </li>
            <li> They need mesh to expand a little more.</li>
            <li> Axe recommends you replace it every 4-6 weeks, I toss mine in the washing machine once a week with a little color safe bleach and some Tide.</li>
            <li> He likes the rubber grip it has that allows him to scrub hard and the buffing side is nice.</li>
            <li> There is a rough side on the detailer, perfect for hard to remove and stubborn dirt stains.. and a softer side for daily showers and</li>
            <li> The masculine design of the Axe Detailer Shower Tool is geared for manly men, though I wonder if guys would really want something like this.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get the mountains of suds you would get with a normal pouf.</li>
            <li> normal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case</li>
            <li> After a few weeks it loosens up a bit and feels much better on the skin, like a loofa should.</li>
            <li> : Easier to grip than a normal loofah.  </li>
            <li> pros - the &#x27;soft&#x27; dark scrubber side leaves skin feeling cleaner and more exfoliated.  </li>
            <li> good marketing, not a great idea.  </li>
            <li> In short...a cheap synthetic loofa-wannabe will do the total job better than this will, will probably be a bit cheaper and you can just get one in black if you&#x27;re worried it doesn&#x27;t look manly enough.</li>
            <li> Multiple colors make it easy to differentiate for showers with multiple users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Same results except that this time my axe detailer went right into the trash.</li>
            <li> only thing they got right is, it&#x27;s a detail</li>
            <li> Salux or other brand flat nylon mesh cloths are superior IMHO for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The new Axe Detailer is just what is says it is...a \\&quot;shower</li>
            <li> Of course, the packaging tells you to buy a new one every month.  </li>
            <li> I think it is fantastic that someone finally came out with a male version of a bath puff.</li>
            <li> Strong, sturdy, and long lasting!</li>
            <li> The others don&#x27;t seem to last more than a few weeks, this one is very sturdy and &amp;#34;built for a man&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The shower tool&#x27;s red abrasive \\&quot;scrubbing\\&quot; surface is not much more effective at cleaning the body&#x27;s extremities than normal scrubbing alone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the price of these on Amazon is not super cheap, it is in line with a sale in a store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gone are the lovely pastels, replaced by a manly black and red.  </li>
            <li> Not only did it get his skin good and clean, but he has phoresis (dry, flaky skin) and the hard scrubbie side made his dry patches VERY, VERY, soft.</li>
            <li> I have seen similar nylon sponges made for women that behave like large cotton balls in everyway but this Axe brand tool truly is made for men because you WILL feel it.  </li>
            <li> The red side has the texture of a steel pan scrubber - only softer, and it works great for tough jobs, as advertised.  </li>
            <li> rubber outer edge is soft, and feels like the polyurethane that inflatable pool floats are made from more than the hard rubber of a car tire.  </li>
            <li> The soft side is soft enough not to feel like sand paper yet hard enough to give a good exfoliation.</li>
            <li> It sounds like a great idea, but this thing is just awkward to use.  </li>
            <li> Now Axe has developed a shower sponge with a sturdy grip.  </li>
            <li> Axe Body Detailing Shower tool is essentially a nylon sponge marketed for men and intended to be used with the Axe brand of body washes (the liquid soap alternative to the ubiquitous bar) but really any body wash will do.  </li>
            <li> I saw that this so-called \\&quot;shower tool\\&quot; had one part(a soft poof)for</li>
            <li> , overall I really like this \\&quot;detailing tool for bodies.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> So, overall I really like this \\&quot;detailing tool for bodies.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> , scrub side has scrubbing power of soft washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve all used those \\&quot;poofy\\&quot; scubbers that use shower gel instead of bar soap (at least many of us have).  </li>
            <li> As a shower scrubby, it is too rigid, does not conform to &#x27;body parts&#x27; comfortably, and is not comfortable to hold for a period of time in your hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m soft now.</li>
            <li> far as quality goes, I like the material.</li>
            <li> It has 2 sides, a soft loofa and a scrubber loofa.</li>
            <li> The 4 pack offers a convenient buying method</li>
            <li> unless you&#x27;re an oompa loompa or have the grip strength of a 98 year old woman with arthritis who bathes in WD40, I can&#x27;t see how anyone could not grip this thing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Buy a regular shower scrubber, and an abrasive one if you really need it.  </li>
            <li> While you&#x27;re at it, buy some soap or shower gel that doesn&#x27;t play into our culture&#x27;s masculine insecurities to sell a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Axe -</li>
            <li> If you have tender or sensitive skin, then I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for those areas.</li>
            <li> In short, typical high energy teen with a love of the outdoors and sports.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A pack of 4 will last you 6 months, so right off the back</li>
            <li> Not only is it compact, but it has two sides (a soft side for the sensitive areas) and a rough part to clean the heels and palms.  </li>
            <li> Unlike some other reviewers here, I never had a problem with how they look, though they do have a distinctly feminine air about them, even if you don&#x27;t go for the pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the red and black motif, and the rough scrub side and gentle lather side gets the job done.</li>
            <li> The soft mesh are a dime a dozen at any wal-mart and the rough side does the exact job a hand towel can do.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;poofy\\&quot; side is little more than a big knot of mesh that could be purchased at my local \\&quot;Dollar-General\\</li>
            <li> Natural loofahs seem to work better but are usually hard to hold onto, especially when they&#x27;re loaded up with soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;For those with sensitive skin, you may not like the texture of the Axe Shower Tool in the beginning, but after a few uses, you&#x27;ll likely start to enjoy it.  </li>
            <li> I bought this and tried it and it feels pretty rough on my skin.</li>
            <li> The advertisement talks about a &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; side when both sides are pretty rough.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty rough.  </li>
            <li> first I thought I would have to add soap to the red pad to use it, but the lather from the poof behind it squeezes right through it, so if you&#x27;ve been using the rest of the tool, the scrubby is all soaped up and ready to go.  </li>
            <li> This is slightly more expensive than a $3 loofah, but lasts much longer.</li>
            <li> About the size of a grapefruit cut in half, it has two distinct features: a spongy coil of nylon for general cleaning and a multi-colored scrubber</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s in black and red, and not those fruity pink and violet colors that seem more suited to women.  </li>
            <li> Overall, the design of the tool is geared towards males, but its function is no more effective than any other loofah on the market.</li>
            <li> Plus, unlike a regular loofah, it seems like it would be less likely to have bacteria grow quickly since it isn&#x27;t a natural product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Title clearly says 4 pack and only received 1.</li>
            <li> I go through shower poofs so fast because they get big and stretched out.</li>
            <li> that you immediate feel it yet soft enough that it will yield to your skin.  </li>
            <li> Scrubber\\&quot; added to one side that allows you to really \\&quot;get in\\&quot; to those parts that you want to well, scrub harder at.  </li>
            <li> A rubber tire grip allows you to apply masculine force and direction to the problem while the red pad provides exfoliation for those men who need it.  </li>
            <li> Apparently.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t foam nearly as well as a standard loofah for a given amount of soap --</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the scrubby side much because it&#x27;s too rough.</li>
            <li> but when I started to use the Axe Body shower tool and dried myself afterwards, I got into a level of cleanliness - a distinct smell and feel - that</li>
            <li> :  The lather side is a bit more scrubby, the scrub side of dove&#x27;s version is also a bit tougher, but still not great.  </li>
            <li> The poof part is fine, but just very small.  </li>
            <li> tool consists of a vinyl mesh faux loufah gathered and attached to a large rubber disc with a finer vinyl weave attached to the other side.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;fluff side\\&quot; is harsh, and doesn&#x27;t get where you need it too, easily</li>
            <li> The other side is soft, for more delicate areas.  </li>
            <li> At first the red side was very rough on my skin</li>
            <li> All in all a great product but a little expensive if you are used to buying 0.85 loofahs from Walmart.</li>
            <li> I thought I was just purchasing one, and even for the price, I didn&#x27;t think much of it because it was on par with all the other shower tools I looked at.</li>
            <li> It does create a nice lather with liquid soaps (which I dislike as they tend to leave a slimy residue) but it is no good for washing your back and a bit rough for your face.  </li>
            <li> The tough scrubber side is good for rubbing dead skin off your feet and ankles, or for scrubbing paint and stuff off your body, and that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> Axe detailer has two distinct parts -- the regular bath sponge part in black and the red \\&quot;detailer\\&quot; that is for the rougher parts of the body like feet and elbows.  </li>
            <li> I realized I won&#x27;t be able to use this everyday, its just too harsh.  </li>
            <li> I say that anyone who is a little interested in this product just needs to try it.</li>
            <li> P. Logue, 2008ad to use it, but the lather from the poof behind it squeezes right through it, so if you&#x27;ve been using the rest of the tool, the scrubby is all soaped up and ready to go.  </li>
            <li> One side is similar to a loofa, except much denser, and the other side is a rougher material for scrubbing.  </li>
            <li> Wow - I can&#x27;t believe it took this long for a product like this to be made.</li>
            <li> When you first use one of these tools, the loofa side is a bit harsh.</li>
            <li> He likes that there is a rough side along with the normal loofa.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;handest\\&quot; bit about the Detailer is the hard rubber that separates the hard and soft sides of the tool, this serves as and effective grip for washing, one you can&#x27;t get with a simple mesh thingy from a \\&quot;bath\\&quot; store.</li>
            <li> you guys can really get down and scrub your skin.</li>
            <li> The disc is so large that it does hot allow scrubbing behind or inside the ears.</li>
            <li> It actually does look very much like a car detailing tool, with the black and red color scheme and the \\&quot;tire\\&quot; ring around the outside edge.  </li>
            <li> They are also rather durable - as an experiment, I used the same scrub daily for over half a year, and only after did the soft side start to separate from the main shell.  </li>
            <li> Now I am rather active man who can build up a layer sweat with my outdoor work and can easily find an excuse not to shower everyday but</li>
            <li> I have big hands, but have had trouble gripping these things in the past...</li>
            <li> This break-in period is a bit annoying, but in the end is well worth it, as these things can last a really long time, which is what I love about them.  </li>
            <li> And the bristly side isn&#x27;t really bristly; coarse yes, but not very effective.</li>
            <li> And a soft on the other.  </li>
            <li> Every time I mow the lawn, I get green stains on my feet, particularly the heels and toes.  </li>
            <li> am unsure of the pricing concerning this product, as it is usually part of a promotional pack, allowing you to get AXE shower gel along with the Detailer, but I would certainly recommend the tool.</li>
            <li> [that is similar to looped portion of a Velcro closure] for less sensitive parts like calluses or soles of feet.</li>
            <li> I assure you their will be no old skin left on your body.</li>
            <li> To the product&#x27;s credit, this shower tool will last you for a long time.</li>
            <li> because they essentially have to air dry - you cannot squeeze out the water out this like you would a washcloth.  </li>
            <li> because they essentially have to air dry - you cannot squeeze out the water out this like you would a washcloth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that when I try to reshape it the product life is far less and needs replacement after just one month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found that the traditional shower loofa just wasn&#x27;t cutting it for me, I needed something more.</li>
            <li> Overall, this thing was a complete waste of my money.</li>
            <li> readers of my Vine reviews have noted, I&#x27;ve long believed that men and women are similar enough that they can use each other&#x27;s health and personal care items but that in order to market said products to both men and women, changes may be required.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never go back to using soap or body washes not specifically designed for men because it&#x27;s been scientifically proven that men have different skin needs than women, so while Axe Anarchy Revitalizing Shower Gel is right for my skin, something with cucumber melon would probably dry out my skin or worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not normally a fan of Axe products, but this thing beats the hell out of a regular loofah.</li>
            <li> But, they are also hard to hold when they are soapy, are a bit scratchy, and not firm enough to really help with the green feet.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;cover&amp;#34; gets in the way for completely using in tight areas.</li>
            <li> Really should be used only with liquid soap as hard soaps will cake up and dry on the shower tool.    </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t really seem to lather up hardly at all).  </li>
            <li> It is much coarser and designed to take off hard dirt, paint, etc.  </li>
            <li> First impression of this product is that it exceeded my expectations,made with soft and durable material,like always you have certain people that are either blind or can&#x27;t appreciate quality, there was this reviewer saying that the item was heavy and bulky LIAR!!</li>
            <li> Honestly that&#x27;s not that bad, but</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t actually had one turn into a giant poof of mesh on me yet, although I regularly replace them a few times throughout the year when I remember to do so.</li>
            <li> and also long life</li>
            <li> Maybe I am a big baby, but it hurts to use the rough side anywhere else.</li>
            <li> This thing is only about three inches wide so</li>
            <li> Oh, and this thing lasts a damn long time</li>
            <li> With the thick rubber grip is much easier to handle in the shower.</li>
            <li> What kind of a sick bastard steals another mans shower body scrubber?  </li>
            <li> , it does have sandpaper sides, one of which would remove the face off a statue and other that buffs your flesh to a tender red.</li>
            <li> However, I do wish that the net part of the item would last a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> other is like coarse sandpaper&lt;br /&gt;In case your skin requires a scraper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Saw this the other day at my local grocery store, for $4.99, bought it &amp; tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 3 uses, I</li>
            <li> I typically use a scrubby that is soft and shapeless, or a scrubby with a long handle, so you can scrub your back with it.</li>
            <li> Then a few years ago companies started coming out with male specific scrubbers like this one.</li>
            <li> Save a few bucks and just buy a generic loofah, or if you are male and embarrassed to buy a loofah, like myself, have a friend buy it for you.</li>
            <li> The Axe Detailer Shower Tool does a fine job of getting the dirt off, even reaching the difficult back area, ones not easily accessed by wash cloth or bar of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also the surface area is small to work with &amp; it&#x27;s kind of awkward to use.</li>
            <li> But, it is hard to shake the strange (possibly less-erotic-than-intended)imagery of the AXE commercial connected with this tool, the one with the woman-driven-man-washer...</li>
            <li> It is too rough for any other delicate regions, but the puff behind it is fine for those (that one is the same as a standard puff, and is a little bit scratchy like those are, but nothing too</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;poofy\\&quot; side was small and harsh ans required me to use three times the amount of body wash as my old method, only to yield about no soap suds.</li>
            <li> It is too rough for any other delicate regions, but the puff behind it is fine for those (that one is the same as a standard puff, and is a little bit scratchy like those are, but nothing too rough).    </li>
            <li> Has a hard scrubbing pad on one side and a normal body wash sponge like thing on the other side.</li>
            <li> Just wished it was a little bigger.</li>
            <li> The tough pad part is supposed to be for areas like your feet and elbows, but it really doesn&#x27;t seem to do much(and</li>
            <li> The detailer side is tough and takes up to much room.</li>
            <li> It really sucks that the Axe Shower Tool was advertised as a pack of four then suddenly changed charging me over $20.00 for only one.</li>
            <li> This is great since I am on a Military base and have common showers.  </li>
            <li> The rougher side, which people complain doesn&#x27;t produce enough suds or is too harsh, ISN&#x27;T</li>
            <li> I wash them off afterward, but inevitably a green caste remains over the next week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> well, let&#x27;s just say that I would rather drag a bar of lava soap across my body than try to use it.</li>
            <li> My only problem with it is that it is a bit too heavy.</li>
            <li> I dig them and the rough side gets the dirt out.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no real need to use this AXE&lt;br /&gt;Unless</li>
            <li> I find the Axe Detailer Shower Tool to be rough and scratchy.  </li>
            <li> I got 2 greyish green and 2 red</li>
            <li> A bit on the rough side.</li>
            <li> One side is rough, because guys are rough.  </li>
            <li> Works just as expected.</li>
            <li> It seemed a little too expensive, and as a person not too hung up on a macho exterior, I didn&#x27;t think it would make a significant difference from anything else I already used.  </li>
            <li> My husband has had his for months and the black poofy part isn&#x27;t stretched out at all</li>
            <li> It is mainly a tool to help get those really dirty spots from your body like arm pits and back and such.  </li>
            <li> The cleansing unit is small and rough on one side, and simply plastic on the other.  </li>
            <li> They seemed flimsy and small for a guy&#x27;s larger hand.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fall apart and puff out like other shower poofs.</li>
            <li> This is a 2 sided item- use one side to scrub and the other to lather up.</li>
            <li> But other than that it&#x27;s just sort of a sponge.</li>
            <li> The color makes it workable for him, since he did not like the other \\&quot;girly\\&quot; colored \\&quot;puffer fish\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The other side of the detailer,....</li>
            <li> With other bath sponges, they seem to come unraveled within the space of a week or two.  </li>
            <li> The Luffa stays together, not tearing apart like some other ones I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> I use the softer side and the rough side on my feet!  </li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll have to give the other 3 away to friends.</li>
            <li> Stop complaining about there being a rough side on the darn thing!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to use the rough, exfoliating side then don&#x27;t use it!  </li>
            <li> However, the Axe shower tool&#x27;s only real advantage over any other loofah is that it has a black grip surrounding it which makes it less vulnerable to slip through the user&#x27;s hand while in the shower.</li>
            <li> The backside is very rough almost like a sandpaper kinda which you can use for spots.  </li>
            <li> The finer side is very rough</li>
            <li> But for me this thing is very rough on the skin.</li>
            <li> the other side is used for hard places such as your elbows or the bottom of your feet.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy!</li>
            <li> This is the same thing with an added \\&quot;hard</li>
            <li> you are wondering about whether he fits your \\&quot;target user\\&quot; criteria or if it&#x27;d work for you: his daily activity level is high, athletic, engages in plenty of sports and doesn&#x27;t hesitate to dive for that soccer ball, get dirty, etc.</li>
            <li> I can already tell it is made of tougher stuff from the average scrubber.</li>
            <li> I gave this \\&quot;tool\\&quot; an average rating.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really worth buying this item.</li>
            <li> It comes with the poofy stuff all tight, but after a few showers they get loose and start to come out.  </li>
            <li> All that being said, it will scrub you down.</li>
            <li> , I would have gave it 5 stars, but the mesh side on some of them are a little coarse and can irritate your skin if you press too hard (like me).</li>
            <li> The rough side should only be used for tough areas (like the soles of your feet etc.).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a rough scrubber and this has held up to the task without being too rough or hard.</li>
            <li> He truly appreciates it (and that is saying plenty for someone who typically isn&#x27;t into \\&quot;mens grooming\\&quot; products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I am slightly colorblind though, so take that as you</li>
            <li> but it is a little pricey.</li>
            <li> If your choice of career or lifestyle does not produce calluses, you are advised to use it sparingly in order to avoid screaming like a little girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a little string to hang it up when you&#x27;re done</li>
            <li> It also has a little hook on the bottom to hang your Axe Detailer.  </li>
            <li> I like the little loopy thing, and not holding onto the scrubbing part</li>
            <li> Flip this little bugger around and you have the &amp;#34;rough side&amp;#34; as I like to call it.</li>
            <li> but I find it a little harsh for elbows.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a man who tends to destroy loofas and pouf sponges after little use, then this product is for you.</li>
            <li> Have to be careful not to scrub too hard.</li>
            <li> SUPPOSED TO BUILD UP A HEAVY LATHER.</li>
            <li> The tool will not fit between my cheek bone and nose.</li>
            <li> (it is in there, hiding behind the red scrubby pad).  </li>
            <li> I read one guy&#x27;s review about green feet while mowing the grass</li>
            <li> My son used this product since he has been using Axe products for a few years now</li>
            <li> Housing is firm, but flexible, rubber</li>
            <li> When you are in shower you do not want something so heavy...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.  </li>
            <li> a waste.</li>
            <li> I guess the clever Mad Men down in marketing got me, because I picked one up in the afternoon while I was out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Is sensitive or very thin</li>
            <li> Yes, these are expensive, but if you consider the amount you would spend on loofahs in that 3-5 months they probably cost the same (or less...</li>
            <li> /&gt;To understand how raw skin feels</li>
            <li> It is wound very tightly and takes a couple of weeks to wear in.</li>
            <li> your delicates and another part(a tough pad)for your rough parts.  </li>
            <li> Bad: The rubber holding the detailer together does not allow for much flexibility.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for whole year and still used till something bad happen to  mine.</li>
            <li> Use this stuff everyday !</li>
            <li> Plus, lately my wife has been asking me why my feet aren&#x27;t green, which I&#x27;d say is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus, lately my wife has been asking me why my feet aren&#x27;t green, which I&#x27;d say is a plus.    </li>
            <li> Not sure what these things are called (sponges/loofahs?)</li>
            <li> The surface area is too small.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re kinda small, about the size of a softball.</li>
            <li> You can use one side of arms, legs, shoulders,etc and the small circular area (which is a lot rougher) for grimier spots like ankles and feet to help remove dirt buildup.</li>
            <li> The sponge was too small.  </li>
            <li> put a ton of soap on it, and after rubbing your arm there is no more soap</li>
            <li> A bit excessive?</li>
            <li> Too small for a fully built man like myself.</li>
            <li> Seriously, it&#x27;s small.</li>
            <li> It is small and doesn&#x27;t hold a lather on the loofah side.</li>
            <li> Every guy&#x27;s worst nightmare is his girlfriend thinking he&#x27;s gay.</li>
            <li> It has a hard shell on one side.  </li>
            <li> Just might knock the bark off if you scrub too hard.</li>
            <li> At least that seems to be how it was marketed.</li>
            <li> I had to try the Axe detailer tool when it came out because I&#x27;m a Axe fanatic.</li>
            <li> I use one of these for at least 3-5 months before I have to change.</li>
            <li> While their shower tool was a little weird getting used to in the beginning, I find it hard to not use it now.</li>
            <li> It is surrounded by a massive plastic ring making it impossible to use the sides of the detailer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The material is stiff, horribly scratchy, and doesn&#x27;t allow shower gel to lather very well.</li>
            <li> I used to use regular loofahs, but I hated how they would break down after a week or so.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to create a situation in which women - I&#x27;m assuming really dumb ones - are made out of control in your presence after using it.</li>
            <li> and this is very hard to hold .</li>
            <li> Additionally, I see some poor reviews being given as a result of the product being too difficult to hold - another puzzling complaint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really happy with this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After feeling miffed about being jipped, I sent them an email telling em I was annoyed.</li>
            <li> The scouring pad is basically useless, it&#x27;s a Brillo pad</li>
            <li> My biggest disappointment is how poorly my Axe body wash lathers with this.  </li>
            <li> Its difficult to relate how something feels</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> Also, the rubber grip becomes slippery when wet/soapy and is difficult to keep hold of.</li>
            <li> Sorry about that,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m angry because it says pack of 4.</li>
            <li> False advertising!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This means that there is ample opportunity to get sweaty and dirty - and that occurs.</li>
            <li> and I was afraid of scratching myself,</li>
            <li> Really disappointing.</li>
            <li> and, I hate to say it, somewhat awkward to hold.</li>
            <li> Stupid, beyond stupid.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overpriced for functionally worthless sponge.</li>
            <li> but this thing was crap.</li>
            <li> Very frustrated, and feel taken advantage of.  </li>

            <li> Misleading product title.  Only received one instead of a pack of four.</li>
            <li> Very misleading title. Title clearly says 4 pack and only received 1. Thought I was getting a great deal for 4 of these but instead spent way too much just for 1.</li>
            <li> I love it ! Use this stuff everyday !</li>
            <li> These things are great for guys and when combined with dove men it is the perfect wash tool to use</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I got one of the shower kits yesterday (the phoenix one) while shopping and he used it today after work. Not only did it get his skin good and clean, but he has phoresis (dry, flaky skin) and the hard scrubbie side made his dry patches VERY, VERY, soft. I loved it so much, I plan on getting a scrubbie for me.</li>
            <li> If you share a bathroom with a female, be it a wife, girlfriend, daughter, are roommate, you know what a loofa is because it is most likely hanging from your shower head right now.  And the Axe Detailer Shower Tool is basically a loofa marketed to guys.  The only thing different from the female in your life&#x27;s besides the color scheme is the flip side that has a rougher scrubber on it for tougher places on your body like the feet, elbows, etc., but that side just feels like an afterthought and I found myself cleaning those areas with the scrubbing side after awhile.  In the end the Ax Shower Tool does get the job done and basically you need to ask yourself, \\&quot;Do I want another loofa hanging on my showerhead?\\&quot;</li>
            <li> For years the women in our household have been buying shower sponges, but they just never seemed to be that effective to me.  Why not?  They seemed flimsy and small for a guy&#x27;s larger hand.  Now Axe has developed a shower sponge with a sturdy grip.  The grip makes it easy to scrub away and it doesn&#x27;t slip away.  Adding to the effectiveness of this tool is the coarse brush located opposite the sponge.  This works well in stimulating the scalp.  Overall a big improvement.</li>
            <li> Designed to work with the [[ASIN:B000FKERKY AXE Revitalizing Shower Gel]], the Axe Detailer Shower Tool is a joy to use. This 2-sided cleanser (red cushion scrub side and black mesh lather side) gets the job done quick, easy but most important, effectively. The Axe Detailer Shower Tool really doesn&#x27;t miss a thing. Recommended!</li>
            <li> This item is well worth the money!! Much better than a regular loofa.  With the thick rubber grip is much easier to handle in the shower. I give it an A+++</li>
            <li> My husband uses this and likes it very much.......He likes the rubber grip it has that allows him to scrub hard and the buffing side is nice. I wish they made one for women.........I go through shower poofs so fast because they get big and stretched out. My husband has had his for months and the black poofy part isn&#x27;t stretched out at all and it looks new and great. I might buy one for myself even though it&#x27;s for men............since it lasts so long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I bought myself one and it&#x27;s great. It doesn&#x27;t fall apart and puff out like other shower poofs. I wish they made a woman&#x27;s version of this.</li>
            <li> Like most Axe products I&#x27;ve tried, this is a mixed bag.  The pouf side is surprisingly MUCH more abrasive than a regular shower pouf.  The scouring pad is basically useless, it&#x27;s a Brillo pad and I can only use it on the bottoms of my feet.  I realized I won&#x27;t be able to use this everyday, its just too harsh.  My biggest disappointment is how poorly my Axe body wash lathers with this.  You don&#x27;t get the mountains of suds you would get with a normal pouf. All that being said, it will scrub you down. This is strictly for those in the market for a super scrubber to use once in a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not normally a fan of Axe products, but this thing beats the hell out of a regular loofah. It doesn&#x27;t become a huge ball of mesh immediately. The grip is nice, but I don&#x27;t get much use out of the rougher scrub side. This is slightly more expensive than a $3 loofah, but lasts much longer. I haven&#x27;t actually had one turn into a giant poof of mesh on me yet, although I regularly replace them a few times throughout the year when I remember to do so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really happy with this product. I bought this and tried it and it feels pretty rough on my skin.</li>
            <li> When you first use this body scrubber, you will notice just how aggressive it is.  Before this, I used washcloths and I was sure they did a good job of getting me clean but when I started to use the Axe Body shower tool and dried myself afterwards, I got into a level of cleanliness - a distinct smell and feel - that I thought I could only get from those spa treatments seen on television.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Axe Body Detailing Shower tool is essentially a nylon sponge marketed for men and intended to be used with the Axe brand of body washes (the liquid soap alternative to the ubiquitous bar) but really any body wash will do.  About the size of a grapefruit cut in half, it has two distinct features: a spongy coil of nylon for general cleaning and a multi-colored scrubber [that is similar to looped portion of a Velcro closure] for less sensitive parts like calluses or soles of feet. It has ring that keeps the two parts together that feels great in your hand under all circumstances moreso when its wet, slippery with soap, and rubbing it around yourself building up a lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one feature would like to emphasize is the hardiness sponge.  Its difficult to relate how something feels but I suppose that the best analogy would be comparing it mildly browned toast - its firm enough that you immediate feel it yet soft enough that it will yield to your skin.  I have seen similar nylon sponges made for women that behave like large cotton balls in everyway but this Axe brand tool truly is made for men because you WILL feel it.  The stiff nylon sponge will easily scour off the grime of irregular bathing or a days&#x27; worth of work if you work a blue-collar job. Now I am rather active man who can build up a layer sweat with my outdoor work and can easily find an excuse not to shower everyday but no matter what my circumstances are now, I know that the detailer is going to get me clean.  I have seen women and effeminate men submit themselves to these luxury spa skin treatments and get tangible results; I have to admit I felt like those people but without the vanity and narcissism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to move up in personal hygiene, the axe detailer is a leap in male cleanliness.  The almost scratchy feel may not be to everyone taste but soft girly bright nylon sponges did not feel like they could get the job either.  About only negative is that is best you use a body wash with an anti-bacteria quality because they essentially have to air dry - you cannot squeeze out the water out this like you would a washcloth.  Nevertheless, is a great showering tool that I tempted to buy another in case Axe stops making them.and get tangible results; I have to admit I felt like those people but without the vanity and narcissism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to move up in personal hygiene, the axe detailer is a leap in male cleanliness.

            <li> This is a 2 sided item- use one side to scrub and the other to lather up. Both sides do their jobs well. Of course, kitchen sponges have functioned like this for many years with one side for scrubbing and the other for lathering up. So they are taking that principle from the kitchen sink to the shower. This is also a concept used in many \\&quot;bath lines\\&quot;. I think the product is fine but it is a little pricey.</li>
            <li> The tool looked so cool I bought some and gave them to friends.  It looks a little more manly hanging in the shower and does give some scrubbing options.  The flexible grip just gets in the way (in my opinion).  You can try and flip it out of the way but everyone to whom I gave one leaves it hanging in the shower and hide the shower sponges they use every day.  I just threw mine in a drawer.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working well</li>
            <li> First impression of this product is that it exceeded my expectations,made with soft and durable material,like always you have certain people that are either blind or can&#x27;t appreciate quality, there was this reviewer saying that the item was heavy and bulky LIAR!! this is as light as they come if not even lighter so better not listen to those misleading reviews and give this a try, i guarantee you that it&#x27;s worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Saw this in a pharmacy, thought I&#x27;d pick it up to give it a try.  Won&#x27;t go back to regular loofas for sure.  The loofa mesh side works up a great lather, and gets a good scrub going.  The rougher side, which people complain doesn&#x27;t produce enough suds or is too harsh, ISN&#x27;T SUPPOSED TO BUILD UP A HEAVY LATHER. I use this side to really scrub and exfoliate places (which already have suds from the loofa side) that can handle it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this tool, the rubber grip is a manageable size, will continue purchasing it.</li>
            <li> An attractive yet practical shower tool, minimalistic but hardy design. Rough scrub side indeed excellent for ground in dirt on hands, feet, etc. Softer scrub side great for sunburned skin.</li>
            <li> The Axe Detailer Shower Tool is an attractive shower decoration. It would look very nice in an all white shower. It&#x27;s not as attractive hanging against my blue and yellow tile. Besides it&#x27;s decorative aspects there&#x27;s nothing about this product to recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tool consists of a vinyl mesh faux loufah gathered and attached to a large rubber disc with a finer vinyl weave attached to the other side. The disc is so large that it does hot allow scrubbing behind or inside the ears. The tool will not fit between my cheek bone and nose. the finer weaved part is supposed to allow removal of \\&quot;tough\\&quot; dirt but doesn&#x27;t work as well as a regular wash cloth. The rubber disc is too large to fit comfortably in a regular sized hand. This allows one to experience feelings of inadequacy in the shower without looking downwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Axe Detailer Shower Tool is truly the Pet Rock of Men&#x27;s personal  grooming products. Only they have outdone the Pet Rock people by making you buy 4 of these things, that are good for nothing but just hanging there, instead of just one.</li>
            <li> I saw that this so-called \\&quot;shower tool\\&quot; had one part(a soft poof)for your delicates and another part(a tough pad)for your rough parts.  It sounds like a great idea, but this thing is just awkward to use.  The tough pad part is supposed to be for areas like your feet and elbows, but it really doesn&#x27;t seem to do much(and it doesn&#x27;t really seem to lather up hardly at all).  The poof part is fine, but just very small.  Oh, and you&#x27;ll constantly be rubbing(i.e. scratching)yourself with the big rubber body of the \\&quot;tool\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Axe&#x27;s Shower Tool is a great concept, but the execution is way off.</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting, when I searched for this item, the description said $9.01 ($2.25/count) so I thought what a great deal! Should&#x27;ve read the reviews first! I only received 1 detailer, I was expecting 4! False advertising! Definitely returning. Btw, the product works fantastic! HUBBY APPROVED! You&#x27;ll find it way cheaper at your local retailer.</li>
            <li> Every guy&#x27;s worst nightmare is his girlfriend thinking he&#x27;s gay. So this is perfect for me. I don&#x27;t want my girlfriend thinking I&#x27;m doing something gay every time I touch myself taking a shower, but this product is specifically designed for guys who have or want a girlfriend. So it&#x27;s perfect. I hang it from the shower curtain bar so she&#x27;s sure to see it. I&#x27;d never go back to using soap or body washes not specifically designed for men because it&#x27;s been scientifically proven that men have different skin needs than women, so while Axe Anarchy Revitalizing Shower Gel is right for my skin, something with cucumber melon would probably dry out my skin or worse.</li>
            <li> Maybe I don&#x27;t get the point with this. Okay, they use sex to sell it; I get that. It&#x27;s supposed to create a situation in which women - I&#x27;m assuming really dumb ones - are made out of control in your presence after using it. Right. And Yaks fly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But is there anything truly unique about it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it does have sandpaper sides, one of which would remove the face off a statue and other that buffs your flesh to a tender red. But other than that it&#x27;s just sort of a sponge. The &#x60;directions&#x27; say it gets all those special places (if we all have them are they really so special?) but I think a washrag does a better job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why am I even thinking about this thing this much? I&#x27;m done and I&#x27;m outta here - to find my washcloth.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s finally a decent shower gel sponge on the market for guys!  I enjoyed this shower tool from Axe very much.  Not only is it compact, but it has two sides (a soft side for the sensitive areas) and a rough part to clean the heels and palms.  The shower tool is easy to hang on to and after you&#x27;re finished, you can hang it on the shower head.  No muss and no fuss with this body scrubber.  I tried it out as soon as I received it in the mail.  I gave it a good workout and it stood up to the test.  Another sold customer for this fine product from Axe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The new Axe Detailer is just what is says it is...a \\&quot;shower tool.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;It is a functional bathing tool, but one that the guys won&#x27;t be embarrassed to put in their shopping cart, even if it is a virtual one.&lt;br /&gt;It maybe for that reason that the packaging on the product looks so...well phallic. But, that is niether here-nor-there, the Detailer is an effective bathing tool, it doesn&#x27;t miss a thing, a soft mesh side for your general washing and a coarser side for the \\&quot;dirtier spots\\&quot; feet and hands and such.  When used with the AXE shower gel (or your choice really) the mesh side works up a good lather and the red scrub side is a nice finishing tool. The \\&quot;handest\\&quot; bit about the Detailer is the hard rubber that separates the hard and soft sides of the tool, this serves as and effective grip for washing, one you can&#x27;t get with a simple mesh thingy from a \\&quot;bath\\&quot; store. Points radiate out to comfortably hold in the hand, along with a standard loop for post-wash hang-up to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am unsure of the pricing concerning this product, as it is usually part of a promotional pack, allowing you to get AXE shower gel along with the Detailer, but I would certainly recommend the tool. But, it is hard to shake the strange (possibly less-erotic-than-intended)imagery of the AXE commercial connected with this tool, the one with the woman-driven-man-washer...</li>
            <li> love them. work great!</li>
            <li> I read many reviews on how nice this is and finally tested it out.  I will agree with another poster when he said that it won&#x27;t replace your wash rag.  It is mainly a tool to help get those really dirty spots from your body like arm pits and back and such.  It came with a pack of four for a reasonable price and i got 2 red and 2 blue ones.  Axe makes great conditioner called \\&quot;Pure Soft Conditioner\\&quot; so make sure you check that out.  Overall I gave it four stars, I would have gave it 5 stars, but the mesh side on some of them are a little coarse and can irritate your skin if you press too hard (like me).</li>
            <li> The advertisement talks about a &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; side when both sides are pretty rough. I don&#x27;t know if my skin is super sensitive or not, but it hurts to use this. Doesn&#x27;t even lather that well.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with the critics on this one.  I used it and even the soft meshy side was too rough on your skin.  I bought a package of four I hope I can return three of them.  The verdict is still out on the Axe Shower Gel in terms of cleanliness.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product. It looks great and has the pieces needed to scrub more than just your \\&quot;balls\\&quot;. Unfortunately those pieces don&#x27;t fit well enough together as one apparatus; it&#x27;s just too bulky and unwieldy to get into certain areas that you want to clean the most.  In short...a cheap synthetic loofa-wannabe will do the total job better than this will, will probably be a bit cheaper and you can just get one in black if you&#x27;re worried it doesn&#x27;t look manly enough.</li>
            <li> Every time I mow the lawn, I get green stains on my feet, particularly the heels and toes.  I wash them off afterward, but inevitably a green caste remains over the next week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the big puffy shower things, which is really the only way to get good lather with modern liquid shower soaps and gels.  They work, and produce a lot of lather.  But, they are also hard to hold when they are soapy, are a bit scratchy, and not firm enough to really help with the green feet.  Unlike some other reviewers here, I never had a problem with how they look, though they do have a distinctly feminine air about them, even if you don&#x27;t go for the pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was detailing my car this morning, and thought about the detailer shower tool from Axe.  I guess the clever Mad Men down in marketing got me, because I picked one up in the afternoon while I was out.  It actually does look very much like a car detailing tool, with the black and red color scheme and the \\&quot;tire\\&quot; ring around the outside edge.  It is stylized enough so that it doesn&#x27;t look like something that should be decorating a mechanic&#x27;s garage.  I have to admit, it does look considerably better hanging in the shower than the purple shower poof it replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, it is smaller than it appears in the pictures, so it is easy to hold and maneuver.  I guess because of the tire outer edge, I was worried it would be too big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rubber outer edge is soft, and feels like the polyurethane that inflatable pool floats are made from more than the hard rubber of a car tire.  This makes it easier to hold, but compressible so that a good lather can be worked up from the black colored shower poof inside (it is in there, hiding behind the red scrubby pad).  So already I like this better than the traditional poof, because it feels better in my hand, is easier to hold, and looks better.  But, what really threw it over the top for me is the red scrubby pad on the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought I would have to add soap to the red pad to use it, but the lather from the poof behind it squeezes right through it, so if you&#x27;ve been using the rest of the tool, the scrubby is all soaped up and ready to go.  It is perfect for getting dirt, oils, and, yes, green grass stains off of the soles of feet, toes, elbows, palms, and other tougher areas of the skin (it does tickle a bit!).  It is too rough for any other delicate regions, but the puff behind it is fine for those (that one is the same as a standard puff, and is a little bit scratchy like those are, but nothing too rough).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, overall I really like this \\&quot;detailing tool for bodies.\\&quot;  It is easier to hold than a standard puff, looks better hanging in the shower, and has a great scrubby pad built in.  A great replacement for the standard combo of shower poof and loofah, and takes up less space. Plus, lately my wife has been asking me why my feet aren&#x27;t green, which I&#x27;d say is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sean P.

            <li> I&#x27;m a big-time shower sponge user and have been for many years.  Whatever shower gel product I&#x27;ve used has worked fairly well, although I&#x27;ve always wished they could improve it.  Well, this Axe Detailer Shower Tool has some excellent improvements--an easy-to-grip rubber handle and this extra stiff scrubber side that gets off the tougher dirt.  Pretty good, but it&#x27;s nothing THAT different from what&#x27;s already out there.  Sure, it&#x27;s nice and I give it three stars.  But you don&#x27;t really need AXE gel for this product.  Sorry.</li>
            <li> Although he isn&#x27;t into the Axe body sprays as much as he used to be, my son was eager to try this product as soon as he saw it. It is now a staple part of his daily shower and grooming routine. He truly appreciates it (and that is saying plenty for someone who typically isn&#x27;t into \\&quot;mens grooming\\&quot; products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line on why he likes it? First of all, he can keep it nearby in the shower, easily hanging from the shower head with the attached rope. That makes things easy, allows it to dry off between uses,etc. It also is attractive enough. The most important thing however, is that it actually makes it easier for him to get off any dirt, grime or other stuff - and do it in record time. There is a rough side on the detailer, perfect for hard to remove and stubborn dirt stains.. and a softer side for daily showers and normal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you are wondering about whether he fits your \\&quot;target user\\&quot; criteria or if it&#x27;d work for you: his daily activity level is high, athletic, engages in plenty of sports and doesn&#x27;t hesitate to dive for that soccer ball, get dirty, etc. In short, typical high energy teen with a love of the outdoors and sports.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This means that there is ample opportunity to get sweaty and dirty - and that occurs. The Axe Detailer Shower Tool does a fine job of getting the dirt off, even reaching the difficult back area, ones not easily accessed by wash cloth or bar of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sound like a product you could use too?</li>
            <li> I think it is fantastic that someone finally came out with a male version of a bath puff.Only I wouldn&#x27;t dare call this axe shower tool that!It works just as well as the ones made for ladies only the the handle which kind of resembls a tire is much easier to hold onto and keep a grip.The other side,the really rough scrubber,works great for feet and hands and does clean skin that a normal wash cloth can&#x27;t but I find it a little harsh for elbows.If you have rough skin this will exfoliate as good as anything you could buy not to mention the price is great!I am  extremely  satisfied with this product and reccomend it to anyone looking for a bath scrubber for men.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my 6-year-old and he actually uses it while playing in the bath with his \\&quot;bath toys\\&quot;. The color makes it workable for him, since he did not like the other \\&quot;girly\\&quot; colored \\&quot;puffer fish\\&quot;.  The handle is comfortable and it does give a good scrub.</li>
            <li> This was a great scrubber. I have always felt that these sponge scrubbers were kind of girly and for the most part weak. Everyone I have ever purchased simply unraveled. I always felt like I was wasting my money. The Axe scrubber changed my mind. With each one recommended to last 4-6 weeks I can already tell it is made of tougher stuff from the average scrubber. A pack of 4 will last you 6 months, so right off the back it also looks like a good buy.     It has a nice lather, I like to use the rougher side as well. It makes me feel like I am getting extra clean. This is a good product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not using a scrubber or loofa with your body wash, you aren&#x27;t getting clean!  I used to use a loofa with my body wash, but they would always unravel within a couple weeks of use, sometimes sooner! Then a few years ago companies started coming out with male specific scrubbers like this one. Dove, Gillette, and Axe all have their versions (the Gillette one was the best, but they stopped making it), and they are all basically the same. One side is similar to a loofa, except much denser, and the other side is a rougher material for scrubbing.  When you first use one of these tools, the loofa side is a bit harsh. It is wound very tightly and takes a couple of weeks to wear in. After a few weeks it loosens up a bit and feels much better on the skin, like a loofa should. This break-in period is a bit annoying, but in the end is well worth it, as these things can last a really long time, which is what I love about them.  The tough scrubber side is good for rubbing dead skin off your feet and ankles, or for scrubbing paint and stuff off your body, and that&#x27;s about it. It&#x27;s pretty abrasive and not too pleasant on the skin.  If you&#x27;re a man who tends to destroy loofas and pouf sponges after little use, then this product is for you. It&#x27;s nice to be able to scrub away as hard as you need to without worrying about the thing falling apart.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using this as your primary shower cloth.  It is not a loofa like a regular one is.  It is much coarser and designed to take off hard dirt, paint, etc.  It works very well for that purpose.  I read one guy&#x27;s review about green feet while mowing the grass and I would think it would get it right off.  The backside is very rough almost like a sandpaper kinda which you can use for spots.  I guess it&#x27;s not like sandpaper because that would hurt, but it is great for spots that are really hard to get off.  Again, buy this if you can&#x27;t get dirt off using a regular cloth or loofa and want something to fine detail those spots.  Works very well for the price.  I got 2 blue and 2 red ones when I bought these a while ago.</li>
            <li> Product description says pack of 4, but I only received 1 despite the price tag of 16 bucks. What a misleading rip off</li>
            <li> only kind my husband uses!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome. Just wished it was a little bigger.</li>
            <li> These are great for guys or even gals  (you have to get use to it)  with shower gel you guys can really get down and scrub your skin. I assure you their will be no old skin left on your body. I use mine with a good body scrub and my skin has never looked better. You get out of the shower and your skin is tinkling. I LOVE MINE!!!!&lt;br /&gt;One thing I want to say. I got my first one almost 2 years ago and I am STILL USING IT. I don&#x27;t know why they say they last 3 or 4 months I guess to sell more. My first one looks like the day I got it. You do have to rinse it out after your shower just like a wash cloth. I put mine the dishwasher every 2 monts to get it real clean.</li>
            <li> All this product is is an overpriced loofah aimed at men. Save a few bucks and just buy a generic loofah, or if you are male and embarrassed to buy a loofah, like myself, have a friend buy it for you.</li>
            <li> I purchased the \\&quot;detailer\\&quot; at my local Wal-Mart two days ago. After reading reviews and buying into all the hype, I figured, I&#x27;d give it a try. Thirty seconds into my first attempt at using this thing and I was ready to toss it into the nearest trash receptacle. The \\&quot;poofy\\&quot; side is little more than a big knot of mesh that could be purchased at my local \\&quot;Dollar-General\\&quot; for, you guessed it...one dollar. The \\&quot;poofy\\&quot; side was small and harsh ans required me to use three times the amount of body wash as my old method, only to yield about no soap suds. The other side of the detailer,....well, let&#x27;s just say that I would rather drag a bar of lava soap across my body than try to use it. I&#x27;m all for giving things a second chance and before I deep-sixed this thing, I decided to give it one more try. Same results except that this time my axe detailer went right into the trash. Overall, this thing was a complete waste of my money. It is not designed well and much too harsh unless you have skin like an armadillo. Don&#x27;t pay for the name on this thing. Save your money and buy a manly colored poofy for $.99 and you&#x27;ll be better off.</li>
            <li> After watching the commercials, I still had no idea what this thing did. It&#x27;s a scrubby for the shower -- specifically for male genitalia. At least that seems to be how it was marketed. Stupid, beyond stupid. A product for Neanderthals.</li>
            <li> I ordered a 4-pack of these, got 2 blue and 2 red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Easier to grip than a normal loofah.  Multiple colors make it easy to differentiate for showers with multiple users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Seems to require more soap than my older loofah to get proper lather.  I have not found a use for the &#x27;scrub side&#x27;, the lather side seems to do a better job for either scrubbing or lathering, scrub side has scrubbing power of soft washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternate Pick:  Dove&#x27;s Men +Care Shower tool:  The lather side is a bit more scrubby, the scrub side of dove&#x27;s version is also a bit tougher, but still not great.  However, the grip on dove&#x27;s version is not quite as comfortable for my hands.</li>
            <li> This is really a fancy version of a mesh sponge/loofah. The puffy mesh side works wonderfully and really builds up a nice lather. The red side is more like a fuzzy, soft, spongey pillow. It&#x27;s not too abrasive but does do a nice job exfoliating. It rinses well and the cord to hang it from the faucet is a nice, handy, touch. It dries pretty quickly. Really should be used only with liquid soap as hard soaps will cake up and dry on the shower tool.    I&#x27;ve found that my son is using this during each shower now whereas he didn&#x27;t every want to use one of those pastel mesh sponges because \\&quot;they were for girls.\\&quot; This is definitely not for girls. It even looks like a guy thing. Good product.</li>
            <li> Wow - I can&#x27;t believe it took this long for a product like this to be made. It&#x27;s a great solution for the loofah and puff!  My son used this product since he has been using Axe products for a few years now and these were his thoughts on it -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Ergonomic, comfortable to hold and use.&lt;br /&gt;- Scrub side (red) is great for exfoliating, esp. hands and feet.  Plus, unlike a regular loofah, it seems like it would be less likely to have bacteria grow quickly since it isn&#x27;t a natural product.&lt;br /&gt;- Mesh side takes the place of the puff he used before to get a good lather going.  He said the mesh side was even better than a puff because it retained more shower gel and still had a great lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The first time using it, the mesh side is a bit rough.&lt;br /&gt;- Not as good for the environment vs. a loofah since it is man-made, while a loofah is a plant.</li>
            <li> Great scrub with 2 different types of scrubbing. They lather pretty well, not the best. The tightness of the bundle wears of in about 6 months, but it&#x27;s pretty decent.</li>
            <li> If you are used to using loofahs then you will love the addition of a harder scrubbing section. The soft side is soft enough not to feel like sand paper yet hard enough to give a good exfoliation. The rougher side is great for buffing, not eliminating those trouble rough spots on your body, IE knees, elbows and soles of the feet. All in all a great product but a little expensive if you are used to buying 0.85 loofahs from Walmart.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve all used those \\&quot;poofy\\&quot; scubbers that use shower gel instead of bar soap (at least many of us have).  This is the same thing with an added \\&quot;hard Scrubber\\&quot; added to one side that allows you to really \\&quot;get in\\&quot; to those parts that you want to well, scrub harder at.  For that, it&#x27;s tops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rubber over mold helps with grip, and it works as well as you can imagine.  I didn&#x27;t think it would make that much of a difference but for what it is...it&#x27;s the best \\&quot;poofy scrubber\\&quot; out there.  Best of all..it&#x27;s in black and red, and not those fruity pink and violet colors that seem more suited to women.  Kudos.</li>
            <li> You know, actually this is a good idea. A lot of girls have skin brushes for deep exfoliation, but I don&#x27;t know any men who do. Skin brushing (dry or wet) is very good for your overall health, as it assists you body&#x27;s natural detox process. And having a two-in-one product like the Axe Shower Tool is nice because&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A) It&#x27;s manly-looking, as appeals to manly-men&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;br /&gt;B) It saves time and precious shower storage space&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the design of the actual product is a bit on the flimsy side (especially considering the price) and, I hate to say it, somewhat awkward to hold. Best to borrow the little woman&#x27;s skin brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GRADE: C+</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to use the shower tool for a period of a week. I typically use a scrubby that is soft and shapeless, or a scrubby with a long handle, so you can scrub your back with it. I like both of those. I did NOT like this product. Asthetically, it is very homely looking, more like something you would scrub a car with. As a shower scrubby, it is too rigid, does not conform to &#x27;body parts&#x27; comfortably, and is not comfortable to hold for a period of time in your hand.</li>
            <li> Works fine and your get four for a great price.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy an Axe Detailer the first time I saw it.  It seemed a little too expensive, and as a person not too hung up on a macho exterior, I didn&#x27;t think it would make a significant difference from anything else I already used.  I took the leap of faith at a grocery store where I saw them on sale.  I decided to give it a whirl, and I&#x27;ve been a fan ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Axe detailer has two distinct parts -- the regular bath sponge part in black and the red \\&quot;detailer\\&quot; that is for the rougher parts of the body like feet and elbows.  While I have not found the detailer part incredibly helpful in my scrubbing routine, I think the black sponge part has held up remarkably well.  With other bath sponges, they seem to come unraveled within the space of a week or two.  I&#x27;m happy to report that I&#x27;ve been using my Axe Detailer for over two months, and it&#x27;s held up incredibly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you don&#x27;t use Axe products, or even if you&#x27;re a woman, give the Axe Detailer a try.  Forget the brand image -- this product is remarkably adept at cleaning your body!</li>
            <li> its a shower tool, it does what its advertised to do</li>
            <li> My husband is a big fan of Axe products, so I was intrigued by this product. The soft side is just a traditional synthetic loofah, but the tighter weave of the scrubbing side is a wonderful addition for rougher skin. It&#x27;s easy to hang onto, even when soapy, and lathers well. All in all, a great \\&quot;shower tool\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The axe shower tool is a great way to exfoliate your skin without buying a natural loofah. Natural loofahs seem to work better but are usually hard to hold onto, especially when they&#x27;re loaded up with soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mesh material used to make it does a good job without being overly rough. The tool itself fits perfectly in my palm and is simple to use (I&#x27;m male and have large hands, FYI).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see this for about 3 bucks each at Target and having used it, would most likely buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> I had to try the Axe detailer tool when it came out because I&#x27;m a Axe fanatic. I use Axe body spray, body wash, deoderant, everything they make. While their shower tool was a little weird getting used to in the beginning, I find it hard to not use it now. I love it and anyone who does labor work like myself such as warehouse or construction work, you will really enjoy the rough side of the tool for your feet. I say that anyone who is a little interested in this product just needs to try it. It was worth it for me.</li>
            <li> The masculine design of the Axe Detailer Shower Tool is geared for manly men, though I wonder if guys would really want something like this.  I&#x27;ve used the shower tool for months now, alternating between it and a regular soap scrunchy, and honestly I like the scrunchy better.  While the Shower Tool is designed to be gripped, and each side is designed for the intensity of scrub desired, I&#x27;m more inclined for something more minimal and less (gender) overdetermined.  Plus, I wonder do we really need another plastic bath accessory?  To the product&#x27;s credit, this shower tool will last you for a long time.</li>
            <li> Everything was great.</li>
            <li> Good quality. Recommended. And I would love to buy again.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good manly version of the shower tool. However, I do wish that the net part of the item would last a little bit longer. It starts to tear off after a couple of weeks. Have to be careful not to scrub too hard.</li>
            <li> scraper is fantastic. I have a girly loofah but it doesn&#x27;t feel like it scrubs rougher so I had to get this no matter the cost.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice scrubber but I think I&#x27;ll stick with a wash cloth!  It does create a nice lather with liquid soaps (which I dislike as they tend to leave a slimy residue) but it is no good for washing your back and a bit rough for your face.  Also, the rubber grip becomes slippery when wet/soapy and is difficult to keep hold of.</li>
            <li> I gave this \\&quot;tool\\&quot; an average rating.  It does do what it promises but it falls short on innovation.  The soft mesh are a dime a dozen at any wal-mart and the rough side does the exact job a hand towel can do.  Putting them together... good marketing, not a great idea.  You can get the mesh and a hand towel for a fraction of what this sells for.      The biggest problem with putting them together is that when one side wears out you must replace them both.  A hand towel lasts forever and you don&#x27;t need to replace it when the mesh wears down, unless you own this product.    So, I&#x27;m using my last one.  I see no reason to get more of these.  Just pick up your own and save the cash.</li>
            <li> Sorry about that, but I recently discovered Robert E. Howard&#x27;s [[ASIN:0345490177 Kull: Exile of Atlantis]], and I couldn&#x27;t resist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As readers of my Vine reviews have noted, I&#x27;ve long believed that men and women are similar enough that they can use each other&#x27;s health and personal care items but that in order to market said products to both men and women, changes may be required.  The Axe Detailer Shower Tool is a perfect example of this as it is rather obviously just another lowly [[ASIN:B000GCAJB2 Foaming Shower Pouf]]... with a sex change.  Gone are the lovely pastels, replaced by a manly black and red.  A rubber tire grip allows you to apply masculine force and direction to the problem while the red pad provides exfoliation for those men who need it.  Note: care must be exercised as the pad is quite abrasive.  If your choice of career or lifestyle does not produce calluses, you are advised to use it sparingly in order to avoid screaming like a little girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over a month of daily use with [[ASIN:B001B4S0XS Gillette Oil Control Face + Body Wash]] and [[ASIN:B0019R39JW Gillette Shampoo + Body Wash]] produced excellent results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why only four stars?  Because there is already another product on the market that outdoes it: [[ASIN:B00198JG6Q Salux Japanese Beauty Skin Cloth]].  Salux or other brand flat nylon mesh cloths are superior IMHO for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Unlike the Axe the Salux cloth can be used to scrub the back with a two-hand motion.&lt;br /&gt;2. Unlike the Axe the Salux cloth works quite well with bar soap.&lt;br /&gt;3. The Salux cloth is much better for cleaning nooks and crannies like between the toes.&lt;br /&gt;4. A Salux cloth packs a lot smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good try, Axe, but I&#x27;m going back to my Salux.</li>
            <li> Scrubber is good.  Man like scrubber.  I used on my elbows and knees and feet.  I&#x27;m soft now.</li>
            <li> Once your order has been submitted, make sure you give Amazon.com a call to confirm that your order will come in a pack of 4 (as mentioned in the product description). I was sent just 1 and had to return it while Amazon worked to send me a pack of 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as quality goes, I like the material. However, I do not like how the product is designed. The mesh side is too compact that the rubber gets in the way of cleaner. They need mesh to expand a little more. The rough side should only be used for tough areas (like the soles of your feet etc.).</li>
            <li> As the title says. You are going to save money. Just buy it here instead of driving out to a local store to get them.&lt;br /&gt;the Axe scrubber is so much better than the other brands. I love the grip that they have on the side, it makes it easy so hold on to.&lt;br /&gt;And the other side is used for hard places such as your elbows or the bottom of your feet.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy! Recommend for people who wanna scrub off all the dirt!</li>
            <li> This is probably the best one i&#x27;ve ever bought.  The others don&#x27;t seem to last more than a few weeks, this one is very sturdy and &amp;#34;built for a man&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My husband uses these.  He likes that there is a rough side along with the normal loofa.</li>
            <li> Nice. Not sure what these things are called (sponges/loofahs?) but this thing is pretty nice. Has a hard scrubbing pad on one side and a normal body wash sponge like thing on the other side. Housing is firm, but flexible, rubber so it seems it&#x27;ll last awhile. Elastic lanyard is pretty sturdy as well.</li>
            <li> It works well, looks good and does the job.  Dove for Men has a version of this too - it&#x27;s just as good but for now only comes in a light blue color.  I like the look of the Axe brand better.</li>
            <li> God I love Axe! Great commercials, smart marketing department, and it seems like they are pioneers! This is the MEN&#x27;S loofa! Strong, sturdy, and long lasting! I got the three pack and they lasted a year!</li>
            <li> soft and clean up all body. can use bar or liquid soap, feel so clean after bath. and also long life</li>
            <li> The surface area is too small.  It is surrounded by a massive plastic ring making it impossible to use the sides of the detailer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overpriced for functionally worthless sponge.</li>
            <li> This is the mans&#x27; Loofah!  It has a hard shell on one side.  And a soft on the other.  This is perfect to shower with.  Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The best mens shower scrubber! Last forever, indestructable!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really worth buying this item. It&#x27;s basically the poof you can buy for a buck fifty, with an added scruffy pad for your calluses -- BUT, it doesn&#x27;t really remove calluses. It isn&#x27;t very good. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this item again.</li>
            <li> Good quality materials and a good price. The finer side is very rough so I&#x27;d recommend just the regular side. Easy to grip and cleans great, definately recommmend!</li>
            <li> Not as fond of them as I thought I would be. They&#x27;re kinda small, about the size of a softball. They do scrub well though.</li>
            <li> These work great!!! Lathe side and scrub side in a handheld size good grip form, what else can I say?</li>
            <li> These things are overpriced but my sons love them so I continue to purchase them. This was a better deal than buying one at a time. Eventually they fall apart and have to be replaced but they&#x27;re better than the cheaper versions made originally for us ladies.</li>
            <li> I love it. It has 2 sides, a soft loofa and a scrubber loofa. You can use bar or liquid soap to lather ot and it stays lathered up well. Feels like it exfoliates, but does not irritate the skin. has a wrist strap I use to hang it on the faucet. good palm grip size. Travel friendly. Great for boys or girls, home or away!</li>
            <li> I think this \\&quot;detailer\\&quot; is great.  The price is fair, and I like flipping it over for the coarse side for my feet - and the soft side for everywhere else.</li>
            <li> I liked it. It looks snazzy. It does its work. It has a nice design. I got both the red and blue colored one. It is NOT of cheap quality. My only problem with it is that it is a bit too heavy. When you are in shower you do not want something so heavy...but like I said it serves the purpose and it looks snazzy.</li>
            <li> I love using this product... I have big hands, but have had trouble gripping these things in the past... the rubber around the product makes it easy to grasp, squeeze out and hold. The Luffa stays together, not tearing apart like some other ones I&#x27;ve bought. I&#x27;m a rough scrubber and this has held up to the task without being too rough or hard. Overall, very happy.</li>
            <li> People keep stealing mine out of my shower bag kit for some reason.  What kind of a sick bastard steals another mans shower body scrubber?  I dig them and the rough side gets the dirt out.  Feels good on the feet though.  Don&#x27;t recommend using if you got sun burns though.  LoL.</li>
            <li> Great deal for a pack of these for the hubby!</li>
            <li> The Good: The Axe Detailer Shower Tool is great for exfoliating dead skin. The 4 pack offers a convenient buying method and I&#x27;ve found that one tool will last 3 months before needing replacement. At first the red side was very rough on my skin and I was afraid of scratching myself, but after a few uses you really get used to it and feel more clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad: The rubber holding the detailer together does not allow for much flexibility. You are basically stuck with using the detailer as is, and you can&#x27;t flex to meet the contours of your body. I&#x27;ve found that when I try to reshape it the product life is far less and needs replacement after just one month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: A man&#x27;s body is different and more rugged and therefore needs a different kind of tool to clean it. Women won&#x27;t find this tool useful as a man would. I found that the traditional shower loofa just wasn&#x27;t cutting it for me, I needed something more. Although the product isn&#x27;t perfect, it was exactly what I needed to get a deep clean.</li>
            <li> I used to use regular loofahs, but I hated how they would break down after a week or so. Then I found the Axe loofahs. Thanks to the fact that the loofah part of the Detailer is sewn in, it lasts MUCH longer without falling apart. I use one of these for at least 3-5 months before I have to change. Yes, these are expensive, but if you consider the amount you would spend on loofahs in that 3-5 months they probably cost the same (or less...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the price of these on Amazon is not super cheap, it is in line with a sale in a store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: best loofah ever, even at $4 each.</li>
            <li> One satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> It really sucks that the Axe Shower Tool was advertised as a pack of four then suddenly changed charging me over $20.00 for only one. I didn&#x27;t realize it until I viewed my purchase history.</li>
            <li> If your man chooses to groom&lt;br /&gt;Himself inside a locker room&lt;br /&gt;Get him THIS tool for the shower&lt;br /&gt;A manly AXE with scrubbing power&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appearance wise, this is a hit&lt;br /&gt;A rubber \\&quot;tire\\&quot; surrounds it&lt;br /&gt;So he can grip his sturdy AXE&lt;br /&gt;And purge the dirt from out the tracks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For getting into all the cracks&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no real need to use this AXE&lt;br /&gt;Unless you&#x27;ve oil and grime galore&lt;br /&gt;From cleaning seabirds on the shore&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mesh side lathers up real quick&lt;br /&gt;And is the side that you should pick&lt;br /&gt;The other is like coarse sandpaper&lt;br /&gt;In case your skin requires a scraper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware the red side if your skin&lt;br /&gt;Is sensitive or very thin&lt;br /&gt;Scrub your elbows and your heels&lt;br /&gt;To understand how raw skin feels&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t that this product sucks&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s kinda cool - but for four bucks?&lt;br /&gt;A bath net sponge performs just fine&lt;br /&gt;And costs a dollar ninety nine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amanda Richards, July 14, 2008</li>
            <li> The Axe Detailer Shower Tool comes in an easy open package. However, the Axe shower tool&#x27;s only real advantage over any other loofah is that it has a black grip surrounding it which makes it less vulnerable to slip through the user&#x27;s hand while in the shower. The shower tool&#x27;s red abrasive \\&quot;scrubbing\\&quot; surface is not much more effective at cleaning the body&#x27;s extremities than normal scrubbing alone. Overall, the design of the tool is geared towards males, but its function is no more effective than any other loofah on the market.</li>
            <li> I find the Axe Detailer Shower Tool to be rough and scratchy.  It would be great for removing paint, tar, or glue from tougher parts of your body, but is very coarse for general shower use.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  Easy to handle and perfect for mens heavy scrubing. Excellent product.  Wish it was available years ago.</li>
            <li> Finally a shower tool made for men. A magnificent blend of form and function. Love the red and black motif, and the rough scrub side and gentle lather side gets the job done. Well satisfied with this product, will definitely buy these goodies next time I run out.</li>
            <li> Soap is OK, and just that.  The cleansing unit is small and rough on one side, and simply plastic on the other.  Really disappointing.</li>
            <li> great gift for my husband much more manly then puffs I use</li>
            <li> Unfortunately there are not too many alternatives. It&#x27;s great to have the scrubbing/lathering sides, but too often the later side starts falling apart too soon. Tried the Dove one as well, same problem. Seems like they are designed to fall apart easily.</li>
            <li> These scrubbers are excellent for removing dirt and grime. You can use one side of arms, legs, shoulders,etc and the small circular area (which is a lot rougher) for grimier spots like ankles and feet to help remove dirt buildup. These have been very effective and nice to have in the shower. They also last quite a while unlike the girlie loofahs I used to purchase.</li>
            <li> It would be fine if you worked in a coal mine to scrub the coal dust off. But for me this thing is very rough on the skin.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend originally bought these and he really digs them. So I decided to try it out..Now we both like them :D</li>
            <li> since it is sold with men in mind it should bigger since men are bigger. the two surfaces are great for men who have a lot to scrub off</li>
            <li> This is great since I am on a Military base and have common showers.  Makes good lather.  I use the softer side and the rough side on my feet!  Maybe I am a big baby, but it hurts to use the rough side anywhere else.</li>
            <li> The sponge was too small.  It did not appear to be very useful in the shower.  I used it twice and then placed in the trash can.</li>
            <li> This has much more eye appeal than it does practicality. It is not nearly as easy or effective to use as a basic scrungee, it also took more liquid soap to lather up.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.  I bought a 4 pack and might as well throw them out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the detailer for a couple of years now. In my opinion it is perfect - the gripper and ease of scrubbing yourself clean is just right. Whoever came up with this is a marketing genius. My wife used to have these scrubbies in the shower, but my manliness would never allow me to use one of those. Girls- get one of these for your man, he will love it. Guys - pick one up, and you will love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using one of these Axe Shower Tools for a year now and it&#x27;s showing no signs of wear.  I guess I&#x27;ll have to give the other 3 away to friends.</li>
            <li> put a ton of soap on it, and after rubbing your arm there is no more soap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;should be bigger cause a man is bigger than a women</li>
            <li> Honestly, when I first saw the commercial for this, my friends and I laughed, believing it to be nothing more than a glorified scrub for men.  Recently, I had the chance to try one, and I guess the adage about how one shouldn&#x27;t judge a book by its cover (or in this case, a shower tool by its ad) is still true.  &#x27;The more you know...&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros - the &#x27;soft&#x27; dark scrubber side leaves skin feeling cleaner and more exfoliated.  The red side has the texture of a steel pan scrubber - only softer, and it works great for tough jobs, as advertised.  They are also rather durable - as an experiment, I used the same scrub daily for over half a year, and only after did the soft side start to separate from the main shell.  However, for hygiene purposes, I recommend replacing these as often as you would your toothbrush.  For those who enjoy outdoor sports and/or frequent trips to the gym, this tool will come in handy for getting the sweat and grime off after a workout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those with sensitive skin, you may not like the texture of the Axe Shower Tool in the beginning, but after a few uses, you&#x27;ll likely start to enjoy it.  It&#x27;s kind of like breaking in a pair of boat shoes, the more you use it - the more comfortable it becomes.  Also, I admit that the price leaves something to be desired - perhaps pick one up when it&#x27;s on sale to see if you like it before jumping on the bandwagon and getting a pack of four on Amazon.  However, definitely try sticking with the tool even if the first few uses aren&#x27;t too pleasant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the \\&quot;female\\&quot; liquid soap scrubs for 3 years. Saw this the other day at my local grocery store, for $4.99, bought it &amp; tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 3 uses, I \\&quot;TOSSED IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;What a waste. No, it doesn&#x27;t come close to lathering up the soap like the $1 store ones do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, being honest here, when it comes to cleaning my \\&quot;private parts\\&quot;, fugheddaboudit!!&lt;br /&gt;Not even close. The \\&quot;fluff side\\&quot; is harsh, and doesn&#x27;t get where you need it too, easily/comfortably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t go on, please, take my word,LUCKY I gave it 2 Stars, I guess I gave the extra star for Axe&#x27;s \\&quot;EFFORT\\&quot; to make a MAN&#x27;S Product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing they got right is, it&#x27;s a detail TOOL!!&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t even ATTEMPT to try it on my car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STAY with the scrubbees @ the Dollar Store.</li>
            <li> Works great, I subscribed to get one every 3 months!</li>
            <li> Welp, the title says it all. I&#x27;m puzzled as to why this review section is riddled with posts of people complaining about this scrubber being &amp;#34;too complex&amp;#34;. For Christ&#x27;s sake, you put soap on it and wash your body! Stop complaining about there being a rough side on the darn thing! It&#x27;s there so you have a choice. If you don&#x27;t want to use the rough, exfoliating side then don&#x27;t use it!  Additionally, I see some poor reviews being given as a result of the product being too difficult to hold - another puzzling complaint. This thing is only about three inches wide so unless you&#x27;re an oompa loompa or have the grip strength of a 98 year old woman with arthritis who bathes in WD40, I can&#x27;t see how anyone could not grip this thing.  The detailer is a simple product with a simple purpose: a sponge for washing yourself with two different scrubbing surfaces for you to choose from. Stop over thinking things, people. Oh, and this thing lasts a damn long time and I love the rough scrubbing surface which is why I&#x27;m giving it five stars.</li>
            <li> Does as described but more scratchy then over brands which I prefer.</li>
            <li> They are as described in the discription. I got 2 greyish green and 2 red (I am slightly colorblind though, so take that as you will).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;They clean you.&lt;br /&gt;There is a little string to hang it up when you&#x27;re done&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;The string on mine came out. (this is not a big issue)</li>
            <li> A bit on the rough side.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this item paired with the [[ASIN:B0012N0XY2 Axe  Skin Contact Purifying Shower Gel, 12-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 4)]].  I really do feel more energized and clean, especially after I run / workout.  The handle section gives it a more masculine appeal, but honestly this is just like any normal bath scrubbing device.  I like the addition of two sides, which is handy for scrubbing deep when using the rougher flat side to exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem... this pack comes with four of these shower tools.  Honestly that&#x27;s not that bad, but really I can&#x27;t imagine needing more than two of these within a year or even two years.  These are well made and don&#x27;t seem to be the kind of item that readily needs to be replaced anytime soon.  An extra for the spare bathroom or possibly a backup for the gym bag, maybe... but honestly I can&#x27;t figure out what to do with the other leftovers.  Other than this, I have no complaints and have happily changed my daily routine to include using this shower accessory.</li>
            <li> This product is really a loofah.  And we all know loofahs are for girls, right?  Axe has figured out a way to market loofahs to guys.  One side is rough, because guys are rough.  The other side is soft, for more delicate areas.  The Axe Detailer isn&#x27;t rocket science, just brilliant marketing.</li>
            <li> It looks nice and works well, there&#x27;s not much to say about it. Axe recommends you replace it every 4-6 weeks, I toss mine in the washing machine once a week with a little color safe bleach and some Tide. I do own a couple of these as they work well, but even with my weekly tossing em in the washing machine I don&#x27;t want to use the same one every day forever :)    If you can find the body wash in the special package it will come with an \\&quot;Axe Shower Hook-Up\\&quot; which is a suction cup thing that&#x27;ll hold your bottle to your shower wall. It also has a little hook on the bottom to hang your Axe Detailer.  It&#x27;s pretty ingenious, but my bottle doesn&#x27;t always stay in place.    Maybe it&#x27;s all in my mind but after showering and using my Axe Detailer(tm) lathered with Axe Recovery(tm) I feel cleaner.  Axe Recovery also smells VERY GOOD.  With Snake Peel being a close 2nd IMHO.    This is basically a more manly pouf, the red scrubby on the front is nice, but I don&#x27;t suggest you scrubbin&#x27; ya privates with it *ouch* it&#x27;s pretty rough.  And the rubber grips all around it make it easy to hold and better for applying pressure when you&#x27;re really scrubbing.    I approve of this product, and my ultimate goal is to have 7 bottles of different Axe Shower Gel, each on their own Axe Shower Hook-Up that has it&#x27;s own Axe Detailer on it. One for each day of the week. A bit excessive? probably, but it will look cool and you can never be too clean :)</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;cover&amp;#34; gets in the way for completely using in tight areas. For me this only works as a body wash no personal areas can be reached with this.</li>
            <li> Love these shower tool&#x27;s - and everyone I give one of these to as a gift also loves them!</li>
            <li> This product title says you get a quantity of 4.. which explains the price of around 15$, I was buying in bulk.  But, it arrived and I only received one detailer.  Very frustrated, and feel taken advantage of.  This is a dupe, and is very misleading.</li>
            <li> I am a guy with big hands and this is very hard to hold . I don&#x27;t think it is any nicer than a dollar one . would not buy this again ever .</li>
            <li> i got these for a family member and they loved them. and I would recommend this product to any one reading this</li>
            <li> Unusable - I had to throw mine out. The material is stiff, horribly scratchy, and doesn&#x27;t allow shower gel to lather very well. Would be better suited for cleaning car tires or farm animals.</li>
            <li> The marketing makes it seem useful, but the \\&quot;detailer\\&quot; is useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t lather--the product seems specifically designed to waste as much overpriced axe-brand scented body wash as possible.  It requires around 3-5 times more soap to finish a shower with this thing.  The manly rubber grips don&#x27;t actually make it any easier to hold.  Positives... I like the little loopy thing, and not holding onto the scrubbing part might make it last longer.  Of course, the packaging tells you to buy a new one every month.  No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy a regular shower scrubber, and an abrasive one if you really need it.  While you&#x27;re at it, buy some soap or shower gel that doesn&#x27;t play into our culture&#x27;s masculine insecurities to sell a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Axe - because real men perfume themselves and use sandpaper on their elbows.  Apparently.</li>
            <li> Works just as expected. They do not sell in Brooklyn NY</li>
            <li> He got this for a gift and I loved the color. I totally stole it from him as my legs get really ichy in the wintertime and the scrubby side felt great and worked wonderfully to get all the loose dry skin off. It sounds gross but it does what it&#x27;s supposed too. I love to scratch and I almost wish this was rougher.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this.  He uses the puff traditionally, and says the other side is great for his hands, or stubborn dirt spots.</li>
            <li> when i try these  &amp;#34;Axe Detailer Shower&amp;#34; hurt&#x27;s me  especially at first time, however it&#x27;s getting softer when you re-use it many times. I&#x27;ve used these for whole year and still used till something bad happen to  mine. You can give two of shower tool to your family member like what i did, so they can thanks you when they use it too.</li>
            <li> It comes with the poofy stuff all tight, but after a few showers they get loose and start to come out.  This means you wont get as clean as when its new.  It would be ok if it didnt happen after 3 showers.</li>
            <li> I received 1 Tool, for those wondering about the quantity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m angry because it says pack of 4. I only resourced 1. Rip off that I won&#x27;t let go until resolved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;After feeling miffed about being jipped, I sent them an email telling em I was annoyed. So they did the nice thing and they&#x27;re sending me the rest. Hopefully it&#x27;ll all be in the box- I&#x27;ll update again when it arrives.</li>
            <li> Good scrubber so far holding up well.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like these. I started getting into the Dr. Bronners liquid soaps, and you really need a loofah to apply them. I thought these would be nice manly loofahs (and I guess they still are) but functionally, they&#x27;re lack-luster. It doesn&#x27;t foam nearly as well as a standard loofah for a given amount of soap -- so basically you have to use more soap. And the bristly side isn&#x27;t really bristly; coarse yes, but not very effective.</li>
            <li> The only thing sadder than reading the reviews for a loofah is writing one.</li>
            <li> Want to feel like a man without descending into the darkside of the loufa? Here&#x27;s your ticket and your best chance to experience the gratifying effects of a loufa without the stigma surrounding it. Meet the Axe detailer shower tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little man of a sponge will soak up your favorite manly body wash, and apply with greatest of ease while you still retain your badboy status. Flip this little bugger around and you have the &amp;#34;rough side&amp;#34; as I like to call it. AWESOME for getting off those dead skin cells from the bottoms of your feet. Just make sure you do not use this side on your junk. Whoa boy. What are you waiting for, buy this now!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a grown man stay away from this. It&#x27;s made for Tweens and teens. Too small for a fully built man like myself. Seriously, it&#x27;s small.</li>
            <li> I like this scrubber to take care of my feet. If you have tender or sensitive skin, then I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for those areas. Just might knock the bark off if you scrub too hard.</li>
            <li> good item, feels clean after</li>
            <li> After using it 5 times already the scrubby side &amp; the mesh side are already coming apart. I didn&#x27;t use the scrubby side much because it&#x27;s too rough. The mesh side does lather nice, but can be a bit rough on the skin as well. Also the surface area is small to work with &amp; it&#x27;s kind of awkward to use. I wanted to like this product, but it&#x27;s overrated &amp; I would say it&#x27;s (not that the cost is gonna break the bank) overpriced for what it is. I&#x27;ll just stick with using a wash cloth or I&#x27;ll get a mesh pouf for 99¢.</li>
            <li> Very useful product, must have accessory for shower</li>
            <li> I thought I was just purchasing one, and even for the price, I didn&#x27;t think much of it because it was on par with all the other shower tools I looked at. BUT imagine my surprise when it showed up, in a box with a pack of 4. That&#x27;s right - I got 2 red and 2 teal Axe shower scrub tools for what I thought was the price of one. Now my man won&#x27;t have to buy another shower scrubber for quite some time, and I may steal a teal one for myself. ;)</li>
            <li> I thought this was finally a bath sponge, loofah or whatever for men but this thing was crap. It is small and doesn&#x27;t hold a lather on the loofah side. The detailer side is tough and takes up to much room.</li>
