            <li>I find this very sweet smelling, and it does smell up the whole house when it&#x27;s used.  </li>
            <li>My favorite bath vendor Blissful Bath went out of business and I am testing out new products to replace ones that they used to make.  </li>
            <li>It takes so little to make your skin soft and smell wonderful!</li>

            <li>Now it&#x27;s only available online.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, but the can size does not last long at all and for the price</li>

            <li> Wonderful, wonderful bath salts!</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Zum products, especially Frankincense and Myrrh.  I have used the bath salts, the soap, and the  roll on cologne.  Intense staying power of the fragrances, people often comment on how lovely they are.  I have tried others including Zen Scents which have poor intensity.  I have purchased these for several years and will stay with them for sure.  The lotion is so rich and hydrating, leaves a glow and smells incredible.  Great lotion.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my daughter and she loves the scent</li>
            <li> Am absolutely addicted to this scent.  Love the way it makes my skin feel, too.</li>

            <li> Zum products all seem pretty great - but this is lushly wonderful and a reasonable luxury, too!! The &amp;#34;Dragon&#x27;s Blood&amp;#34; scent is also awesome!</li>
            <li> The smell is completely overpowering.....I had to double bag it in plastic bags just so I could tolerate it in my bathroom. Only use a really small amount in your bath. When you get out, you will feel like a million bucks!</li>
            <li> I used to get this at the grocery store. Now it&#x27;s only available online. Good Stuff.</li>
            <li> This is a Must-Have for me from now on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this in a bath the other day and was just bubbling with joy :) The container is a little smaller than I was expecting, but I didn&#x27;t have to use much and it is SOOOO luxurious and wonderful. I think I&#x27;m going to try their Eucalyptus one next :)</li>

            <li> Good product but too expensive.  About $2.00 a bath.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I am ordering more.  I love your use of essential oils!!</li>
            <li> Does the job soothing and the smell is wonderful.  Softens the skin a little goes a long way will buy again</li>
