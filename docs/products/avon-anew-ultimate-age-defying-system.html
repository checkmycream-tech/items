            <li>Not looking for botox effect; still happy with effects of creams.</li>
            <li>This is a great starter kit for this product.  </li>
            <li>Again, Avon has come up with a great line of skin care products.</li>
            <li>this is the 50 plus line and even though I am in my 40&#x27;s this a great product.</li>
            <li>This product is great.</li>
            <li>Avon always makes great products.</li>
            <li>Love Avon Anew!!</li>
            <li>Face creams nice too!</li>
            <li>Once it soaks into your skin, though, it feels pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I am a faithful Avon user and credit Avon products for my good 50+ skin quality.</li>
            <li>I purchased this kit from Amazon about two weeks ago, and I&#x27;m very pleased with this system.  </li>
            <li>Worth the purchase price just for this awesome eye cream!</li>
            <li>I am fine with Avon products, they are good products and I have used them for sometime with great results</li>
            <li>I was thrilled.</li>
            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer is nice, but prefer Olay the most.</li>
            <li>The inclusion of their full size eye system makes this purchase a good buy.  </li>
            <li>and well honestly she liked the gift, Amazon was careful in the delivery considering that the package got 100% in perfect state to me.</li>
            <li>Love the eye cream the most, followed by the cleanser.</li>
            <li>Wrinkles have lessened and my skin feels more supple.  </li>
            <li>I love the delivery process.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that the moisturizer doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy.</li>
            <li>I am a fan of Avon product and Anew Ultimate Gold is perfect for my age group.  </li>
            <li>but I am satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>, though:  Bring back your best product ever:</li>
            <li>The cream located on the bottom of the jar, as well as the P.M. elixir in it&#x27;s own special compartment within the lid.  </li>
            <li>: When I first took this out of the box, I thought that this was a nice size for a travel kit or gym bag.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a great facial cleanser, try out &#x27;Purity&#x27;, from the Philosophy line.  </li>
            <li>I also liked that I could buy the complete system to be able to try all of the products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very good buy for anyone wanting the eye contour system, a substantial savings off even Avon&#x27;s sale prices, and you get the two other trial-size creams.</li>
            <li>Review By Marilyn:  I had been happily using Avon&#x27;s Dermabrasion system for a couple of months, so I wanted to try out their other Age Defying System products.  </li>
            <li>Received the product on due date and in great condition.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little starter kit, with a full size eye cream inside of it.  </li>
            <li>First, it did not do a good job removing makeup, especially eye makeup.  </li>
            <li>These are packaged perfectly for travel and last me through a couple of week long getaways.</li>
            <li>This product with its&#x27; 2 week supply of facial care necessities will be great to use on an upcoming overseas trip since the luggage we are able  to bring is very limited.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love what this does for that sensitive under eye area.  </li>
            <li>Got this Avon fun pack of creams and stuff for my mom</li>
            <li>Love it,no other words can describe it:)</li>
            <li>A great little buy !</li>
            <li>Upon first use, however, I did not like the the cleanser one bit.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Anew products for years and they provide the plump and firm that work for me, as well smooth out fine lines.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d pass on the cream cleanser as it&#x27;s too heavy, but the rest of the products are great, especially the contouring eye system.</li>
            <li>The product I really wanted was the eye contour system.  </li>
            <li>I can really feel (and tell) the difference since I&#x27;ve started using this Avon product.  </li>
            <li>The few times I used it, however, I liked it.  </li>
            <li>Nicely moisturizing, it&#x27;s not too heavy, and I&#x27;d use this again.  </li>
            <li>At 59 7/8&#x27;s, I find this particular eye care product really helps.  </li>
            <li>The eye cream is my favorite product, as I have dry mature skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this a couple of times as this made it to my travel kit and has not replaced my regular full time day cream.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 40&#x27;s, with combination skin, so finding a product that does not clog pores yet moisturizes and protects can be a challenge.    </li>
            <li>and it makes my eyes look so much nicer and younger.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  makes your skin look younger and soft</li>
            <li>The total package costs far less than ONLY the eye care product at normal price.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Review By Marilyn:  I had been happily using Avon&#x27;s Dermabrasion system for a couple of months, so I wanted to try out their other Age Defying System products.  I purchased this kit from Amazon about two weeks ago, and I&#x27;m very pleased with this system.  I&#x27;m in my early 40&#x27;s, with combination skin, so finding a product that does not clog pores yet moisturizes and protects can be a challenge.    Here&#x27;s what you get:  Age Repair Creme Cleanser: When I first took this out of the box, I thought that this was a nice size for a travel kit or gym bag. Upon first use, however, I did not like the the cleanser one bit.  First, it did not do a good job removing makeup, especially eye makeup.  Second, it feels too heavy on my skin and I wanted to wash my face again to remove the heavy feel.  If you&#x27;re looking for a great facial cleanser, try out &#x27;Purity&#x27;, from the Philosophy line.  I&#x27;ve been using this for years, and IMHO, it&#x27;s the best at removing all traces of makeup, including eye makeup, while still protecting your skin.   Day Creme SPF 25:  I&#x27;ve only used this a couple of times as this made it to my travel kit and has not replaced my regular full time day cream.  The few times I used it, however, I liked it.  Nicely moisturizing, it&#x27;s not too heavy, and I&#x27;d use this again.  Night Creme: I like it, but it comes close to the border of \\&quot;too heavy\\&quot;, a bit like the cleansing cream.  Once it soaks into your skin, though, it feels pleasant.  Contouring Eye System: The hit in this system is the dual eye cream system.  The inclusion of their full size eye system makes this purchase a good buy.  I absolutely love what this does for that sensitive under eye area.  The system has two components: The cream located on the bottom of the jar, as well as the P.M. elixir in it&#x27;s own special compartment within the lid.  You use the cream for the entire eye area (lid, undereye, eye temple area) in both the a.m. &amp; p.m.  In the p.m., you apply the elixir for the under eye and eye temple area.Summary:  I&#x27;d purchase this again in a heartbeat.  Sizes are perfect for travel and/or the gym bag.  I&#x27;d pass on the cream cleanser as it&#x27;s too heavy, but the rest of the products are great, especially the contouring eye system.</li>
            <li> I am a faithful Avon user and credit Avon products for my good 50+ skin quality. This set is an especially good value and makes a great travel kit.</li>
            <li> The product I really wanted was the eye contour system.  At 59 7/8&#x27;s, I find this particular eye care product really helps.

It&#x27;s a very good buy for anyone wanting the eye contour system, a substantial savings off even Avon&#x27;s sale prices, and you get the two other trial-size creams.</li>
            <li> My wife is happy, I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> Perfecto! I have been using Anew products for years and they provide the plump and firm that work for me, as well smooth out fine lines. Not looking for botox effect; still happy with effects of creams. Skin over 55.</li>
            <li> Great deal! Arrived sooner than promised. I was thrilled. I would order it again ay time.</li>
            <li> Love the eye cream the most, followed by the cleanser. The moisturizer is nice, but prefer Olay the most.</li>
            <li> This is a great starter kit for this product.  I can really feel (and tell) the difference since I&#x27;ve started using this Avon product.  Wrinkles have lessened and my skin feels more supple.  Again, Avon has come up with a great line of skin care products.</li>
            <li> I am fine with Avon products, they are good products and I have used them for sometime with great results and I recommend them to everyone. It is the seller of this product through Amazon with whom I have an issue. I received the product in a package which seal was already broken and it was not possible to know if this had been a return to them or the creams had been used because in the shipping they get shifted. I will never buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I love the delivery process.  Received the product on due date and in great condition.  I find this Avon product a bit greasy but don&#x27;t mind because my skin is so dry.  I like the eye cream.  A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  makes your skin look younger and soft I liked it.</li>
            <li> Makes the skin glow and erases wrinkles beautifully - since I&#x27;ve used it everyone tells me how &amp;#34;bright&amp;#34; I look!</li>
            <li> I used it in the past and I had to order it again. I love this product. this is the 50 plus line and even though I am in my 40&#x27;s this a great product. I saw softer and smoother skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great little starter kit, with a full size eye cream inside of it.  The eye cream is my favorite product, as I have dry mature skin and it makes my eyes look so much nicer and younger.  A great little buy !</li>
            <li> This product is great. I love the fact that the moisturizer doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy. I also liked that I could buy the complete system to be able to try all of the products.</li>
            <li> Love it,no other words can describe it:)</li>
            <li> This product with its&#x27; 2 week supply of facial care necessities will be great to use on an upcoming overseas trip since the luggage we are able  to bring is very limited. I am a fan of Avon product and Anew Ultimate Gold is perfect for my age group.  It is a little &amp;#34;pricey&amp;#34; and I won&#x27;t use the facial cleanser but I am satisfied with it.  Note to Avon, though:  Bring back your best product ever: Anew Ultimate Gold Emulsion!!!!</li>
            <li> Eye cream lasts forever! Worth the purchase price just for this awesome eye cream! Face creams nice too! Avon always makes great products.</li>
            <li> Item arrived in a timely manner,  but product did not produce any big change in my complexion.</li>
            <li> Got this Avon fun pack of creams and stuff for my mom and well honestly she liked the gift, Amazon was careful in the delivery considering that the package got 100% in perfect state to me.</li>
            <li> Love Avon Anew!! These are packaged perfectly for travel and last me through a couple of week long getaways.</li>
