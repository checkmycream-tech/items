            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>I love this stamper!!!!!  </li>
            <li>The scraper wasn&#x27;t so great.</li>
            <li>Very nice</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind waiting for something if it&#x27;s going to be good quality</li>
            <li>The stamper works perfectly and is consistent.</li>
            <li>And I am so loving it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving my stampers from Cheeky</li>
            <li>Works good,  I haven&#x27;t been able to get it to pick up an image 100% yet.  </li>
            <li>Primed with Mr Clean magic eraser they work great.</li>
            <li>Very cheap quality.  </li>
            <li>This thing is huge!</li>
            <li>tried so many times and it just messes up my manicure.&lt;br /&gt;so</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the set.</li>
            <li>I love all of the VAGA stampers in every shape and texture.  </li>
            <li>I have a cheap sample I paid more for this one</li>
            <li>To remove oil buffed it lightly 3-4 times afterward had no problem :).</li>
            <li>A huge wast of money.  </li>
            <li>Available in 3 sizes ...</li>
            <li>Also I was pleased to see that it was squishy and sticky very much like the marshmallow stamper</li>
            <li>one more for my collection havent really gave a good round use yet.</li>
            <li>An old credit card works better than the scrapper.  </li>
            <li>-Beauty.&lt;br /&gt;It took so long to arrive but it was worth the wait because now I&#x27;m so loving this stamper to.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off spending the extra money on a Konad stamper  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s exactly what I did.</li>
            <li>it was consistent.</li>
            <li>When received it was VERY oily and shiny, that oil and shine prevents stamper from picking up the selected image.  </li>
            <li>Really wanted this to work, now I have a bunch of plates and no stamper .</li>
            <li>The tiny side is great for isolating small images on the mural type nail plates.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to stamping.</li>
            <li>When it does work it&#x27;s very nice because of how soft it is, but I keep having to put back in or adjust the white stamp part because it&#x27;s not secure.</li>
            <li>so it wouldn&#x27;t scrape well, and I had to file and smooth it down to make it usable.</li>
            <li>First double sided stamper I&#x27;ve found that is soft on both ends of the stamper.  </li>
            <li>I stamped all nails on my right hand a few times to see how consistent it was and just like the square stamper</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on this cheap stamper.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional nail technician</li>
            <li>Many people have complained about it not working or falling out.  </li>
            <li>As far as it falling out</li>
            <li>yes it is true there is a slight problem but manageable.</li>
            <li>It is small but works good with my small nails.</li>
            <li>Both rubber stamps fell out, they barely pick up the Polish from the stamp plate.</li>
            <li>Not huge as in big foot huge but big enough so that your fingers could grip it at three different lengths.</li>
            <li>So glad I received the other pink and green stamper as a gift</li>

            <li> So you can apply a firm pressure to it and the little white rubbers won&#x27;t sink into the barrel unlike another brand where I had to stuff the barrel of the stamper with cotton balls so the stamper&#x27;s head won&#x27;t fall in.</li>

            <li> The rubber part is so soft it smooshes down and fails to pick up any polish--though it attracts dirt and dust like crazy and is difficult to clean.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a maker of softer stampers and VAGA has done it.  </li>

            <li> one more for my collection havent really gave a good round use yet.</li>
            <li> A huge wast of money.  The rubber part is so soft it smooshes down and fails to pick up any polish--though it attracts dirt and dust like crazy and is difficult to clean.  On top of that it fits badly in the plastic tube and requires constant fiddling with.  So glad I received the other pink and green stamper as a gift or I would have been SOL.</li>
            <li> So very disappointed. I will be returning on your expense.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this cheap stamper. Doesn&#x27;t pick up images well at all. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional nail technician and I ordered this product in Jan and it took over 2 months to arrive. I don&#x27;t mind waiting for something if it&#x27;s going to be good quality but this piece of junk is not worth it. Don&#x27;t even waste your time on this product. Both rubber stamps fell out, they barely pick up the Polish from the stamp plate. You&#x27;re better off spending the extra money on a Konad stamper  and that&#x27;s exactly what I did.</li>
            <li> I have a cheap sample I paid more for this one and it doesn&#x27;t work at all and it keeps falling out</li>
            <li> Really really poor quality:(&lt;br /&gt;The tips comes off the stamper and it doesn&#x27;t even picks up the design in place. HORRIBLE !!!!!</li>
            <li> OMG! These are marshmallow squishy stampers. Available in 3 sizes ...tall, short and squared.  Primed with Mr Clean magic eraser they work great. Seller needs to add an XL stamper to their collection. 2 weeks delivery.  Great product!</li>
            <li> TOOK VERY LONG TO COME IT SAYS IT WILL COME ON OCTOBER8-27 AND I PLACED THE OREDER ON SEPTEMBER13</li>
            <li> Stamps were not deep enough. Don&#x27;t waste your time on this product</li>
            <li> Squishy! No priming. Works like a charm. 💕</li>
            <li> I cant get the nail polish onto the stamper!&lt;br /&gt;I tried so many times and it just messes up my manicure.&lt;br /&gt;so sad this didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> not what I was expecting</li>
            <li> Very nice **marshmallow** squishy stamper. I misread the title and expected this to be an XL squishy but it is not as big as the XL.</li>
            <li> This thing is huge! And I am so loving it. Not huge as in big foot huge but big enough so that your fingers could grip it at three different lengths. In the picture you see slight indentations. It&#x27;s also a hard plastic and solid. I like when you remove the white little rubber and peep down into the barrel you notice a small hole which is smaller than the hole on the outside so you get a slight ledge (if that&#x27;s what you want to call it) is there to prevent the little white rubbers from falling in. So you can apply a firm pressure to it and the little white rubbers won&#x27;t sink into the barrel unlike another brand where I had to stuff the barrel of the stamper with cotton balls so the stamper&#x27;s head won&#x27;t fall in. Now, I&#x27;ve ordered a different one of this from before and both are swishy marshmellowy feeling stampers. I&#x27;m loving my stampers from Cheeky-Beauty.&lt;br /&gt;It took so long to arrive but it was worth the wait because now I&#x27;m so loving this stamper to. No weird scent and no cheap feeling fake. The stamper works perfectly and is consistent. I stamped all nails on my right hand a few times to see how consistent it was and just like the square stamper it was consistent. And just like the square stamper a tip is to return the stamper to the little bag after use because it attracts dust like a magnet. Also, the scraper doesn&#x27;t scratch your plate or anything.</li>
            <li> Works good,  I haven&#x27;t been able to get it to pick up an image 100% yet.  I definitely need some practice. It is small but works good with my small nails. I had to stuff some toilet paper in the handle because it was hollow and the white stamp would just get pushed down into the handle.</li>
            <li> Many people have complained about it not working or falling out.  When received it was VERY oily and shiny, that oil and shine prevents stamper from picking up the selected image.  To remove oil buffed it lightly 3-4 times afterward had no problem :). As far as it falling out yes it is true there is a slight problem but manageable. Also I was pleased to see that it was squishy and sticky very much like the marshmallow stamper but I&#x27;m not sure if the squishy-ness is the same /:</li>
            <li> It only picks up nail polish 20% of the time. When it does work it&#x27;s very nice because of how soft it is, but I keep having to put back in or adjust the white stamp part because it&#x27;s not secure. I&#x27;ll probably end up stuffing the tube and glue the stamper in. The scraper wasn&#x27;t so great. It was rough/jagged so it wouldn&#x27;t scrape well, and I had to file and smooth it down to make it usable.</li>
            <li> Absolutely terrible the sponge was messed up and had bumps all over it</li>
            <li> Sucks. Doesnt work. Just sux.</li>
            <li> Very cheap quality.  An old credit card works better than the scrapper.  The pads of the stampers fall out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to stamping. I enjoyed the set. Arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> I love this stamper!!!!!  First double sided stamper I&#x27;ve found that is soft on both ends of the stamper.  The tiny side is great for isolating small images on the mural type nail plates.  I love all of the VAGA stampers in every shape and texture.  It&#x27;s hard to find a maker of softer stampers and VAGA has done it.  I will continue to buy VAGA stampers!</li>
            <li> Am I the only one who had 0 luck with this? The stamper won&#x27;t pick up any nail polish whatsoever. Is there a trick here in missing? Really wanted this to work, now I have a bunch of plates and no stamper . The scraper work tho.</li>
