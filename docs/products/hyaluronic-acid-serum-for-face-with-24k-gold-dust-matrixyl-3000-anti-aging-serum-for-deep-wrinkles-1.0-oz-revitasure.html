            <li>Not a lot of people know that gold is actually really healthy for your skin and body.</li>
            <li>I also enjoyed the packaging.</li>
            <li>It is not sticky like most.</li>

            <li>I had some fine lines and light wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I have been using this and the advanced wrinkle cream together</li>

            <li>If you want smooth, glowing skin....</li>
            <li>This was such a great item to review.</li>
            <li>Overall this serum is easy to apply and feels good to the touch.</li>
            <li>This is important to me because many I&#x27;ve used before pump too much or revolves around all over the place.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She apply it over clean skin before apply my make up, and the make up goes on so smooth and feel fresh and soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love that it doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feeling and feels very lightweight.  </li>
            <li>I only recommend products or services I use and believe will be good.</li>
            <li>The Vitamin C Complex has a wonderful pump.</li>
            <li>My face feels much smoother and tighter and feels better than it has in years.  </li>
            <li>No bad smell or chemical smell.</li>
            <li>It is very hydrating and great especially as the weather is getting cooler.</li>
            <li>I was lucky to try this out and share my experience with you.</li>
            <li>Loved this product, made my face very soft and clear.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin look fresh and plump.  </li>
            <li>So far this seems to work well at keeping my skin healthy and hydrated</li>
            <li>its nice and light and fresh smelling although I was expecting a goldish tint or something to that effect due to it</li>
            <li>This one pumps the right amount</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>serum is like pure velvet, leaving your skin feeling velvety and perfecting the clarity of your facial and neck skin to the point where my pores are almost non-existent, the tone is even, there is a radiance that is amazing</li>
            <li>It feels so light hydrating and makes the skin soft and dewy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin feels so smooth soft.</li>
            <li>First, I want to talk about the packaging.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that my wrinkles are diminished and my face is more supple and younger feeling.</li>
            <li>I have bought any products and as many that I have this is the only one I use now.</li>
            <li>is a quality about this product that I haven&#x27;t found in so many of the skin care lines I have used over the last 5 or so</li>
            <li>and I cannot stop touching my face because of the sheer softness.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with facial and makeup and health products</li>
            <li>With 24K Gold Is great for skin that is dry, as it moisturizes, and helped fill my fine lines &amp; now they seem less noticeable.</li>
            <li>It looks clean and professional.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothand its gentle for your face no stinging and the first day .</li>
            <li>Intensely hydrates,helps skin retain moisture, optimize natural elasticity, reduce the appearance of wrinkles and leave skin feeling supple, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>so I really recommend it&lt;</li>
            <li>It keeps my face feeling smoother and my makeup application appears so much smoother when using this serum and moisturizer combination.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know what tiny amounts of 24k Gold are supposed to do for me, but this Hyaluronic Acid Serum used with EwVitaSure&#x27;s  Advanced Anti Wrinkle Cream</li>
            <li>guess it works, can&#x27;t really tell</li>
            <li>It perfectly fit in in my daily routine!</li>
            <li>All Natural  and Made in the USA !!!</li>
            <li>The pump dispenses the right amount, and it completely soaks into my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Oddly, right before I ran into ReVitaSure, I started getting some really old looking wrinkles around my ankles.</li>
            <li>I apply it in the morning and night and the next day I noticed a significant difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>The ingredients include Neodermyl, 24 k gold dust and hyaluronic acid along with many other ingredients listed on the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the whole ReVitaSure product line.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I&#x27;m not too far gone in the wrinkle department yet, but when offered a nice discount coupon, I had to give this a try.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The same is true for the pump on the Neo Hydrate Gold Serum.</li>
            <li>I love how much this moisturizes the skin without drying out within a few hours.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Hyaluronic Acid Serum.</li>
            <li>This seemed to tighten up my face without drying, minimize pores, and generally just felt pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>feels so fresh and younger</li>
            <li>and also I feel my skin more firm</li>
            <li>feels nice; like thick water.</li>
            <li>I love the New Hydrate Gold because it actually contains colloidal gold which acts as a natural stimulant and regenerates the cells, restores their normal elastic properties and improves the overall condition of my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and supple, and even seems brighter!</li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am likely to get, use, and recommend more of this and other ReVitaSure products.</li>
            <li>I also have no wrinkles yet but truely believe in bein pro active in preventing them.</li>
            <li>Wow just used this today. .</li>
            <li>It feels soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>so there&#x27;s no waste.</li>
            <li>I am very into skin care and apply serums twice a day on the regular.</li>
            <li>Fits my skin and soft</li>
            <li>I have always had a problem with dry skin, I used the Hyaluronic Aid Serum and it made a very noticeable difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely keep using this, the tiny lines &amp; crows feet are barely visible now, which makes me very happy!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend, even for sensitive skin types!</li>
            <li>The Neo Hydrate Gold Serum, The Vitamin C Complex and the advanced Anti Wrinkle Cream.</li>
            <li>it is clear absolutely no color .so</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Another great product from Revitasure. I apply this serum at night and I love that it doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feeling and feels very lightweight.  I have been using this and the advanced wrinkle cream together and my face looks and feels smoother. I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s and I&#x27;m all about taking care of your skin now, so you don&#x27;t regret it later.</li>
            <li> Recently, there have been a buzz in skin care industry about the use of Gold flakes, although it&#x27;s use has been known since ancient times. It helps in lightening of skin tone, fading of wrinkles. Gold is said to have anti-bacterial and anti-inflammation properties. This product also have Hyaluronic acid, Coffee extract, pumpkin seed extract, all these ingredients are proven to be beneficial to skin. I have used this product for not so long but I can see that it does make a difference in my skin. My face looks brighter and I can also feel firmness on my face. The company also doesn&#x27;t do testing on animals and it is paraben free, which is another plus for this product. With continued use I am sure to get my 50+ skin healthier.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff allot ! I like the texture and I like the scent ! its nice and light and fresh smelling although I was expecting a goldish tint or something to that effect due to it saying w/24K Gold dust on the label . it is clear absolutely no color .so this is a good thing there aren&#x27;t any harmful Dyes or perfumes. this is a fantastic product That is free of Parabens ,Not tested on animals ,All Natural  and Made in the USA !!! what more can you ask for ?&lt;br /&gt; I am really happy that I received this as part of a promotion. I am blessed to try such a great product and I do not hesitate in recommending this product to anyone !!</li>
            <li> The ReVitaSure Hyaluronic acid With 24K Gold Is great for skin that is dry, as it moisturizes, and helped fill my fine lines &amp; now they seem less noticeable. I use it in the morning, then again in the evening. My skin is soft and supple, and even seems brighter! The pump dispenses the right amount, and it completely soaks into my skin. It is unscented which is a definite plus! There is also GOLD flakes in the product, YES!! They have a complete product line, each compliments the other. I will definitely keep using this, the tiny lines &amp; crows feet are barely visible now, which makes me very happy!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product Discounted for testing purposes in exchange for my honest and unbiased review! All the opinions in this review are 100% my own!</li>
            <li> This serum is great for the wrinkles. I use it twice. Once in the morning and once at night. Next morning I can see a big difference in my skin. I can see the glow on my face. My friends and family have noticed the change in my skin. It has nice smell. The packaging is great. I have tried another product from this company and it is as good as this serum is. Actually i use this serum 1st and let it absorb on my skin and then apply the anti Wrinkle cream. the combination works amazing. I would highly recommend this product. It firms the skin on the face and reduces the fine lines, creases wrinkles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, it meets and exceeds all expectations. I really enjoy that when applied it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or greasy. There isn&#x27;t a strong odor which for me is a plus because I cant handle strongly scented things on my face. I apply it in the morning and night and the next day I noticed a significant difference in my skin. It looked firmer in places were I had some fine lines and light wrinkles. Best of all its a USA made product!!!</li>
            <li> Loved this product, made my face very soft and clear. Wrinkles relaxed and were not as deep. I would purchase it again</li>

            <li> Winter is upon us and this Hyaluronic Acid Serum For Face with 24k Gold Dust by ReVitaSure, is a great product to help keep the skin nice during the drying winter weather. It feels so light hydrating and makes the skin soft and dewy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It Intensely hydrates,helps skin retain moisture, optimize natural elasticity, reduce the appearance of wrinkles and leave skin feeling supple, soft and smooth.

Opinions stated are 100% mine! I only recommend products or services I use and believe will be good.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of serums now that I&#x27;ve tried them. For one they are water based, not oil and they contain a more potent dose of ingredients. I love the New Hydrate Gold because it actually contains colloidal gold which acts as a natural stimulant and regenerates the cells, restores their normal elastic properties and improves the overall condition of my skin. The results are astounding! I absolutely love this serum!</li>
            <li> This is a great face like cream serum very good for every day use, not too heavy&lt;br /&gt;It has help me with my dry skin and help me not to look like a snake  but glowing and also I feel my skin more firm so I really recommend it&lt;br /&gt;It is great</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it works yet or not. P my been 2 weeks since I started using it</li>
            <li> You can buy hyaluronic acid and vit c bulk and make your own serum / moisturizing creams that will be more affective...very easy to do don&#x27;t waste money on garbage there is hidden ingredients that are harmful</li>
            <li> It makes my face moist it doesn&#x27;t reduce my wrinkles. My face appears younger looking.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Rachel h.</li>
            <li> I got this because of the anti aging properties and Inlove serums.They seem go on smoother than some creams and lotions.This glided on smoothly I like how it feels on my face it does not weigh it down.I also have no wrinkles yet but truely believe in bein pro active in preventing them.Good to use these to prevent any wrinkles from appearing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks and I can already see a visible difference in my fine lines around my lips and eyes. My skin feels so smooth soft. I can&#x27;t wait to see my results in 2 months..</li>
            <li> Wow just used this today. . .My skin is normally dry.  It feels soft and hydrated.  I reccommend that you use both the moisturizer and the serum together for best results.</li>
            <li> I purchased 3 wonderful products from ReVitaSure. The Neo Hydrate Gold Serum, The Vitamin C Complex and the advanced Anti Wrinkle Cream. They are the perfect prescription for younger looking skin. First, I want to talk about the packaging. The Vitamin C Complex has a wonderful pump. This is important to me because many I&#x27;ve used before pump too much or revolves around all over the place. This one pumps the right amount so there&#x27;s no waste. The same is true for the pump on the Neo Hydrate Gold Serum. The Anti Wrinkle cream comes in a beautiful crystal jar that is pretty to look at on the counter. I love that these products have no scent. I&#x27;ve noticed that my wrinkles are diminished and my face is more supple and younger feeling. I have combination skin and have issues with products that are too greasy. This is not. I have areas where I was starting to get age spots but these products are stopping them in their tracks. I highly recommend the whole ReVitaSure product line.</li>
            <li> Great serum, I like the design of the packaging and how well it dispenses. I am very into skin care and apply serums twice a day on the regular. This is a nice serum and dries smoothly. There is no scent that lingers and goes well with the moisturizer. It keeps my face feeling smoother and my makeup application appears so much smoother when using this serum and moisturizer combination. It is very hydrating and great especially as the weather is getting cooler.</li>
            <li> Thank you for making a wonderful product Revitasure!!!! If you want smooth, glowing skin....please give this face serum a try. It has remarkable ingredients and is a top quality part of my  daily skin regiment! I received this at a discount for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I love this product it gives my skin a nice glow</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t make any difference</li>
            <li> Received the ReVitaSure Neo Hydrate Gold face serum. It comes in a nice box that is very attractive.  The bottle is sealed and has a nice pull easy strip to take off the seal.  It is in a pump bottle that is done in great colors. The ingredients include Neodermyl, 24 k gold dust and hyaluronic acid along with many other ingredients listed on the bottle.  You can apply this serum twice a day as stated on the label section. Great product.</li>

            <li> I love how much this moisturizes the skin without drying out within a few hours. I have bought any products and as many that I have this is the only one I use now. Best stuff</li>
            <li> I love this product!I put it on at night and when i get up my face looks so smooth and feel fantastic. My skin is glowing again. Im 48 yrsold and my face was starting to get dull and rough looking. I heard about Hyaluronic Acid Serum For Face With 24k Gold Dust and wanted to try it. It goes on smoothand its gentle for your face no stinging and the first day . I seen results my dead skin was peeling off.

            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it will help my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have to tell you that I love this serum!  I liked this one because it does have 24k Gold dust in it. Not a lot of people know that gold is actually really healthy for your skin and body. My pores are so much smaller. And lighter. I cant believe my face My looks awesome. It looks radiant! The serum is so lightweight on my skin and it smells delicious...makes my skin smoother. I was lucky to try this out and share my experience with you. This was such a great item to review. I also enjoyed the packaging. It looks clean and professional. Overall this serum is easy to apply and feels good to the touch. No bad smell or chemical smell. It is not sticky like most.</li>
            <li> My wife not young, and she has been using Serum for about 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;She said about this product next:&lt;br /&gt;There is a quality about this product that I haven&#x27;t found in so many of the skin care lines I have used over the last 5 or so years.&lt;br /&gt;The serum is like pure velvet, leaving your skin feeling velvety and perfecting the clarity of your facial and neck skin to the point where my pores are almost non-existent, the tone is even, there is a radiance that is amazing and I cannot stop touching my face because of the sheer softness.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use all of the products, but this one will always remain in my skin care arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;She use serum everyday with or without make up.&lt;br /&gt;She apply it over clean skin before apply my make up, and the make up goes on so smooth and feel fresh and soft.&lt;br /&gt;Her dryness is relived and noticeable little lines disappear.&lt;br /&gt;She loves this product and highly recommend it to use everyday.</li>
            <li> I have fine lines and sadly didn&#x27;t notice any results. :(</li>
            <li> Is an excellent product. Fits my skin and soft I can feel that the skin is healing!</li>
            <li> Luckily, I&#x27;m not too far gone in the wrinkle department yet, but when offered a nice discount coupon, I had to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;This feels nice; like thick water. It&#x27;s not greasy and it does not irritate my skin or have a strong smell.&lt;br /&gt;My dry, delicate facial skin is losing some elasticity, but there&#x27;s enough fat to keep the shape.  This seemed to tighten up my face without drying, minimize pores, and generally just felt pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I started using it with the ReVitaSure Wrinkle Cream. The following is about the two used together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oddly, right before I ran into ReVitaSure, I started getting some really old looking wrinkles around my ankles. Just horrible and depressing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what tiny amounts of 24k Gold are supposed to do for me, but this Hyaluronic Acid Serum used with EwVitaSure&#x27;s  Advanced Anti Wrinkle Cream has smoothed out my wrinkles and minimized the lines left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m told that &amp;#34;Black Don&#x27;t Crack&amp;#34;, so I may not need anti-wrinkle cream &amp; serum specifically on my face for awhile yet, but for now, I am thrilled that the aging of my ankles and lower legs has been made less repulsive and practically &amp;#34;normal looking&amp;#34; while I&#x27;ve used these two products together.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty happy with ReVitaSure right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am likely to get, use, and recommend more of this and other ReVitaSure products.</li>
            <li> So far this seems to work well at keeping my skin healthy and hydrated</li>
            <li> guess it works, can&#x27;t really tell</li>
            <li> so far give me a breakout in red little pimples so I stop using it for a couples days to see if that what its causing the effect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with facial and makeup and health products so if course I had to buy this it truly does work and would recommend for any who wanted soft glowing beautiful skin!</li>
            <li> I like this moisturiser a lot! It has a very rich texture that feels smooth and creamy with an overall great consistency. I love that it&#x27;s not greasy,  so I can use it before applying my make up! It perfectly fit in in my daily routine! Love it!</li>
            <li> I have always had a problem with dry skin, I used the Hyaluronic Aid Serum and it made a very noticeable difference in my skin.  My face feels much smoother and tighter and feels better than it has in years.  I highly recommend the Hyaluronic Acid Serum.</li>
            <li> my wife use this product to help her reduce wrinkle and smoothen her skin face... after 2 weeks, she said she feel her skin smother and firm. she is continuing sung this product. it works great.</li>
