            <li>These clippers are great.</li>
            <li>While it was working it did cut great</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this clipper.  </li>
            <li>beard looks great.</li>
            <li>Great clippers for replacing wires and cables of your shelf.</li>
            <li>(sold separate)This are a great replacement for your oster 76</li>
            <li>Cut very nice.</li>

            <li>Best purchase made all year, for sure.</li>
            <li>im sure it will perform at its best</li>
            <li>Perfect - easy to use, and great results.</li>
            <li>but most important is battery operated with NO CORD!!!!</li>
            <li>Love it works very good</li>
            <li>There are many great clippers out there which would be great for home use like the Wahl Designer with the adjustable blade.</li>
            <li>The fact is you don&#x27;t need good technique.  </li>
            <li>The clipper guards for this ceramic version are included, fit perfectly in the storage container, and on the clipper itself.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ok, the Andis is lighter, has superior ergonomics and a quieter motor when compared with the Oster 76.</li>
            <li>I gave it three stars because the quality seems to be good</li>
            <li>This is an item where overkill is a GOOD thing, and you know that if I&#x27;m saying it can handle a sheepdog, it can handle you, your kids, or your customers for that matter...  </li>
            <li>I thought they were good</li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery life is good.  </li>
            <li>The build quality, as some have commented, is good</li>
            <li>, good thing</li>
            <li>Good price arrived on time and as described.</li>
            <li>Incredible item, lightweight, powerful, great battery life.</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE LOVE it!!!!</li>
            <li>Love these clippers!</li>
            <li>These are my favorite clippers that I own!</li>

            <li>Andis quality is amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m just a guy who clips his own hair with a guide #2 every two weeks.  </li>
            <li>Clippers  are nice</li>
            <li>The design is impressively built, and they really made this customizable.</li>
            <li>I own duplicate blades, and just switch them when they get warm.like butter in comparison to a $20 clipper.  </li>
            <li>The design is impressively built, and they really made this customizable.</li>
            <li>I own duplicate blades, and just switch them when they get warm.</li>
            <li>They also don&#x27;t include a cleaning brush which would have been nice.</li>
            <li>These clippers are the best and far superior than any I have used.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a week to cut my own hair.  </li>
            <li>The money you save could buy a nice blade collection.</li>
            <li>Bought it to cut my own hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok - feels like it could be made in China - but it is made in the good ole&#x27; US of A.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The storage case holds everything nicely.  </li>
            <li>Nice clipper</li>
            <li>I trim my own hair.</li>
            <li>Purchase a quality hair trimmer and trim your own hair.</li>
            <li>They cut great, and stay mostly cool to the touch.  </li>
            <li>Removable blades are very easy to work with.</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair and have for years, these are just one of many clippers I have owned.  </li>
            <li>She went on to say that the best clipper she had ever purchased was a Andis Ceramic Bgrc professional</li>
            <li>In the 33 years of being a cosmetologist, this clipper is the best clipper by far.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;d like to be able to simulate a razor shave, and get pretty darn close, pick up that blade, it&#x27;s great too.  </li>
            <li>This in no way takes away from the quality of these clippers, I love them</li>
            <li>I expect to have a better experience when I switch to NiMH; as stated the product is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That is my favorite feature.</li>
            <li>That is my favorite feature.</li>
            <li>charging system that allow &#x27;refreshing&#x27; of the battery at the push of a button (fully discharging, then recharging bat.</li>
            <li>This is a top quality machine.  </li>
            <li>Love this clipper.</li>
            <li>and I love having no cord to work around.  </li>
            <li>If you shave your head more than once a week this the trimmer you want.</li>
            <li>I did a hair cut and this time I was able to finish my cut in about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>It was time to buy something that would perform like pro equipment every time I reached for it for many years...  </li>
            <li>Good thing I did, because these clippers are worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I love the freedom of having no cord.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>but all in all i love this clipper</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a shame that there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a better alternative for wireless clippers.  </li>
            <li>And my clients love it also.  </li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with this hair clipper.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with the product because it&#x27;s everything I wanted it to be:</li>
            <li>I love these clippers.  </li>
            <li>Let me tell you, I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>i love this machine.</li>
            <li>Love the ceramic blades and the freedom with the battery.</li>
            <li>My wife love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I like it so much better than my Oster 76.</li>
            <li>In addition, this is an outstanding device.</li>
            <li>To do more damage to impressions, the clipper died while I had a client in my chair.</li>
            <li>and I had perhaps used this clippers at most 10 times.</li>
            <li>No doubt it is a great high quality product</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!!</li>
            <li>I owned the Oster 76 for 4 years and decided to try this one since I only buzz my own head and figured no wire and ceramic blades would be great.</li>
            <li>Given the choice over again I would go for the light weight cheaper and buy more often.  </li>
            <li>Good clipper that cuts very well.</li>
            <li>many people did it in a very good way with a very long explanation so if you don&#x27;t have a problem with the 120v</li>
            <li>MOST people will be just fine with the set as it comes in the box anyway, so you might never even use a bare blade, as you have the great assortment of guards at your disposal.&lt;br</li>

            <li>I like best is the fact that the blades that touch your head aren&#x27;t sharp - the edges that is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy for me to handle</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s great for necklines and facial hair, anywhere you want very clean lines.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much for shipping it so quickly!!!</li>
            <li>cannot say enough good about the overall design; Andis is top-notch.</li>
            <li>Seems to charge fine on a transformer and since it is cordless.  </li>
            <li>Being able to swap out the blades for an exact size and not relying on plastic guards gives a much better cut.  </li>
            <li>most clippers, no screwdriver required to change blades&lt;br /&gt;-Paying for a poodle groom @ $45 every month, this quickly paid for itself at my house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>most clippers, no screwdriver required to change blades  -Paying for a poodle groom @ $45 every month, this quickly paid for itself at my house.    </li>
            <li>The charging stand is huge</li>
            <li>Like I said, I got away with a cheap clipper for a while.  </li>
            <li>I totally agree with all the great reviews seen on amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>Smooth takedown clippers  </li>
            <li>These clippers precisely trim all hair types including beards.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to people who is looking to upgrade from cheap ones.</li>
            <li>Powerful for sure.</li>
            <li>I have had two cheap clippers (already reviewed)and</li>
            <li>but then again I didn&#x27;t want cheap,  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had cheap wired clippers ($40-$75 somewhere in that range)</li>
            <li>The cheap plastic junk.  </li>
            <li>but Oster was in the process of discontinuing that clipper and never had the accessory battery and charger available no matter where I looked.</li>
            <li>it is not like cheap clippers which struggle to cut your hair.</li>
            <li>Went on Amazon to read if anyone else has experienced same as we have and noticed Amazon&#x27;s price of the BRG+, a week after delivered, is now over $10.00 cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Blades are easy to change and to clean.  </li>
            <li>Smooth guy cuts, variety of guides.</li>
            <li>easy to clean.</li>
            <li>young lady talked about how the clipper I had just purchased was not at all good and it pulled her clients hair.</li>
            <li>Perfectly groomed, and pays for itself in about three months depending on your local barber prices and how much your time is valued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using my original set for 4 years not one problem</li>
            <li>Love these clippers they do absolutely what needs to be done!</li>
            <li>I take very good care of it, i clean it and oil it down on a monthly bases.  </li>
            <li>One more thing, the hand is not as ergonomic as I would have liked, as a female with small/medium hands.</li>
            <li>Now I cut my hair ever other week with the #1 ceramic blade and feel better about my hair looking good all the time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;no need to add more comments about the product itself (it&#x27;s a real 5stars)</li>
            <li>This was after a full charge</li>
            <li>The clipper get hot very quickly.</li>
            <li>Quick</li>
            <li>Seems like an adequate trimmer</li>
            <li>It charges the battery relatively quickly.  </li>
            <li>its blade is very sharp and powerful and cuts very smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;Other than top notch product quality, Their support is great, I had a problem with clipper charger and Andis</li>
            <li>Probably a very good clipper but very heavy.</li>
            <li>All these things combined, and anyone picking one of these up should be in good shape for a LONG time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The clippers work great, if they have a down side</li>
            <li>I keep my hair so short that I went ahead and picked up a &#x27;1&#x27; blade, even though you still have pretty good flexibility with the 000 and included guards.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product, should last a long time.</li>
            <li>Sound is smooth and very quiet, cut is accurate.  </li>
            <li>Works great with short hair and trimming, quiet and smooth.</li>
            <li>The time alone that I save by doing it myself would make it worth it</li>
            <li>and I feel that it&#x27;s well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I think this unit will be worth the money you pay for it</li>
            <li>Each use is like going to your favorite barber, because these clippers are every bit professional.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>was kind enough to send me a replacement for free.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But otherwise I would say that is 100% as powerful as a corded unit.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I chose to go ahead and pick up some additional blades when I bought the clipper, the system does come with a large set of great quality &#x27;guards&#x27; ranging from 1/16\\&quot; to 1\\&quot;, so chances are you don&#x27;t NEED anything that&#x27;s not in the box already (other than maybe a spray cleaner if you&#x27;d like).  </li>
            <li>He posted a very positive and succinct review.</li>
            <li>just right&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I have been clipping my own hair for the past 20 years and have gone through many clippers.</li>
            <li>Charging unit is amazing and the unit holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>My BGR+ at first full charge did not last for more than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>I will come back and update this review after several more uses but my first impression is luke warm.</li>
            <li>All of my cordless stuff works great for a while, but not worth the headache of having to replace batteries and not having the convenience of being able to really work on them when necessary without having to send them out.  </li>
            <li>These things just go right through like a hot knife thru butter.</li>
            <li>- The past two I owned had a two level minimum adjustment on the actual blade itself, which is a great feature as it makes your length cuts very accurate.</li>
            <li>I can go from beard stable to a beard and keep it nice and even with no random long hairs.  </li>
            <li>The combs snap on and off easily and are clearly labeled for length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She is a Std Poodle, so it&#x27;s a big groom, but I wish a NiMH battery were available when I bought this originally.</li>
            <li>i do not recommend this at all the cord is huge and always falls out of the plug which can become a problem on a busy day at the shop</li>
            <li>Clipper.&lt;br /&gt;This does not get hot because of the Ceramic Guard that Andis made.&lt;br /&gt;Charging</li>
            <li>It just cuts consistently each pass.  </li>
            <li>I do the most simple cut so this might not translate to everyone</li>
            <li>but it was more than I needed at this time because I need the combs to properly self-cut my hair.</li>
            <li>it got really hot.</li>
            <li>Every time I looked around for nicer trimmer or top-notch clippers, they were pretty expensive, so I kept putting it off and putting it off.  </li>
            <li>and I thought back on what a piece of junk it had been as I looked around for a replacement, although it DID survive many years.  </li>
            <li>It just works exactly like it&#x27;s supposed to.  </li>
            <li>and got so hot immediately .</li>
            <li>all the time, that was my first mistake.</li>
            <li>Going back corded, they have more power that cordless clippers, anyway.</li>
            <li>The head will get hot over time and eventually too hot to touch.</li>
            <li>I tried them out here in States first.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but the batteries don&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>but it sure didn&#x27;t last an hour</li>
            <li>So I thought I would tell you exactly what&#x27;s in the box...</li>
            <li>I purchased this item after trying a higher end Oster that I ended up returning.  </li>
            <li>This is the last trimmer you will ever buy, and I have purchased many.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a bit heavier than the other kind, but I was used to it after the first time.</li>
            <li>Not a big deal though, as they could easily be filed/sanded with just a couple passes of the right material to take the &#x27;edge&#x27; off.  </li>
            <li>Not a big deal though, as they could easily be filed/sanded with just a couple passes of the right material to take the &#x27;edge&#x27; off.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth the money, and it does an awesome job of cutting hair.</li>
            <li>Ordered straight from Amazon and it took a week to ship and several more days to be delivered.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I really need to get into how much better it is to NOT be lugging a cord around as you try to cut someone&#x27;s hair, or like in my case, my own (or worse, with pet grooming).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty quiet, which is a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Large variety of blade options.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the Andis quiet sound and less heat to deal with but the Oster 76 packed the power to easily feel it cut.</li>
            <li>I have had this for over two years now and this thing is very high quality.  </li>
            <li>It certainly gets the job done but the problem is it&#x27;s very inconsistent.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that I really dont like about these clippers are the Available Power Adapter</li>
            <li>While the customer service person was excellent and generously offered parts if any were missing, the missing tapering combs made it a return for me</li>
            <li>You can tell the difference in quality, and the fact that the drive mechanism must be different, makes a huge difference, too.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s not too much to say about..</li>
            <li>The ceramic blades are so much cooler than metal blades and the convenience of being cordless can&#x27;t be matched.  </li>
            <li>I would have kept it because I love good quality gadgets, however, the only missing item is the tapering combs which would be key for me to keep it rather than return it.  </li>
            <li>Smooth quiet.</li>
            <li>For the price I expected to be satisfied which I was not.</li>
            <li>I tend to agree with others who have said this is too much clipper for home use given the cost.</li>
            <li>It is a professional model with a powerful motor.</li>
            <li>She wants to get them too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not used it continuously for an hour straight</li>
            <li>overall impression is this is a well-made clipper that you&#x27;ll enjoy using for years and years.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like these clippers.  </li>
            <li>but I expected something phenomenal after reading these comments.</li>
            <li>I can run these for an hour straight no problem.  </li>
            <li>the whole bit.  </li>
            <li>With the battery fully charged the clipper runs at a brisk pace and cuts very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but had to send battery back to andis after it wouldn&#x27;t hold charge but andis replaced it for free</li>
            <li>This one works well, cuts smooth, is quiet and portable.  </li>
            <li>You cannot leave the charger plugged in, or else the whole charger and unit will overheat.  </li>
            <li>I took it as my battery got a good charge this time, at least 60-70%.</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair (a simple, short, men&#x27;s cut) and frankly, it&#x27;s not rocket science.  </li>
            <li>like my new Andis BGR+ very much.</li>
            <li>Very Good product but too high end for a casual home user.  </li>
            <li>When I originally bought this it was my only battery option.</li>
            <li>I ended up replacing it with a Oster Classic 76 and am much happier depsite the Oster being corded.</li>
            <li>After a lot of research and this being the third clipper I have purchased in past 8 years, I say this is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>far, I like the clippers very much.  </li>
            <li>Portable, Quiet, fast, does not run hot, durable build quality, low maintenance, easy to change blades.</li>
            <li>I would be interested in hearing from a professional groomer on this on charge times and longevity etc.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t complete my first DIY hair cut.</li>
            <li>You have to cool it off for the next haircut.</li>
            <li>The second pass did cut more, but I did a third pass with my $30 plug-in clippers and still got much closer.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a host of guides, although, perhaps not quite as many as the average consumer set.  </li>
            <li>first I thought it was not vibrating enough and would not be strong enough.  </li>
            <li>So in comparison, the Andis is much more quieter and the vibration less strenuous on my fingers and palm.  </li>
            <li>so I was able to buy it for less than $100.</li>
            <li>I tried my old cheap clipper one last time....</li>
            <li>For years I &#x27;got by&#x27; on an inexpensive beard trimmer, using it mostly for facial hair, but later in its life, for shaving my head as well.  </li>
            <li>It did the trick, but it had several drawbacks that most trimmers and clippers suffer from, especially cordless clippers...  </li>
            <li>- High quality well manufactured item.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product for people who are looking for premium product.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this Andis clipper to anyone.</li>
            <li>Blade is not sharp at all!!!!</li>
            <li>I recommend the ceramic blades for this as they really don&#x27;t heat up near as much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a very sturdy professional tool.  </li>
            <li>A crappy clipper, that will one day break, leaving you right back where you are now, where you should&#x27;ve bought quality.  </li>
            <li>A crappy clipper, that will one day break, leaving you right back where you are now, where you should&#x27;ve bought quality.  </li>
            <li>Other blades are available to be purchased separately.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t need a new clipper</li>
            <li>Having no chord allows new angles</li>
            <li>As a result, I started cutting my own hair with some big-store available clippers.  </li>
            <li>but in the long run I&#x27;m saving time and money and that makes it worth it.  </li>
            <li>The first refresh took only 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>At first I tried Japanese cordless clippers</li>
            <li>the first time you pick it up, the quality is obvious.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are other benefits for actual hairstylists</li>
            <li>I was impressed at how they cut evenly, but was somewhat disappointed that they didn&#x27;t closer,</li>
            <li>The battery is still old school Nickel Metal Hydride (one reviewer thought that the new models might have a newer type Lithium-ion battery - NOPE).</li>
            <li>Cuts very smooth both dry and wet with no pulling .</li>
            <li>so maybe they&#x27;ll perform better on a white guy, but if were looking for clippers to cut close, I&#x27;d spend less on something else.  </li>
            <li>Amazon replaced another one to me quickly, and the second one has no problem with the initial charge.</li>
            <li>With the selection of plastic bits that hold tight to the trimmer blade, you can dial in different hair lengths for the top of my head, sides of my head, beard and mustache.</li>
            <li>Having used other cheaper devices in the past, this is well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Specifically, with a gliding it over my hair once, at most twice</li>
            <li>The Andis 64850 provided a clean cut in less than 5 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought the 00000 guard because I keep my head completely bald, and people ask me what type of razor i use.  </li>
            <li>They really allowed for customization; you only buy what you intend on using (no need to pay for a cord if you do not want to use it).</li>
            <li>No problems with battery so far.</li>
            <li>Andis has a very descriptive section in the user manual on charging and battery maintenance, of which I have been following their procedure for maintenance.</li>
            <li>The Andis is marked &amp;#34;made in USA&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>However, the charging stand, battery and comb attachments are all marked &amp;#34;made in China&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The clipper body and ceramic blade are marked USA.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this if you are old, because it will outlast you.</li>
            <li>Short &#x27;run time&#x27;, slowing/degrading performance, plastic guards vs. real metal blades, hair gathering in the motor assembly, etc.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really just a personal preference thing to me.  </li>
            <li>WOW...</li>
            <li>Has the power for professional use all day.  </li>
            <li>and they never seemed to &#x27;dim&#x27; in performance.  </li>
            <li>Professional through and through.  </li>
            <li>The ceramic blades makes the blade run much cooler than traditional steel blades.</li>
            <li>So far I have never had a chance to recharge this one.</li>
            <li>I cut my hair enough that I finally decided these were worth the investment.  </li>
            <li>It is not so easy to maneuver on small dogs though</li>
            <li>It seems to be good quality but too heavy with the battery, weight is not balanced and the low number comb tips are very sharp which made it a no go for me.  </li>
            <li>I have come to the same conclusion about vacuum cleaners, buy the cheap one and when its dirty throw it away and buy cheap again!!</li>
            <li>I can do my entire neck and look like it was a pretty recent razor shave...</li>
            <li>Solid, Robust, Clear Professional design, the fastest charging, long lasting battery charge, rubs cool.</li>
            <li>this clipper is fast, it&#x27;s ready in 10 minutes or less sometimes.  </li>
            <li>Very amazed the battery life is long.</li>
            <li>I thought this was normal until I read another reviewer with similar problems.</li>
            <li>The blades do get hot however, so be careful and oil them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;120V if u live out side us but its not big problem u can use transformer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but these are the standout features for me as a general consumer.</li>
            <li>but the lack of the \\&quot;open-close\\&quot; lever on the side makes it pretty difficult to cut a smooth fade.  </li>
            <li>have honestly never monitored my exact battery times; when I first got it I could perform an entire Std Poodle groom on one charge, now it takes 3 charges, this is even after faithfully using the discharge feature on the charger.</li>
            <li>but I cannot attest to it&#x27;s durability since I&#x27;ve only gotten to use it once so far...  </li>
            <li>so American clippers are really loud.  </li>
            <li>I keep my hair buzzed extremely short, and I like to touch-up frequently to keep it looking &#x27;</li>
            <li>Although they&#x27;ve always worked, we would always have to be careful not to go too fast</li>
            <li>I figured a good clipper had to make you hand go numb from vibration.  </li>
            <li>They did the job perfectly well, however, I hated having to deal with the cord.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my Yorkies and small Poodle and it gets the job done quickly.</li>
            <li>A little heavy going cordless but balanced ok</li>
            <li>This is a good heavy duty clipper but a little on the heavy side because of the battery.</li>
            <li>but they got to hot after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>Heavy duty, consistent and reliable</li>
            <li>No weak performance or &#x27;bogging down&#x27; and grabbing a hair here and</li>
            <li>It has plenty of power to do a fast take down but is nimble enough to use as an outliner when used with a T-blade.</li>
            <li>The 2nd refresh took 5 hours; however, it still didn&#x27;t take 8 hours as specified but took much longer than the previous refresh.</li>
            <li>I even trimmed a little too much</li>
            <li>Cord free makes cutting so much easier,</li>

            <li> Love it works very good</li>
            <li> There are many great clippers out there which would be great for home use like the Wahl Designer with the adjustable blade.</li>
            <li> The fact is you don&#x27;t need good technique.  </li>
            <li> The clipper guards for this ceramic version are included, fit perfectly in the storage container, and on the clipper itself.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ok, the Andis is lighter, has superior ergonomics and a quieter motor when compared with the Oster 76.</li>
            <li> I gave it three stars because the quality seems to be good</li>
            <li> This is an item where overkill is a GOOD thing, and you know that if I&#x27;m saying it can handle a sheepdog, it can handle you, your kids, or your customers for that matter...  </li>
            <li> I thought they were good</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery life is good.  </li>

            <li> Clippers  are nice</li>
            <li> The design is impressively built, and they really made this customizable.</li>
            <li> I own duplicate blades, and just switch them when they get warm.like butter in comparison to a $20 clipper.  </li>

            <li> I own duplicate blades, and just switch them when they get warm.</li>
            <li> They also don&#x27;t include a cleaning brush which would have been nice.</li>
            <li> These clippers are the best and far superior than any I have used.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week to cut my own hair.  </li>
            <li> The money you save could buy a nice blade collection.</li>
            <li> Bought it to cut my own hair.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;The storage case holds everything nicely.  </li>

            <li> In the 33 years of being a cosmetologist, this clipper is the best clipper by far.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;d like to be able to simulate a razor shave, and get pretty darn close, pick up that blade, it&#x27;s great too.  </li>
            <li> This in no way takes away from the quality of these clippers, I love them</li>
            <li> I expect to have a better experience when I switch to NiMH; as stated the product is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This is a top quality machine.  </li>
            <li> Love this clipper.</li>
            <li> and I love having no cord to work around.  </li>
            <li> If you shave your head more than once a week this the trimmer you want.</li>
            <li> I did a hair cut and this time I was able to finish my cut in about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> It was time to buy something that would perform like pro equipment every time I reached for it for many years...  </li>
            <li> Good thing I did, because these clippers are worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love the freedom of having no cord.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> but all in all i love this clipper</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a shame that there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a better alternative for wireless clippers.  </li>
            <li> And my clients love it also.  </li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with this hair clipper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the product because it&#x27;s everything I wanted it to be:</li>
            <li> I love these clippers.  </li>
            <li> Let me tell you, I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> i love this machine.</li>
            <li> Love the ceramic blades and the freedom with the battery.</li>
            <li> My wife love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I like it so much better than my Oster 76.</li>
            <li> In addition, this is an outstanding device.</li>
            <li> To do more damage to impressions, the clipper died while I had a client in my chair.</li>
            <li> and I had perhaps used this clippers at most 10 times.</li>
            <li> No doubt it is a great high quality product</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!!</li>
            <li> I owned the Oster 76 for 4 years and decided to try this one since I only buzz my own head and figured no wire and ceramic blades would be great.</li>
            <li> Given the choice over again I would go for the light weight cheaper and buy more often.  </li>
            <li> Good clipper that cuts very well.</li>
            <li> many people did it in a very good way with a very long explanation so if you don&#x27;t have a problem with the 120v</li>
            <li> MOST people will be just fine with the set as it comes in the box anyway, so you might never even use a bare blade, as you have the great assortment of guards at your disposal.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I like best is the fact that the blades that touch your head aren&#x27;t sharp - the edges that is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy for me to handle</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s great for necklines and facial hair, anywhere you want very clean lines.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much for shipping it so quickly!!!</li>
            <li> cannot say enough good about the overall design; Andis is top-notch.</li>
            <li> Seems to charge fine on a transformer and since it is cordless.  </li>
            <li> Being able to swap out the blades for an exact size and not relying on plastic guards gives a much better cut.  </li>
            <li> most clippers, no screwdriver required to change blades&lt;br /&gt;-Paying for a poodle groom @ $45 every month, this quickly paid for itself at my house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> The charging stand is huge</li>
            <li> Like I said, I got away with a cheap clipper for a while.  </li>
            <li> I totally agree with all the great reviews seen on amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> Smooth takedown clippers  </li>
            <li> These clippers precisely trim all hair types including beards.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to people who is looking to upgrade from cheap ones.</li>
            <li> Powerful for sure.</li>
            <li> I have had two cheap clippers (already reviewed)and</li>
            <li> but then again I didn&#x27;t want cheap,  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had cheap wired clippers ($40-$75 somewhere in that range)</li>
            <li> The cheap plastic junk.  </li>
            <li> but Oster was in the process of discontinuing that clipper and never had the accessory battery and charger available no matter where I looked.</li>
            <li> it is not like cheap clippers which struggle to cut your hair.</li>
            <li> Went on Amazon to read if anyone else has experienced same as we have and noticed Amazon&#x27;s price of the BRG+, a week after delivered, is now over $10.00 cheaper.  </li>
            <li> Blades are easy to change and to clean.  </li>
            <li> Smooth guy cuts, variety of guides.</li>
            <li> easy to clean.</li>
            <li> young lady talked about how the clipper I had just purchased was not at all good and it pulled her clients hair.</li>
            <li> Perfectly groomed, and pays for itself in about three months depending on your local barber prices and how much your time is valued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my original set for 4 years not one problem</li>
            <li> Love these clippers they do absolutely what needs to be done!</li>
            <li> I take very good care of it, i clean it and oil it down on a monthly bases.  </li>
            <li> One more thing, the hand is not as ergonomic as I would have liked, as a female with small/medium hands.</li>
            <li> Now I cut my hair ever other week with the #1 ceramic blade and feel better about my hair looking good all the time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;no need to add more comments about the product itself (it&#x27;s a real 5stars)</li>
            <li> This was after a full charge</li>
            <li> The clipper get hot very quickly.</li>
            <li> Quick</li>
            <li> Seems like an adequate trimmer</li>
            <li> It charges the battery relatively quickly.  </li>
            <li> its blade is very sharp and powerful and cuts very smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;Other than top notch product quality, Their support is great, I had a problem with clipper charger and Andis</li>
            <li> Probably a very good clipper but very heavy.</li>
            <li> All these things combined, and anyone picking one of these up should be in good shape for a LONG time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The clippers work great, if they have a down side</li>
            <li> I keep my hair so short that I went ahead and picked up a &#x27;1&#x27; blade, even though you still have pretty good flexibility with the 000 and included guards.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product, should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Sound is smooth and very quiet, cut is accurate.  </li>
            <li> Works great with short hair and trimming, quiet and smooth.</li>
            <li> The time alone that I save by doing it myself would make it worth it</li>
            <li> and I feel that it&#x27;s well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I think this unit will be worth the money you pay for it</li>
            <li> Each use is like going to your favorite barber, because these clippers are every bit professional.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> was kind enough to send me a replacement for free.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But otherwise I would say that is 100% as powerful as a corded unit.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I chose to go ahead and pick up some additional blades when I bought the clipper, the system does come with a large set of great quality &#x27;guards&#x27; ranging from 1/16\\&quot; to 1\\&quot;, so chances are you don&#x27;t NEED anything that&#x27;s not in the box already (other than maybe a spray cleaner if you&#x27;d like).  </li>
            <li> He posted a very positive and succinct review.</li>
            <li> just right&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I have been clipping my own hair for the past 20 years and have gone through many clippers.</li>
            <li> Charging unit is amazing and the unit holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> My BGR+ at first full charge did not last for more than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I will come back and update this review after several more uses but my first impression is luke warm.</li>
            <li> All of my cordless stuff works great for a while, but not worth the headache of having to replace batteries and not having the convenience of being able to really work on them when necessary without having to send them out.  </li>
            <li> These things just go right through like a hot knife thru butter.</li>
            <li> - The past two I owned had a two level minimum adjustment on the actual blade itself, which is a great feature as it makes your length cuts very accurate.</li>
            <li> I can go from beard stable to a beard and keep it nice and even with no random long hairs.  </li>
            <li> The combs snap on and off easily and are clearly labeled for length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She is a Std Poodle, so it&#x27;s a big groom, but I wish a NiMH battery were available when I bought this originally.</li>
            <li> i do not recommend this at all the cord is huge and always falls out of the plug which can become a problem on a busy day at the shop</li>
            <li> Clipper.&lt;br /&gt;This does not get hot because of the Ceramic Guard that Andis made.&lt;br /&gt;Charging</li>
            <li> It just cuts consistently each pass.  </li>
            <li> I do the most simple cut so this might not translate to everyone</li>
            <li> but it was more than I needed at this time because I need the combs to properly self-cut my hair.</li>
            <li> it got really hot.</li>
            <li> Every time I looked around for nicer trimmer or top-notch clippers, they were pretty expensive, so I kept putting it off and putting it off.  </li>
            <li> and I thought back on what a piece of junk it had been as I looked around for a replacement, although it DID survive many years.  </li>
            <li> It just works exactly like it&#x27;s supposed to.  </li>
            <li> and got so hot immediately .</li>
            <li> all the time, that was my first mistake.</li>
            <li> Going back corded, they have more power that cordless clippers, anyway.</li>
            <li> The head will get hot over time and eventually too hot to touch.</li>
            <li> I tried them out here in States first.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but the batteries don&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> but it sure didn&#x27;t last an hour</li>
            <li> So I thought I would tell you exactly what&#x27;s in the box...</li>
            <li> I purchased this item after trying a higher end Oster that I ended up returning.  </li>
            <li> This is the last trimmer you will ever buy, and I have purchased many.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit heavier than the other kind, but I was used to it after the first time.</li>
            <li> Not a big deal though, as they could easily be filed/sanded with just a couple passes of the right material to take the &#x27;edge&#x27; off.  </li>
            <li> Not a big deal though, as they could easily be filed/sanded with just a couple passes of the right material to take the &#x27;edge&#x27; off.  </li>
            <li> It is well worth the money, and it does an awesome job of cutting hair.</li>
            <li> Ordered straight from Amazon and it took a week to ship and several more days to be delivered.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I really need to get into how much better it is to NOT be lugging a cord around as you try to cut someone&#x27;s hair, or like in my case, my own (or worse, with pet grooming).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty quiet, which is a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Large variety of blade options.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the Andis quiet sound and less heat to deal with but the Oster 76 packed the power to easily feel it cut.</li>
            <li> I have had this for over two years now and this thing is very high quality.  </li>
            <li> It certainly gets the job done but the problem is it&#x27;s very inconsistent.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that I really dont like about these clippers are the Available Power Adapter</li>
            <li> While the customer service person was excellent and generously offered parts if any were missing, the missing tapering combs made it a return for me</li>
            <li> You can tell the difference in quality, and the fact that the drive mechanism must be different, makes a huge difference, too.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s not too much to say about..</li>
            <li> The ceramic blades are so much cooler than metal blades and the convenience of being cordless can&#x27;t be matched.  </li>
            <li> I would have kept it because I love good quality gadgets, however, the only missing item is the tapering combs which would be key for me to keep it rather than return it.  </li>
            <li> Smooth quiet.</li>
            <li> For the price I expected to be satisfied which I was not.</li>
            <li> I tend to agree with others who have said this is too much clipper for home use given the cost.</li>
            <li> It is a professional model with a powerful motor.</li>
            <li> She wants to get them too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not used it continuously for an hour straight</li>
            <li> overall impression is this is a well-made clipper that you&#x27;ll enjoy using for years and years.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like these clippers.  </li>
            <li> but I expected something phenomenal after reading these comments.</li>
            <li> I can run these for an hour straight no problem.  </li>
            <li> the whole bit.  </li>
            <li> With the battery fully charged the clipper runs at a brisk pace and cuts very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but had to send battery back to andis after it wouldn&#x27;t hold charge but andis replaced it for free</li>
            <li> This one works well, cuts smooth, is quiet and portable.  </li>
            <li> You cannot leave the charger plugged in, or else the whole charger and unit will overheat.  </li>
            <li> I took it as my battery got a good charge this time, at least 60-70%.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair (a simple, short, men&#x27;s cut) and frankly, it&#x27;s not rocket science.  </li>
            <li> like my new Andis BGR+ very much.</li>
            <li> Very Good product but too high end for a casual home user.  </li>
            <li> When I originally bought this it was my only battery option.</li>
            <li> I ended up replacing it with a Oster Classic 76 and am much happier depsite the Oster being corded.</li>
            <li> After a lot of research and this being the third clipper I have purchased in past 8 years, I say this is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> far, I like the clippers very much.  </li>
            <li> Portable, Quiet, fast, does not run hot, durable build quality, low maintenance, easy to change blades.</li>
            <li> I would be interested in hearing from a professional groomer on this on charge times and longevity etc.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t complete my first DIY hair cut.</li>
            <li> You have to cool it off for the next haircut.</li>
            <li> The second pass did cut more, but I did a third pass with my $30 plug-in clippers and still got much closer.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a host of guides, although, perhaps not quite as many as the average consumer set.  </li>
            <li> first I thought it was not vibrating enough and would not be strong enough.  </li>
            <li> So in comparison, the Andis is much more quieter and the vibration less strenuous on my fingers and palm.  </li>
            <li> so I was able to buy it for less than $100.</li>
            <li> I tried my old cheap clipper one last time....</li>
            <li> For years I &#x27;got by&#x27; on an inexpensive beard trimmer, using it mostly for facial hair, but later in its life, for shaving my head as well.  </li>
            <li> It did the trick, but it had several drawbacks that most trimmers and clippers suffer from, especially cordless clippers...  </li>
            <li> - High quality well manufactured item.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product for people who are looking for premium product.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this Andis clipper to anyone.</li>
            <li> Blade is not sharp at all!!!!</li>
            <li> I recommend the ceramic blades for this as they really don&#x27;t heat up near as much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a very sturdy professional tool.  </li>
            <li> A crappy clipper, that will one day break, leaving you right back where you are now, where you should&#x27;ve bought quality.  </li>
            <li> A crappy clipper, that will one day break, leaving you right back where you are now, where you should&#x27;ve bought quality.  </li>
            <li> Other blades are available to be purchased separately.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t need a new clipper</li>
            <li> Having no chord allows new angles</li>
            <li> As a result, I started cutting my own hair with some big-store available clippers.  </li>
            <li> but in the long run I&#x27;m saving time and money and that makes it worth it.  </li>
            <li> The first refresh took only 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li> At first I tried Japanese cordless clippers</li>
            <li> the first time you pick it up, the quality is obvious.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are other benefits for actual hairstylists</li>
            <li> I was impressed at how they cut evenly, but was somewhat disappointed that they didn&#x27;t closer,</li>
            <li> The battery is still old school Nickel Metal Hydride (one reviewer thought that the new models might have a newer type Lithium-ion battery - NOPE).</li>
            <li> Cuts very smooth both dry and wet with no pulling .</li>
            <li> so maybe they&#x27;ll perform better on a white guy, but if were looking for clippers to cut close, I&#x27;d spend less on something else.  </li>
            <li> Amazon replaced another one to me quickly, and the second one has no problem with the initial charge.</li>
            <li> With the selection of plastic bits that hold tight to the trimmer blade, you can dial in different hair lengths for the top of my head, sides of my head, beard and mustache.</li>
            <li> Having used other cheaper devices in the past, this is well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Specifically, with a gliding it over my hair once, at most twice</li>
            <li> The Andis 64850 provided a clean cut in less than 5 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought the 00000 guard because I keep my head completely bald, and people ask me what type of razor i use.  </li>
            <li> They really allowed for customization; you only buy what you intend on using (no need to pay for a cord if you do not want to use it).</li>
            <li> No problems with battery so far.</li>
            <li> Andis has a very descriptive section in the user manual on charging and battery maintenance, of which I have been following their procedure for maintenance.</li>
            <li> The Andis is marked &amp;#34;made in USA&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> However, the charging stand, battery and comb attachments are all marked &amp;#34;made in China&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The clipper body and ceramic blade are marked USA.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this if you are old, because it will outlast you.</li>
            <li> Short &#x27;run time&#x27;, slowing/degrading performance, plastic guards vs. real metal blades, hair gathering in the motor assembly, etc.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really just a personal preference thing to me.  </li>
            <li> WOW...</li>
            <li> Has the power for professional use all day.  </li>
            <li> and they never seemed to &#x27;dim&#x27; in performance.  </li>
            <li> Professional through and through.  </li>
            <li> The ceramic blades makes the blade run much cooler than traditional steel blades.</li>
            <li> So far I have never had a chance to recharge this one.</li>
            <li> I cut my hair enough that I finally decided these were worth the investment.  </li>
            <li> It is not so easy to maneuver on small dogs though</li>
            <li> It seems to be good quality but too heavy with the battery, weight is not balanced and the low number comb tips are very sharp which made it a no go for me.  </li>
            <li> I have come to the same conclusion about vacuum cleaners, buy the cheap one and when its dirty throw it away and buy cheap again!!</li>
            <li> I can do my entire neck and look like it was a pretty recent razor shave...</li>
            <li> Solid, Robust, Clear Professional design, the fastest charging, long lasting battery charge, rubs cool.</li>
            <li> this clipper is fast, it&#x27;s ready in 10 minutes or less sometimes.  </li>
            <li> Very amazed the battery life is long.</li>
            <li> I thought this was normal until I read another reviewer with similar problems.</li>
            <li> The blades do get hot however, so be careful and oil them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;120V if u live out side us but its not big problem u can use transformer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but these are the standout features for me as a general consumer.</li>
            <li> but the lack of the \\&quot;open-close\\&quot; lever on the side makes it pretty difficult to cut a smooth fade.  </li>
            <li> have honestly never monitored my exact battery times; when I first got it I could perform an entire Std Poodle groom on one charge, now it takes 3 charges, this is even after faithfully using the discharge feature on the charger.</li>
            <li> but I cannot attest to it&#x27;s durability since I&#x27;ve only gotten to use it once so far...  </li>
            <li> so American clippers are really loud.  </li>
            <li> I keep my hair buzzed extremely short, and I like to touch-up frequently to keep it looking &#x27;</li>
            <li> Although they&#x27;ve always worked, we would always have to be careful not to go too fast</li>
            <li> I figured a good clipper had to make you hand go numb from vibration.  </li>
            <li> They did the job perfectly well, however, I hated having to deal with the cord.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my Yorkies and small Poodle and it gets the job done quickly.</li>
            <li> A little heavy going cordless but balanced ok</li>
            <li> This is a good heavy duty clipper but a little on the heavy side because of the battery.</li>
            <li> but they got to hot after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> Heavy duty, consistent and reliable</li>
            <li> No weak performance or &#x27;bogging down&#x27; and grabbing a hair here and</li>
            <li> It has plenty of power to do a fast take down but is nimble enough to use as an outliner when used with a T-blade.</li>
            <li> The 2nd refresh took 5 hours; however, it still didn&#x27;t take 8 hours as specified but took much longer than the previous refresh.</li>
            <li> I even trimmed a little too much</li>
            <li> Cord free makes cutting so much easier,</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It has a powerful motor; it navigates a thick poodle coat like butter in comparison to a $20 clipper.&lt;br /&gt;-Battery:</li>
            <li> It takes very little maintenance, cuts extremely well and evenly, and is said to run a FULL HOUR on one charge.  </li>
            <li> Professional grade, quiet, and sharp - goes through hair like nobody&#x27;s business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a cheap clipper for the past few years.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell you how long this thing can last, but i bought an animal guard, and trimmed my Mati-poo dog from 4&amp;#34; to 1/2&amp;#34;  and it still had battery and felt like it was not affected.</li>
            <li> Multiple passes and strange lines are a reality.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t last that long get the adapter</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it long enough now to believe it to be reliable.  </li>
            <li> All the power of a corded clipper, without the cord, and a long lasting battery as well.</li>
            <li> They seem like they will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair.</li>
            <li> This is a professional unit, not your typical drugstore clipper/trimmer...</li>
            <li> Info says the only maintenance required is for the blades to be cleaned and oiled and that the inner workings are permanently lubricated at the factory and no maintenance is needed other than on the blades.  </li>
            <li> Overall a great set of clippers clean cutting and the batteries last for at least an hour of cutting.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not a professional.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it for that long yet, but I can tell you that this thing keeps on running like it&#x27;s plugged into the wall,</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this thing a couple times, I was not surprised at all to see talk of it being used for dog grooming.  </li>
            <li> I was undecided between two products, but after reading numerous reviews of the Andis cordless, I gave gave in a spent the money for the &amp;#34;good one&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Cordless, long battery life and cuts hair.</li>
            <li> Nearly every other rechargeable clipper you&#x27;ll see is a trimmer or is a conventional clipper with blades that are not detachable.</li>
            <li> Some of my hair (that I have left) will be longer in spots then others due to this.</li>
            <li> Other than the initial battery charging issue, built quality meets my expectation.</li>
            <li> This is an expensive item, and worth every cent!</li>
            <li> This was for personal use, I used it once and did not like the feel and the sharp combs.  </li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a very long time too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This clipper fits comfortably in my hand and it&#x27;s a bit nicer feel and balance than cutting with a big Oster 76.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that having a cordless would make much of a difference, but it makes cutting my hair much easier.</li>
            <li> Very solid, quieter than most other units, very expensive hence the 1 star knocked off.  </li>
            <li> If you cut your own hair on a weekly basis these are the clippers to have you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Expect to buy new batteries (around $55 or so each) at least once per year.</li>
            <li> I guess this wasn&#x27;t a quick review after all, sorry.</li>
            <li> Amazing clippers until the battery goes up, went through 2 batteries in under a year(yes, I&#x27;ve used the power drain that the base does to keep the recharge memory going) and now about 2 minutes into a cut the motor just starts to die.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap, but you get what you pay for.ust saved $30, total...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even bitter that I spent over $300 for the clippers, blades, guards and case..</li>
            <li> This is not why I am docking stars, but I spent over 1 hour looking at all of the Andis models and the pictures and product descriptions can be bewildering.</li>
            <li> Quiet, heavy duty unit.&lt;br /&gt;Pricey</li>
            <li> I also wonder if this would be too heavy for a professional [battery is very heavy].</li>
            <li> but it is very heavy and larger than I expected.</li>
            <li> The attachable plastic comb on my previous machine was always comming loose.  </li>
            <li> No matter how closely you follow the manufacturer instructions, the batteries are just very low quality and after 4-6 months, start to hold a very little charge.</li>
            <li> for longer life)&lt;br /&gt;-Detachable blades, compatible with other pro clipper blades (oster, etc)&lt;br /&gt;-quality, pro, ceramic edge blades.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of the clipper&#x27;s internal condition, so it&#x27;s being returned to Amazon.</li>
            <li> and if you use it as a tool on other people it may be Ok.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely</li>
            <li> My hair got a bit shorter than usual (scalped, actually) because she didn&#x27;t want to stop using them.</li>
            <li> The plastic attachments are so sharp they cut/poke into the skin.</li>
            <li> It does hold a charge extremely well.  </li>
            <li> The actually buzzer and blades are nice but the battery life is horrible.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The ceramic blades do run cooler than conventional blades.</li>
            <li> The guards are not universal as I found out the hard way.</li>
            <li> It has cut down time spent to less than half the time and the results are infinitely better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product description was also confusing, leading me to believe that this might have a cord after all (it does not - this is a Battery Only unit).</li>
            <li> I do not enjoy the empty banter.</li>
            <li> ONLY complaint is that the guards can be a little on the sharp side.  </li>
            <li> My ONLY complaint is that the guards can be a little on the sharp side.  </li>
            <li> No cord- no slowing down.  </li>
            <li> His 1st and 2nd buzz cuts were with a $30 corded Wahl that was very loud and the vibration made my hand numb half way through the buzzing.  </li>
            <li> This review is for the Black version which is cordless.  </li>
            <li> but of course not having to pay for a cut twice a month makes up the difference in less than a year.  </li>
            <li> As a bonus, the Oster is half the price of the Andis.</li>
            <li> Wish they cost less.</li>
            <li> The Andis also requires less maintenance than the Oster 76.</li>
            <li> The wireless clipper game is WIDE open.</li>
            <li> black plastic attachment combs, sizes as follows:  1/16\\&quot;, 1/8\\&quot;, 1/4\\&quot;, 3/8\\&quot;, 1/2\\&quot;, 3/4\\&quot;, 1\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Charging</li>
            <li> But no worries a lot less noisy.</li>
            <li> would NOT pay half the price it sells for</li>
            <li> NOT TRUE..</li>
            <li> or they&#x27;d get bogged down.</li>
            <li> I also got the &#x27;OUTLINER&#x27; blade, which really works well for cutting down to NOTHING-</li>
            <li> /&gt;Spoil yourself a little.  </li>
            <li> Spoil yourself a little.  </li>
            <li> Thank you Andis for making my work life a little easier.</li>
            <li> While it may be expensive, my 3 trims in 2 weeks is at least one extra haircut than I&#x27;d normally get in that time, and they would have cost me at least $45 + tips.  </li>
            <li> A little heavy, but you get used to the weight.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s that they are a little on the heavy side.</li>
            <li> A little heavy</li>
            <li> It is a little heavy</li>
            <li> I put the battery in the charger and initiated &#x27;refresh&#x27; a few times.</li>
            <li> It was also missing the plastic blade &amp;#34;guard&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I will probably reorder in a few months (my star rating is not influenced by the shipping condition, but on the clipper itself).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quite heavy.</li>
            <li> I just use it to shave my head and it works well for that.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not cheap</li>
            <li> This is simply a personal item you don&#x27;t want to compromise on, or accept poor performance from.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s heavy .</li>
            <li> and I had no idea what I was missing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few months now.  </li>
            <li> The NiCad battery is heavy and inefficient.</li>
            <li> I have a few complaints.  </li>
            <li> I do not enjoy the time lost commuting to the barber aka hair stylist.</li>
            <li> I do not enjoy sitting and waiting my turn.</li>
            <li> The cutting blades are ceramic, and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought the less expensive version of the clipper only to find out</li>
            <li> but they didn&#x27;t slow down.  </li>
            <li> Was not very happy with this product, battery ran down after just 15 mins.</li>
            <li> If this adapter was improved, I&#x27;d probably sell my other 76&#x27;rs and take this one on the road w/ me!!!</li>
            <li> This thing is so slick</li>
            <li> expensive initially but industrial grade and charge lasts forever.</li>
            <li> This was one concern while researching the clipper, because a very few stated they had problems with it.</li>
            <li> yeah, the dull blades still pulled my hair.  </li>
            <li> so I have a mini cordless for the hard to get to areas.</li>
            <li> They also have a hard traveling case...</li>
            <li> That is the complaint I was getting from my client.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always ready to go on its charging base, the Andis 64850</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I had to get a step down power transformer to start using the clipper, but the charger still failed to charge.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re anything like me seriously consider this clipper as an option.</li>
            <li> A must-have for any serious barber.</li>
            <li> i gave 3 stars only because the charger is a 120v input only witch is very stupid knowing that 90% of the world is on</li>
            <li> too heavy, I am looking to sell it after one use&lt;br /&gt;too expensive</li>
            <li> i was very disappointed with the first time i used this on my clients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these in my aresenal for a little over a year now, these are my go to&#x27;s for just about every haircut!!!</li>
            <li> I am slightly disappointed because I only groom one dog.</li>
            <li> Disappointed all around, likely will return.</li>
            <li> Not a great 1st experience.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t buy it now, you&#x27;re going to spend it on haircuts, or worse:</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t buy it now, you&#x27;re going to spend it on haircuts, or worse:</li>
            <li> The unit seems durable but it is heavy and a bit awkward to get used to.  </li>
            <li> It is heavy and sometimes awkward to balance in your hands.  </li>
            <li> I needed some clippers that I could take overseas with me and previously had bad experiences with voltage converters, so when I heard about the cordless Andis Ceramic BGR+, I was elated.  </li>
            <li> So if you receive a &#x27;bad&#x27; battery, ran refresh a few times to check if this is the case.</li>
            <li> and it starts to look bad after 3, but it&#x27;s too much trouble and expensive (haircut and shampoo</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this the overall quality (and I&#x27;m an andis fan).</li>
            <li> Sadly, my Andis arrived dislodged from it&#x27;s plastic carrying case when shipped.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s expensive, but I&#x27;d rather pay premium for a premium product.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> It had a nasty tendency to cut me if I wasn&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li> Made by the Swiss but at least it isn&#x27;t CHINESE.SHAME ON YOU ANDIS!!!</li>
            <li> It seems like a crazy amount of money to spend for clippers</li>
            <li> No tangled cords to plug in and fuss with while you&#x27;re cutting.</li>
            <li> They need li-on batteries whatever they use is very poor!</li>
            <li> Will never purchase another Andis product... just too bad.</li>
            <li> Mistakenly wrote a bad review on an andis blade.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not the end of the world, but it is definitely annoying.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;What is NOT included is the electrical cord base that would replace the battery pack to make it a corded clipper rather than a rechargeable clipper.</li>

            <li> The best investment i have ever put my money towards clippers.  I have had this for over two years now and this thing is very high quality.  Never had a problem with it. I take very good care of it, i clean it and oil it down on a monthly bases.  I also let the battery reset cycle once every month.  I bought the 00000 guard because I keep my head completely bald, and people ask me what type of razor i use.  I tell them I bought an Andis Cordless Clipper.&lt;br /&gt;This does not get hot because of the Ceramic Guard that Andis made.&lt;br /&gt;Charging this clipper is fast, it&#x27;s ready in 10 minutes or less sometimes.  After one charge, I can clip my head bald, and still feels like the battery was never affected or a loss of any power.  I couldn&#x27;t tell you how long this thing can last, but i bought an animal guard, and trimmed my Mati-poo dog from 4&amp;#34; to 1/2&amp;#34;  and it still had battery and felt like it was not affected. Very amazed the battery life is long.</li>
            <li> Awesome should have bought it sooner.</li>
            <li> This review is for the Black version which is cordless.  It comes with the battery and charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just a guy who clips his own hair with a guide #2 every two weeks.  I&#x27;ve been using a cheap clipper for the past few years.  It seems like a crazy amount of money to spend for clippers but in the long run I&#x27;m saving time and money and that makes it worth it.  Like I said, I got away with a cheap clipper for a while.  It certainly gets the job done but the problem is it&#x27;s very inconsistent.  Multiple passes and strange lines are a reality.  This is compounded by the fact I&#x27;m doing it myself with a mirror and I&#x27;m not a professional.  This clipper is in a completely different league.  The fact is you don&#x27;t need good technique.  It just cuts consistently each pass.  I&#x27;m not wasting time trying to fix lines or missed hair.  The time alone that I save by doing it myself would make it worth it but of course not having to pay for a cut twice a month makes up the difference in less than a year.  I do the most simple cut so this might not translate to everyone but if you&#x27;re anything like me seriously consider this clipper as an option.</li>
            <li> For a year, I used this clipper to get a \\&quot;stubbly\\&quot; shave on my face. It had a nasty tendency to cut me if I wasn&#x27;t careful. The battery always left something to be desired and eventually it died to the point that it was not possible to turn the unit on. I ended up replacing it with a Oster Classic 76 and am much happier depsite the Oster being corded. I several months with the Oster, I have yet to cut myself. As a bonus, the Oster is half the price of the Andis.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these in my aresenal for a little over a year now, these are my go to&#x27;s for just about every haircut!!! Quick Take Downs/ Ceasars/ and Even Fades. I used to have 2 Oster 76&#x27;s, I would like to say I got rid of both of them but I keep one just in case I have to travel. The only thing that I really dont like about these clippers are the Available Power Adapter it&#x27;s akward and when used makes the clippers seem \\&quot;Smaller in the Hand\\&quot;. If this adapter was improved, I&#x27;d probably sell my other 76&#x27;rs and take this one on the road w/ me!!! This in no way takes away from the quality of these clippers, I love them there&#x27;s not too much to say about.. Great Detachable Blade Clipper!!!</li>
            <li> I used to get my haircut every 4 to 6 weeks and it starts to look bad after 3, but it&#x27;s too much trouble and expensive (haircut and shampoo so I don&#x27;t get hair in the car afterwards) to go every 3 weeks so I decided to get a clipper and do it myself and save time and money by doing it at home.  I decided to spend the extra money for the Andis BGR+ clipper and I feel that it&#x27;s well worth the money.  The ceramic blades are so much cooler than metal blades and the convenience of being cordless can&#x27;t be matched.  Now I cut my hair ever other week with the #1 ceramic blade and feel better about my hair looking good all the time.</li>
            <li> Clippers  are nice the battery  don&#x27;t last that long get the adapter</li>
            <li> I agree with a review posted by \\&quot;James &#x27;Jamie&#x27; Farrous.\\&quot; He posted a very positive and succinct review. [[ASIN:B000NE6LD8 Andis BGR+ Rechargeable Clipper]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is mine has a NiCad battery, which I believe they have now replaced with a NiMH [I would verify the battery type before buying one to prevent being sold a closeout version with NiCad]. I have owned mine for 4 years, and it is still performing. I am now back to replace the battery. I am slightly disappointed because I only groom one dog. She is a Std Poodle, so it&#x27;s a big groom, but I wish a NiMH battery were available when I bought this originally. I feel the NiCad is archaic technology that cannot hold enough charge, nor endure repeated charges and Andis made a mistake by using it. When I originally bought this it was my only battery option. I would be interested in hearing from a professional groomer on this on charge times and longevity etc. I also wonder if this would be too heavy for a professional [battery is very heavy]. Newer corded models are lightweight to reduce work overuse injury/fatigue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have honestly never monitored my exact battery times; when I first got it I could perform an entire Std Poodle groom on one charge, now it takes 3 charges, this is even after faithfully using the discharge feature on the charger. I expect to have a better experience when I switch to NiMH; as stated the product is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say enough good about the overall design; Andis is top-notch. They really allowed for customization; you only buy what you intend on using (no need to pay for a cord if you do not want to use it). I also believe that an overlooked benefit is the ability to charge a spare battery without it being attached to the unit. Perhaps in the future designs it will allow you to charge two at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kudos:&lt;br /&gt;-This tramples a $20 clipper from Wal-Mart; no comparison. It has been dropped several times, still perfect.&lt;br /&gt;-It has a powerful motor; it navigates a thick poodle coat like butter in comparison to a $20 clipper.&lt;br /&gt;-Battery: it is replaceable without having to send the unit in [think iPhone]&lt;br /&gt;-Like most clippers, no screwdriver required to change blades&lt;br /&gt;-Paying for a poodle groom @ $45 every month, this quickly paid for itself at my house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This feels like a $200 clipper; I don&#x27;t feel ripped-off, but yes, $200 is a lot for a clipper. The design is impressively built, and they really made this customizable. That is my favorite feature. You only pay for what you want (battery/cord options), including blades. I own duplicate blades, and just switch them when they get warm.like butter in comparison to a $20 clipper.  -Battery: it is replaceable without having to send the unit in [think iPhone]  -Like most clippers, no screwdriver required to change blades  -Paying for a poodle groom @ $45 every month, this quickly paid for itself at my house.

            <li> its the best in the world</li>
            <li> I have always purchased the cheap Wally World clippers, and was quite tired of throwing them away after a year. I did a lot of research and decided to purchase this clipper. It is well worth the money, and it does an awesome job of cutting hair. Andis has even provided an awesome, durable carry case, that holds all the blades and combs that we need. No problems with battery so far. This was one concern while researching the clipper, because a very few stated they had problems with it. Andis has a very descriptive section in the user manual on charging and battery maintenance, of which I have been following their procedure for maintenance. My thoughts on battery issues, is that those user didn&#x27;t charge the battery as describe in the manual, or as with any product they had a defective modal. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I totally agree with all the great reviews seen on amazon.com.  I actually bought the clipper on the strength of the reviews as the price-point is out of my comfort zone.  You can knock off $15 already; I gave myself a buzz an hour after ups dropped it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasons I decided to purchase:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Replaceable rechargeable battery.&lt;br /&gt;-smart charging system that allow &#x27;refreshing&#x27; of the battery at the push of a button (fully discharging, then recharging bat. for longer life)&lt;br /&gt;-Detachable blades, compatible with other pro clipper blades (oster, etc)&lt;br /&gt;-quality, pro, ceramic edge blades.  I tried my old cheap clipper one last time....yeah, the dull blades still pulled my hair.  The Andis 64850 provided a clean cut in less than 5 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a bald guy committed to keeping a close cut, this is your clipper.  Stop paying the barber.</li>
            <li> They are horrible!!! Blade is not sharp at all!!!!</li>
            <li> I owned the Oster 76 for 4 years and decided to try this one since I only buzz my own head and figured no wire and ceramic blades would be great. The actually buzzer and blades are nice but the battery life is horrible. I&#x27;ll charge it and then it will go in and out while buzzing. Some of my hair (that I have left) will be longer in spots then others due to this. I really enjoy the Andis quiet sound and less heat to deal with but the Oster 76 packed the power to easily feel it cut. I compared the Andis 1 to the Oster 1 blade and felt the Oster blade cut shorter. I&#x27;m not a fan of the Oster 76 heating up to the point of burning at times but I may switch back.</li>
            <li> Very Good product but too high end for a casual home user.  I would have kept it because I love good quality gadgets, however, the only missing item is the tapering combs which would be key for me to keep it rather than return it.  While the customer service person was excellent and generously offered parts if any were missing, the missing tapering combs made it a return for me this can not be purchased after market.  No doubt it is a great high quality product but it was more than I needed at this time because I need the combs to properly self-cut my hair. Again. its a buy if this is not a concern. They also don&#x27;t include a cleaning brush which would have been nice.</li>
            <li> After a lot of research and this being the third clipper I have purchased in past 8 years, I say this is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro - High quality well manufactured item. Sound is smooth and very quiet, cut is accurate.  Charging unit is amazing and the unit holds a charge for a long time. I use it as a personal clipper and have used in like three times in one month without a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - The past two I owned had a two level minimum adjustment on the actual blade itself, which is a great feature as it makes your length cuts very accurate. This one as you can see, has not adjustment on the blade. It is one level. Not a biggie, just different!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go for it.</li>
            <li> Love these clippers! Stays charged all day. A little heavy, but you get used to the weight. Wish they cost less.</li>
            <li> I have been clipping my own hair for the past 20 years and have gone through many clippers. These clippers are the best and far superior than any I have used. Portable, Quiet, fast, does not run hot, durable build quality, low maintenance, easy to change blades. If you cut your own hair on a weekly basis these are the clippers to have you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Smooth quiet. Cut very nice. Came promptly would buy again from this</li>
            <li> The attachable plastic comb on my previous machine was always comming loose.  I wanted a clipper with detachable blades.  This is a top quality machine.  I use it twice a week to cut my own hair.  Works great!</li>
            <li> Seems to charge fine on a transformer and since it is cordless.  No 50/60hz issues.</li>
            <li> Very solid, quieter than most other units, very expensive hence the 1 star knocked off.  Since purchasing this we&#x27;ve only managed to buzz my toddler&#x27;s head only once cos he hates get his head buzzed.  His 1st and 2nd buzz cuts were with a $30 corded Wahl that was very loud and the vibration made my hand numb half way through the buzzing.  So in comparison, the Andis is much more quieter and the vibration less strenuous on my fingers and palm.  The price is steep but if you plan on doing a lot of buzzing I think this unit will be worth the money you pay for it but I cannot attest to it&#x27;s durability since I&#x27;ve only gotten to use it once so far...  One more thing, the hand is not as ergonomic as I would have liked, as a female with small/medium hands.</li>
            <li> Andis quality is amazing. Love this clipper. I bought this one for myself, but have had an Andis corded for my Aussies for several years.</li>
            <li> I had to get a step down power transformer to start using the clipper, but the charger still failed to charge. Not a great 1st experience.</li>
            <li> This is quiet and cuts through my cockapoo&#x27;s hair with ease.  I&#x27;ve had it long enough now to believe it to be reliable.  It&#x27;s also easy for me to handle and I love having no cord to work around.  One of the best buys I&#x27;ve made.  I&#x27;ve already saved a bundle doing her myself rather than taking her to the groomer.  She also likes not having to be caged for hours at a time and we can take a break when necessary.</li>
            <li> excellent 5 stars on all parameter exclude the weight.</li>
            <li> only had for 6 months before the battery went got another battery and that one lasted 6 months i do not recommend this at all the cord is huge and always falls out of the plug which can become a problem on a busy day at the shop</li>
            <li> Perfect for maintaining a bald head and stubble.  If you shave your head more than once a week this the trimmer you want.</li>
            <li> The clippers work great, if they have a down side it&#x27;s that they are a little on the heavy side. Overall a great set of clippers clean cutting and the batteries last for at least an hour of cutting.</li>
            <li> Smooth takedown clippers  A must-have for any serious barber.</li>
            <li> Been using for about a year.  Will never go back to cheaper clippers.  Being able to swap out the blades for an exact size and not relying on plastic guards gives a much better cut.  I use a couple different length blades for my head and beard.  I can go from beard stable to a beard and keep it nice and even with no random long hairs.  I recommend the ceramic blades for this as they really don&#x27;t heat up near as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery lasts for well over a haircut and beard trim.  I leave it off the charger for a week or two at a time and it holds a charge so you can travel with it if needed.</li>
            <li> Was not very happy with this product, battery ran down after just 15 mins. of use. Would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These clippers precisely trim all hair types including beards.The clipper guards for this ceramic version are included, fit perfectly in the storage container, and on the clipper itself.</li>
            <li> Works great. A little heavy going cordless but balanced ok so no issues. Cuts very smooth both dry and wet with no pulling . Probably will buy plug in attachment at some point.</li>
            <li> These are the perfect clipper if you need them to travel easily, or do alot of clipper cuts in a day!!</li>
            <li> They need li-on batteries whatever they use is very poor!</li>
            <li> My BGR+ at first full charge did not last for more than 10 minutes. I couldn&#x27;t complete my first DIY hair cut. I then learned from the instruction that battery might not get fully charged if it didn&#x27;t get used for a while. I put the battery in the charger and initiated &#x27;refresh&#x27; a few times. The first refresh took only 10-15 minutes. I immediately ran another refresh again. The 2nd refresh took 5 hours; however, it still didn&#x27;t take 8 hours as specified but took much longer than the previous refresh. I took it as my battery got a good charge this time, at least 60-70%. I did a hair cut and this time I was able to finish my cut in about 30 minutes. So if you receive a &#x27;bad&#x27; battery, ran refresh a few times to check if this is the case. You can probably use the time refresh takes to determine how well the battery takes a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like my new Andis BGR+ very much. It doesn&#x27;t run silent but relatively quiet. It cuts well with plenty power. Other than the initial battery charging issue, built quality meets my expectation. I would recommend it to people who is looking to upgrade from cheap ones.</li>
            <li> Seems like an adequate trimmer but I think I have been deceived. The only reason I decided to take this trimmer is it appeared to be made in USA--not the case .Charger-chinese.Extra cord-chinese.Battery-chinese.Attachments-CHINESE.Need I go on. I should have purchased the Oster. Made by the Swiss but at least it isn&#x27;t CHINESE.SHAME ON YOU ANDIS!!!</li>
            <li> Sadly, my Andis arrived dislodged from it&#x27;s plastic carrying case when shipped. It was also missing the plastic blade &amp;#34;guard&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m not sure of the clipper&#x27;s internal condition, so it&#x27;s being returned to Amazon. I will probably reorder in a few months (my star rating is not influenced by the shipping condition, but on the clipper itself).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, the Andis is lighter, has superior ergonomics and a quieter motor when compared with the Oster 76. The Andis also requires less maintenance than the Oster 76. The quality of the plastic used in the Andis is of moderate quality and should be improved. My biggest gripe are the accessories. The charging stand is huge (so if you are short on bathroom counter space, keep this in mind). The Andis is marked &amp;#34;made in USA&amp;#34;. However, the charging stand, battery and comb attachments are all marked &amp;#34;made in China&amp;#34;. The clipper body and ceramic blade are marked USA. The accessories are not of the highest quality. Also of note: the charging stand smoked when charging (smelled like burning plastic). I thought this was normal until I read another reviewer with similar problems. I guess this wasn&#x27;t a quick review after all, sorry. In a nutshell, unless a cordless clipper is a must for you, I would recommend either the Oster 76 or Andis BGRC (corded) or BGRV (variable speed corded model). I think when I re-order I will swing for the BGRV and save about $100. The money you save could buy a nice blade collection.</li>
            <li> Powerful for sure. Quite heavy. Didn&#x27;t Last for two haircut in a row not bc of battery but bc it got really hot. You have to cool it off for the next haircut.</li>
            <li> I got these cause I am stationed in Japan, and the power is 50 Hz and not 60 Hz so American clippers are really loud.  At first I tried Japanese cordless clippers but they got to hot after a few minutes.  They cut great, and stay mostly cool to the touch.  My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t get these 14 years ago.</li>
            <li> While I like the quality of these clippers I do not like the weight.  I cut my own hair and have for years, these are just one of many clippers I have owned.  Given the choice over again I would go for the light weight cheaper and buy more often.  I have come to the same conclusion about vacuum cleaners, buy the cheap one and when its dirty throw it away and buy cheap again!!</li>
            <li> Nothing beats great quality. This is an expensive item, and worth every cent! I have had two cheap clippers (already reviewed)and this is where I should have been initially. Don&#x27;t buy this if you are old, because it will outlast you.</li>
            <li> Love it works very good</li>
            <li> Probably a very good clipper but very heavy. Not for a hair stylist</li>
            <li> It seems to be good quality but too heavy with the battery, weight is not balanced and the low number comb tips are very sharp which made it a no go for me.  This was for personal use, I used it once and did not like the feel and the sharp combs.  I gave it three stars because the quality seems to be good and if you use it as a tool on other people it may be Ok.  For the price I expected to be satisfied which I was not.</li>
            <li> All the power of a corded clipper, without the cord, and a long lasting battery as well. Cord free makes cutting so much easier,</li>
            <li> I just use it to shave my head and it works well for that.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not cheap but then again I didn&#x27;t want cheap,  I want solid, dependable, quality, and durability.</li>
            <li> i bought this expecting a great name brand product. i was very disappointed with the first time i used this on my clients.</li>
            <li> The Andis 64850 is a great cordless clipper.  I keep my hair buzzed extremely short, and I like to touch-up frequently to keep it looking &#x27;just right&#x27;.  I&#x27;ve had this clipper a couple weeks and have already used it for several trims... I&#x27;m extremely pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the first time you pick it up, the quality is obvious.  For years I &#x27;got by&#x27; on an inexpensive beard trimmer, using it mostly for facial hair, but later in its life, for shaving my head as well.  It did the trick, but it had several drawbacks that most trimmers and clippers suffer from, especially cordless clippers...  Short &#x27;run time&#x27;, slowing/degrading performance, plastic guards vs. real metal blades, hair gathering in the motor assembly, etc.  Every time I looked around for nicer trimmer or top-notch clippers, they were pretty expensive, so I kept putting it off and putting it off.  Finally my beard trimmer wouldn&#x27;t finish a haircut anymore (even plugged-in!) and I thought back on what a piece of junk it had been as I looked around for a replacement, although it DID survive many years.  It was time to buy something that would perform like pro equipment every time I reached for it for many years...  I got the Andis 64850.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always ready to go on its charging base, the Andis 64850 gives you pro results anytime you want them.  No cord- no slowing down.  No weak performance or &#x27;bogging down&#x27; and grabbing a hair here and there- It just works exactly like it&#x27;s supposed to.  It takes very little maintenance, cuts extremely well and evenly, and is said to run a FULL HOUR on one charge.  I haven&#x27;t used it for that long yet, but I can tell you that this thing keeps on running like it&#x27;s plugged into the wall, which was what I wanted.  As to the review mentioning the battery, I DID get the supposedly newer NiMH model.  The charger also detects when your clipper&#x27;s battery does or does not need charge, so it will not sit there trying to charge the thing 24/7 and kill the battery.  It also has a drain/refresh function for simple, fool-proof battery maintenance.  All these things combined, and anyone picking one of these up should be in good shape for a LONG time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I chose to go ahead and pick up some additional blades when I bought the clipper, the system does come with a large set of great quality &#x27;guards&#x27; ranging from 1/16\\&quot; to 1\\&quot;, so chances are you don&#x27;t NEED anything that&#x27;s not in the box already (other than maybe a spray cleaner if you&#x27;d like).  I thought I had seen a mention of it coming with a &#x27;1&#x27; blade, but FYI, mine came with a &#x27;000&#x27;.  I keep my hair so short that I went ahead and picked up a &#x27;1&#x27; blade, even though you still have pretty good flexibility with the 000 and included guards.  It&#x27;s really just a personal preference thing to me.  I also got the &#x27;OUTLINER&#x27; blade, which really works well for cutting down to NOTHING- So it&#x27;s great for necklines and facial hair, anywhere you want very clean lines.  I can do my entire neck and look like it was a pretty recent razor shave... and that&#x27;s not a simple task.  If you&#x27;d like to be able to simulate a razor shave, and get pretty darn close, pick up that blade, it&#x27;s great too.  I don&#x27;t think I really need to get into how much better it is to NOT be lugging a cord around as you try to cut someone&#x27;s hair, or like in my case, my own (or worse, with pet grooming).  It&#x27;s also pretty quiet, which is a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this thing a couple times, I was not surprised at all to see talk of it being used for dog grooming.  It could definitely handle the job with ease.  This is an item where overkill is a GOOD thing, and you know that if I&#x27;m saying it can handle a sheepdog, it can handle you, your kids, or your customers for that matter...  Let me not overlook that point: This is a professional unit, not your typical drugstore clipper/trimmer... While it may be expensive, my 3 trims in 2 weeks is at least one extra haircut than I&#x27;d normally get in that time, and they would have cost me at least $45 + tips.  Let&#x27;s say I just saved $30, total... It will pay itself off in NO TIME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ONLY complaint is that the guards can be a little on the sharp side.  Not a big deal though, as they could easily be filed/sanded with just a couple passes of the right material to take the &#x27;edge&#x27; off.  Don&#x27;t let that disuade you from a purchase: This is an awesome product!  MOST people will be just fine with the set as it comes in the box anyway, so you might never even use a bare blade, as you have the great assortment of guards at your disposal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spoil yourself a little.  If you don&#x27;t buy it now, you&#x27;re going to spend it on haircuts, or worse: A crappy clipper, that will one day break, leaving you right back where you are now, where you should&#x27;ve bought quality.  This is simply a personal item you don&#x27;t want to compromise on, or accept poor performance from.  Buy the 64850, and you won&#x27;t be doing either... You&#x27;ll be doing quite the opposite: Buying quality that will perform, and last.  It&#x27;s not cheap, but you get what you pay for.ust saved $30, total... It will pay itself off in NO TIME.

            <li> This works well but it is very heavy and larger than I expected. I use it on my Yorkies and small Poodle and it gets the job done quickly. It is not so easy to maneuver on small dogs though so I have a mini cordless for the hard to get to areas.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy . and got so hot immediately .</li>
            <li> My son loves this!  He&#x27;s training to be a barber.  Looking forward to using it for years.</li>
            <li> These clippers are great. I&#x27;ve been thinking about getting a wireless set of clippers for a while. I&#x27;ve always had cheap wired clippers ($40-$75 somewhere in that range) and I had no idea what I was missing. Although they&#x27;ve always worked, we would always have to be careful not to go too fast or they&#x27;d get bogged down. I have pretty thick hair. These things just go right through like a hot knife thru butter. I couldn&#x27;t believe how well they cut. Another issue we had was having to keep going over spots several times. Not with this thing! It produces a cleaner cut in a shorter time. And if there&#x27;s a problem with the blades or u want a different size , you can order those seperately. I&#x27;m sure there are other benefits for actual hairstylists but these are the standout features for me as a general consumer.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase. I was undecided between two products, but after reading numerous reviews of the Andis cordless, I gave gave in a spent the money for the &amp;#34;good one&amp;#34;. Good thing I did, because these clippers are worth every penny. Each use is like going to your favorite barber, because these clippers are every bit professional.</li>
            <li> I am a target/walmart clipper shopper.  The cheap plastic junk.  I thought they were good and I even bought a &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; pair.  then I Bought the Andis.  WOW...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought it was not vibrating enough and would not be strong enough.  I figured a good clipper had to make you hand go numb from vibration.  NOT TRUE.. This thing is so slick I even trimmed a little too much cause you don&#x27;t get the same grinding noise you get from the cheapo clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING:  I bought the less expensive version of the clipper only to find out it was the corded version and it did not come with any of the clipper guards.  Buy the more expensive version that is rechargable and you get a box and clipper guards too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted a cordless, detachable-blade clipper.  I purchased an Oster PowerTeq years ago but Oster was in the process of discontinuing that clipper and never had the accessory battery and charger available no matter where I looked. Nearly every other rechargeable clipper you&#x27;ll see is a trimmer or is a conventional clipper with blades that are not detachable. Enter the Andis BGR+!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t need a new clipper but I bought this one from a guy who was going to try cutting his own hair.  It didn&#x27;t work out quite like he planned so I was able to buy it for less than $100. (No brainer)  I tend to agree with others who have said this is too much clipper for home use given the cost. There are many great clippers out there which would be great for home use like the Wahl Designer with the adjustable blade. The key to using vibrating clippers is to keep the blades oiled and adjust the motor properly.  I&#x27;ve had one for years and years.  Be assured the BGR+ will be the last clipper you&#x27;ll ever buy if you do decide to get one for home use. It is a professional model with a powerful motor. I love the freedom of having no cord. It sits in the charger until I need it. No tangled cords to plug in and fuss with while you&#x27;re cutting. If you&#x27;re cutting your own hair, you&#x27;ll appreciate this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ceramic blades do run cooler than conventional blades. This clipper fits comfortably in my hand and it&#x27;s a bit nicer feel and balance than cutting with a big Oster 76. It has plenty of power to do a fast take down but is nimble enough to use as an outliner when used with a T-blade. A friend used it to cut my hair just after I got it. My hair got a bit shorter than usual (scalped, actually) because she didn&#x27;t want to stop using them. She wants to get them too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is good.  I&#x27;ve not used it continuously for an hour straight but I&#x27;ve done several cuts back to back to back but they didn&#x27;t slow down.  The charger has a quick-charge mode which keeps it going. It also has a battery &#x27;conditioner&#x27; which you&#x27;re supposed to use once a month to keep the battery from developing a memory. Push a button and the recycle occurs overnight. It&#x27;s still an old-school rechargeable rather than the newer tech batteries that avoid such things.  I haven&#x27;t noticed but I expect someday I&#x27;ll need to replace it.  The batteries seem expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My overall impression is this is a well-made clipper that you&#x27;ll enjoy using for years and years.</li>
            <li> Love it. I had to get use to it and educate myself. keep an extra battery and cord just in case. i dont keep it on the charger all the time, that was my first mistake. but all in all i love this clipper</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few months now.  Bought it to cut my own hair.  The design of these clippers is DATED.  The NiCad battery is heavy and inefficient. The set itself isn&#x27;t too heavy to manipulate.. but should be much lighter and ergonomic.  These clippers are NOT intended to cut fades.  I have ALL the blades for them from the \\&quot;Outliners\\&quot; to \\&quot;3 1/2\\&quot;.. but the lack of the \\&quot;open-close\\&quot; lever on the side makes it pretty difficult to cut a smooth fade.  I really wanted to like these clippers.  I&#x27;m not even bitter that I spent over $300 for the clippers, blades, guards and case.. It&#x27;s just a shame that there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a better alternative for wireless clippers.  Looking for a business idea?  The wireless clipper game is WIDE open.</li>
            <li> The best clippers i&#x27;ve ever owned</li>
            <li> Cuts through hair effortlessly.  Has the power for professional use all day.  A little heavy but it&#x27;s worth it.  And my clients love it also.  No pulling the hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my original set for 4 years not one problem</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with this hair clipper. it is not like cheap clippers which struggle to cut your hair. its blade is very sharp and powerful and cuts very smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;Other than top notch product quality, Their support is great, I had a problem with clipper charger and Andis was kind enough to send me a replacement for free.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for people who are looking for premium product.</li>
            <li> It wont hold a charge and the battery pack heats up only works for perhaps 5 mins. before it stops in the middel of a haircut.</li>
            <li> Amazing clippers until the battery goes up, went through 2 batteries in under a year(yes, I&#x27;ve used the power drain that the base does to keep the recharge memory going) and now about 2 minutes into a cut the motor just starts to die. Info says the only maintenance required is for the blades to be cleaned and oiled and that the inner workings are permanently lubricated at the factory and no maintenance is needed other than on the blades.  All of my cordless stuff works great for a while, but not worth the headache of having to replace batteries and not having the convenience of being able to really work on them when necessary without having to send them out.  Going back corded, they have more power that cordless clippers, anyway.</li>
            <li> I am not head over heels on this product. The build quality, as some have commented, is good but I expected something phenomenal after reading these comments. It&#x27;s just ok - feels like it could be made in China - but it is made in the good ole&#x27; US of A. The battery is still old school Nickel Metal Hydride (one reviewer thought that the new models might have a newer type Lithium-ion battery - NOPE). The head will get hot over time and eventually too hot to touch. The product description was also confusing, leading me to believe that this might have a cord after all (it does not - this is a Battery Only unit). This is not why I am docking stars, but I spent over 1 hour looking at all of the Andis models and the pictures and product descriptions can be bewildering. I&#x27;m satisfied with the product because it&#x27;s everything I wanted it to be: Cordless, long battery life and cuts hair. I will come back and update this review after several more uses but my first impression is luke warm.</li>
            <li> i gave 3 stars only because the charger is a 120v input only witch is very stupid knowing that 90% of the world is on 220-240v&lt;br /&gt;all DVD players, TV, washing machine etc, etc... are all both 110 to 240 v so at this price the charger should also support the 220-240v&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no need to add more comments about the product itself (it&#x27;s a real 5stars) many people did it in a very good way with a very long explanation so if you don&#x27;t have a problem with the 120v The product by itself is a very nice one with 5 stars quality</li>
            <li> BRG+: The #000 blade does not outline neckline (or shave neck) or sideburns as it does not go deep enough.  The plastic attachments are so sharp they cut/poke into the skin. They need to be &amp;#34;dulled&amp;#34; with a file or sandpaper.  The unit seems durable but it is heavy and a bit awkward to get used to.  Ordered straight from Amazon and it took a week to ship and several more days to be delivered.  Went on Amazon to read if anyone else has experienced same as we have and noticed Amazon&#x27;s price of the BRG+, a week after delivered, is now over $10.00 cheaper.  Disappointed all around, likely will return.</li>
            <li> cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the Ceramic  blade cut the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;120V if u live out side us but its not big problem u can use transformer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if u want bald look like what i want  try ( do-it-yourself balder) coz i stop use andis and back to my panasonic clipper</li>
            <li> Heavy duty, consistent and reliable</li>
            <li> Great clippers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you are a barber get these clippers ASAP no dought they will change the way you cut hair.</li>
            <li> I needed some clippers that I could take overseas with me and previously had bad experiences with voltage converters, so when I heard about the cordless Andis Ceramic BGR+, I was elated.  I tried them out here in States first.  I was impressed at how they cut evenly, but was somewhat disappointed that they didn&#x27;t closer, being that I like to be close to bald.  In fact, I cut my hair as close as the blades would allow, then brush the residual hair off then did a second pass.  The second pass did cut more, but I did a third pass with my $30 plug-in clippers and still got much closer.  I may send them back because they aren&#x27;t meeting my expectations for the cut, but they do the trick for when I&#x27;m overseas and may not have access to the proper voltage to operate any clippers.  It does hold a charge extremely well.  I used them everyday for one seven days straight and they never seemed to &#x27;dim&#x27; in performance.  I just wish they cut closer.  I am African-American so maybe they&#x27;ll perform better on a white guy, but if were looking for clippers to cut close, I&#x27;d spend less on something else.  If they had a blade that cut closer, these would be five stars all they way.</li>
            <li> The best clippers you&#x27;ll ever own!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow! Having used another brand from the big box stores for the last 15 years, and finally deciding I wanted something else, I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Professional grade, quiet, and sharp - goes through hair like nobody&#x27;s business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like best is the fact that the blades that touch your head aren&#x27;t sharp - the edges that is. The cutting blades are ceramic, and will last a long time. Perfect - easy to use, and great results. I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair forever, with a corded clipper, and using cord-free is quite the delight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit heavier than the other kind, but I was used to it after the first time. You can tell the difference in quality, and the fact that the drive mechanism must be different, makes a huge difference, too. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. Did I mention it&#x27;s quiet?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with the 0000 blade at 0.5 mm, and I ordered the 00000 for the 0.2 mm length as I like to keep it real short, but not shaved. Best purchase made all year, for sure.</li>
            <li> I had this product now over a year... and the battery will not hold a charge.  After contacting Andis... they would not replace the battery since it is over a year.  I purchased a $200 clipper now I have to purchase a battery for $60... what a piece of junk this is.  Will never purchase another Andis product... just too bad.</li>
            <li> I love these clippers.  I cut my own hair (a simple, short, men&#x27;s cut) and frankly, it&#x27;s not rocket science.  Nevertheless, hairdressers in three different states have managed to screw it up with regularity.  As a result, I started cutting my own hair with some big-store available clippers.  They did the job perfectly well, however, I hated having to deal with the cord.  It&#x27;s not the end of the world, but it is definitely annoying.  I cut my hair enough that I finally decided these were worth the investment.  Let me tell you, I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  These clippers are built like a tank.  The blades do get hot however, so be careful and oil them.  (You should anyway!)  It comes with a host of guides, although, perhaps not quite as many as the average consumer set.  Nevertheless, I&#x27;ve not been left wanting.  I can run these for an hour straight no problem.  Having no chord allows new angles and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  These are definitely a case of, &amp;#34;get what you pay for&amp;#34;.  They also have a hard traveling case...the whole bit.  Just bite the bullet and get them.  Also, you can get replacement parts and different blades for these.  Professional through and through.  You won&#x27;t regret it I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> Quiet, heavy duty unit.&lt;br /&gt;Pricey but I think you get what you pay for.  The ceramic blades makes the blade run much cooler than traditional steel blades. Excellent product, should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Incredible item, lightweight, powerful, great battery life. Removable blades are very easy to work with. Large variety of blade options.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but the batteries don&#x27;t last. Expect to buy new batteries (around $55 or so each) at least once per year. No matter how closely you follow the manufacturer instructions, the batteries are just very low quality and after 4-6 months, start to hold a very little charge.</li>
            <li> Good clipper that cuts very well. I wish the package had come with the optional cord but I&#x27;ll have to buy that separately.</li>
            <li> i love this machine. came with everything the description said it would. the guards r not all that but im getting the rest of the ceramic blades and im sure it will perform at its best</li>
            <li> These are my favorite clippers that I own! Well worth the money!! Love the ceramic blades and the freedom with the battery. Now al andis has to do is come out with a cordless master &amp; ceramic master blades!! That would be amazing!!</li>
            <li> The clipper looks and feels solid, but the charger smoked during the initial charge. Amazon replaced another one to me quickly, and the second one has no problem with the initial charge.</li>
            <li> I just got my trimmer delivered today and I thought that I might try it out. I read a review before I bought it saying that it runs for over an hour on a charge. I charged it fully before I tried it. 10 mins. is all it lasted until it died . While it was working it did cut great but it sure didn&#x27;t last an hour, good thing I order a cord with it.</li>
            <li> Works great with short hair and trimming, quiet and smooth. My wife love it.</li>
            <li> As of the date of this writing, Amazon&#x27;s description leaves something to be desired.  So I thought I would tell you exactly what&#x27;s in the box...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kit Includes:&lt;br /&gt;Rechargeable Clipper (including battery pack)&lt;br /&gt;CeramicEdge #000 blade&lt;br /&gt;7 black plastic attachment combs, sizes as follows:  1/16\\&quot;, 1/8\\&quot;, 1/4\\&quot;, 3/8\\&quot;, 1/2\\&quot;, 3/4\\&quot;, 1\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Charging base&lt;br /&gt;Storage Case&lt;br /&gt;4 oz. bottle of clipper oil&lt;br /&gt;Instructions/Owners Manual&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is NOT included is the electrical cord base that would replace the battery pack to make it a corded clipper rather than a rechargeable clipper. (Even though the corded base shows in one of the Amazon pictures!)  That is an accessory that can be purchased separately, but it is NOT included in this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note also that only one blade comes in this kit, the #000.  Other blades are available to be purchased separately.  The combs that clip onto the blade are what determines the haircut length using the blade that&#x27;s included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I like the clippers very much.  They seem like they will last a long time.  The charger has a discharge feature that you can use periodically to keep the battery pack from developing memory.  It charges the battery relatively quickly.  With the battery fully charged the clipper runs at a brisk pace and cuts very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The storage case holds everything nicely.  (It&#x27;s not like some storage cases where once it&#x27;s opened, you can never quite seem to get everything back in.)  The combs snap on and off easily and are clearly labeled for length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a good heavy duty clipper but a little on the heavy side because of the battery. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love these clippers they do absolutely what needs to be done!</li>
            <li> This is GREAT!  I use it on my dogs and I cut my husbands hair with it. LOVE, LOVE LOVE it!!!!</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this clipper.  I have a corded one but it doesn&#x27;t give me the flexibility that this one does.  I can use it anywhere.  Blades are easy to change and to clean.  It holds a charge for a very long time too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this Andis clipper to anyone.</li>
            <li> I watched a you tube video regarding another clipper I had purchased at a Salon wholesale store.&lt;br /&gt;The young lady talked about how the clipper I had just purchased was not at all good and it pulled her clients hair. That is the complaint I was getting from my client. She went on to say that the best clipper she had ever purchased was a Andis Ceramic Bgrc professional clipper.&lt;br /&gt;I searched everywhere locally and could not find. I searched Amazon, found it and had it shipped. I have to agree with her. In the 33 years of being a cosmetologist, this clipper is the best clipper by far. I like it so much better than my Oster 76. It is a little heavy but most important is battery operated with NO CORD!!!! Love it! Thank you Andis for making my work life a little easier.</li>
            <li> Nice clipper but had to send battery back to andis after it wouldn&#x27;t hold charge but andis replaced it for free so that&#x27;s a plus</li>
            <li> Bought for my girlfriend for work she loves it</li>
            <li> 5 stars!!! This product is everything described and more!!! Thank you so much for shipping it so quickly!!!</li>
            <li> Did not receive packing slip.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that having a cordless would make much of a difference, but it makes cutting my hair much easier. In addition, this is an outstanding device. Having used other cheaper devices in the past, this is well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Specifically, with a gliding it over my hair once, at most twice and it&#x27;s cut all even. It has cut down time spent to less than half the time and the results are infinitely better.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but I&#x27;d rather pay premium for a premium product.</li>
            <li> The best investment you could ever make!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item after trying a higher end Oster that I ended up returning.  This one works well, cuts smooth, is quiet and portable.  Has neat carrying case that everything actual fits back into.  Smooth guy cuts, variety of guides.</li>
            <li> The clipper get hot very quickly. The length of hair come out not evenly after I run the clipper through hair several times. I&#x27;m not very happy with this product. I thought that an expensive clipper would cut hair better than the cheaper one but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> This clipper rocks you could shave a camel with it. Everything that came with it is industrial quality. The last clipper you will ever need. I went through three lower cost one that lost thair charge. So far I have never had a chance to recharge this one.</li>
            <li> This is a very sturdy professional tool.  I have a few complaints.  It is heavy and sometimes awkward to balance in your hands.  You cannot leave the charger plugged in, or else the whole charger and unit will overheat.  So you have to charge it, and then unplug for awhile until you think it might need a charge.  But otherwise I would say that is 100% as powerful as a corded unit.  Definitely ditch the included plastic guards and spend the money on extra metal blades.</li>
            <li> Solid, Robust, Clear Professional design, the fastest charging, long lasting battery charge, rubs cool. Plus you don&#x27;t even feel the vibration when your hair is cut. Ceramic blades are a big difference. This is the last trimmer you will ever buy, and I have purchased many.</li>
            <li> I trim my own hair. I do not enjoy the time lost commuting to the barber aka hair stylist. I do not enjoy sitting and waiting my turn. I do not enjoy the empty banter. But wait, there is an alternative. Purchase a quality hair trimmer and trim your own hair. With the selection of plastic bits that hold tight to the trimmer blade, you can dial in different hair lengths for the top of my head, sides of my head, beard and mustache. Perfectly groomed, and pays for itself in about three months depending on your local barber prices and how much your time is valued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BGR+ has the feel of quality, and no cord to get in your way. The BGR+ has a permanent place on my counter.</li>
            <li> expensive initially but industrial grade and charge lasts forever. easy to clean. beard looks great. Had &#x27;em a couple years</li>
            <li> Great clippers for replacing wires and cables of your shelf. Charges battery while running the cord. (sold separate)This are a great replacement for your oster 76</li>
            <li> Mistakenly wrote a bad review on an andis blade. The description was for this clippers set.  I am very disappointed in this the overall quality (and I&#x27;m an andis fan). The guards are not universal as I found out the hard way. To do more damage to impressions, the clipper died while I had a client in my chair. This was after a full charge and I had perhaps used this clippers at most 10 times. Severely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Good price arrived on time and as described. Runs a bit hotter than the oster 76 blades. But no worries a lot less noisy.</li>
            <li> too heavy, I am looking to sell it after one use&lt;br /&gt;too expensive&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT pay half the price it sells for</li>
