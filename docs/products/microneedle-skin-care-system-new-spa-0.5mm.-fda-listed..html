            <li>I woke up looking great!</li>
            <li>but this gives great results if your patient.</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>I received my order in good time from this seller and the size was correct however the roller appears to be defective.</li>
            <li>the skin on my face is in good condition, i was just hoping to rejuvinate.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget to buy a good healing cream.</li>
            <li>The price is fair and the product is quality.</li>
            <li>But as I am getting braver, and using more pressure, I can see what everyone says about the pain!</li>
            <li>and they love it too!</li>
            <li>the first thing he said to me was, \\&quot;You look wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Nicely packaged, even though it all looked sterile</li>
            <li>Skin is very smooth..</li>
            <li>more can I say?  </li>
            <li>face gets more firming effect and my friends acknowledge that too</li>
            <li>Remember this will cause your skin to absorb a lot more of any product you apply, so be picky about your products.</li>
            <li>I love everything about this roller brand.</li>
            <li>so far so good!</li>
            <li>I have been using this in conjunction with Lumiere light therapy treatments in a salon, so I can&#x27;t be sure which I&#x27;m benefiting more from, but either way, I have noticed that my fine lines and wrinkles are diminishing and my skin looks firmer.  </li>
            <li>Used this for about 2 month, but haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction of fine lines or pores.  </li>
            <li>Shipment arrived very fast, very please with this product and loving the results!</li>
            <li>and sometimes it would spin freely, sometimes not.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this purchase overall.</li>
            <li>It is worth it!   </li>
            <li>Try rolling your face and then applying your special skin care lotion.</li>
            <li>Might be something you need to see a professional about before attempting on your own.</li>
            <li>Now I only use it at night when I can just put a good moisturizer on and not have to deal with sunscreen or makeup.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to return it because I need it right now, but</li>
            <li>However, while the raised areas seem to be improving, the rest of my face was becoming very blotchy and appeared to be receiving skin damage, so much so that I have discontinued use of the product at the moment.</li>
            <li>Very nice quality, small needles.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it brought tears to my eyes</li>
            <li>follow up later with progress report :)</li>
            <li>Anything you repeatedly stab yourself with should be of higher quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I am increasing my rating to three stars.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still interested in the skin needling concept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i guess, i was a bit ambitious.</li>
            <li>Ok I have only used 4x</li>
            <li>I love this and wish I had found it earlier!  </li>
            <li>Not even halfway through its first \\&quot;real\\&quot; use (and believe me I was being extremely gentle having not quite accustomed myself to the idea of self-injury in the name of vanity)</li>
            <li>I have very fair, pale, sensitive skin, and the first use actually tickled!</li>
            <li>I would not say \\&quot;Don&#x27;t get this product!\\&quot;, because it may end up working really well for you.</li>
            <li>I used it 3 or 4 times gently.</li>
            <li>I gave it a 4 out of 5 star because it hurts haha</li>
            <li>Was too intense for my face.</li>
            <li>I would get very irritated skin like a rash everytime</li>
            <li>ordered the .05 and am going to purchase the 1.0 very soon.</li>
            <li>the less painful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell a huge difference, but I do notice my skin care products absorb better.  </li>
            <li>The new roller has plenty of clearance between the barrel and arms</li>
            <li>but wow what a difference!   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the roller for only a week now, but the results are already promising.</li>
            <li>I am a 60 year old caucasian woman, if that has anything to do with anything.</li>
            <li>I did not have a chance to use it enough to see weather it really improve my skin tone or not.</li>
            <li>the barrel seized up rendering the roller completely unusable.</li>
            <li>I actually gave myself a bit of scrape on the forehead which hasn&#x27;t done much to improve my looks.</li>
            <li>The first pass doesn&#x27;t hurt it is the multiple passes over the same spot that you are suppose to do, feel like I am doing it on sunburnt skin.    </li>
            <li>The first time I was really sensitive to doing my jaw line and felt a bit feverish the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>I only stopped usage a couple days ago and already see and feel a marked improvement in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>It works if I use it regularly, I&#x27;ve noticed the lines and old acne scars fading.</li>

            <li> I was going slow enough to stop before any real damage was done.</li>
            <li> The seller quickly sent me a replacement roller as well as a return slip for the broken device.</li>
            <li> Cannot give a review one way or the other because I only used once......</li>
            <li> left little \\&quot;pock\\&quot; marks that took awhile to heal.</li>
            <li> Not appreciated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll have to return this and look at the other brands.  </li>
            <li> I just have to remember to use it, I tend to get lazy because it does take awhile to do your entire face in every direction with a minimum of 4 rolls each spot: Vertical, horizontal, and an X pattern.</li>
            <li> It carved little 0.5mm gouges down the center of my nose!  </li>
            <li> Very alarming!</li>
            <li> I keep a little spray bottle of 91% rubbing alcohol to spray it down before and after use.</li>
            <li> My little wrinkle disappeared.</li>
            <li> It does hurt, but I can take a little pain for beauty results.</li>
            <li> After a few uses, you do build a tolerance to the pain</li>
            <li> I am still waiting for the seller&#x27;s response re a refund or replacement but save yourself some trouble folks and look elsewhere for a roller.</li>
            <li> You have to learn how to use it.., Your  will be red, It is uncomfortable, But it works.</li>
            <li> If it did lock up tight, it would be a lot worse, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After one use, the needles feels dull already.</li>
            <li> I had read that it may be helpful to use something to numb your skin before use, but I did not find that necessary.</li>
            <li> The only problem with this device is that it IS quite painful, so I would recommend ordering Lidocaine cream along with it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for approximately three weeks now.</li>
            <li> I used the product as instructed, but I was not really happy with the short-term results.  </li>
            <li> I think this concept works and the seller stands behind the product.</li>
            <li> It actually is a little painful compared to others I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  </li>
            <li> Considering that I was sick and exhausted when I ran into him, this is a testament to how well these treatments seem to be working.  </li>
            <li> Also my worst wrinkles are just underneath my eyes where the skin is very thin and delicate, and it&#x27;s very difficult to access that area with the roller because of its shape, and it&#x27;s too painful for me to tolerate when I do try it.</li>
            <li> I would just say not to be disappointed if you spend your money and it doesn&#x27;t work as well as you&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> it was so painful!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Cannot give a review one way or the other because I only used once......</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the roller for only a week now, but the results are already promising. I have very fair, pale, sensitive skin, and the first use actually tickled! But as I am getting braver, and using more pressure, I can see what everyone says about the pain! I call it my \\&quot;Medieval torture device\\&quot; now... But hey, if it works, I&#x27;ll keep doing it! The lines on my forehead and  between my eyebrows seem to be softening.. I am even considering getting the 1.0 or 1.5 roller to step things up a bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for approximately three weeks now. I had read that it may be helpful to use something to numb your skin before use, but I did not find that necessary. I have some raised areas on my face that seem to be evening out with product use.  However, while the raised areas seem to be improving, the rest of my face was becoming very blotchy and appeared to be receiving skin damage, so much so that I have discontinued use of the product at the moment. I only stopped usage a couple days ago and already see and feel a marked improvement in the texture of my skin. I used the product as instructed, but I was not really happy with the short-term results.  Maybe over the long-term it may prove to be beneficial. I am a 60 year old caucasian woman, if that has anything to do with anything. I would not say \\&quot;Don&#x27;t get this product!\\&quot;, because it may end up working really well for you. I would just say not to be disappointed if you spend your money and it doesn&#x27;t work as well as you&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> I used it 3 or 4 times gently. It started getting locked. I did not have a chance to use it enough to see weather it really improve my skin tone or not.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because of various skin conditions on my face and wanted to see if it would help with scarring.  The first time I used it, it brought tears to my eyes it was so painful!  After a few uses, you do build a tolerance to the pain and I found that the faster I roll it over my skin, the less painful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell a huge difference, but I do notice my skin care products absorb better.  I&#x27;ve ordered bio oil to use along with this but have not received it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will follow up later with progress report :)</li>
            <li> I received my order in good time from this seller and the size was correct however the roller appears to be defective. Not even halfway through its first \\&quot;real\\&quot; use (and believe me I was being extremely gentle having not quite accustomed myself to the idea of self-injury in the name of vanity) the barrel seized up rendering the roller completely unusable. I actually gave myself a bit of scrape on the forehead which hasn&#x27;t done much to improve my looks. Ouch. Not appreciated. There may be an Aesop&#x27;s fable in here somewhere. I am still waiting for the seller&#x27;s response re a refund or replacement but save yourself some trouble folks and look elsewhere for a roller. Anything you repeatedly stab yourself with should be of higher quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I am increasing my rating to three stars. The seller quickly sent me a replacement roller as well as a return slip for the broken device. The new roller has plenty of clearance between the barrel and arms so I don&#x27;t anticipate this one will have the same issue. Bottom line- I think this concept works and the seller stands behind the product.</li>
            <li> I got pimples using it.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 4 out of 5 star because it hurts haha but i can handle the pain...but this gives great results if your patient. I used it for acne scars/acne and I&#x27;ve used it on my family and they love it too!</li>
            <li> I purchased this in hopes of reducing some acne scarring. I began seeing results after only 3 uses. The 4th time I used it, the drum locked. Very alarming! I was going slow enough to stop before any real damage was done. I used this according to the supplied instructions and did not deviate. Like another reviewer, I spun the wheel w/ my finger and sometimes it would spin freely, sometimes not.</li>
            <li> Only the third time I used it, and it&#x27;s locking up while turning!  It carved little 0.5mm gouges down the center of my nose!  I then played with it using my fingers, and sometimes it spins freely enough, and then it locks up again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What more can I say?  What could be WORSE?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the 1.5, a couple days earlier, and haven&#x27;t had the same problem with it.  That one has a lot stronger grip in the skin, though, to overcome friction.  If it did lock up tight, it would be a lot worse, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll have to return this and look at the other brands.  I&#x27;m still interested in the skin needling concept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m keeping my nose coated in moisturizer, hoping it will heal by tomorrow.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and actually got 1.0mm size. I&#x27;m not going to return it because I need it right now, but just FYI</li>
            <li> Was too intense for my face. the skin on my face is in good condition, i was just hoping to rejuvinate. left little \\&quot;pock\\&quot; marks that took awhile to heal. if youre gonna go for it just start on a smaller setting i guess, i was a bit ambitious. been usuing it on lower body where i have some keloid scarring from shaving. so far so good! I use it in the shower and when i get out i put some mederma (scar ointment) on after so it soaks in. no complaints!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mid-50s, sun damaged skin, medium skin tone.  Used this for about 2 month, but haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction of fine lines or pores.  Not impressed.  Might be something you need to see a professional about before attempting on your own.</li>
            <li> I thought I purchased the .5mm roller but received the 1mm. It actually is a little painful compared to others I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality, small needles.</li>
            <li> works great-like micro plastic surgery. just keep doing and not forgetting.my face gets more firming effect and my friends acknowledge that too</li>
            <li> You have to learn how to use it.., Your  will be red, It is uncomfortable, But it works. My little wrinkle disappeared. Don&#x27;t forget to buy a good healing cream.</li>
            <li> I have been using this in conjunction with Lumiere light therapy treatments in a salon, so I can&#x27;t be sure which I&#x27;m benefiting more from, but either way, I have noticed that my fine lines and wrinkles are diminishing and my skin looks firmer.  I saw a friend lastnight who I hadn&#x27;t seen in a month and the first thing he said to me was, \\&quot;You look wonderful.  You&#x27;re glowing.\\&quot; Considering that I was sick and exhausted when I ran into him, this is a testament to how well these treatments seem to be working.  The only problem with this device is that it IS quite painful, so I would recommend ordering Lidocaine cream along with it.  Also my worst wrinkles are just underneath my eyes where the skin is very thin and delicate, and it&#x27;s very difficult to access that area with the roller because of its shape, and it&#x27;s too painful for me to tolerate when I do try it.</li>
            <li> Ok I have only used 4x but wow what a difference!   I love this and wish I had found it earlier!  But saying that I will admit it hurts! The first pass doesn&#x27;t hurt it is the multiple passes over the same spot that you are suppose to do, feel like I am doing it on sunburnt skin.    I think I am getting use to the discomfort (I will say instead of pain)  It is worth it!   Shipment arrived very fast, very please with this product and loving the results!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this line when living in Australia. It&#x27;s a fantastic product. I don&#x27;t have any issues with it getting stuck.</li>
            <li> Try rolling your face and then applying your special skin care lotion. Amazing! I woke up looking great! Try in conjunction with a retinoids.</li>
            <li> It does hurt, but I can take a little pain for beauty results. I would get very irritated skin like a rash everytime I would use it and breakout. It&#x27;s n the back of my cabinets now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this purchase overall. Nicely packaged, even though it all looked sterile I keep a little spray bottle of 91% rubbing alcohol to spray it down before and after use. It works if I use it regularly, I&#x27;ve noticed the lines and old acne scars fading. I just have to remember to use it, I tend to get lazy because it does take awhile to do your entire face in every direction with a minimum of 4 rolls each spot: Vertical, horizontal, and an X pattern. The first time I was really sensitive to doing my jaw line and felt a bit feverish the rest of the day. Now I only use it at night when I can just put a good moisturizer on and not have to deal with sunscreen or makeup. Remember this will cause your skin to absorb a lot more of any product you apply, so be picky about your products.</li>

            <li> My wife loves this. Skin is very smooth..</li>
            <li> I love everything about this roller brand. The price is fair and the product is quality. It comes with instructions, as well. However, do your homework online to see how often you should roll.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the .05 and am going to purchase the 1.0 very soon.</li>
