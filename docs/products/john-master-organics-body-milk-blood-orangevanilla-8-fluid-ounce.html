            <li>I absolutely love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>but I love all of John masters products.</li>
            <li>but definitely the best option if you don&#x27;t like perfume.</li>
            <li>and I love that too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more moist than most lip balms and isn&#x27;t waxy at all.</li>

            <li>LOVE this lotion.</li>
            <li>Love, love this scent.</li>
            <li>Smells great clean fresh orange sent that is Not over.powering.</li>
            <li>This actually smells like fruity pebbles cereal and my skin absorbs it and makes it feel so good!</li>
            <li>This product definitely is one of the most pleasant luxuries that I afford myself.</li>
            <li>My favorite lip balm is their Lip Calm.</li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li>it go on smooth but feels greasy for a couple minutes...</li>
            <li>This is the only scented product I use on my skin, and I&#x27;m thrilled that it doesn&#x27;t cause a reaction of any kind.</li>
            <li>this all natural lotion leaves my skin smelling sooo good.</li>
            <li>rose water toning mist is amazing though, especially for summer, and a product I buy loyally from John Masters Organics.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite lotion!</li>
            <li>Then you&#x27;ll love this, because, as another poster pointed out, that&#x27;s exactly what this smells like.</li>
            <li>and they smell good but have never actually used one</li>
            <li>bought from Amazon.com, I was satisfied with getting items in reasonable.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff - found it at Whole Foods year ago.  </li>
            <li>I use it for full body....</li>
            <li>What I received must have been an old or expired product - the smell was not correct - more of a musty scent rather than the rich blood orange and vanilla.</li>
            <li>Smells great, absorbs quickly and really helps repair my dry cracked skin</li>
            <li>The smell of the lotion is so intoxicating first of all!  </li>
            <li>If you have never used this lush body lotion, you will LOVE it.</li>
            <li>He was right.</li>
            <li>This is my ultimate favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>I present for my favorite artist&#x27;s present.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>It smells very nice, though the scent doesn&#x27;t last for too long.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t blown away by this like some other reviews, smells nice and moisturizes</li>
            <li>The lotion is light and absorbs well, so I&#x27;ll try another scent (or the Bare), but I won&#x27;t get this again.</li>
            <li>Though this smells lovely, I can see myself becoming tired of it quickly.  </li>
            <li>and it actually made my skin feel good all day long!</li>
            <li>It is absolutely something that I would purchase again.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>A little of this lotion goes a long way, which is great.</li>
            <li>I really like John Master&#x27;s products because they tend to be highly organic and work well.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it and contacted John Masters customer service for information because I am not sure what caused the discoloration and if it could be hazardous change.</li>
            <li>Between the overpowering scent and the high price</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>You can really smell the citrus sweet of the blood orange, and the vanilla lingers with it for a long lasting, but light scent left afterward.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth the extra $$$$.</li>
            <li>On the body it leaves a film as well, and when I&#x27;ve used it on even my most incredibly dry winter skin, there is still an oily film left behind.&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I was using this product years ago, I always got complimented on how soft my skin was!  </li>
            <li>I will absolutely purchase this in the future, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I usually use this brand other items, I loved this brand natural perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My local Whole Foods stopped carrying it</li>
            <li>Not at all greasy and not too light or too heavy.</li>
            <li>Within a week, my skin is back to being soft again!!!</li>
            <li>I use barely a drop of the stuff and still wipe the excess off of my hands.  </li>
            <li>I will only purchase direct from John Masters now.</li>
            <li>Weirdly, other people, not so much.</li>

            <li> Weirdly, other people, not so much.</li>
            <li> I dab it on my neck and wrists, and the scent last a long time.</li>
            <li> so it has a thin consistency and doesn&#x27;t moisturize as much as a lotion or cream.  </li>
            <li> My last bottle which I purchased from John Master official website discolored to pink after one month which never happened in the past (I have emptied over 20 of these).  </li>
            <li> People already trip on the amount of boxes I get almost daily, but it is just a saved shopping trip arriving a little at a time!</li>
            <li> I like other john masters products as well but</li>
            <li> but overall the scent was not a favorite.</li>
            <li> ill certainly repurchase this one again and again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely sweet, and, for me, borders on unpleasant.</li>
            <li> John masters never lets you down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s too bad, because I really enjoy the scent of this lotion, and the fact that it&#x27;s organic, but I just can&#x27;t stand that filmy, greasy, dry oil feeling that the lotion leaves behind.</li>
            <li> This is my HG body product hands down!</li>
            <li> It is not cheap</li>
            <li> As others have noted, it doesn&#x27;t have the heavy moisturizing of creams, but I use whipped cocoa butter or like products when I need to protect my skin.</li>
            <li> mmmmmmm delicately vanilla and slightly orangy</li>
            <li> I usually dont like wearing lotion</li>
            <li> The scent is definitely present but not cloyingly or artificially</li>
            <li> The formula is too liquidy for me though, not very moisturizing and feels weird on my skin.</li>
            <li> this brand items is very expensive in Japanese shop.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wish it were less expensive</li>
            <li> This lotion leaves a very thick, almost drying film on your hands.</li>
            <li> The other vendor may have just gotten a bad batch.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with John Master customer service and thinking to switch to another brand.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love, love this fragance!!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this body milk and tried it today.  I would not put it on in the morning as I think co-workers would be able to smell it. The blood orange scent smells more like the chewable baby aspirin we had when I was a kid.  Note that it is a \\&quot;body milk\\&quot; - so it has a thin consistency and doesn&#x27;t moisturize as much as a lotion or cream.  Between the overpowering scent and the high price I am not a fan of this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion.  It smells so wonderful.  I wish it were less expensive then I would use it all the time rather than just occasionally.</li>
            <li> I have not tried this yet but I love all of John masters products. They don&#x27;t disappoint!</li>
            <li> This is my ultimate favorite lotion. It is not cheap but definitely the best option if you don&#x27;t like perfume. The smell is sensational!</li>
            <li> While I was using this product years ago, I always got complimented on how soft my skin was!  My local Whole Foods stopped carrying it so I was thrilled to see it on Amazon. Within a week, my skin is back to being soft again!!!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of John Masters organics Blood Orange &amp; Vanilla Body Milk! It&#x27;s refreshing with a great balance of the two scents. The consistency of the lotion is perfect. Not at all greasy and not too light or too heavy. I have purchased the Body Milk twice from Amazon and will continue to buy it. I also have the same scent of John Masters body wash and I love that too. My favorite lip balm is their Lip Calm. It&#x27;s more moist than most lip balms and isn&#x27;t waxy at all. I like that all these products are quality organics.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent light lotion. As others have noted, it doesn&#x27;t have the heavy moisturizing of creams, but I use whipped cocoa butter or like products when I need to protect my skin. This is the only scented product I use on my skin, and I&#x27;m thrilled that it doesn&#x27;t cause a reaction of any kind. The scent is definitely present but not cloyingly or artificially so. NOTE: unscrew the cap and smell it when it arrives. I got two bottles in a row that smelled spoiled, so I switched vendors and have been happy ever since. (I knew what it was meant to smell like because I used to buy it locally when I could still find it.) The other vendor may have just gotten a bad batch. They were polite about the returns.</li>
            <li> Another one of my FAVES. I really like John Master&#x27;s products because they tend to be highly organic and work well. This product definitely is one of the most pleasant luxuries that I afford myself. I find the smell to be heavenly. Weirdly, other people, not so much. Must be my hypersensitivity or something that makes me cant get enough of this smell. Besides that, it seems to work well. I wish it came in a bigger bottle though so I wouldn&#x27;t have to order it so often. People already trip on the amount of boxes I get almost daily, but it is just a saved shopping trip arriving a little at a time! With the cost of gas these days, not only do I save money but I reduce the footprint I make on our environment and get my shopping fix to boot!</li>
            <li> I am a John Master Organics user for several years now and especially liked this Blood Orange and Vanilla location. My last bottle which I purchased from John Master official website discolored to pink after one month which never happened in the past (I have emptied over 20 of these).  I stopped using it and contacted John Masters customer service for information because I am not sure what caused the discoloration and if it could be hazardous change. NO REPLY. I am very disappointed with John Master customer service and thinking to switch to another brand. I don&#x27;t think neither their product and the company is reliable anymore.</li>
            <li> mmmmmmm delicately vanilla and slightly orangy this all natural lotion leaves my skin smelling sooo good. the consstency is lightweight yet moisturing and like all JM products the organic all natural ingredients are nourishing and wonderful.</li>
            <li> The smell of the lotion is so intoxicating first of all!  The lotion is wonderful, smooth and silky, but the smell is wonderful!!! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love it  Organic  &amp; Non Greasy. Smells great clean fresh orange sent that is Not over.powering.</li>
            <li> Nice smelling and makes my skin feel great. John masters never lets you down.</li>
            <li> Everyone is different. Some didn&#x27;t like the scent at all, but I absolutely love it. I think it is my favorite smelling body lotion of all time.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of citrus, and this lotion smells so good. It is absolutely something that I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> It smells very nice, though the scent doesn&#x27;t last for too long. The formula is too liquidy for me though, not very moisturizing and feels weird on my skin. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I use lotions just because they are there and they smell good but have never actually used one and it actually made my skin feel good all day long! This actually smells like fruity pebbles cereal and my skin absorbs it and makes it feel so good! I will definitely repurchase. This is my HG body product hands down! Mmmmm smells amazing! It&#x27;s non greasy and I love it</li>
            <li> If you have never used this lush body lotion, you will LOVE it. Non greasy, smells great, and my skin&#x27;s condition has improved while using it. Ordered 2 bottles this time so I don&#x27;t run out!</li>
            <li> Then you&#x27;ll love this, because, as another poster pointed out, that&#x27;s exactly what this smells like. It&#x27;s extremely sweet, and, for me, borders on unpleasant. It also has incredible staying power for an organic, so it lingers all day (I was hoping it would dissipate, but it didn&#x27;t). The lotion is light and absorbs well, so I&#x27;ll try another scent (or the Bare), but I won&#x27;t get this again. Four stars for the organic lotion and it&#x27;s moisturizing properties, no stars for the scent. Jeez, John, dial it back.</li>
            <li> This body lotion smells amazing and feels amazing on the skin, its not thick and greasy, so its ideal for use in warm weather. I like other john masters products as well but ill certainly repurchase this one again and again.</li>
            <li> A little of this lotion goes a long way, which is great. The smell is fantastic. You can really smell the citrus sweet of the blood orange, and the vanilla lingers with it for a long lasting, but light scent left afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like about it though is a big deal for me and the lotion I use. This lotion leaves a very thick, almost drying film on your hands. I know it&#x27;s body lotion, but come on, it&#x27;s going to get on your hands, and the film is shiny and oily, but somehow has a drying effect at the same time. On the body it leaves a film as well, and when I&#x27;ve used it on even my most incredibly dry winter skin, there is still an oily film left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too bad, because I really enjoy the scent of this lotion, and the fact that it&#x27;s organic, but I just can&#x27;t stand that filmy, greasy, dry oil feeling that the lotion leaves behind. I won&#x27;t buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rose water toning mist is amazing though, especially for summer, and a product I buy loyally from John Masters Organics.</li>
            <li> I usually use this brand other items, I loved this brand natural perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this item. I present for my favorite artist&#x27;s present.&lt;br /&gt;But this brand items is very expensive in Japanese shop.&lt;br /&gt;I bought from Amazon.com, I was satisfied with getting items in reasonable.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite lotion! It smells so good and really absorbs nicely into your skin.  I usually dont like wearing lotion but since trying this i am on my second container.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t blown away by this like some other reviews, smells nice and moisturizes well but overall the scent was not a favorite.</li>
            <li> Wonderful tropical scent.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. So happy I found it.  Smells sooooo great and works really well. I am not a lotion person either.  This stuff rocks</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the lightness. I purchased this because my massage client wanted an organic lotion. He uses this product regularly at home. He was right. It is a great product. I only wish I could find it in a larger quantity.</li>
            <li> Though this smells lovely, I can see myself becoming tired of it quickly.  I am not a fan of the feel of the lotion...it go on smooth but feels greasy for a couple minutes...I use barely a drop of the stuff and still wipe the excess off of my hands.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It&#x27;s silky, absorbs quickly, and smells really good. I love the all-natural, organic ingredients. I will absolutely purchase this in the future, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff - found it at Whole Foods year ago.  They stopped carrying it so I came to Amazon.  What I received must have been an old or expired product - the smell was not correct - more of a musty scent rather than the rich blood orange and vanilla. I will only purchase direct from John Masters now.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this as lotion. Instead, I use it as I would cream perfume. I dab it on my neck and wrists, and the scent last a long time. If I need to freshen up, I just dab some more on throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Creamy, love scent, and just feels wonderful on the skin. I use it for full body.... even as a face moisturizer at times.</li>
            <li> LOVE this lotion. Worth the extra $$$$. Smells great, absorbs quickly and really helps repair my dry cracked skin</li>
            <li> Love, love this scent. Creamsicle-ish.</li>
