    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I have tried lots of ponytail bands but believe me when I say this is the best!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re perfect!</li>
            <li>, it was perfect for her as well.</li>
            <li>Works great and is attractive.</li>
            <li>This works great.  </li>
            <li>still get my fly aways under helmet but always do without a wrap too.</li>
            <li>but otherwise it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>What a great idea.</li>
            <li>plus, amazing gifts for all of my friends and family too.  </li>
            <li>Saw these on the Today Show, and liked them.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and the ponytail holder works!  </li>
            <li>Sent to daughter and daughter-in-law and both thought the Pulleez was a cute hair decoration and very comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>I had seen these on \\&quot;The Grommet\\&quot; &amp; was pleased to see Amazon carried them, to be able to add 1 to my order.</li>
            <li>okay ...  </li>
            <li>but i now love it.</li>
            <li>I love the Pulleez ponytail holders.</li>
            <li>I love the ease of this ponytail holder.</li>
            <li>Love that I can wear this all throughout the day either dressed up or casual.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I still have a lot of breakage from barrettes, but I don&#x27;t seem to be accumulating more since I started using this ponytail holder.</li>
            <li>I loved this product when I first heard about it.  </li>
            <li>i sometimes use a knee-hi hose sock to cover my ponytail to contain it on motorcycle, and i use the hanging elastic to tie around it a second time (then they also don&#x27;t blow in wind) and the beads seem to keep it tied &amp; secure perfectly.</li>
            <li>No breaking your hair or using a huge scrunchy.</li>
            <li>I have smooth, baby-fine hair.</li>
            <li>Very pretty, feels light, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Unique ponytail holder.</li>
            <li>and you have to take care to not turn your head too quickly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK but priced high for the material used.</li>
            <li>love pulleez, great to pull my hair back and double as a bracelet too!</li>
            <li>I have fine but thick wavy hair and it stays in my hair beautifully.  </li>
            <li>Dressy but great for everyday.</li>
            <li>I have fine thin hair and it works great.  </li>
            <li>slip it on my wrist when i take it off at stops, kind of looks like a bracelet &amp; not tight like standard elastics.</li>
            <li>It really stays in place.</li>
            <li>Quality product that elevates the look of a normal ponytail.</li>
            <li>but I have a very sensitive head.</li>
            <li>If you like a higher one on the back of your head, you&#x27;re going to need to do a lot of readjusting.</li>
            <li>so far it seems more durable than standard elastic bands that stretch out or break after only a few uses, if that.</li>
            <li>i have mostly straight fine hair, and a lot of it, long medium thick pony.</li>
            <li>If you prefer a low ponytail at the base of your neck, this is perfect.</li>
            <li>Other ponytail holders either fall off right away or slide off gradually over the following hour or two.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t pull out my hair when I take them out; the squeeze is gentle enough that I don&#x27;t think it breaks my hair, which all other ponytail holders do, even the ones that claim not to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty heavy</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have normal (not thin or thick) hair</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that it does tend to slip down straight hair.</li>

            <li> The only drawback is that it does tend to slip down straight hair.</li>
            <li> took a minute to figure out how to get it on my long mop</li>
            <li> I also like that I can wear it like a bracelet on those days when I don&#x27;t always want a pony, or waiting for my hair to dry before I put it up.</li>
            <li> Does not adjust tight enough for my use.</li>
            <li> It sometimes feels a little loose and doesn&#x27;t give quite as tight a ponytail as I sometimes want</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> and I have to keep readjusting it as it slides down.  </li>
            <li> The little silver balls on the end could probably chip a tooth, so be careful when wearing this and playing sports!</li>
            <li> have always worn plain hair ties around my wrist (not very flattering)</li>
            <li> hated the price for a hair-tie, but so far it&#x27;s worth it, well made.</li>
            <li> so I was disappointed, especially considering the high cost.</li>
            <li> A bit heavy</li>
            <li> I set the loop about midway, pull my hair through it like a usual hair tie, then cinch it up tight.  </li>
            <li> It was hard to find something to hold them that didn&#x27;t look childish or bland.</li>
            <li> it tends to get twisted up in the back of my hair when I use it for a ponytail.</li>
            <li> This product leaves a worse crimp in my hair then any other band I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> and she has thick hair</li>
            <li> like that the Pulleez come in dressy and casual styles.</li>

            <li> I had seen these on \\&quot;The Grommet\\&quot; &amp; was pleased to see Amazon carried them, to be able to add 1 to my order. After wearing, this it was admired by several people. So I purchased 2 as gifts. Unique ponytail holder.</li>
            <li> Works great and is attractive. It&#x27;s pretty heavy and you have to take care to not turn your head too quickly or you will smack yourself!</li>
            <li> This works great.  I have fine but thick wavy hair and it stays in my hair beautifully.  I set the loop about midway, pull my hair through it like a usual hair tie, then cinch it up tight.  Have never had it fall out, or even feel like it was going to.  The silver knots on the end give it a bit of style.  I also like that I can wear it like a bracelet on those days when I don&#x27;t always want a pony, or waiting for my hair to dry before I put it up.</li>
            <li> It does hold the hair.  Just need to double the loop in order to hold hair</li>
            <li> love pulleez, great to pull my hair back and double as a bracelet too! plus, amazing gifts for all of my friends and family too.  everyone should try them!</li>
            <li> I like the holder okay ...  it tends to get twisted up in the back of my hair when I use it for a ponytail.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK but priced high for the material used. Ends are metal but 6the adjustment clip is plastic. Does not adjust tight enough for my use.</li>
            <li> took a minute to figure out how to get it on my long mop but i now love it. i have mostly straight fine hair, and a lot of it, long medium thick pony. so far it seems more durable than standard elastic bands that stretch out or break after only a few uses, if that. hated the price for a hair-tie, but so far it&#x27;s worth it, well made. i sometimes use a knee-hi hose sock to cover my ponytail to contain it on motorcycle, and i use the hanging elastic to tie around it a second time (then they also don&#x27;t blow in wind) and the beads seem to keep it tied &amp; secure perfectly. still get my fly aways under helmet but always do without a wrap too. slip it on my wrist when i take it off at stops, kind of looks like a bracelet &amp; not tight like standard elastics. i&#x27;m ordering the gold &amp; trying the cheaper purple one too now.</li>
            <li> Quality product that elevates the look of a normal ponytail.</li>
            <li> I love the Pulleez ponytail holders. I have smooth, baby-fine hair. Other ponytail holders either fall off right away or slide off gradually over the following hour or two. They also take some of my hair with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pulleez ponytail holders are the only ones I&#x27;ve found that will hold my hair in place all day. They don&#x27;t pull out my hair when I take them out; the squeeze is gentle enough that I don&#x27;t think it breaks my hair, which all other ponytail holders do, even the ones that claim not to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the Pulleez come in dressy and casual styles. I have some of both.</li>
            <li> I love the ease of this ponytail holder. It sometimes feels a little loose and doesn&#x27;t give quite as tight a ponytail as I sometimes want but otherwise it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t hold hair well</li>
            <li> I loved this product when I first heard about it.  However, it is heavier than it looks and I have to keep readjusting it as it slides down.  I don&#x27;t have normal (not thin or thick) hair so I was disappointed, especially considering the high cost.</li>
            <li> Very pretty, feels light, and easy to use. Love that I can wear this all throughout the day either dressed up or casual.&lt;br /&gt;I have always worn plain hair ties around my wrist (not very flattering) but when I wear these on my wrist it looks like a bracelet with dangling charms</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t stay in my hair.</li>
            <li> Four stars. I&#x27;m trying to reduce the damage to my hair from barrettes, and this holder doesn&#x27;t seem to leave that &amp;#34;hump&amp;#34; in my hair that barrettes do. I still have a lot of breakage from barrettes, but I don&#x27;t seem to be accumulating more since I started using this ponytail holder. The only drawback is that it does tend to slip down straight hair. If you prefer a low ponytail at the base of your neck, this is perfect. If you like a higher one on the back of your head, you&#x27;re going to need to do a lot of readjusting. The little silver balls on the end could probably chip a tooth, so be careful when wearing this and playing sports! Maybe look into the plastic version if you&#x27;re engaged in an activity where you need to whip your head around a lot.</li>
            <li> Sent to daughter and daughter-in-law and both thought the Pulleez was a cute hair decoration and very comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of ponytail bands but believe me when I say this is the best! It really stays in place.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and the ponytail holder works!  A bit heavy but I have a very sensitive head.</li>
            <li> What a great idea. No breaking your hair or using a huge scrunchy. Why didn&#x27;t I think of this? Dressy but great for everyday.</li>
            <li> This product leaves a worse crimp in my hair then any other band I&#x27;ve used.  They claim it does not do this but oh yes it does! Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have dreadlocks, and I wear them pulled back. It was hard to find something to hold them that didn&#x27;t look childish or bland. Saw these on the Today Show, and liked them. They&#x27;re perfect!</li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair and it works great.  No breaking of my hair.  I also bought one for a gift and she has thick hair, it was perfect for her as well.</li>
