            <li>This is such a good buy and on top of that it happens to be my favorite  Eau de Cologne anyway.</li>
            <li>He more than I, but when I need a quick splash under my arms, it&#x27;s the cologne I choose.  </li>
            <li>However, with continued use I sense the light citrus and spice in my bedding and clothing.</li>
            <li>It has a light citrus scent with lavender and herbal notes.  </li>
            <li>This is a fabulous buy</li>

            <li>Smells so fresh and clean!  </li>
            <li>This is the original scent I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It is extremely light, unlike more modern fragrances.  </li>
            <li>What more can be said for a centuries old fragrance that has embraced the olfactory senses of generations, with its memorable scent?</li>
            <li>and I certainly saw a lot of this product because it is used by many people.</li>
            <li>Notification Of possible date of  delivery was good.</li>
            <li>So when I had finished the last bottle that I ordered a couple of years back from Walgreens, I thought I will check my beloved amazon for a good price on this cologne.</li>
            <li>Fresh and light...</li>
            <li>the larger size offers a great value to those who love this cologne.</li>
            <li>Strong alcohol and barbershop at smell at first to me.  </li>
            <li>Simply the best scent a human being can exude.</li>
            <li>Quick turn-around time from order to receipt of product.</li>
            <li>Also a little tip - When I have a headache,  I take a few drops in the palm of my hand and rub it on my temples - great soothing relief!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT - and super affordable!!!!</li>
            <li>This 4711 has been my favorite since finding it when I was stationed in Germany in the early 1960&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>My husband lived in Germany for a few years and this cologne is very popular there.  </li>
            <li>I put it on everyone at home to check if I getting this right.</li>
            <li>This is a classic light cologne that can be used liberally without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>The fragrance dissipates almost instantly where as previously, the 4711 would smell wonderful for hours after.</li>
            <li>It is light and fruitful a bit bitter and the best for everyday use.</li>
            <li>; (water from Cologne).It has a light ,refreshing scent that soon is only noticed when really close to wearer.</li>
            <li>i love the refreshing feeling you get when applying a few splashes.</li>
            <li>I love this cologne, it&#x27;s refreshing to spray on after a shower and does not have harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>The price, however, is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>For a while had a hard time finding it and was so happy to see it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that you still smell it later in the day.</li>
            <li>This cologne has a crisp citrus nose that refreshes without being cloying.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Never offensive,can be reapplied hours later for a refreshing .</li>
            <li>No other Cologne can compare to the clean fresh scent of 4711 after a bath.</li>
            <li>This was such a good find since we could only get it at the dutch store before.</li>
            <li>Love the 4711, i was looking for so long for this sent, its cause when i was working for marlon brando</li>
            <li>3 bottle gifted to my aunnts it was orgasmic forthese ladies bringing memories of long term use that is how i got used to it so send me another people take my colongesend me via amazon prime thanks cliff</li>
            <li>Note this is a large bottle.</li>
            <li>Size of a large liquor bottle.</li>
            <li>It consist of pure water with alcohol &amp; fragrance added.</li>
            <li>In fact I ordered the large bottle because I used it so fast.</li>
            <li>I buy the large bottles and use them to fill smaller convenient spray bottles available here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>And I sometimes enjoy the lighter scent myself, especially in the summer.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH</li>
            <li>The ABSOLUTE BEST!!!!~!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>so fast becasue</li>
            <li>Just has such a clean, light fragrance, but does last all day ...</li>
            <li>As long as it is available, I&#x27;ll be splashing it on after every shower.</li>
            <li>Crisp, masculine scent that is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Initially, as advertised, you cannot over use it, as it dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li>Decent value for the price.</li>
            <li>Therefore I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing the same cologne pretty much all my life.</li>
            <li>Men would put a few drops in a hanky and put over nose if in stinky situatuation. :-)</li>
            <li>I use it for a quick freshening up during the day, for a cool down during a hot summer day, and disinfecting minor wounds.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that it is not long lasting, but it is so refreshing, you can just use it over and over all day and NEVER tire of it.</li>
            <li>very natural scent.  </li>
            <li>I went through my first (smaller) bottle of 4711</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simply the best all-around fragrance, cologne, body-scent, etc. - especially for dry-hot and/or muggy climates - I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
            <li>She found the large bottles only in NY at the time.</li>
            <li>I got the large bottle, big mistake.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s&#x27; classy.</li>
            <li>smells fresh and is traditional European scent.  </li>
            <li>I did buy it in my hometown previously to support an independent local store but paid $25 more for exactly the same thing, I&#x27;m buying it now from Amazon.</li>
            <li>This time it is too mild and absolutely nothing close to what it usually is.</li>
            <li>I prefer this over most other expensive men&#x27;s colognes costing much more.  </li>
            <li>Then quickly quiets down to more subtle tones.  </li>
            <li>it apparently has been used in Europe for quite some time.  </li>
            <li>There it was, marked down to a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Hard to beat the pricing, the ease of purchase and the quick delivery.</li>
            <li>time the distinctive lavender scent is missing, it is just pure</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The price, however, is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> For a while had a hard time finding it and was so happy to see it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that you still smell it later in the day.</li>

            <li> It consist of pure water with alcohol &amp; fragrance added.</li>
            <li> In fact I ordered the large bottle because I used it so fast.</li>
            <li> I buy the large bottles and use them to fill smaller convenient spray bottles available here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> And I sometimes enjoy the lighter scent myself, especially in the summer.</li>
            <li> SO MUCH</li>
            <li> The ABSOLUTE BEST!!!!~!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> so fast becasue</li>
            <li> Just has such a clean, light fragrance, but does last all day ...</li>
            <li> As long as it is available, I&#x27;ll be splashing it on after every shower.</li>
            <li> Crisp, masculine scent that is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Initially, as advertised, you cannot over use it, as it dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li> Decent value for the price.</li>
            <li> Therefore I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing the same cologne pretty much all my life.</li>
            <li> Men would put a few drops in a hanky and put over nose if in stinky situatuation. :-)</li>
            <li> I use it for a quick freshening up during the day, for a cool down during a hot summer day, and disinfecting minor wounds.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it is not long lasting, but it is so refreshing, you can just use it over and over all day and NEVER tire of it.</li>
            <li> very natural scent.  </li>
            <li> I went through my first (smaller) bottle of 4711</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply the best all-around fragrance, cologne, body-scent, etc. - especially for dry-hot and/or muggy climates - I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
            <li> She found the large bottles only in NY at the time.</li>
            <li> I got the large bottle, big mistake.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s&#x27; classy.</li>
            <li> smells fresh and is traditional European scent.  </li>
            <li> I did buy it in my hometown previously to support an independent local store but paid $25 more for exactly the same thing, I&#x27;m buying it now from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This time it is too mild and absolutely nothing close to what it usually is.</li>
            <li> I prefer this over most other expensive men&#x27;s colognes costing much more.  </li>
            <li> Then quickly quiets down to more subtle tones.  </li>
            <li> it apparently has been used in Europe for quite some time.  </li>
            <li> There it was, marked down to a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Hard to beat the pricing, the ease of purchase and the quick delivery.</li>
            <li> time the distinctive lavender scent is missing, it is just pure</li>
            <li> The large bottles was hard to find before internet.  </li>
            <li> Other similar fragrances dry my skin, this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> udes for very long years...</li>
            <li> Not overbearing and lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li> My wife has used the Mexican Agua de Colonia for several decades but that is not easily available in the USA.</li>
            <li> Little booboos go away instantly when we apply some 4711 and the kids are off to play again.</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> I use it also for a base to experiment with my own fragrances and combine with herbs, spices, flowers, plants, and scents.</li>
            <li> How can you go wrong on a very old cologne from Cologne Germany where they have been making it for the last 3 centuries.</li>
            <li> Bought this size before and usually lasts us ten years or longer.  </li>
            <li> This is the product that originated the category,henceforth all products like this were commonly called &amp;#34;cologne water&amp;#34; or simply &amp;#34;cologne&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the same I was used to, just not the same and rather expensive also  They must have chaged the frmula.  </li>
            <li> It took me a little while to like it</li>
            <li> I grew up with it and missed it for years as  I was not able to find it in stores.</li>
            <li> This is hard to find.</li>
            <li> It does linger when you wear it, fading to a barely perceptible note on the skin, making it almost impossible to over apply.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if I got a fake one or if they changed something in the contents.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> If you get a chance to sample it somewhere, I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> am very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Refreshing and fair price for the quality of this eau de cologne!</li>
            <li> Been using it for 30 years.</li>
            <li> My wife has used the Mexican Agua de Colonia for several decades but that is not easily available in the USA. The 4711 by Muelhens is an excellent substitute.</li>
            <li> I was intrigued by this products history and customers.  I am a male and it is growing on me.  Initially, as advertised, you cannot over use it, as it dissipates quickly.  However, with continued use I sense the light citrus and spice in my bedding and clothing. I love it!</li>
            <li> I have always loved this scent. I use it for a quick freshening up during the day, for a cool down during a hot summer day, and disinfecting minor wounds. The essential oils help heal and make you feel well.</li>
            <li> I did not care for it I would not order it again</li>
            <li> I like the perfume (smell) of this cologne. It is light and fruitful a bit bitter and the best for everyday use. I am happy to find it in your shops...</li>
            <li> Simply the best scent a human being can exude.</li>
            <li> My Mother in Law got me a bottle of this for Christmas, and I loved it. In fact I ordered the large bottle because I used it so fast. A very nice light fragrance. I love the fact that you still smell it later in the day.</li>
            <li> Product provided was as ordered.Notification Of possible date of  delivery was good. Actual Delivery took longer than anticipated. Still the transaction can be rated as Very Good .</li>
            <li> BEST STUFF IN THE WORLD</li>
            <li> My husband lived in Germany for a few years and this cologne is very popular there.  That&#x27;s where he started using it.  It is his favorite cologne.  It has a nice citrus touch.</li>
            <li> I gave this product to a friend.  She said it had weaker fragrance than she remembered it to have.  The price, however, is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using 4711 for over 30 years.  The large bottles was hard to find before internet.  She found the large bottles only in NY at the time.</li>
            <li> udes for very long years...allways the very best quality....</li>
            <li> This cologne has a crisp citrus nose that refreshes without being cloying.  And I sometimes enjoy the lighter scent myself, especially in the summer.</li>
            <li> Love the 4711, i was looking for so long for this sent, its cause when i was working for marlon brando he walked up to me and was talking to me and the sent that i just fell in love with it and i did not ask him, so now i am living with the niece of marlon i ask her what did he us and she told me 4711 and she has some to,and  that was his favorite body splash when he got out of the shower, and now i got it and i LOVE IT!! so much&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU SO MUCH</li>
            <li> Refreshing, light, just right for the morning splash on the face</li>
            <li> Fantastic low-key fragrance that leaves a lemmony clean scent on your skin and clothes.  Not overbearing and lasts a very long time.  I prefer this over most other expensive men&#x27;s colognes costing much more.  I buy the large bottles and use them to fill smaller convenient spray bottles available here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> 4711 is arguably the \\&quot;original\\&quot; cologne, with the exception of Farina, produced in Cologne, Germany for over 100 years.  It has a light citrus scent with lavender and herbal notes.  It is extremely light, unlike more modern fragrances.  It does linger when you wear it, fading to a barely perceptible note on the skin, making it almost impossible to over apply.  Because of the light, predominantly citrus profile, it is both suitable for men and women.  It is not cloying at all.  It has been one of my summertime favorites for years.  For the price, it is an exceptional value.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best splash, I remember when it was a great price at &amp;#34;Goldblatt&#x27;s, this was to, huge bottle!!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing the same cologne pretty much all my life. I did buy it in my hometown previously to support an independent local store but paid $25 more for exactly the same thing, I&#x27;m buying it now from Amazon. Hard to beat the pricing, the ease of purchase and the quick delivery. The sales tax do make me pause though.</li>
            <li> What more can be said for a centuries old fragrance that has embraced the olfactory senses of generations, with its memorable scent?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan and user of 4711 for 35 years. It&#x27;s simply the best all-around fragrance, cologne, body-scent, etc. - especially for dry-hot and/or muggy climates - I&#x27;ve ever found. As long as it is available, I&#x27;ll be splashing it on after every shower. By the way, I am a man in my mid-50s. It&#x27;s the perfect non-gender-specific scent.</li>
            <li> This 4711 has been my favorite since finding it when I was stationed in Germany in the early 1960&#x27;s.  I am getting Another 27 oz. bottle again.</li>
            <li> A very fresh scent, not at all overpowering, and the most hypoallergenic product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand for ages. My aunt used it and I loved the smell as a child.&lt;br /&gt;This time the distinctive lavender scent is missing, it is just pure alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the same I was used to, just not the same and rather expensive also  They must have chaged the frmula.  I won&#x27;t buy any more of this..</li>
            <li> A product steeped in German traditon and upholding principles of a simpler time. Predicated upon a melange of nature&#x27;s fragrances from time immemorial; well-blended and reimagined into an Eau De Cologne, par excellence.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the fragrance I use to love. I was disappointed.  I got the large bottle, big mistake. Try the smaller bottle if you decide to get.</li>
            <li> almost finished the bottle better order another one</li>
            <li> Given as gift to friend who loved it.  No disappointments here!</li>
            <li> I used this while in my college days and just recently picked up a couple of bottles from Amazon. i love the refreshing feeling you get when applying a few splashes. Want to get compliments, use 4711 cologne, made in Germany for centuries</li>
            <li> My wife was born and raised in Germany and has used this product to over 70 years.  That should have been enough of a recommendation.  I was stationed in Germany for 12 years and I certainly saw a lot of this product because it is used by many people.</li>
            <li> My favorite Cologne since adolescence!</li>
            <li> How can you go wrong on a very old cologne from Cologne Germany where they have been making it for the last 3 centuries. My wife loves me more than ever for buying her this.</li>
            <li> Strong alcohol and barbershop at smell at first to me.  Then quickly quiets down to more subtle tones.  I use it also for a base to experiment with my own fragrances and combine with herbs, spices, flowers, plants, and scents.</li>
            <li> Have really liked this scent for years.  I get it for my husband, but I use it sometimes as well!  It is a clean citrusy scent, light.</li>
            <li> Should not be called cologne. It is water with a touch of fragrance which dissipates in seconds. Suggest you save your money for something better.</li>
            <li> Pretty cool, and the kind of product I like to support. Think of it like &amp;#34;body spray&amp;#34; that doesn&#x27;t gross you out. I occasionally will use it to mask odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bar of soap is great as well.</li>
            <li> 3 bottle gifted to my aunnts it was orgasmic forthese ladies bringing memories of long term use that is how i got used to it so send me another people take my colongesend me via amazon prime thanks cliff</li>
            <li> Good smell.  Not feminine</li>
            <li> Started wearing this cologne in the 1970&#x27;s and wore it for years.  For a while had a hard time finding it and was so happy to see it on Amazon.  My god son liked the way it smelled and I sent him the big bottle for his birthday.  He wears it every day.</li>
            <li> This is such a good buy and on top of that it happens to be my favorite  Eau de Cologne anyway. It is so refreshing .</li>
            <li> This is the best !  You will never be disappointedl</li>
            <li> I discovered 4711 in S.E. Asia while I was doing government work during the Viet Nam era in the 1960&#x27;s. No other Cologne can compare to the clean fresh scent of 4711 after a bath. Nothing........    That said, I&#x27;ve used 4711 for over 40+ years and need no other \\&quot;smell good\\&quot; to keep me happy!</li>
            <li> Iam very happy with my purchase.The 4711 cologne is my favorite.I got agreat product and service. I will buy from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> 4711 is a fresh scent good for men and women. It&#x27;s a splash, so pour some in your hands and rub it on  your neck and arms for a fragrance that last all day!</li>
            <li> Have loved this scent for decades.  Still love it.  Will always love it.  Light and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Fresh clean cologne in a beautiful bottle</li>
            <li> I love this Cologne !!!</li>
            <li> This is hard to find. It&#x27;s the original cologne!!</li>
            <li> We have always had 4711 in the family for generations. The kids use it, and so do the adults. Little booboos go away instantly when we apply some 4711 and the kids are off to play again. Magical it seems! ;) So when I had finished the last bottle that I ordered a couple of years back from Walgreens, I thought I will check my beloved amazon for a good price on this cologne. There it was, marked down to a reasonable price. Here&#x27;s the thing, though. It&#x27;s not the same 4711. Where is the citrus undertone? The bottle I received didn&#x27;t have that same fragrance as my last bottle of 4711. This time it is too mild and absolutely nothing close to what it usually is. I put it on everyone at home to check if I getting this right. The fragrance dissipates almost instantly where as previously, the 4711 would smell wonderful for hours after. I am disappointed. I am not sure if I got a fake one or if they changed something in the contents.</li>
            <li> What a bargain in the 800 ml size.  Bought this size before and usually lasts us ten years or longer.  Love the scent.</li>
            <li> Hve used it for years..happy to have Amazon&#x27;s price and ailing</li>
            <li> I use this product as an Eau de Cologne .Super - refreshing!  Have used for years and years!  The ABSOLUTE BEST!!!!~!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Also a little tip - When I have a headache,  I take a few drops in the palm of my hand and rub it on my temples - great soothing relief!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT - and super affordable!!!! for this size!!!!</li>
            <li> Very refreshing without the strong perfume. I have been using it for 45 years and never found a more refreshing cologne.</li>
            <li> Use product regularly. Arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> It has such a beautiful refreshing scent. I grew up with it and missed it for years as  I was not able to find it in stores. It&#x27;s&#x27; classy. Therefore I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Fresh and light... it apparently has been used in Europe for quite some time.  I used it decades ago and hadn&#x27;t found it since. This is a fabulous buy and i love it.  Just has such a clean, light fragrance, but does last all day ...</li>
            <li> As you probably know, this product has been around for decades.  Both my husband and I use this product.  He more than I, but when I need a quick splash under my arms, it&#x27;s the cologne I choose.  The fragrance is very pleasant, very fresh, and very unisex.  If you get a chance to sample it somewhere, I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I can rely on 4711 to always be a successful gift for women and men. Love this product since my decades living in Germany</li>
            <li> Best old time fragrance ever!  I first experienced it while living in Germany as a child.  Fond  memories of my mom..... now my daughter&#x27;s wear it to remind them of me.</li>
            <li> received  and  satisfied....</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne at the best price. Thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> Boyfriend loves this!  Thanks</li>
            <li> My dutch in laws love this stuff. They say it helps with nausea and can has bug repellant properties. The smell is very unique. It took me a little while to like it but now I do. This was such a good find since we could only get it at the dutch store before.</li>
            <li> Have used this for 50 years and it is a pleasing fragrance.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my elderly mother who has many memories of it from years gone by. This is a classic light cologne that can be used liberally without being overpowering. Compared to mail-order catalogs, the price can&#x27;t be beat. Quick turn-around time from order to receipt of product. Great service and great value!</li>
            <li> A great fragrance for every occasion</li>
            <li> Light fragrance and refreshing for the day, in any season. It also gives a great feeling after bath. Other similar fragrances dry my skin, this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful cologne...very natural scent.  The only problem is that it is not long lasting, but it is so refreshing, you can just use it over and over all day and NEVER tire of it.</li>
            <li> This is the original scent I was looking for. Note this is a large bottle. Size of a large liquor bottle. But I love it and will buy again from this seller</li>
            <li> I went through my first (smaller) bottle of 4711 so fast becasue I tend to wear it in the evenings at home and on weekends anytime.  My wife thinks I may have a problem becasue this one is the size of a liquor bottle.</li>
            <li> Need to get more !!!!</li>
            <li> THE ORIGINAL splash!. This is the product that originated the category,henceforth all products like this were commonly called &amp;#34;cologne water&amp;#34; or simply &amp;#34;cologne&amp;#34;.  It consist of pure water with alcohol &amp; fragrance added.Made in the city of&lt;br /&gt;Cologne, Germany,popularized by Napoleon&#x27;s army, therefore the french name &amp;#34;Eau de Cologne&amp;#34; (water from Cologne).It has a light ,refreshing scent that soon is only noticed when really close to wearer. Never offensive,can be reapplied hours later for a refreshing .</li>
            <li> Crisp, masculine scent that is not overpowering.  Decent value for the price. Does not sting after shaving like many others.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne, it&#x27;s refreshing to spray on after a shower and does not have harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Smells so fresh and clean!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Always the best.....arrived as posted, excellent packaging, the best!</li>
            <li> unisex, splash on arms and underarms and it reconstitutes when you perspire.  better than chemical carcinogenic deodorants.  smells fresh and is traditional European scent.  Men would put a few drops in a hanky and put over nose if in stinky situatuation. :-)</li>
            <li> have always loved this scent - and the packaging as well.</li>
            <li> Love the scent ..Gave as Christmas Gift.  Well received!!!</li>
