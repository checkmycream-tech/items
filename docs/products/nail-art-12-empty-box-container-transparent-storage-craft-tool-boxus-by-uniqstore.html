            <li>and I will be ordering more</li>
            <li>The top lid from the case did came broke</li>
            <li>So will order again when i need more .</li>
            <li>but, place it in the right pull string bag, your good to go :)</li>
            <li>The containers inside the case were untouched and in a pretty good condition.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They are sturdy and last after repeated uses&lt;br /&gt;very cool product and excellent seller-came quickly and well packaged</li>
            <li>Most of my nail art accessories come in cheap plastic baggies that can rip super easily.</li>
            <li>Awesome little containers.</li>
            <li>in all, it was cheap.</li>
            <li>Great containers for several uses.</li>
            <li>Also great for storing different nail art supplies, from glitter to colored powders.</li>
            <li>But I have to say, there are cute and very well made.</li>
            <li>Not for acrylic storage only good to store certain stones</li>
            <li>and i was able to perfectly fit my cute little bows in them.</li>
            <li>NICE FOR STORAGE OF UR FUN MIXED COLORS</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried them in hot weather</li>
            <li>The item arrived exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>first off, it took just about 3 weeks to get here.</li>
            <li>Plus the individual containers are cute.</li>
            <li>not too big not too small- a great sampler size!</li>
            <li>The item arrived exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Makes small items that can be easily lost very easy to find.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, price was right and was as described.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t all shut properly and break really easily.</li>
            <li>I used these for my loose powder makeup and they work phenomenal.</li>
            <li>I really like them</li>
            <li>Good thing I wasn&#x27;t expecting typical standard shipping??</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind waiting a while for the product and are willing to gamble on whether or not it&#x27;ll arrive unblemished, but I wouldn&#x27;t do it again.</li>
            <li>This is neat little item to have, because you can use it for so many purposes.  </li>
            <li>The actual containers are good containers but very small.</li>
            <li>The lid comes off a little easy</li>
            <li>when I got it, it was early witch</li>
            <li>but i dont mind i fixed it .</li>
            <li>and I was a bit surprised at the size</li>
            <li>Heavy, durable and clean.  </li>
            <li>x 1 cm ( they fit 3 MM&#x27;s inside), too small for what I was planning to do with them.</li>
            <li>These little cups came quickly and packaged well</li>
            <li>The whole case is about 4 1/2 inches wide - you could maybe keep a piece of gym in one of these cylinders.  </li>
            <li>It took a month for me to get it, since apparently it comes all the way from China, and although it was apparently well wrapped, one of the container came cracked and one of the larger cover tops for all the container.</li>
            <li>and i love this little jars they are small</li>
            <li>Wow, Im not sure why I was expecting so much for $2.30.  </li>
            <li>These little boxes are very helpful but they are not recyclable and the plastic container which holds them is not recyclable either.</li>

            <li> These little boxes are very helpful but they are not recyclable and the plastic container which holds them is not recyclable either.</li>
            <li> I had bought some small rhinestones that came in cheap, flimsy baggies that I was afraid would tear too easily.</li>
            <li> It took a really long time for them to come in the mail..</li>
            <li> Took a relatively long time to ship - order placed October 29th arrived today November</li>
            <li> You could put earring backs, stud earrings, fingernail jewels and decals, small screws and tons of other small items in this handy little container, so they are not easily lost.</li>
            <li> The little containers...are SOOOOOO tiny.  </li>
            <li> A LITTLE BIGGER</li>
            <li> This arrived in the mail today and the outer case was cracked in several small  spots on the back, and completely in half on the front.</li>
            <li> pretty mush useless for me</li>
            <li> I assume due to the fact that it was packed in a flimsy bubble envelope.</li>
            <li> I bought this to put some loose eye shadows in, which I bought (that were delivered in little ziploc baggies).  </li>
            <li> my major complaint is that MINE DID NOT COME WITH LIDS!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little bit wider than a quarter</li>
            <li> I am a little disappoited with this boxes.</li>
            <li> Case was cracked from shipping but not a huge issue.</li>
            <li> They usually come in little baggies</li>
            <li> The box arrived with a cover, however the 12 small containers within arrived without even one cover.</li>
            <li> they may hold 1/8 teasppoon of acrylic powder, small beads, or small nail jewels.  </li>
            <li> but it is sometimes hard to determine size based on a description or dimensions.  </li>
            <li> When the package arrived and I opened it all three were packed into the small package together and the two container on either end were scratched and parts a bit broken.  </li>
            <li> Also, the picture is a bit deceiving, these containers are very small.</li>
            <li> The case was broken when I received the item.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely useless.</li>
            <li> this was a terrible product that i will not purchase again.  </li>
            <li> and i ordered 4 of them, and when i got them, some of them were cracked, and there were these brown spots in some of them that looked disgusting.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great product. Using it for my nail accessory supplies.</li>
            <li> This arrived in the mail today and the outer case was cracked in several small  spots on the back, and completely in half on the front. If it had arrived in good condition my review would be 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The containers that I was sent did not have any lids so rendering this item pretty mush useless for me</li>
            <li> Just the size I need foe what I do. Very cute and convenient. I use these for the samples I give out for my products.</li>
            <li> This came on time and was well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im using it for beading supplies but you could use it for anything, really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im glad I made the purchase. Great product!</li>
            <li> The actual containers are good containers but very small. I didn&#x27;t realize these were coming all the way from china or else I would not have ordered them. It took a really long time for them to come in the mail..Good thing I wasn&#x27;t expecting typical standard shipping??</li>
            <li> The case was broken when I received the item.  The little containers...are SOOOOOO tiny.  They don&#x27;t all shut properly and break really easily.</li>
            <li> Took a relatively long time to ship - order placed October 29th arrived today November 22.&lt;br /&gt;The case was cracked on arrival. I assume due to the fact that it was packed in a flimsy bubble envelope. The jars appear to be fine.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it was cheap. The jars are still useable. If you don&#x27;t mind waiting a while for the product and are willing to gamble on whether or not it&#x27;ll arrive unblemished, but I wouldn&#x27;t do it again.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little bit wider than a quarter and they&#x27;re probably taller then a cm. I really like them, they&#x27;re perfect for my homemade lip balm since large amounts can get contaminated with germs and what not. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Perfect just like the pictures, these will be perfect for lipsticks (:&lt;br /&gt;Loce the case they come in too (:</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried them in hot weather yet so I hope the lip balm I put in them won&#x27;t leak out.</li>
            <li> The item arrived exactly as described.  I use it as a sample case for my shea scents instead of for eye shadow and it is excellent.  It fits in my purse so I can whip it out anytime for a customer.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, price was right and was as described.  Case was cracked from shipping but not a huge issue. Perfect for what I wanted them for.</li>
            <li> whats to review, they are just plastic boxes.  FUNCTIONAL !!</li>
            <li> Great containers for several uses. Makes small items that can be easily lost very easy to find. Also great for storing different nail art supplies, from glitter to colored powders.</li>
            <li> It took a month for me to get it, since apparently it comes all the way from China, and although it was apparently well wrapped, one of the container came cracked and one of the larger cover tops for all the container. But I do like the size of them and overall, I don&#x27;t regret buying them. I&#x27;ll use them to store the different shades of liquid foundation that I have for when I have to do a make up job.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for depotting jumbo makeup pencils I got mine yesterday and already looking to get more jumbo makeup pencils love this product.</li>
            <li> Awesome little containers. I&#x27;ll use them to store tiny craft items.</li>
            <li> this was a terrible product that i will not purchase again.  first off, it took just about 3 weeks to get here. and i ordered 4 of them, and when i got them, some of them were cracked, and there were these brown spots in some of them that looked disgusting. my major complaint is that MINE DID NOT COME WITH LIDS! i cannot touch them without something spilling or falling out... i would not recomend this product.</li>
            <li> Great for concentrates.</li>
            <li> perfect for samples and mixing eye shadows, very sturdy</li>
            <li> when I got it, it was early witch I love but the case holding the mini containers was cracked.</li>
            <li> The box arrived with a cover, however the 12 small containers within arrived without even one cover. Absolutely useless.</li>
            <li> Good if you like to mix your own colors and carry with you! :) The lid comes off a little easy but, place it in the right pull string bag, your good to go :)</li>
            <li> Wow, Im not sure why I was expecting so much for $2.30.  This container is OKAY.  Nothing great and spectacular but its not bad either.  I ordered three of these containers.  When the package arrived and I opened it all three were packed into the small package together and the two container on either end were scratched and parts a bit broken.  If it had better packaging, I think this could have been aleviated.  Overall I would say it will work for what I need it to work for.  The containers inside the case were untouched and in a pretty good condition.  Also, the picture is a bit deceiving, these containers are very small. they may hold 1/8 teasppoon of acrylic powder, small beads, or small nail jewels.  Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> It was smaller then I thought it would be, but it will work for what I need.  The only thing was they box that they came in was damaged on one of the sides.  Plus the individual containers are cute.</li>
            <li> This is a cute nail art container. Smaller than it looks.But, it will do.</li>
            <li> This containers are amazing I used them to make diy lip balm diy gel liner diy lip jelly and diy lip scrub and diy plumping lip balm</li>
            <li> I bought this to put some loose eye shadows in, which I bought (that were delivered in little ziploc baggies).  It&#x27;s durable enough and will work perfectly for what I need it for.  This is neat little item to have, because you can use it for so many purposes.  You could put earring backs, stud earrings, fingernail jewels and decals, small screws and tons of other small items in this handy little container, so they are not easily lost.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not deep! Not for acrylic storage only good to store certain stones nothing big</li>
            <li> Can finally store my tiny items. Great</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for the kind of storage I needed</li>
            <li> Got these to use for homemade lip gloss and ended up shattering my eyeshadow so that is what filled them! Absolutely wonderful and I love the box they came in. Great for traveling.</li>
            <li> got it was in good shape love it happy to use it and much more of it thank so much</li>
            <li> Perfect containers for lip balm. These pots are the perfect size to showcase your balm and looks very durable. Love them</li>
            <li> Bought this to organize my make up samples. They usually come in little baggies so I thought this would be perfect to display them so I can actually see the colors. Love it.</li>
            <li> I give my makeup touch up kits to my clients using these&lt;br /&gt;I love them! not too big not too small- a great sampler size!</li>
            <li> THESE R GREAT….WOULD HAVE LIKED THEM A LITTLE BIGGER BUT WORK JUST FINE…NICE FOR STORAGE OF UR FUN MIXED COLORS</li>
            <li> The whole case is about 4 1/2 inches wide - you could maybe keep a piece of gym in one of these cylinders.  Whether you are using them for nail stuff or beading stuff, you are not fitting much of anything in here!</li>
            <li> These little boxes are very helpful but they are not recyclable and the plastic container which holds them is not recyclable either.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, however it&#x27;s smaller than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> These little cups came quickly and packaged well&lt;br /&gt;I love them, they are a life saver for packaging touch up makeup kits for clients, or holding things like gems or liquids for crafts&lt;br /&gt;They are sturdy and last after repeated uses&lt;br /&gt;very cool product and excellent seller-came quickly and well packaged</li>
            <li> Got this and the price is great and I was so happy that it was what o was looking for got 12 of this and I will be ordering more</li>
            <li> Good product, nice quality and cheap price... It met my expectations for exactly what I wanted which is very good!</li>
            <li> I am a little disappoited with this boxes. It said that they are 3cm x1,5cm and they are not. They are 2 cm x 1 cm ( they fit 3 MM&#x27;s inside), too small for what I was planning to do with them. But I have to say, there are cute and very well made.</li>
            <li> I just got this today and i love this little jars they are small and i was able to perfectly fit my cute little bows in them. The top lid from the case did came broke but i dont mind i fixed it . So will order again when i need more . Thankz..!</li>
            <li> The item arrived exactly as described.They are perfect size to put lip gloss in.Now, I could carry 12 colors in my purse!!!&lt;br /&gt;Perfect!!</li>
            <li> I had bought some small rhinestones that came in cheap, flimsy baggies that I was afraid would tear too easily. These containers were perfect. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I use these for lipscrubs and I LOVE LOVE LOVE them! Cheapest price for these I&#x27;ve ever seen!</li>
            <li> I used these for my loose powder makeup and they work phenomenal. They came WAY before the estimated date. A+++ Seller</li>
            <li> I make my own beauty products and I was a bit surprised at the size but it is sometimes hard to determine size based on a description or dimensions.  Regardless, they will still be functional as travel/sample size product containers.  Arrived in the storage box as described and intact.  Heavy, durable and clean.  Very happy!</li>
            <li> Most of my nail art accessories come in cheap plastic baggies that can rip super easily. These containers help keep my rhinestones, charms, and beads nice and organized and I don&#x27;t have to worry about them spilling everywhere.</li>
            <li> Just as described. Arrived on time</li>
            <li> Bought these to put lip glosses in. They are nice. perfect size. I don&#x27;t know, I like them a lot. Happy with my purchase.</li>
