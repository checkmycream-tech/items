            <li>The Perfect C Serum, 15 ml]], [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Very very happy!</li>
            <li>You can purchase this product at a great price!</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Its really an incredible product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Four stars because it&#x27;s great, but pricey.</li>
            <li>Another bonus is that the MyChelle line smells great, not perfumey,  but honest-to-goodness yummy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The serums are great for keeping my skin moisturized without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>Great skin care product.</li>
            <li>It works like a toner and my face feels great (not overly drying like a lot of firming serums).  </li>
            <li>The MyChelle website does have a really good sale every now and</li>
            <li>I figured this would be a good thing to try</li>
            <li>and I loved it.  </li>
            <li>I am not so great at talking about the way this works, but LIsa Eldridge can explain it better than I can.</li>
            <li>I feel good knowing that the ingredients in this product, like Superoxide Dismutase (an awesome antioxidant), are the real deal and not marketing hype.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this serum!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>MyChelle does not supply expiration dates (they are supposed to be good for 18 to 24 months from purchase), so I prefer to buy from a reputable source.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve found that Amazon is the best place to buy MyChelle.</li>
            <li>Alright so I&#x27;ve used firming serums 3 times the price of this stuff and WOW this stuff is absolutely amazing!!  </li>
            <li>I love how this doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling on my face.</li>
            <li>Most products claim this and more, but don&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and my skin is smoother, softer, and more plump.</li>
            <li>I love all mychelle products.  </li>
            <li>Love this line of products.</li>
            <li>I discovered this product after it was recommended by my favorite makeup artist.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>My favorite moisturizer for my oily skin</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks much better and softer.</li>
            <li>As in, I noticed I did not have so many of them.</li>
            <li>The difference is noticeable for sure.</li>
            <li>I think I could squeeze one more noticeable in these two lines.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you can just google it.</li>
            <li>This serum works very well and has a pleasant aroma and texture.</li>
            <li>though I&#x27;m now putting more serums and lotions on my face than ever before, my skin is not breaking out which was an unexpected, and welcome, bonus.</li>
            <li>Not every product works for every person, but this product is worth a try for those folks who want a smoother, more radiant complexion, and who doesn&#x27;t?!  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad I can get it for so cheap on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>- MyChelle is also a cruelty free/all natural brand that has a great reputation.</li>
            <li>Great natural product.</li>
            <li>I have lines on my forehead from expressive eyebrows and have had since I was young.</li>
            <li>I have fine lines around my eyes and around my mouth</li>
            <li>Perhaps my crows feet are a bit fainter and some fine lines are gone,</li>
            <li>The product does help with fine lines and makes your face look refreshed.</li>
            <li>This stuff isn&#x27;t cheap</li>
            <li>Great product, delivers real results fast.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite MyChelle facial product because it feels so good going on...</li>
            <li>Loved the texture of the serum as well as how soft my skin feels.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I think this product if very worth the money, as it lasts about 3-4 months.</li>
            <li>Love it and would absolutely recommend!</li>
            <li>Seems Nice to early to tell.</li>
            <li>Beautiful results on my skin with this product and other steps from this line!</li>
            <li>so its obviously a pretty good deal, I paid only $29 here!  </li>
            <li>Definitely be ordering more of this miracle serum!</li>
            <li>It goes on light and absorbs very well.  </li>
            <li>-- like my face is going to crack if I smile.  </li>
            <li>But the results are well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>I put it on my forehead, the lines between my eyebrows, around my laugh lines, and along my jawline.</li>
            <li>I  apply moisturizer (Principal Secret) on top of the serum and my face feels good.</li>
            <li>Then I tried Ole Henricksen&#x27;s Truth Serum/Collagen Booster (as a gift) but felt like it didn&#x27;t really do very much for my skin</li>
            <li>I always make sure to have this stuff on hand especially at this price.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and how it instantly goes to work.</li>
            <li>Since discovering the MyChelle brand, I have been blown away by the fact that every product I&#x27;ve tried has done exactly that.</li>
            <li>Very organic!</li>
            <li>The first time a friend introduced me to it</li>
            <li>Its a lot more at my local Whole Foods</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m starting to notice more fine and deep set lines on my face.</li>
            <li>I have some fine lines around my upper lip</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells like wildflowers, which is nice but the scent tends to linger a little.</li>
            <li>I am 32 and have fine lines on the forehead that are good &amp;#34;indicators&amp;#34; for me as they begin to fade within a week of using Genifique at night and then return when I stop using it (which is lame itself, no product seems to offer a permanent solution).</li>
            <li>but in terms of real, noticeable firming at the jaw line, no, I don&#x27;t see any real difference.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Towards the end, I just shake out as much of the remnants as I can.</li>
            <li>The fact that is it an aeromatherapy product is very soothing as well.</li>
            <li>but it feels like there is absolutely nothing sitting on my skin.</li>
            <li>After only 4 days of using this amazing product, my skin is noticeably smooth, soft and tight.</li>
            <li>I do some preventative things, but my main concern is dealing with my oily, problem skin.</li>
            <li>Many products have ingredients (like preservatives) that actually age your skin and then add moisturizers to just make it look younger.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Finding a good moisturizer is tough for me.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Firms and tones facial contours while deep hydration smooths, plumps and retexturizes the skin.&amp;#34; Its rare to find a product that does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Either way, I was amazed because the first time I used this serum I could actually feel my skin firming up!</li>
            <li>and wow!</li>
            <li>The calibrated pump doesn&#x27;t always dispense a full application and it stops working before the bottle is empty.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t spend this much on a single skin care product, but boy am I glad I did!</li>
            <li>MyChelle Dermaceuticals is a cruelty free company, committed to being green, and makes natural products.</li>
            <li>not that old.  </li>
            <li>and while it does moisturize and leave my skin feeling silky soft, it does not fade my indicator lines.</li>
            <li>No heavy perfumes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know too many women who don&#x27;t wear at least powder foundation?</li>
            <li>Alas, while this feel similarly light and disappears into the skin right after application, it does not seem to offer any anti-wrinkle benefits.</li>
            <li>With daily use (2 pumps), I noticed after one bottle, that my jawline was firmer, and my fine lines were less noticeable.</li>
            <li>It has not filled in my deep set lines (on my second bottle), but is softening them more than before.</li>
            <li>It takes a few minutes to get the full effect</li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re looking for a quick and drastic fix to firm your skin</li>
            <li>(I do not smoke so they are natural, regular lines)</li>
            <li>Their prices are consistently lower than average.</li>
            <li>This serum is very drying and irritating for my combo skin, probably because it&#x27;s full of alcohol.</li>
            <li>Try this product alone first, then add other products if necessary.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was so impressed by this product that I&#x27;ve gone on to try other products from this brand and have yet to be disappointed.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a product that had hyaluronic acid - which occurs naturally in the skin but diminishes, along with collagen, around 1% a year after age 21 - but kept finding things that had controversial ingredients (argireline, for example) or a useless collagen component (the collagen molecule is too big to pass through the skin; it must be taken orally).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t worry about absorbing excess parabens and other problematic ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Some reviews mentioned a possible rash, which did happen to me when I was using certain other products with it.  </li>
            <li>I have dry sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>If I have a long night or notice my skin is extra dry, I pop this on and it revitalizes my skin in just a few minutes and comfortably hydrates my skin all day.</li>

            <li> I was looking for a product that had hyaluronic acid - which occurs naturally in the skin but diminishes, along with collagen, around 1% a year after age 21 - but kept finding things that had controversial ingredients (argireline, for example) or a useless collagen component (the collagen molecule is too big to pass through the skin; it must be taken orally).</li>

            <li> I used daily as recommended, finally talked with company, and they suggested a different product, so I returned it and tried the other.</li>
            <li> /&gt;About me: I am a 48-year old grandmother of three and in the past three months, since I began using the MyChelle line, I&#x27;ve been carded twice and have received numerous compliments about my \\&quot;glowing\\&quot; complexion.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say what the long term results will be.  </li>
            <li> It dispenses well, and doesn&#x27;t dry up if not used for a long time.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Does not work on my skin will send back if I can &amp; credit me.</li>
            <li> Alright so I&#x27;ve used firming serums 3 times the price of this stuff and WOW this stuff is absolutely amazing!!  I have fine lines around my eyes and around my mouth and I notice a difference and I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few months now. Its a lot more at my local Whole Foods so I&#x27;m glad I can get it for so cheap on Amazon.  It&#x27;s $60 there so its obviously a pretty good deal, I paid only $29 here!  I always make sure to have this stuff on hand especially at this price.</li>
            <li> I love how this doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling on my face. It pulls the skin tighter, making it firmer. I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks now, twice a day, and I only see a faint difference for the sagging, and I am only 54 so...not that old.  Perhaps my crows feet are a bit fainter and some fine lines are gone, but in terms of real, noticeable firming at the jaw line, no, I don&#x27;t see any real difference.  I have some fine lines around my upper lip (I do not smoke so they are natural, regular lines) and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s doing anything at all with those.  I&#x27;ve even rubbed in an entire drop every night.    I also do not like the way it makes my skin feel tight and dry after it dries -- like my face is going to crack if I smile.  Perhaps if I combined it with the other MyChelle products it might matter but they are so expensive, at this point I don&#x27;t know if it is worth the investment.  I  apply moisturizer (Principal Secret) on top of the serum and my face feels good.</li>
            <li> Beautiful results on my skin with this product and other steps from this line!</li>
            <li> Seems Nice to early to tell. Thanks</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to replace my very expensive Genifique serum from Lancome. Alas, while this feel similarly light and disappears into the skin right after application, it does not seem to offer any anti-wrinkle benefits. I am 32 and have fine lines on the forehead that are good &amp;#34;indicators&amp;#34; for me as they begin to fade within a week of using Genifique at night and then return when I stop using it (which is lame itself, no product seems to offer a permanent solution). The MyChelle I&#x27;ve used for well over a month, once to twice a day, and while it does moisturize and leave my skin feeling silky soft, it does not fade my indicator lines. Now I mostly put it on my neck as I hate the feeling of anything else on my neck, even the lightest lotion or cream feels too heavy except for this. So I&#x27;m still going to use it up but I doubt I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Not every product works for every person, but this product is worth a try for those folks who want a smoother, more radiant complexion, and who doesn&#x27;t?!  At the risk of sounding like an infomercial, Mychelle Firming Serum, Serious Hyaluronic has helped to make my facial skin look and feel smoother.  I only use it in the morning, using other Mychelle and DHC products in the evening.  It provides a great base for my mineral powder make-up.  And I&#x27;ve received compliments on my skin since using it.  It can be layered with other products.  I don&#x27;t believe in using a sole product all the time.  Seems to me that our skin can become accustomed to products decreasing the effectiveness over time.  Thus, I do take a break from my routine on occasion.  But in truth, I don&#x27;t like not using this product every morning.  Some reviews mentioned a possible rash, which did happen to me when I was using certain other products with it.  After the process of elimination, I discovered the culprit, thankfully not this product, and eliminated the problem.  However, I do use this product with others, just be wary of certain combinations that will together aggravate the skin, such as exfoliating type products.  We tend to be overly harsh with our skin in the name of youth.  Try this product alone first, then add other products if necessary.  Four stars because it&#x27;s great, but pricey.</li>
            <li> I have used this before. It was too expensive at the retail store and the price was better here. The product does help with fine lines and makes your face look refreshed. Most products claim this and more, but don&#x27;t do anything. It does not &amp;#34;erase&amp;#34; deep lines or make you 20 years younger. It dispenses well, and doesn&#x27;t dry up if not used for a long time.</li>
            <li> Great product, delivers real results fast.  It takes a few minutes to get the full effect but I watched my skin tighten A LOT within a few minutes and it lasted until I washed my make-up off.  I just started using it so I can&#x27;t say what the long term results will be.  However, if you&#x27;re looking for a quick and drastic fix to firm your skin this is it.  A small price for a product that works.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It goes on light and absorbs very well.  The fragrance reminds me of summertime...wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
            <li> I use the Serious Hyaluronic Firming Serum along with other MyChelle skincare products. This is my favorite MyChelle facial product because it feels so good going on... My skin just loves it. (I wish I could take a bath in this stuff!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I&#x27;m now putting more serums and lotions on my face than ever before, my skin is not breaking out which was an unexpected, and welcome, bonus. Another bonus is that the MyChelle line smells great, not perfumey,  but honest-to-goodness yummy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative, in my opinion, is the packaging. The calibrated pump doesn&#x27;t always dispense a full application and it stops working before the bottle is empty. I&#x27;ve taken to undoing and replacing the cap which seems to help as the bottle gets low. Towards the end, I just shake out as much of the remnants as I can. This stuff isn&#x27;t cheap so I try to get every last bit of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best deals: So far, I&#x27;ve found that Amazon is the best place to buy MyChelle. Their prices are consistently lower than average. You can also get deals on eBay, but you have to work (snipe) for them. MyChelle does not supply expiration dates (they are supposed to be good for 18 to 24 months from purchase), so I prefer to buy from a reputable source. The MyChelle website does have a really good sale every now and then so, if you like her products, you may want to get on the email list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About me: I am a 48-year old grandmother of three and in the past three months, since I began using the MyChelle line, I&#x27;ve been carded twice and have received numerous compliments about my \\&quot;glowing\\&quot; complexion. I followed the suggestions on the MyChelle website and I&#x27;m using the [[ASIN:B000MAPFRG Mychelle Honeydew Cleanser, 4.4 Fl oz (130 ml) (Pack of 2)]], [[ASIN:B000MAOWP2 Mychelle The Perfect C Serum, 15 ml]], [[ASIN:B000MAQW9Q Mychelle Supreme Polypeptide Cream, With Matrixyl 3000 And Marine Polypeptides, Unscented, 1.2 Fl oz]], [[ASIN:B000MAOWO8 Mychelle Deep Repair Cream, 1.2 Fl oz]] (AM), [[ASIN:B000MANVPE Mychelle Night Cream, Revitalizing, 30 ml]] (PM) and [[ASIN:B000MASTM4 Mychelle Fruit Enzyme Mist, 4.4 Fl oz (130 ml)]].

            <li> I was looking for a product that had hyaluronic acid - which occurs naturally in the skin but diminishes, along with collagen, around 1% a year after age 21 - but kept finding things that had controversial ingredients (argireline, for example) or a useless collagen component (the collagen molecule is too big to pass through the skin; it must be taken orally). I looked at the bottom of the Amazon screen and saw Mychelle Firming Serum, Serious Hyaluronic as a suggestion and clicked on it. Fast-forward to today and my skin is smoother, softer, and more plump. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 2 weeks but noticed the softness the very next morning. I feel good knowing that the ingredients in this product, like Superoxide Dismutase (an awesome antioxidant), are the real deal and not marketing hype. I will be purchasing this product for as long as they make it! Very very happy!</li>
            <li> I love all mychelle products.  I have dry sensitive skin.  The serums are great for keeping my skin moisturized without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Miracle worker! This product makes my skin feel so plump and soothed! The fact that is it an aeromatherapy product is very soothing as well. I love the smell and how it instantly goes to work. I use this product every morning before i put my makeup on for work. It&#x27;s kind of like a cold splash of water in your face feeling! Love it and would absolutely recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this serum! I don&#x27;t usually use serums because I have acne prone skin and serums usually are oily and break me out. This serum is not oily and does NOT break me out! I put this on after getting out of the shower and it sinks into my skin and firms up my face. I put this on mixed with my SPF face lotion in the morning. It mixes well with my other moisterizers as well. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the second product from Mychelle that I&#x27;ve tried that irritated my skin. Their moisturizers make me break out, but I do like their masks. This serum is very drying and irritating for my combo skin, probably because it&#x27;s full of alcohol.</li>
            <li> I used daily as recommended, finally talked with company, and they suggested a different product, so I returned it and tried the other.</li>
            <li> Great skin care product. Love this line of products.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Firms and tones facial contours while deep hydration smooths, plumps and retexturizes the skin.&amp;#34; Its rare to find a product that does exactly what it claims to do. Since discovering the MyChelle brand, I have been blown away by the fact that every product I&#x27;ve tried has done exactly that. The Firming Serum is one of my faves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my late 20s, so I&#x27;m not really concerned with anti-aging just yet. I do some preventative things, but my main concern is dealing with my oily, problem skin. Finding a good moisturizer is tough for me. I heard all the glowing claims about Hyaluronic acid and I figured I would try it out. I discovered this product after it was recommended by my favorite makeup artist. I can get puffy at certain times throughout the year and tend to have problems with puffy eyes if I don&#x27;t sleep well or sleep in a weird position. I figured this would be a good thing to try - MyChelle is also a cruelty free/all natural brand that has a great reputation. Plus, I believe their products are made in the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, I was amazed because the first time I used this serum I could actually feel my skin firming up! After about 5 minutes I could visually see a difference in the tightness and texture of my skin. It hydrates extremely well but it feels like there is absolutely nothing sitting on my skin. If I have a long night or notice my skin is extra dry, I pop this on and it revitalizes my skin in just a few minutes and comfortably hydrates my skin all day. A little goes a long way - you only need two pumps to see the benefits. Its really an incredible product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like wildflowers, which is nice but the scent tends to linger a little. I find this a tad annoying because I usually hate fragrance in any product, but the scent doesn&#x27;t smell artificial at all and after a few hours its usually gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so impressed by this product that I&#x27;ve gone on to try other products from this brand and have yet to be disappointed. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This serum has anti aging ingredients that would cost you more with expensive companies! It&#x27;s a lightweight serum that benefits the skin. No heavy perfumes. Very organic! I have been using this product for years. You can purchase this product at a great price! I recommend MyChelle Firming Serum...</li>
            <li> Love this. Great natural product.</li>
            <li> My favorite moisturizer for my oily skin</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It works like a toner and my face feels great (not overly drying like a lot of firming serums).  When I put my moisturizer on after the serum the layering of product doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.    I don&#x27;t worry about absorbing excess parabens and other problematic ingredients.  Many products have ingredients (like preservatives) that actually age your skin and then add moisturizers to just make it look younger.  This product doesn&#x27;t age your skin, so it takes a few extra weeks to for you to see results.  But the results are well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t spend this much on a single skin care product, but boy am I glad I did! After only 4 days of using this amazing product, my skin is noticeably smooth, soft and tight. I&#x27;m looking forward to the results to come. Definitely be ordering more of this miracle serum!</li>
            <li> I saw on Lisa Eldridge&#x27;s blog that she recommended this product. I thought to give it a try and wow! I put it on in the morning and after I few minutes you can actually see the difference. My skin looks much better and softer. Great product!</li>
            <li> I thought this would be the non-surgical answer to botox. I was wrong. it also peels off in little crumbs if you touch your face or want to apply make-up over it. I don&#x27;t know too many women who don&#x27;t wear at least powder foundation? I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> It made my skin dry. In addition, my skin broke out in red scaly patches. I am not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This item is beyond sell date and is very bad.  I have used this for years.  I am returning it.</li>
            <li> I was turned onto this product by makeup artist Lisa Eldridge from her YouTube videos. I have dry/combination skin that is acne prone and I&#x27;m starting to notice more fine and deep set lines on my face. This serum works very well and has a pleasant aroma and texture. I put it on my forehead, the lines between my eyebrows, around my laugh lines, and along my jawline. With daily use (2 pumps), I noticed after one bottle, that my jawline was firmer, and my fine lines were less noticeable. As in, I noticed I did not have so many of them. The difference is noticeable for sure. I think I could squeeze one more noticeable in these two lines. Anyway, I think this product if very worth the money, as it lasts about 3-4 months. I have it on Subscribe and Save, so I never forget to buy it.    MyChelle Dermaceuticals is a cruelty free company, committed to being green, and makes natural products. I mean, if you care about any of that stuff.    Please note that this is not a filler. It has not filled in my deep set lines (on my second bottle), but is softening them more than before. I have lines on my forehead from expressive eyebrows and have had since I was young. They are getting to be less obvious with this serum. I am not so great at talking about the way this works, but LIsa Eldridge can explain it better than I can. Actually, the MyChelle website probably has a video. I&#x27;m sure you can just google it.</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering this serum. The first time a friend introduced me to it and I loved it.  Then I tried Ole Henricksen&#x27;s Truth Serum/Collagen Booster (as a gift) but felt like it didn&#x27;t really do very much for my skin AND it was more expensive.  Loved the texture of the serum as well as how soft my skin feels.  You can feel your skin tighten as the serum dries on your skin!</li>
