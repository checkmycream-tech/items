            <li>This is a good foot cream.</li>
            <li>and I found that its also good for your hands.</li>
            <li>I have used a number of foot creams over the years -- this is superior.</li>
            <li>and it worked good but then found this food cream bu</li>
            <li>I had just as good results with Curel</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>This is a good product.  </li>
            <li>However, it does a good job when you do use it.</li>
            <li>My feet have never looked so good.</li>
            <li>My mom loved using this on her feet.  </li>
            <li>so I was delighted to find it on Amazon under Prime.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve used many and this has superior strength, and a great creamy feel.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s great to have smooth skin again.  </li>
            <li>Amazing stuff.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m already thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a&lt;br /&gt;really good product i will use for many years.</li>
            <li>I liked this foot cream -</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t effective for me.</li>
            <li>It has a really nice non greasy, creamy feel.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love!!</li>
            <li>Still, works to smooth out feet over time, and my callus peels (using an alkaline callus remover), were VERY effective.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s one of the best I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best product I have ever found</li>
            <li>Have tried many foot creams and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>I have used so many foot creams and this is by the far the best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I always see a difference quickly with this cream, and now they have improved the smell so all is good with this now.</li>
            <li>I love this foot cream and wish I had bought it sooner.</li>
            <li>Okay, my son was born with a peeling toe.</li>
            <li>Top Docs at Children&#x27;s Dermatology dept recommended AmLactin after looking at smears of his toe skin under a microscope and determining it was not a fungus or yeast.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I read reviews about this cream that said it was much better than anything else, including the lotion.  </li>
            <li>Cannot find in any retail stores so grateful to be able to order it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The AmLactin Foot Cream worked much better.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products with promises of healing cracked heels to no avail.  </li>
            <li>The result is almost magical.  </li>
            <li>Calluses that I&#x27;ve had for years began to disappear, like magic.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Actually, I am quite pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never seen a scented Amlactin, but would love to try one.</li>
            <li>and it sure seems to work well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>There is also a skin lotion she said I could use instead if I could not find it, but this is thicker and better for  your feet.</li>
            <li>Be sure to get the FOOT CREAM, not the lotion.  </li>
            <li>AFter 2 weeks of using it faithfully every evening, then putting cotton socks on over it, my feet are 200% better.  </li>
            <li>Better than Rx from dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>am going to buy more for myself to stock up&lt;br</li>
            <li>healthy feet works a thousand times better.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it, so buy some today.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think it is any better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried...</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>My feet are in better shape than with the prescription ammonium lactate products or urea products my GP and dermatologist have prescribed.  </li>
            <li>Makes the feet feel nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff for my feet.  </li>
            <li>Just ordered five more tubes.</li>
            <li>I truly haven&#x27;t found anything that works better than AmLactin Therapy does, and Preferred Mart was timely and reliable with their delevery of the product.</li>
            <li>and it absorbed better and has a good smell</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>
            <li>It works better than the Stridex routine, and soaks in and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on the sheets when I skip wearing socks.</li>
            <li>The price and delivery were outstanding.</li>
            <li>I have yet to find a better foot or skin cream.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This is the best foot cream I have ever used to keep my feet smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>it :-)</li>
            <li>I got better results using it twice a day.</li>
            <li>I will Purchase More.</li>
            <li>I really love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I just wished it worked better on preventing the built up of calluses.</li>
            <li>I love the crab but the tube was punctured when I got it.</li>
            <li>WORTH EVERY PENNY!!</li>
            <li>This is excellent for relieving dry skin on feet.</li>
            <li>Awesome for dry skin and not just feet.  </li>
            <li>Best cream for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Best cream for dry heels</li>
            <li>After using it twice daily for a week, my heels look so good, like they appear after a good pedicure.</li>
            <li>I have tried many foot creams to deal with my rough heels, and this one is the best of them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of different foot creams and this one has worked the best at keeping my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>Best product for rough feet.  </li>
            <li>This is the best foot cream I have ever used, I&#x27;ve had rough heels and  cracked skin for 20 years.</li>
            <li>It is not terribly harsh and I was happy to spread any remaining lotion on my hands</li>
            <li>My daughter told me how much she loved this product.</li>
            <li>It has been very effective in healing the crack completely</li>
            <li>it goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t have an odor to it</li>
            <li>Otherwise everything was fine.</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and seems to soak in fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>Getting ready to order more!</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t been able to find this exact product for over 2 years and his feet has taken a beating but as soon as this arrived his feet were almost cleared up within 4 days!  </li>
            <li>Best over the counter foot product out on the market, hands down!</li>
            <li>It has helped smooth the skin.</li>
            <li>Being pre-diabetic, it is important that I care for my feet.  </li>
            <li>Great lotion for feet, especially heels and around toes.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>the cheap stuff you can buy at the grocery store.</li>
            <li>It keeps my feet smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>it is scent free but has a horrid smell that lingers on my hands after applying.</li>
            <li>My heels have not been so smooth since I was a kid.</li>
            <li>Repairs cracked heels, leaving them smooth so they don&#x27;t fray over the sheets at night.</li>
            <li>I tried this foot lotion because it got such great reviews.</li>
            <li>You have to use it 2x&#x27;s a day to see results and at the 2 week mark your feet are callus free.</li>
            <li>Seems good so far.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Be aware!!</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended AmLactin Foot Cream Therapy for treating my cracked skin at the back of my heel, as nothing else was very effective.  </li>
            <li>was excited to get.</li>
            <li>The cream is rich but not too greasy.  </li>
            <li>This goes on easy, I put this on first, then heavy cream, and put socks on, a great overnight moisturizing treatment for the feet!!!</li>
            <li>I knew the Amlactin cream was great for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>So after showers and as I said at bedtime, especially, use this and put some light weight bedtime socks and good to go.</li>
            <li>I had nearly fresh heels and the next time they looked great.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at how effective this was.</li>
            <li>soft, nails look better too!</li>
            <li>THOSE REVIEWS WERE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!  </li>
            <li>This was recommended by my dermatologist, and I must say she was right!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I&#x27;m good to go with daily use and am once again shaking hands with confidence.</li>
            <li>My feet is nice and soft after using it.</li>
            <li>has really helped my feet look so much better.  </li>
            <li>Cannot say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>However, a friend of mine suggested that AmLactin cream might be even more effective at treating the dry skin on my feet</li>
            <li>is a super</li>
            <li>This is, by far, the best product that I&#x27;ve used on my rough feet in the winter.  </li>
            <li>This product quickly heals any cracks I have on the bottom of my heels.  </li>
            <li>No sticky residue, seems to absorb quickly.</li>
            <li>It could use just a hint of fragrance in my opinion, as it has a unique smell but better for sensitive skins this way I suppose.</li>
            <li>This foot cream is creamy and is absorbed quickly.  </li>
            <li>and works fast!!</li>
            <li>and my feet will be ready!!</li>
            <li>Excellent product for extra dry feet.</li>
            <li>but there is something about this cream that is worth</li>
            <li>so I figured it was worth</li>
            <li>It is worth the cost.</li>
            <li>This product was recommended and have found it works as described and well worth the recommendation.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than no lotion, but not any different than using a cheap lotion.  </li>
            <li>This product is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>This product is worth every Dollar.</li>
            <li>I love this cream and it did really work on my very cracked heels.</li>
            <li>but if it works it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products that really didn&#x27;t do anything more than just a regular lotion would do.</li>
            <li>The product came as expected and in good time.  </li>
            <li>This is first time for the foot cream, but quickly saw results in the softness of my feet.</li>
            <li>Not greasy, it soaks right in.</li>
            <li>I have been plagued by dry skin on the heels of my feet for quite some while now; and I recently tried Eucerin Moisturizing Cream in a plastic tub with very good results.</li>
            <li>You use very little, and get great results.</li>
            <li>Reminiscent of Elmer&#x27;s Glue, the smell isn&#x27;t my favorite, but does dissipate quickly.  </li>
            <li>Unscented and more affective than a general moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Should be used everynight to really work to full capacity.</li>
            <li>Tried other brands (Flexitol, Eucerin), but this worked the best for me for really dry and cracked heels.</li>
            <li>I am diabetic and this brand is what my dermatologist recommended I&#x27;ve use this for many years, makes your feet feel soft and very well protected</li>
            <li>I normally put it on at night before bed, let it dry for a minute or two, then I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li>This substance is very effective as stated above, used daily on the toes...  </li>
            <li>This cream makes me feet soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure if this version was really necessary.  </li>
            <li>This product does exactly as advertised...</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t been able to get back into the dermatologist.</li>
            <li>It is not sticky and you don&#x27;t need to wear socks to bed, which makes my feet too hot.  </li>
            <li>and I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Bumpy skin has turned smooth nearly overnight.</li>
            <li>Tried many products and not wearing sandals but still suffer from the same issue in the winterso footwear was not my issue.</li>
            <li>This really does work!</li>
            <li>pretty pricey for the amount</li>
            <li>This has both moisturizer and lactic acid which gently solve the problem!  </li>
            <li>The cream works exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>something that actually fosters healthy skin.</li>
            <li>but the purple pumice thing really rocks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also starting using their body lotion and love that as well.</li>
            <li>and my feet felt better the next morning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an avid gardener</li>
            <li>I just have to use it consistently.</li>
            <li>This, along with trying to take better care of my bare feet in general, has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>I have been using Miracle Foot cream and really can&#x27;t notice any difference, enough to justify the greater cost.</li>
            <li>Have been using it for my dry hands for a long time and works great.  </li>
            <li>It smells a little funny but its amazing stuff</li>
            <li>OK my feet are dry and scratchy in winter.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also glad to report that my recent shipments have been the new fragrance-free formula.</li>
            <li>It works great on dry, cracked, rough and calloused feet.</li>
            <li>The product inside was fine but the outside was so grimy I would not have even picked it up.  </li>
            <li>Feet getting callus free and much softer....... they won&#x27;t want to walk barefoot next summer though.</li>
            <li>Love this foot cream..really softens the rough spots on your foot and is very non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>Really recommend it.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how well and fast it worked.  </li>
            <li>The Foot Cream is thicker than the Body Lotion and doesn&#x27;t seem to \\&quot;disappear\\&quot; as fast.</li>
            <li>While it seems to work about as fast as Eucerin, AmLactin is not quite so greasy</li>
            <li>Like Eucerin, AmLactin does not have any real scent to it</li>
            <li>and I really tried</li>
            <li>I have tried all the touted remedies, including creams and lotions and even udder balm, but until AmLactin Foot Cream Therapy, nothing seemed to make much of a difference.</li>
            <li>the kicker is this stuff really does works.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>and I really need this product</li>
            <li>I have tried at least a dozen different foot lotions and this is by far the best I have used.</li>
            <li>AmLactin Foot Cream Therapy works very well</li>
            <li>thanks,  ronnie</li>
            <li>When I finally tried it I forgot an important step and didn&#x27;t get the results she got.</li>
            <li>I also use same method to get smooth legs.</li>
            <li>totally worth the money if you want soft feet.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t need much of it.  </li>
            <li>Recommended by my very fussy sister, I couldn&#x27;t resist.</li>
            <li>Was hoping that this would smooth them out when added to my regular pedicures.</li>
            <li>but I really can&#x27;t stand the way it smells.  </li>
            <li>This product is the real heal deal.  </li>
            <li>However, it does not seem to be available at local stores any longer.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>but this stuff really softens them.  </li>
            <li>This product had been recommended by a podiatrist and it has really softened my feet as promised.</li>
            <li>it came rushing out, very watery</li>
            <li>but i waited 2 days and it is still very watery and kinda greasy.</li>
            <li>I really like this foot cream.</li>
            <li>AmLactin products really do what the manufacturer says they will.</li>
            <li>but it really watery.</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement.</li>
            <li>hasnt changed much for me yet...</li>
            <li>This foot cream actually helps keep your skin smooth.</li>
            <li>It really does work, my feet&lt;</li>
            <li>I immediately ordered the product and it was delivered very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My feet are much softer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered from two of Amazon&#x27;s vendors thus far, and both products received have been the older scented (mildly) version.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE, five months later... my hands are now almost completely healthy and as soft as a guy can stand.</li>
            <li>The cream is thick and feels really good going on.</li>
            <li>I have soft feet and hands now!!!</li>
            <li>great product, doesnt yellow your skin like vaseline, no strong perfumey odor either.</li>
            <li>Another reviewer writes that \\&quot;a pea size for each foot is plenty;\\&quot; and they are definitely right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, while Eucerin moisturizing cream is a very good product, even for dry skin on feet, this is the product of choice for treating dry skin on feet.</li>
            <li>After only 2 uses, I noticed a significant difference in my feet.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a great value because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>More costly than other moisturizers?</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works very well on keeping your feet in condition, and is particularly helpful for those with diabetes.  </li>
            <li>This cream is amazing, it healed my cracked heels in just a few days!  </li>
            <li>If I had been at a store making this purchase I would not have brought this particular tube home.</li>
            <li>The cream feels somewhat \\&quot;oily\\&quot; when first applied, but it doesn&#x27;t take long before it is absorbed.  </li>
            <li>Have to use it more regularly than I do currently.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s economical and small enough to carry around with you; and unlike Eucerin a very tiny bit each day does a very effective job.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone with cracked heels.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist highly recommended it to me.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I am beyond satisfied, have sent this to my mother who has the same problem of cracked, dry heels because the cream has done so much to improve my feet.  </li>
            <li>worked really well on super dry calloused skin.</li>
            <li>The 3 ounce tube may seem small but it doesn&#x27;t take much for it to work it&#x27;s magic</li>
            <li>This product made my feet look normal.</li>
            <li>Regular use keeps my feet pretty and ready for sandals.</li>
            <li>Nice and thick, softens and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>it was nice and thick, not greasy.  </li>
            <li>With one application you see improvement, and with regular use you have smooth feet with no dry cuticles or callous areas.</li>
            <li>I now use it on my feet and was totally surprised had how smooth my feet have become, both the heels and dry skin around toe nails.  </li>
            <li>I have tried lots of foot products and this is one that is nice, but does not really help with dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Expensive for the amount you get, but very effective.</li>
            <li>There is no more cracking, rough skin, peeling skin- just smooth, healthy appearing.</li>
            <li>I fell into the foot cream on a trip to NY and cannot live without this product.</li>
            <li>I live in Arizona</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find it where i live</li>
            <li>Where I live is super dry...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different creams for my feet, that never really did what they said they would do.  </li>
            <li>and I was very surprised how well it worked.  </li>
            <li>i was so excited to find such a highly-rated product to FINALLY cure my cracked heels.</li>
            <li>Next time will likely just opt for the non foot version like last time that was a lot more bang for the buck.</li>
            <li>I used to stick to the carpet like Velcro, but now I&#x27;m soft and smoooooothe!</li>
            <li>I apply at bedtime and awake with soft feet!</li>
            <li>I noticed a big difference the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>We have used this product for about 6 months, having bought it locally the first time.  </li>
            <li>It is not greasy, no scent, and makes my feet soooo soft!</li>
            <li>Especially if you use it consistently.  </li>
            <li>This is the first over the counter product that has actually helped my dishydrosis.</li>
            <li>Used this product on several occasions and don&#x27;t know if it is much better than any other foot cream with alpha-hydroxy in it.</li>
            <li>Must be used pretty regularly.</li>
            <li>After a 20 minute soak and then a pumice stone, my feet are so soft!  </li>
            <li>It softens them to the point where I can take a buff stone and smooth them down.</li>
            <li>Worked OK of the rest of my foot areas but not worth spending the extra money for use on the callouses.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s application is such that just the smallest amount spreads to a surprisingly large area...</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this based on the other reviews &amp; I had hoped this was going to help w/my dry &amp; cracking heels</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much thicker than the other two and did a fantastic job clearing up my dry cracking heal.</li>
            <li>They might not win a beauty contest, but the difference is amazing.  </li>
            <li>quote my four year old \\&quot;Mommy, my toe is not peeling any more!\\</li>
            <li>so much I ordered 2 with my initial order but am going to \\&quot;stock</li>
            <li>This is the &amp;#34;gold standard&amp;#34; for foot creams, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t need to use much to get the same effect.</li>
            <li>a tiny bit at a time is all you&#x27;ll ever really need.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to learn from another reviewer that her</li>
            <li>Podiatrist suggested to have it work better, to put it on my feet and not walk on them or put any socks on for at least 15 minutes so it would not be rubbed off my feet anyway</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at the improvement to the heals of my feet.</li>
            <li>are so soft and hydrated</li>
            <li>/&gt;so soft</li>
            <li>I am completely sold on this.</li>
            <li>My daughter told me how she got soft heels after her shower in just one application.</li>
            <li>I now use it once a day to maintain my soft feet.  </li>
            <li>my feet are soft.</li>
            <li>After putting it on before bed, I have to wash my hands so that the odor of the cream won&#x27;t be anywhere near my face.  </li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, this product is what stands between me and soft feet.</li>
            <li>I would much rather lotion up then have to scrub my feet with a stone daily.</li>
            <li>Helps keep heels soft.  </li>
            <li>My feet have never been so soft or looked</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any perfume, it is a thick cream that goes on nicely, not overly greasy, just a great cream that really does the job.</li>
            <li>Good, though expensive.  </li>
            <li>No foot probs here, but this cream has been the first product ever to heal my dry peeling hands.</li>
            <li>It is not always easy to find locally (I usually have to ask for it at the pharmacy counter in Wal-Mart)</li>
            <li>Use a paper towel to clean knife edge as you remove dead skin.</li>
            <li>i give it 3 stars because it was a decent enough lotion, but not for the price and not for all the hype.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the lotion for a few weeks, and it hasn&#x27;t done anything special.</li>
            <li>This lotion really helps exfoliate the slouchy dry skin off and leaves my hands feeling soft.</li>
            <li>After a few days your dry skin will look noticeably better.</li>
            <li>I have a cabinet full of foot cream products that say they will solve my rough, dry, gross feet, but this one really works.</li>
            <li>I use this stuff on my feet, but also on my &amp;#34;barnacles.&amp;#34;  I have Seborheic Keratosis, sometimes called the &amp;#34;barnacles of old age.&amp;#34; The dermotologist won&#x27;t burn them off as they are benign, but this product flattens them so they are not so apparent.</li>
            <li>It makes areas of the foot soft that are not rough or calloused.</li>
            <li>and I actually have almost normal feet.</li>
            <li>Yummy, rich cream for dry feet plus alpha hydroxy to keep the rough areas under control.  </li>
            <li>After several years, it became watery and so she asked me to buy a new bottle.  </li>
            <li>I use a foot file daily and have tried Kerasal, Gold Bond, Dr. Schols and every new cream</li>
            <li>only wish I could find the new fragrance-free version described and pictured here.</li>
            <li>but it I finally have heels I can live with and not be embarrased.</li>
            <li>I actually have soft feet!</li>
            <li>It is hard to find in stores but always available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Very highly recommend this to anyone with medium calloused, rough feet..</li>
            <li>A slightly acrid smell, due to lactic acid, is maybe the only thing I don&#x27;t love.</li>
            <li>The product works great on feet and doesn&#x27;t have any type of bad smell or anything of that sort.</li>
            <li>In general I wear alot of flip flops and so roughness is attained on the feet</li>
            <li>The same in stores near my home.</li>
            <li>Really softens rough spots on feet.</li>
            <li>This foot cream works really well in removing any calluses off heels or any other part of your foot.  </li>
            <li>My new Podiatrist suggested I use this for my extremely dry feet.  </li>
            <li>It only took a few days to smooth out my mangled dry cracked feet.</li>
            <li>I saw improvement in a few days and my heels are smooth and I can take socks off now without them pulling and sticking like velcro on my rough heels.</li>
            <li>I have been unable to find this product locally and was thrilled when I found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Cost is the main thing that tempts me to try out cheaper creams now and then, but I&#x27;ve found nothing else that even remotely compares to the effectiveness of AmLactin.  </li>
            <li>and I do not see much difference for the other products I use that are similar</li>
            <li>It really helps to soften your heals and other areas of your feet that need extra care.</li>
            <li>I have not used it long, but so far it isbgreat.</li>
            <li>When my feet are severely dry and cracked it can take a week or two for the dryness to disappear completely.  </li>
            <li>super thick, industrial strength version of the regular watery amlactin lotion.</li>
            <li>very dry, and now they become soft.</li>
            <li>I have no reason to recommend this product other than to let others know there is  a product out there that will really help those dry, cracked heels.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have used a number of foot creams over the years -- this is superior.</li>

            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  </li>

            <li> it&#x27;s a&lt;br /&gt;really good product i will use for many years.</li>
            <li> I liked this foot cream -</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t effective for me.</li>
            <li> It has a really nice non greasy, creamy feel.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love!!</li>
            <li> Still, works to smooth out feet over time, and my callus peels (using an alkaline callus remover), were VERY effective.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s one of the best I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product I have ever found</li>
            <li> Have tried many foot creams and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> I have used so many foot creams and this is by the far the best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I always see a difference quickly with this cream, and now they have improved the smell so all is good with this now.</li>
            <li> I love this foot cream and wish I had bought it sooner.</li>
            <li> Okay, my son was born with a peeling toe.</li>
            <li> Top Docs at Children&#x27;s Dermatology dept recommended AmLactin after looking at smears of his toe skin under a microscope and determining it was not a fungus or yeast.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read reviews about this cream that said it was much better than anything else, including the lotion.  </li>
            <li> Cannot find in any retail stores so grateful to be able to order it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The AmLactin Foot Cream worked much better.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products with promises of healing cracked heels to no avail.  </li>
            <li> The result is almost magical.  </li>
            <li> Calluses that I&#x27;ve had for years began to disappear, like magic.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Actually, I am quite pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen a scented Amlactin, but would love to try one.</li>
            <li> and it sure seems to work well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There is also a skin lotion she said I could use instead if I could not find it, but this is thicker and better for  your feet.</li>
            <li> Be sure to get the FOOT CREAM, not the lotion.  </li>
            <li> AFter 2 weeks of using it faithfully every evening, then putting cotton socks on over it, my feet are 200% better.  </li>
            <li> Better than Rx from dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> am going to buy more for myself to stock up&lt;br</li>
            <li> healthy feet works a thousand times better.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it, so buy some today.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think it is any better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried...</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> My feet are in better shape than with the prescription ammonium lactate products or urea products my GP and dermatologist have prescribed.  </li>
            <li> Makes the feet feel nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff for my feet.  </li>
            <li> Just ordered five more tubes.</li>
            <li> I truly haven&#x27;t found anything that works better than AmLactin Therapy does, and Preferred Mart was timely and reliable with their delevery of the product.</li>
            <li> and it absorbed better and has a good smell</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>
            <li> It works better than the Stridex routine, and soaks in and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on the sheets when I skip wearing socks.</li>
            <li> The price and delivery were outstanding.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a better foot or skin cream.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is the best foot cream I have ever used to keep my feet smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> it :-)</li>
            <li> I got better results using it twice a day.</li>
            <li> I will Purchase More.</li>
            <li> I really love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I just wished it worked better on preventing the built up of calluses.</li>
            <li> I love the crab but the tube was punctured when I got it.</li>
            <li> WORTH EVERY PENNY!!</li>
            <li> This is excellent for relieving dry skin on feet.</li>
            <li> Awesome for dry skin and not just feet.  </li>
            <li> Best cream for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Best cream for dry heels</li>
            <li> After using it twice daily for a week, my heels look so good, like they appear after a good pedicure.</li>
            <li> I have tried many foot creams to deal with my rough heels, and this one is the best of them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different foot creams and this one has worked the best at keeping my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Best product for rough feet.  </li>
            <li> This is the best foot cream I have ever used, I&#x27;ve had rough heels and  cracked skin for 20 years.</li>
            <li> It is not terribly harsh and I was happy to spread any remaining lotion on my hands</li>
            <li> My daughter told me how much she loved this product.</li>
            <li> It has been very effective in healing the crack completely</li>
            <li> it goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t have an odor to it</li>
            <li> Otherwise everything was fine.</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and seems to soak in fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> Getting ready to order more!</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t been able to find this exact product for over 2 years and his feet has taken a beating but as soon as this arrived his feet were almost cleared up within 4 days!  </li>
            <li> Best over the counter foot product out on the market, hands down!</li>
            <li> It has helped smooth the skin.</li>
            <li> Being pre-diabetic, it is important that I care for my feet.  </li>
            <li> Great lotion for feet, especially heels and around toes.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> the cheap stuff you can buy at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> It keeps my feet smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> it is scent free but has a horrid smell that lingers on my hands after applying.</li>
            <li> My heels have not been so smooth since I was a kid.</li>
            <li> Repairs cracked heels, leaving them smooth so they don&#x27;t fray over the sheets at night.</li>
            <li> I tried this foot lotion because it got such great reviews.</li>
            <li> You have to use it 2x&#x27;s a day to see results and at the 2 week mark your feet are callus free.</li>
            <li> Seems good so far.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Be aware!!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended AmLactin Foot Cream Therapy for treating my cracked skin at the back of my heel, as nothing else was very effective.  </li>
            <li> was excited to get.</li>
            <li> The cream is rich but not too greasy.  </li>
            <li> This goes on easy, I put this on first, then heavy cream, and put socks on, a great overnight moisturizing treatment for the feet!!!</li>
            <li> I knew the Amlactin cream was great for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> So after showers and as I said at bedtime, especially, use this and put some light weight bedtime socks and good to go.</li>
            <li> I had nearly fresh heels and the next time they looked great.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how effective this was.</li>
            <li> soft, nails look better too!</li>
            <li> THOSE REVIEWS WERE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!  </li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist, and I must say she was right!</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I&#x27;m good to go with daily use and am once again shaking hands with confidence.</li>
            <li> My feet is nice and soft after using it.</li>
            <li> has really helped my feet look so much better.  </li>
            <li> Cannot say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> However, a friend of mine suggested that AmLactin cream might be even more effective at treating the dry skin on my feet</li>
            <li> is a super</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the best product that I&#x27;ve used on my rough feet in the winter.  </li>
            <li> This product quickly heals any cracks I have on the bottom of my heels.  </li>
            <li> No sticky residue, seems to absorb quickly.</li>
            <li> It could use just a hint of fragrance in my opinion, as it has a unique smell but better for sensitive skins this way I suppose.</li>
            <li> This foot cream is creamy and is absorbed quickly.  </li>
            <li> and works fast!!</li>
            <li> and my feet will be ready!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product for extra dry feet.</li>
            <li> but there is something about this cream that is worth</li>
            <li> so I figured it was worth</li>
            <li> It is worth the cost.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended and have found it works as described and well worth the recommendation.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than no lotion, but not any different than using a cheap lotion.  </li>
            <li> This product is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> This product is worth every Dollar.</li>
            <li> I love this cream and it did really work on my very cracked heels.</li>
            <li> but if it works it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products that really didn&#x27;t do anything more than just a regular lotion would do.</li>
            <li> The product came as expected and in good time.  </li>
            <li> This is first time for the foot cream, but quickly saw results in the softness of my feet.</li>
            <li> Not greasy, it soaks right in.</li>
            <li> I have been plagued by dry skin on the heels of my feet for quite some while now; and I recently tried Eucerin Moisturizing Cream in a plastic tub with very good results.</li>
            <li> You use very little, and get great results.</li>
            <li> Reminiscent of Elmer&#x27;s Glue, the smell isn&#x27;t my favorite, but does dissipate quickly.  </li>
            <li> Unscented and more affective than a general moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Should be used everynight to really work to full capacity.</li>
            <li> Tried other brands (Flexitol, Eucerin), but this worked the best for me for really dry and cracked heels.</li>
            <li> I am diabetic and this brand is what my dermatologist recommended I&#x27;ve use this for many years, makes your feet feel soft and very well protected</li>
            <li> I normally put it on at night before bed, let it dry for a minute or two, then I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li> This substance is very effective as stated above, used daily on the toes...  </li>
            <li> This cream makes me feet soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure if this version was really necessary.  </li>
            <li> This product does exactly as advertised...</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t been able to get back into the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> It is not sticky and you don&#x27;t need to wear socks to bed, which makes my feet too hot.  </li>
            <li> and I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Bumpy skin has turned smooth nearly overnight.</li>
            <li> Tried many products and not wearing sandals but still suffer from the same issue in the winterso footwear was not my issue.</li>
            <li> This really does work!</li>
            <li> pretty pricey for the amount</li>
            <li> This has both moisturizer and lactic acid which gently solve the problem!  </li>
            <li> The cream works exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> something that actually fosters healthy skin.</li>
            <li> but the purple pumice thing really rocks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also starting using their body lotion and love that as well.</li>
            <li> and my feet felt better the next morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid gardener</li>
            <li> I just have to use it consistently.</li>
            <li> This, along with trying to take better care of my bare feet in general, has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> I have been using Miracle Foot cream and really can&#x27;t notice any difference, enough to justify the greater cost.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for my dry hands for a long time and works great.  </li>
            <li> It smells a little funny but its amazing stuff</li>
            <li> OK my feet are dry and scratchy in winter.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also glad to report that my recent shipments have been the new fragrance-free formula.</li>
            <li> It works great on dry, cracked, rough and calloused feet.</li>
            <li> The product inside was fine but the outside was so grimy I would not have even picked it up.  </li>
            <li> Feet getting callus free and much softer....... they won&#x27;t want to walk barefoot next summer though.</li>
            <li> Love this foot cream..really softens the rough spots on your foot and is very non-greasy.  </li>
            <li> Really recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how well and fast it worked.  </li>
            <li> The Foot Cream is thicker than the Body Lotion and doesn&#x27;t seem to \\&quot;disappear\\&quot; as fast.</li>
            <li> While it seems to work about as fast as Eucerin, AmLactin is not quite so greasy</li>
            <li> Like Eucerin, AmLactin does not have any real scent to it</li>
            <li> and I really tried</li>
            <li> I have tried all the touted remedies, including creams and lotions and even udder balm, but until AmLactin Foot Cream Therapy, nothing seemed to make much of a difference.</li>
            <li> the kicker is this stuff really does works.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> and I really need this product</li>
            <li> I have tried at least a dozen different foot lotions and this is by far the best I have used.</li>
            <li> AmLactin Foot Cream Therapy works very well</li>
            <li> thanks,  ronnie</li>
            <li> When I finally tried it I forgot an important step and didn&#x27;t get the results she got.</li>
            <li> I also use same method to get smooth legs.</li>
            <li> totally worth the money if you want soft feet.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t need much of it.  </li>
            <li> Recommended by my very fussy sister, I couldn&#x27;t resist.</li>
            <li> Was hoping that this would smooth them out when added to my regular pedicures.</li>
            <li> but I really can&#x27;t stand the way it smells.  </li>
            <li> This product is the real heal deal.  </li>
            <li> However, it does not seem to be available at local stores any longer.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> but this stuff really softens them.  </li>
            <li> This product had been recommended by a podiatrist and it has really softened my feet as promised.</li>
            <li> it came rushing out, very watery</li>
            <li> but i waited 2 days and it is still very watery and kinda greasy.</li>
            <li> I really like this foot cream.</li>
            <li> AmLactin products really do what the manufacturer says they will.</li>
            <li> but it really watery.</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement.</li>
            <li> hasnt changed much for me yet...</li>
            <li> This foot cream actually helps keep your skin smooth.</li>
            <li> It really does work, my feet&lt;</li>
            <li> I immediately ordered the product and it was delivered very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My feet are much softer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered from two of Amazon&#x27;s vendors thus far, and both products received have been the older scented (mildly) version.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE, five months later... my hands are now almost completely healthy and as soft as a guy can stand.</li>
            <li> The cream is thick and feels really good going on.</li>
            <li> I have soft feet and hands now!!!</li>
            <li> great product, doesnt yellow your skin like vaseline, no strong perfumey odor either.</li>
            <li> Another reviewer writes that \\&quot;a pea size for each foot is plenty;\\&quot; and they are definitely right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, while Eucerin moisturizing cream is a very good product, even for dry skin on feet, this is the product of choice for treating dry skin on feet.</li>
            <li> After only 2 uses, I noticed a significant difference in my feet.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a great value because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> More costly than other moisturizers?</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works very well on keeping your feet in condition, and is particularly helpful for those with diabetes.  </li>
            <li> This cream is amazing, it healed my cracked heels in just a few days!  </li>
            <li> If I had been at a store making this purchase I would not have brought this particular tube home.</li>
            <li> The cream feels somewhat \\&quot;oily\\&quot; when first applied, but it doesn&#x27;t take long before it is absorbed.  </li>
            <li> Have to use it more regularly than I do currently.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s economical and small enough to carry around with you; and unlike Eucerin a very tiny bit each day does a very effective job.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone with cracked heels.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist highly recommended it to me.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am beyond satisfied, have sent this to my mother who has the same problem of cracked, dry heels because the cream has done so much to improve my feet.  </li>
            <li> worked really well on super dry calloused skin.</li>
            <li> The 3 ounce tube may seem small but it doesn&#x27;t take much for it to work it&#x27;s magic</li>
            <li> This product made my feet look normal.</li>
            <li> Regular use keeps my feet pretty and ready for sandals.</li>
            <li> Nice and thick, softens and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> it was nice and thick, not greasy.  </li>
            <li> With one application you see improvement, and with regular use you have smooth feet with no dry cuticles or callous areas.</li>
            <li> I now use it on my feet and was totally surprised had how smooth my feet have become, both the heels and dry skin around toe nails.  </li>
            <li> I have tried lots of foot products and this is one that is nice, but does not really help with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Expensive for the amount you get, but very effective.</li>
            <li> There is no more cracking, rough skin, peeling skin- just smooth, healthy appearing.</li>
            <li> I fell into the foot cream on a trip to NY and cannot live without this product.</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find it where i live</li>
            <li> Where I live is super dry...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different creams for my feet, that never really did what they said they would do.  </li>
            <li> and I was very surprised how well it worked.  </li>
            <li> i was so excited to find such a highly-rated product to FINALLY cure my cracked heels.</li>
            <li> Next time will likely just opt for the non foot version like last time that was a lot more bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> I used to stick to the carpet like Velcro, but now I&#x27;m soft and smoooooothe!</li>
            <li> I apply at bedtime and awake with soft feet!</li>
            <li> I noticed a big difference the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> We have used this product for about 6 months, having bought it locally the first time.  </li>
            <li> It is not greasy, no scent, and makes my feet soooo soft!</li>
            <li> Especially if you use it consistently.  </li>
            <li> This is the first over the counter product that has actually helped my dishydrosis.</li>
            <li> Used this product on several occasions and don&#x27;t know if it is much better than any other foot cream with alpha-hydroxy in it.</li>
            <li> Must be used pretty regularly.</li>
            <li> After a 20 minute soak and then a pumice stone, my feet are so soft!  </li>
            <li> It softens them to the point where I can take a buff stone and smooth them down.</li>
            <li> Worked OK of the rest of my foot areas but not worth spending the extra money for use on the callouses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s application is such that just the smallest amount spreads to a surprisingly large area...</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this based on the other reviews &amp; I had hoped this was going to help w/my dry &amp; cracking heels</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much thicker than the other two and did a fantastic job clearing up my dry cracking heal.</li>
            <li> They might not win a beauty contest, but the difference is amazing.  </li>
            <li> quote my four year old \\&quot;Mommy, my toe is not peeling any more!\\</li>
            <li> so much I ordered 2 with my initial order but am going to \\&quot;stock</li>
            <li> This is the &amp;#34;gold standard&amp;#34; for foot creams, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t need to use much to get the same effect.</li>
            <li> a tiny bit at a time is all you&#x27;ll ever really need.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to learn from another reviewer that her</li>
            <li> Podiatrist suggested to have it work better, to put it on my feet and not walk on them or put any socks on for at least 15 minutes so it would not be rubbed off my feet anyway</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the improvement to the heals of my feet.</li>
            <li> are so soft and hydrated</li>
            <li> /&gt;so soft</li>
            <li> I am completely sold on this.</li>
            <li> My daughter told me how she got soft heels after her shower in just one application.</li>
            <li> I now use it once a day to maintain my soft feet.  </li>
            <li> my feet are soft.</li>
            <li> After putting it on before bed, I have to wash my hands so that the odor of the cream won&#x27;t be anywhere near my face.  </li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, this product is what stands between me and soft feet.</li>
            <li> I would much rather lotion up then have to scrub my feet with a stone daily.</li>
            <li> Helps keep heels soft.  </li>
            <li> My feet have never been so soft or looked</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any perfume, it is a thick cream that goes on nicely, not overly greasy, just a great cream that really does the job.</li>
            <li> Good, though expensive.  </li>
            <li> No foot probs here, but this cream has been the first product ever to heal my dry peeling hands.</li>
            <li> It is not always easy to find locally (I usually have to ask for it at the pharmacy counter in Wal-Mart)</li>
            <li> Use a paper towel to clean knife edge as you remove dead skin.</li>
            <li> i give it 3 stars because it was a decent enough lotion, but not for the price and not for all the hype.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the lotion for a few weeks, and it hasn&#x27;t done anything special.</li>
            <li> This lotion really helps exfoliate the slouchy dry skin off and leaves my hands feeling soft.</li>
            <li> After a few days your dry skin will look noticeably better.</li>
            <li> I have a cabinet full of foot cream products that say they will solve my rough, dry, gross feet, but this one really works.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff on my feet, but also on my &amp;#34;barnacles.&amp;#34;  I have Seborheic Keratosis, sometimes called the &amp;#34;barnacles of old age.&amp;#34; The dermotologist won&#x27;t burn them off as they are benign, but this product flattens them so they are not so apparent.</li>
            <li> It makes areas of the foot soft that are not rough or calloused.</li>
            <li> and I actually have almost normal feet.</li>
            <li> Yummy, rich cream for dry feet plus alpha hydroxy to keep the rough areas under control.  </li>
            <li> After several years, it became watery and so she asked me to buy a new bottle.  </li>
            <li> I use a foot file daily and have tried Kerasal, Gold Bond, Dr. Schols and every new cream</li>
            <li> only wish I could find the new fragrance-free version described and pictured here.</li>
            <li> but it I finally have heels I can live with and not be embarrased.</li>
            <li> I actually have soft feet!</li>
            <li> It is hard to find in stores but always available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very highly recommend this to anyone with medium calloused, rough feet..</li>
            <li> A slightly acrid smell, due to lactic acid, is maybe the only thing I don&#x27;t love.</li>
            <li> The product works great on feet and doesn&#x27;t have any type of bad smell or anything of that sort.</li>
            <li> In general I wear alot of flip flops and so roughness is attained on the feet</li>
            <li> The same in stores near my home.</li>
            <li> Really softens rough spots on feet.</li>
            <li> This foot cream works really well in removing any calluses off heels or any other part of your foot.  </li>
            <li> My new Podiatrist suggested I use this for my extremely dry feet.  </li>
            <li> It only took a few days to smooth out my mangled dry cracked feet.</li>
            <li> I saw improvement in a few days and my heels are smooth and I can take socks off now without them pulling and sticking like velcro on my rough heels.</li>
            <li> I have been unable to find this product locally and was thrilled when I found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Cost is the main thing that tempts me to try out cheaper creams now and then, but I&#x27;ve found nothing else that even remotely compares to the effectiveness of AmLactin.  </li>
            <li> and I do not see much difference for the other products I use that are similar</li>
            <li> It really helps to soften your heals and other areas of your feet that need extra care.</li>
            <li> I have not used it long, but so far it isbgreat.</li>
            <li> When my feet are severely dry and cracked it can take a week or two for the dryness to disappear completely.  </li>
            <li> super thick, industrial strength version of the regular watery amlactin lotion.</li>
            <li> very dry, and now they become soft.</li>
            <li> I have no reason to recommend this product other than to let others know there is  a product out there that will really help those dry, cracked heels.</li>
            <li> It helps your dry feet like no other.</li>
            <li> Within a few days of beginning to use it, my cracked heels started looking normal again!</li>
            <li> I do have very very thick and dry skin on my feet, (even hands) and even though this is gentle, it really did work.</li>
            <li> They do still occasionally become dry but only when I&#x27;m taking some type of medication or supplement that dries me out overall.</li>
            <li> It really does eliminate cracks, callouses and rough patches on the feet in less than ten days.  </li>
            <li> This is the only product that actually helps heal my cracked dry heels.  </li>
            <li> There was a slightly noticeable smell, but I only noticed it on my hands if they were near my face, so I wouldn&#x27;t worry about it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve rated this exact product at least a dozen times but Amazon isn&#x27;t saving it for some reason.</li>
            <li> Long lasting</li>
            <li> Much of the hard, calloused areas are gone entirely.  </li>
            <li> My feet get so dry and cracked, they actually snag the comforter on our bed!!!</li>
            <li> But if I use it daily, I never develop dry skin or calluses at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only product that got rid of the dry cracks on my heels.</li>
            <li> But I use it everyday and my feet have never been so soft!</li>
            <li> One tube goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> With in a few days of using it morning and night there was a marked difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had rough heels and callouses on the sides of my big toes for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> i expected it to be thick, when i first squeezed some out</li>
            <li> Absolutely, breaks down dead skin build-up.</li>
            <li> at the beeginning i was doubting because is different from the other ffot creams I tried...</li>
            <li> working extremely well until I hurt my back and could no longer apply nightly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will be a life long customer!</li>
            <li> Must have tried every cream on the market, tons of flax and fish and other supplements, and finally found a fix for dry, dry, dry heals.  </li>
            <li> Just one toe gets extremely dry and peels.</li>
            <li> I purchased a tube Of AmLactin for my \\&quot;DRY &amp; CRACKED\\</li>
            <li> AmLactin Foot Cream Therapy (3 oz)]]and dry indoor air.  </li>
            <li> Years of dry, cracked skin -- gone.  </li>
            <li> AFter suffering for years with cracked and dry heels on my feet, I was recommended this product by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> I must have tried everything for my cracked, dry heels.</li>
            <li> If your feet get really dry put some of this on at night before bed and put some socks on over it.</li>
            <li> My skin Dr. reccomended this for my dry heals from wearing sandals and it started working after two uses.  </li>
            <li> I started using it twice a day, and after a week, my feet no longer are cracked, dry, or irritated.  </li>
            <li> I have had dry feet and have tried every product under the sun.</li>
            <li> Does not relieve or diminish dry skin.  </li>
            <li> As promised it relieves dry feet and moisturizes them when used as directed.</li>
            <li> I got a microplane file and file the dry skin on my heels and put this cream on</li>
            <li> This foot cream helped my chronic dry and peeling feet.  </li>
            <li> but it works well on my dry callous feet.</li>
            <li> This was recommended for dry elbows - it is helping, still a way to go.</li>
            <li> If you have dry, cracked feet, this is the product for you.  </li>
            <li> My hands are extremely dry.</li>
            <li> The cream smoothed out dry callused areas on my feet and healed sore</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m still on the hunt for something that will help my wintertime dry feet.</li>
            <li> This is THE stuff if your feet are prone to getting dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> A doctor recommended this to treat dry cracked heels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten both the green and blue regular versions of Amalacin and like the both</li>
            <li> I noticed a big difference after only a few days.</li>
            <li> After just a few days of using the lotion, I noticed a major improvement.  </li>
            <li> I get really hard, thick calluses on my heels and big toes and this stuff clears it right up.  </li>
            <li> But it is such a small tube that it didn&#x27;t last for very long.</li>
            <li> My heels have been an embarrassment to me for decades - dry, cracked, peeling (yuck!), no matter what I did.</li>
            <li> After almost a week, the deep cracks in my heel are much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> However, only a small amount is necessary.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using this nightly, and already less than a week later, I can tell a difference.</li>
            <li> I do believe you should only use half a packet of the foot soap for just your feet.  </li>
            <li> I have a skin condition called ichtheosis, which is hereditory very dry, cracking skin on hands and feet.</li>
            <li> My wife had been using AmLactin lotion for her very dry and cracked feet.  </li>
            <li> I have a type of psoriasis that leaves my hands and feet very dry.</li>
            <li> I use it every single night! ...</li>
            <li> Bought for use on my elbows that get very dry and rough.</li>
            <li> but you only need a little</li>
            <li> I have suffered many years with cracked, painful heels.</li>
            <li> My only negative is that it doesn&#x27;t come in a bigger tube t hat I have found.  </li>
            <li> That being said, you do have to continue to use it on a regular basis, at least daily.</li>
            <li> After only a few applications my wife was raving aobut the &#x27;wonder cream.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> My heels aren&#x27;t as rough, and the callouses are almost gone.  </li>
            <li> Only a few days of use</li>
            <li> After using the AmLactin for just a few days, the results were obvious.</li>
            <li> After only a few weeks of use (as directed)</li>
            <li> My heels can get to feeling as rough and scratchy as my labradoodle&#x27;s foot pads</li>
            <li> I had really rough, cracked heels.  </li>
            <li> I could start to see and feel the difference in only a few days.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it stinks so just put on socks right away.</li>
            <li> I am on my feet a lot and have a few callouses and heels with a few rough spots but nothing too major.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While it is expensive, a little goes a LONG way, so it is well worth</li>
            <li> I have spent 3 times the money on other AmLactin products and they haven&#x27;t done a thing for him</li>
            <li> After using this on the rough spots on my feet, I tried it on other areas.</li>
            <li> I have a few age spots near my knees from sun exposure and they are definitely less brown after applying a few times a week for about 6 weeks now.</li>
            <li> A few years ago, I started a nightly routine of swabbing my heels with Stridex Medicated Pads, letting my heels dry before following up with heavy lotion and cotton socks.</li>
            <li> Also a little goes a long way, the tube lasts me 3 to 4 months.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> again AmLactin scores a few extra points for being less expensive--true</li>
            <li> when extreme I brush superglue on the cracks</li>
            <li> Surpasses Eucerin and other specialty creams for feet.  </li>
            <li> have tried all kinds of other foot creams and not had them work as well as the AmLactin.  </li>
            <li> I felt compelled to write the review here because without reading the other reviews I would have just bypassed this product.</li>
            <li> , my heels are extremely soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A bit disappointed, but will keep using it until I find something better for my calluses.</li>
            <li> and I have a lot of other products.</li>
            <li> She was very much a senior with very tired feet.</li>
            <li> I wear sandals almost year round and in the summer my feet get really dry.</li>
            <li> Actually, rating should be NA - but am saying &amp;#34;I hate it&amp;#34; - not the product but the fact that it was unavailable when it was in fact advertised as available.</li>
            <li> Turned my rough feet into baby-soft feet in less than a week.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried at least a dozen hand creams during the past few years and nothing except steroid prescriptions had helped much.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Though expensive, this stuff really works.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after a couple of months of using this product, I didn&#x27;t see much improvement in preventing calluses.  </li>
            <li> When I asked my podiatrist about what foot cream she recommended, she immediately wrote down Amlactin for me</li>
            <li> no more dry flaky skin</li>
            <li> For the past 10 years I have tried to find something to work on my dry, cracked feet.  </li>
            <li> had previously used a prescription lotion for this problem years ago.</li>
            <li> That said, this medicine worked just as well as the prescription lotion I have previously</li>
            <li> She had previously recommended the Eucerin with alpha-hydroxy.</li>
            <li> , you get less cream but</li>
            <li> I am hypothyroid and my feet are a mess...</li>
            <li> (I have dry hands and thick skin too).</li>
            <li> and it did nothing but soften the callouses a little bit.</li>
            <li> A little pricy</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey</li>
            <li> Ok.. we have all been there when you wear your flip flops all day and then look to see your feet need a little TLC.</li>
            <li> This not the most expensive, nor is it the least expensive.  </li>
            <li> i find it greasy - and I gave up after a few greasy days.</li>
            <li> This cream doesn&#x27;t make my feet feel hydrated all day like some cheaper creams do, I assume because it&#x27;s purpose is to eat away dead skin, not just moisturize.</li>
            <li> You will see results within a few days.</li>
            <li> Wasted my time.</li>
            <li> but it helps dried cracked feet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messy, but does seem to moisturize.</li>
            <li> I had been recommended another product in the past by a dermatologist that was less than satisfactory.  </li>
            <li> My feet were dry, cracked, and very uncomfortable prior to using this product.  </li>
            <li> Use it everyday and it will work!</li>
            <li> No more cracks, and the dryness is gone after about 5 days.  </li>
            <li> This is a small 3 oz tube so use it sparingly.  </li>
            <li> Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive and came in a larger tube for the price.</li>
            <li> After only two weeks of twice-daily use, my hands have healed almost completely--just shy of a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The AmLactin foot cream therapy is unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> It has become difficult to find in our local stores</li>
            <li> I am not sure if the tube I got was defective but it literally spills out.</li>
            <li> I have problems with cracked cuticles because my hands are in water a lot as well as double trouble in the winter because of the cold, [</li>
            <li> Years of hard scale -- gone.  </li>
            <li> I used it for at least 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I try and use this at least 3-5 times per week to see a continuous improvement in the quality of the skin on my feet.</li>
            <li> It is thick and rubs in well.</li>
            <li> Thick and creamy w/o being sticky.</li>
            <li> It got rid the thick callusing on my feet as well as the cracking around my toes.</li>
            <li> No more embarrassment over the appearance of my feet!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never know if it&#x27;s because of the active ingredients, or because the tube was expensive</li>
            <li> Smells horrible for the first 15 minutes but who cares if the product works.</li>
            <li> Dry, cracked, painful heels.</li>
            <li> this product has helped remove very thick calluses from my feet along with a pumice stone.  </li>
            <li> very thick cream</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot less expensive than a spa pedicure!</li>
            <li> but alas, for me it was just another cream.  </li>
            <li> It does have a slight &amp;#34;sour&amp;#34; smell, but it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
            <li> Smells weird, not great, but results speak for themselves.</li>
            <li> The cracks in my fingers were painful and hard to heal.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product for anyone who is tired of buying products that DON&#x27;t work!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had thrown the packaging away, so I can&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it&#x27;s so watery</li>
            <li> It is quite expensive, but it truly works!</li>
            <li> Often the cracks in my heels were so bad they bled.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have really bad cracked feet to begin with.</li>
            <li> My heels were atrocious.</li>
            <li> i was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was doubtful of the recommendation.  </li>
            <li> Annoying.</li>
            <li> and my heels were really UGLY!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed..</li>
            <li> I have horrible cracked heels from walking around barefoot on hardwood floors all of the time.</li>
            <li> I have had awful feet for years.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Unscented and more affective than a general moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This cream makes me feet soft and smooth. I think it&#x27;s one of the best I&#x27;ve used so far. Really recommend it.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> This foot cream works really well in removing any calluses off heels or any other part of your foot.  I was amazed at how well and fast it worked.  I would recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> I have a skin condition called ichtheosis, which is hereditory very dry, cracking skin on hands and feet. This is the best foot cream I have found!</li>
            <li> I love this foot cream and wish I had bought it sooner. It works great on dry, cracked, rough and calloused feet.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my podiatrist. I used it for at least 2 weeks and it did nothing but soften the callouses a little bit. Definitely not worth the money. Worked OK of the rest of my foot areas but not worth spending the extra money for use on the callouses. Trying another product now that seems to be working after only 2 days!</li>
            <li> This is the only product that actually helps heal my cracked dry heels.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it!</li>
            <li> Okay, my son was born with a peeling toe. Just one toe gets extremely dry and peels. Top Docs at Children&#x27;s Dermatology dept recommended AmLactin after looking at smears of his toe skin under a microscope and determining it was not a fungus or yeast.&lt;br /&gt;To quote my four year old \\&quot;Mommy, my toe is not peeling any more!\\&quot; Enough said!</li>
            <li> This is excellent for relieving dry skin on feet.</li>
            <li> I purchased a tube Of AmLactin for my \\&quot;DRY &amp; CRACKED\\&quot; feet and had immediate results.......Product is so good that my son and grandson are now using the product ......  A Miracle!!!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome for dry skin and not just feet.  Don&#x27;t buy it for the fragrance though.  Excellent barrier and not too greasy.</li>
            <li> Great for cracked heals. I used it daily and within a week or so I saw great improvement.</li>
            <li> The best.  Tried other brands (Flexitol, Eucerin), but this worked the best for me for really dry and cracked heels.</li>
            <li> I work for a podiatrist/orthopedic surgeon and this is what he recommends to all our patients who cannot afford the prescription creams or for those whom their insurance doesn&#x27;t cover them.  I use it myself...it&#x27;s not *quite* as good as the prescription creams like Remeven BUT for the cost (I actually just picked up a couple of tubes at Walgreens on clearance for $2.89) it can&#x27;t be beat.  I get really hard, thick calluses on my heels and big toes and this stuff clears it right up.  It&#x27;s safe for diabetics, too!</li>
            <li> Best foot lotion around!</li>
            <li> This is a good foot cream. I bought it because the skin on my feet is drying up. It has helped smooth the skin.</li>
            <li> I have been unable to find this product locally and was thrilled when I found it on Amazon.  My husband works construction and the wool socks he wears in the winter do a number on his feet.  His heals get so cracked they will split and when extreme I brush superglue on the cracks so they don&#x27;t bleed!  This has been an ongoing problem for all the years I&#x27;ve known him until one day my mother gave him the remainder of her tube of this foot cream.  It worked like a miracle! (FYI my mother is diabetic and this is the only foot cream her Dr. recommends).  I hadn&#x27;t been able to find this exact product for over 2 years and his feet has taken a beating but as soon as this arrived his feet were almost cleared up within 4 days!  I have spent 3 times the money on other AmLactin products and they haven&#x27;t done a thing for him but there is something about this cream that is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold.  I swear by this product so much I ordered 2 with my initial order but am going to \\&quot;stock pile\\&quot; this to eliminate having to look for it again.  The 3 ounce tube may seem small but it doesn&#x27;t take much for it to work it&#x27;s magic so it&#x27;s lasts longer than you might think.  The tube of superglue is put away and life is as it should be once again.</li>
            <li> super thick, industrial strength version of the regular watery amlactin lotion. worked really well on super dry calloused skin. A+</li>
            <li> Best foot cream I have ever used.  Surpasses Eucerin and other specialty creams for feet.  Expensive for the amount you get, but very effective.</li>
            <li> Always looking for excellent moisturizers, I was recommended Amlactin by my physicians assistant. I fell into the foot cream on a trip to NY and cannot live without this product. FL may be humid, but we wear a lot of sandles. Without this cream my feet are toast.</li>
            <li> My wife had been using AmLactin lotion for her very dry and cracked feet.  It had been prescribed by her doctor.  After several years, it became watery and so she asked me to buy a new bottle.  In searching for it (our local drug store did not carry it) I read reviews about this cream that said it was much better than anything else, including the lotion.  THOSE REVIEWS WERE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!  After only a few applications my wife was raving aobut the &#x27;wonder cream.&#x27;  Another very happy user of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten both the green and blue regular versions of Amalacin and like the both so I wasn&#x27;t sure if this version was really necessary.  It&#x27;s much thicker than the other two and did a fantastic job clearing up my dry cracking heal. I use daily to maintain.</li>
            <li> After one week of applying this product to foot cracks every night, my feet healed themselves. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> This product does exactly as advertised...when used daily, it helps your feet retain moisture (without being greasy) and I found that its also good for your hands.</li>
            <li> I knew the Amlactin cream was great for dry skin.  The foot cream is wonderful also.  You use very little, and get great results.</li>
            <li> I have horrible cracked heels from walking around barefoot on hardwood floors all of the time. I ordered this on the advice of a friend and have been putting it on every night before bed for about 10 days. I have to tell you, my feet look completely different. After just a few days of using the lotion, I noticed a major improvement.  After almost a week, the deep cracks in my heel are much less noticeable. I am hopeful that after a month or so, my feet wont&#x27; have cracks any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had previously used a prescription lotion for this problem years ago. The last time I went to the dermatologist I asked about that medicine, but she wouldn&#x27;t prescribe because I was brestfeeding at the time and I haven&#x27;t been able to get back into the dermatologist. That said, this medicine worked just as well as the prescription lotion I have previously used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will note that I use it every night before bed and wear cotton socks. This, along with trying to take better care of my bare feet in general, has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> Best out of many!  Being pre-diabetic, it is important that I care for my feet.  I am also a nurse so I am on them all day.  Nice and thick, softens and lasts all day.  Eliminates callouses.  Have tried many foot creams and this is by far the best.  Cannot find in any retail stores so grateful to be able to order it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a very good foot cream  It is thick and rubs in well.</li>
            <li> I apply AmLactin cream to my feet each time I shower and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> If I had been at a store making this purchase I would not have brought this particular tube home. The product inside was fine but the outside was so grimy I would not have even picked it up.  Otherwise everything was fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had rough heels and callouses on the sides of my big toes for as long as I can remember.  This product made my feet look normal. My heels aren&#x27;t as rough, and the callouses are almost gone.  I&#x27;ll never know if it&#x27;s because of the active ingredients, or because the tube was expensive so I put the lotion on every morning and every evening.  But I&#x27;m 66 and I actually have almost normal feet.</li>
            <li> Best cream for dry skin.</li>
            <li> This foot cream is creamy and is absorbed quickly.  It is not sticky and you don&#x27;t need to wear socks to bed, which makes my feet too hot.  With one application you see improvement, and with regular use you have smooth feet with no dry cuticles or callous areas.</li>
            <li> This is the &amp;#34;gold standard&amp;#34; for foot creams, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  Like with anything, you have to keep at it.  I try and use this at least 3-5 times per week to see a continuous improvement in the quality of the skin on my feet.</li>
            <li> this product has helped remove very thick calluses from my feet along with a pumice stone.  Would buy this product again.  use it daily.</li>
            <li> I was doubtful of the recommendation.  I&#x27;ve tried so many different creams for my feet, that never really did what they said they would do.  My feet get so dry and cracked, they actually snag the comforter on our bed!!! After using twice a day for only 3 days, I&#x27;m not snagging the bed anymore!!!  It doesn&#x27;t take alot of cream for each rub, either.  It is quite expensive, but it truly works!</li>
            <li> My pediotrist recommended AmLactin Foot Cream for my cracked heels. She had previously recommended the Eucerin with alpha-hydroxy. The AmLactin Foot Cream worked much better. It even cleared up my fingers. I had tried the AmLactin Body Lotion on my hands but the Foot Cream actually worked. The Foot Cream is thicker than the Body Lotion and doesn&#x27;t seem to \\&quot;disappear\\&quot; as fast.</li>
            <li> I got a sample from a friend to use on my hands.  I have problems with cracked cuticles because my hands are in water a lot as well as double trouble in the winter because of the cold, [[ASIN:B0024GT9NC AmLactin Foot Cream Therapy (3 oz)]]and dry indoor air.  The cracks in my fingers were painful and hard to heal.  Using the foot cream totally relieved the problem.  I now use it on my feet and was totally surprised had how smooth my feet have become, both the heels and dry skin around toe nails.  I have tried many products with promises of healing cracked heels to no avail.  This product is amazing!! and works fast!!</li>
            <li> I have a TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury) and I just need to rub it on my toes to stop calluses from forming and to keep my feet perfect! PERFECTTTTTTTT!!!! A+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++!</li>
            <li> Have just been using a few days but it seems to be really making a difference on my feet. I use it twice a day and I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Seldom does the hype match reality.  Here, it does.  Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried dozens of lotions, creams and ointments, both OTC and prescription.  None worked this well.  Within a week of applying this cream once each evening, I could both see and feel the difference.  The cream feels somewhat \\&quot;oily\\&quot; when first applied, but it doesn&#x27;t take long before it is absorbed.  The result is almost magical.  But, ANY cream can make a temporary improvement.  Calluses that I&#x27;ve had for years began to disappear, like magic.  Years of hard scale -- gone.  Years of dry, cracked skin -- gone.  If anyone ever makes a product that works this well on facial skin, say goodbye to facelifts.  WORTH EVERY PENNY!!</li>
            <li> Been using for about 2 weeks and no callouses.</li>
            <li> Never doubt it! A must try! This is a miracle lotion, my foot healed! Will buy again next time.</li>
            <li> Great lotion for feet, especially heels and around toes. It is not greasy at all.  Should be used everynight to really work to full capacity.</li>
            <li> I have been plagued by dry skin on the heels of my feet for quite some while now; and I recently tried Eucerin Moisturizing Cream in a plastic tub with very good results. However, a friend of mine suggested that AmLactin cream might be even more effective at treating the dry skin on my feet so I figured it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, I am quite pleased with this product. While it seems to work about as fast as Eucerin, AmLactin is not quite so greasy and I didn&#x27;t need to use much to get the same effect. Like Eucerin, AmLactin does not have any real scent to it and I like that; but again AmLactin scores a few extra points for being less expensive--true, you get less cream but a tiny bit at a time is all you&#x27;ll ever really need. Another reviewer writes that \\&quot;a pea size for each foot is plenty;\\&quot; and they are definitely right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, while Eucerin moisturizing cream is a very good product, even for dry skin on feet, this is the product of choice for treating dry skin on feet. It&#x27;s economical and small enough to carry around with you; and unlike Eucerin a very tiny bit each day does a very effective job. Moreover, AmLactin is not as greasy as Eucerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is my third order of this foot cream.  I have used a number of foot creams over the years -- this is superior. The cream softened my cracked heels after four days.  Regular use keeps my feet pretty and ready for sandals. This not the most expensive, nor is it the least expensive.  AmLactin may seem a bit pricey.  However, only a small amount is necessary.  It is worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Believe me, I have tried everything. This actually works. Use it everyday and it will work! Not greasy, it soaks right in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using AmLactin off an on for several years.  When I don&#x27;t use it daily, my cracked heels return with a vengeance.  Cost is the main thing that tempts me to try out cheaper creams now and then, but I&#x27;ve found nothing else that even remotely compares to the effectiveness of AmLactin.  When my feet are severely dry and cracked it can take a week or two for the dryness to disappear completely.  But if I use it daily, I never develop dry skin or calluses at all.  It&#x27;s truly a wonder lotion!  Reminiscent of Elmer&#x27;s Glue, the smell isn&#x27;t my favorite, but does dissipate quickly.  I was surprised to learn from another reviewer that her Amlactin was scented; that she&#x27;d prefer a non-scented variety.  I&#x27;ve never seen a scented Amlactin, but would love to try one.</li>
            <li> Doctor recommended it, I tried it, and have been using it ever since. Highly recommend this product. Great for your feet.</li>
            <li> Well worn \\&quot;summer feet\\&quot; needed TLC.  This product was recommended and have found it works as described and well worth the recommendation.  Feet getting callus free and much softer....... they won&#x27;t want to walk barefoot next summer though.</li>
            <li> Long lasting and I like the way it feels.</li>
            <li> This product is great. Within a few days of beginning to use it, my cracked heels started looking normal again! Only wish it came in a bigger tube.</li>
            <li> My new Podiatrist suggested I use this for my extremely dry feet.  She had given me some samples and I was very surprised how well it worked.  However, when I went to try and buy it locally, I could not find it at CVS, Walgreen&#x27;s or Meijer.  Walgreen&#x27;s had it so that you could order it on line for $9.99 a tube for the same size as it is offered on Amazon @7.99, so I ordered two and will be ordering more.&lt;br /&gt;My Podiatrist suggested to have it work better, to put it on my feet and not walk on them or put any socks on for at least 15 minutes so it would not be rubbed off my feet anyway and it sure seems to work well.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried all kinds of other foot creams and not had them work as well as the AmLactin.  There is also a skin lotion she said I could use instead if I could not find it, but this is thicker and better for  your feet.</li>
            <li> My feet were dry, cracked, and very uncomfortable prior to using this product.  After only 2 uses, I noticed a significant difference in my feet.  No more cracks, and the dryness is gone after about 5 days.  I recommend trying this</li>
            <li> Works well but has a funky smell</li>
            <li> Only a few days of use and I&#x27;m already thrilled with the results. Bumpy skin has turned smooth nearly overnight. A slightly acrid smell, due to lactic acid, is maybe the only thing I don&#x27;t love.</li>
            <li> AFter suffering for years with cracked and dry heels on my feet, I was recommended this product by my dermatologist.  I couldn&#x27;t find it at any local drug stores, so searched and found it online.  Be sure to get the FOOT CREAM, not the lotion.  This stuff is a miracle worker.  AFter 2 weeks of using it faithfully every evening, then putting cotton socks on over it, my feet are 200% better.  They might not win a beauty contest, but the difference is amazing.  They don&#x27;t hurt anymore, and the cracks are gone!  I ALSO USE THIS ON MY CUTICLES of my hands, which were also bleeding and cracking.  I recommend this product for anyone who is tired of buying products that DON&#x27;t work!  THIS ONE DOES!</li>
            <li> I must have tried everything for my cracked, dry heels. My heels were like sandpaper and I really tried everything- I slept with vaseline, lotions/creams of every brand on my feet covered in socks for absorption. I was browsing amazon and came about this product, I ordered it and wow. After using it twice daily for a week, my heels look so good, like they appear after a good pedicure. There is no more cracking, rough skin, peeling skin- just smooth, healthy appearing. I felt compelled to write the review here because without reading the other reviews I would have just bypassed this product. Must try this! I am beyond satisfied, have sent this to my mother who has the same problem of cracked, dry heels because the cream has done so much to improve my feet.  Once you try this product for a week, you will be very pleased. It is the only thing that I have found to work, and it works! It is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic. I&#x27;ve had a lot of problems with the heels of my feet. Often the cracks in my heels were so bad they bled. I have tried all the touted remedies, including creams and lotions and even udder balm, but until AmLactin Foot Cream Therapy, nothing seemed to make much of a difference. Even scrubbing daily with a pumice stone didn&#x27;t work. After using the AmLactin for just a few days, the results were obvious. I was pleasantly surprised at the improvement to the heals of my feet. I highly recommend this product to anyone with cracked heels.</li>
            <li> I have suffered many years with cracked, painful heels. Tried many products and not wearing sandals but still suffer from the same issue in the winterso footwear was not my issue.I&#x27;ve tried everything, so I thoughtwhy not this it is doctor recommended. I use it twice a day and don&#x27;t have to use socks for it to work..the kicker is this stuff really does works.  I have soft feet and hands now!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried many foot creams to deal with my rough heels, and this one is the best of them.  I always see a difference quickly with this cream, and now they have improved the smell so all is good with this now.</li>
            <li> Yummy, rich cream for dry feet plus alpha hydroxy to keep the rough areas under control.  I used regular Amlactin lotion until I found this, which works well also, but this is richer.</li>
            <li> Since I started using the body lotion I became an AmLactin devotee. Decided to ditch my Dr. Scholl&#x27;s for this product and do not regret it! I use it at night with my hydrating socks and my feet are so soft and hydrated I constantly get compliments!</li>
            <li> Works very well. I live in Arizona and I really need this product</li>
            <li> works great for cracked feet</li>
            <li> Better than Rx from dermatologist.  Wonderful stuff.</li>
            <li> Amazing!! I noticed a definite difference after&lt;br /&gt;using this foot cream just once. My feet are&lt;br /&gt;so soft, my heels are extremely soft.&lt;br /&gt;I hope they never stop making this.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to buy more for myself to stock up&lt;br /&gt;and will be buying some for the girls in my&lt;br /&gt;family for their Christmas stockings.&lt;br /&gt;This is a super product.&lt;br /&gt;By  Polly</li>
            <li> This product is &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34;..Very highly recommend this to anyone with medium calloused, rough feet..In general I wear alot of flip flops and so roughness is attained on the feet but this product smoothes along with putting socks on at night at bedtime. So after showers and as I said at bedtime, especially, use this and put some light weight bedtime socks and good to go.</li>
            <li> Amlactin was recommended by my dermatologist.  I&#x27;ve used the lotion for a few weeks, and it hasn&#x27;t done anything special. It&#x27;s better than no lotion, but not any different than using a cheap lotion.  Okeefes healthy feet works a thousand times better.</li>
            <li> I wear sandals almost year round and in the summer my feet get really dry. I have tried at least a dozen different foot lotions and this is by far the best I have used. It smells a little funny but its amazing stuff and now I swear by it. If your feet get really dry put some of this on at night before bed and put some socks on over it. You will notice a difference.</li>
            <li> i was so excited to find such a highly-rated product to FINALLY cure my cracked heels. i was disappointed. it didn&#x27;t work any different then the cheap stuff you can buy at the grocery store. in fact, i was happier with [[ASIN:B003Y69DJG Overnight Repair Nightly Restoring Moisturizer by Jergens, 16.8 Ounce]]  i give it 3 stars because it was a decent enough lotion, but not for the price and not for all the hype.</li>
            <li> This is a great foot cream!  Not too greasy, not smelly.  A pea size for each foot is plenty.  One tube goes a long way.</li>
            <li> AmLactin Foot Cream Therapy works very well, isn&#x27;t greasy, and keeps your feet moisturized. You&#x27;ll love it, so buy some today.</li>
            <li> I received 2 of these tubes. was excited to get. Tried using it tonight and it came out like water. Went all over me, my leather chair and my wooden floor. Tried the second tube and it was like water also. Unfortunately I had thrown the packaging away, so I can&#x27;t return it. I have the lotion and it is wonderful. Thicker than the cream. I won&#x27;t take a chance with the cream again. Be aware!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think it is any better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried...we&#x27;ll see as I go forward but my daughter swears by it!</li>
            <li> this foot creme is really great. i&#x27;ve used many and this has superior strength, and a great creamy feel. it&#x27;s a&lt;br /&gt;really good product i will use for many years. thanks,  ronnie</li>
            <li> Love it!! It works wonders on my feet. It soothes and moistens without being oily or greasy.</li>
            <li> I liked this foot cream - it was nice and thick, not greasy.  I would recommend this to friends and will buy again. A+++++</li>
            <li> Best product for rough feet.  Expensive but you only need a little and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have had awful feet for years. Dry, cracked, painful heels. I&#x27;ve started using this nightly, and already less than a week later, I can tell a difference. I love that it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and seems to soak in fairly quickly. I am completely sold on this.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff ever! It helps your dry feet like no other. The only thing is that it stinks so just put on socks right away. I give it a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> I have an Amlactin body lotion and I love it. So I decided to try their brand on a foot cream. Though expensive, this stuff really works. I just wish it was in a bigger size for me to use. I suggest putting this cream after a shower or after any water activity sports. It keeps my feet smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> i use this stuff in equal volume with Flexitol Heel Balm daily (Walmart).  My feet are in better shape than with the prescription ammonium lactate products or urea products my GP and dermatologist have prescribed.  Tons cheaper, also.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on foot callouses. Thick and creamy w/o being sticky.</li>
            <li> Good, though expensive.  Next time will likely just opt for the non foot version like last time that was a lot more bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> no more dry flaky skin</li>
            <li> This really does work!</li>
            <li> My daughter told me how she got soft heels after her shower in just one application. When I finally tried it I forgot an important step and didn&#x27;t get the results she got. The next time I remembered to gently use a butter knife to scrape away Amlactin and dead skin after just a minute. Amazing. I had nearly fresh heels and the next time they looked great. I also use same method to get smooth legs. Use a paper towel to clean knife edge as you remove dead skin.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing I have found that keeps my feet from cracking.  Love it!  Will help remove callouses when used twice a day.  Can&#x27;t live without this.</li>
            <li> If you have cracked heels, buy this.  Use it two times a day, wear your socks, and wait.  You will see instant improvement.  I don&#x27;t even have to exfoliate my heels when I use this.</li>
            <li> My skin Dr. reccomended this for my dry heals from wearing sandals and it started working after two uses.  I now tell everyone because I finally found a product that works.</li>
            <li> This product was recommened to me by my doctor.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and found that the skin on my feet is improving.  This product is worth every penny.  I had been recommended another product in the past by a dermatologist that was less than satisfactory.  Hurray for AmLactin.</li>
            <li> Makes the feet feel nice and smooth. The cream is not greasy or sticky.</li>
            <li> I am diabetic and this brand is what my dermatologist recommended I&#x27;ve use this for many years, makes your feet feel soft and very well protected it is not greasy in any way, another thing about this product is you don&#x27;t have to use a lot it goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t have an odor to it like some do another excellent product from AmLactin. Give it a try you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> my doctor suggested this creme to help me with my cracked heels.  i find it greasy - and I gave up after a few greasy days.</li>
            <li> Best over the counter foot product out on the market, hands down! It only took a few days to smooth out my mangled dry cracked feet. I used to stick to the carpet like Velcro, but now I&#x27;m soft and smoooooothe!</li>
            <li> Same as Lac-Hydrin 12 at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> pretty pricey for the amount and I do not see much difference for the other products I use that are similar</li>
            <li> For the past 10 years I have tried to find something to work on my dry, cracked feet.  My dermatologist recommended this, and I&#x27;m so thankful he did.  This foot cream is amazing!  I started using it twice a day, and after a week, my feet no longer are cracked, dry, or irritated.  I now use it once a day to maintain my soft feet.  It&#x27;s also a great value because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff for my feet.  My husband received a prescription for AmLactin after going to the podiatrist for a spur on his heel. Guess the doctor thought he could also use softer feet.  Of course I started using his cream since he only used it about a week and when I ran out I found it here on Amazon. I would definitely buy again--totally worth the money if you want soft feet.</li>
            <li> I have been using regular Amlactin lotion as prescribed by my Podiatrist for  a while now and it worked good but then found this food cream bu them and it is amazing!  very thick cream so you don&#x27;t need much of it.  But it softens calluses great!  My only negative is that it doesn&#x27;t come in a bigger tube t hat I have found.  This is a small 3 oz tube so use it sparingly.  But I use it everyday and my feet have never been so soft!</li>
            <li> Works great!! Only thing I have found that works on my cracked heels. With in a few days of using it morning and night there was a marked difference. Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive and came in a larger tube for the price. Will buy again. Sort of smells like oatmeal...not the nicest smell but I can get over that.</li>
            <li> Absolutely, breaks down dead skin build-up. Makes exfoliation a breeze. Eases the burn of walk/run feet along with the application of &amp;#34;Glide Anti-Chafe Balm&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for the callouses on my feet. It softens them to the point where I can take a buff stone and smooth them down.</li>
            <li> Definitely exfoliated my calluses over time. I didn&#x27;t have really bad cracked feet to begin with. This cream doesn&#x27;t make my feet feel hydrated all day like some cheaper creams do, I assume because it&#x27;s purpose is to eat away dead skin, not just moisturize. Still, works to smooth out feet over time, and my callus peels (using an alkaline callus remover), were VERY effective.</li>
            <li> Someone suggested this cream to fade age spots and it works.  I have a few age spots near my knees from sun exposure and they are definitely less brown after applying a few times a week for about 6 weeks now.</li>
            <li> This is the best foot cream I have ever used, I&#x27;ve had rough heels and  cracked skin for 20 years. I use a foot file daily and have tried Kerasal, Gold Bond, Dr. Schols and every new cream I&#x27;d hear about. I read in a Readers Digest article by podiatrists to use this. I couldn&#x27;t find it where i live so I ordered it online. I am reordering so I don&#x27;t run out. I saw improvement in a few days and my heels are smooth and I can take socks off now without them pulling and sticking like velcro on my rough heels.</li>
            <li> No foot probs here, but this cream has been the first product ever to heal my dry peeling hands. I&#x27;d tried at least a dozen hand creams during the past few years and nothing except steroid prescriptions had helped much. Until AmLactin, a product sometimes recommended for worst-case hands like mine. After only two weeks of twice-daily use, my hands have healed almost completely--just shy of a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish I could find the new fragrance-free version described and pictured here. I&#x27;ve ordered from two of Amazon&#x27;s vendors thus far, and both products received have been the older scented (mildly) version. The same in stores near my home. Wonderful stuff, though, which I&#x27;ll continue to use in whatever version I can find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE, five months later... my hands are now almost completely healthy and as soft as a guy can stand. They do still occasionally become dry but only when I&#x27;m taking some type of medication or supplement that dries me out overall. Otherwise, I&#x27;m good to go with daily use and am once again shaking hands with confidence. I&#x27;m also glad to report that my recent shipments have been the new fragrance-free formula. Just ordered five more tubes.</li>
            <li> Best cream for dry heels I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing, it healed my cracked heels in just a few days!  I even use it for my hands, it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> During summer, flip flops causing the dryness and rough spot on the feet... this thing really helps because it solve the rough spot problem. My feet is nice and soft after using it.</li>
            <li> I truly haven&#x27;t found anything that works better than AmLactin Therapy does, and Preferred Mart was timely and reliable with their delevery of the product.</li>
            <li> More costly than other moisturizers? Yes, but this one WORKS! Recommended by my very fussy sister, I couldn&#x27;t resist. OK my feet are dry and scratchy in winter.  This has both moisturizer and lactic acid which gently solve the problem!  Two times a day is great--before bed and before putting on socks for the day.  I just ordered a triple package.</li>
            <li> This foot cream is really good..! my feet are happy!... I use it every single night! ... my feet are soft. at the beeginning i was doubting because is different from the other ffot creams I tried... you have to use it in the night because if you expose the area to the sunlight you can get sun burned... but in spite of that ... the cream is awesome! totally recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Love this foot cream..really softens the rough spots on your foot and is very non-greasy.  I apply at bedtime and awake with soft feet!</li>
            <li> it is scent free but has a horrid smell that lingers on my hands after applying. I had just as good results with Curel and it absorbed better and has a good smell</li>
            <li> I am on my feet a lot and have a few callouses and heels with a few rough spots but nothing too major.  Was hoping that this would smooth them out when added to my regular pedicures. Well, it didn&#x27;t.  Save your money and get a pumice stone and some coconut oil.</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the best product that I&#x27;ve used on my rough feet in the winter.  I&#x27;d give it 5 stars but I really can&#x27;t stand the way it smells.  After putting it on before bed, I have to wash my hands so that the odor of the cream won&#x27;t be anywhere near my face.  Even so, I will continue to buy it.  It&#x27;s a lot less expensive than a spa pedicure!</li>
            <li> Helped with cracked heels after months of wearing flip flops.  Good product.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t effective for me.</li>
            <li> After wasting money on drug store products that don&#x27;t work I found this cream, recommended by a friend who used it.  This product is the real heal deal.  I noticed a big difference the first time I used it.  I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff on my feet, but also on my &amp;#34;barnacles.&amp;#34;  I have Seborheic Keratosis, sometimes called the &amp;#34;barnacles of old age.&amp;#34; The dermotologist won&#x27;t burn them off as they are benign, but this product flattens them so they are not so apparent.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for extra dry feet. You will see results within a few days. It was recommended to me by a podiatrist. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> We have used this product for about 6 months, having bought it locally the first time.  However, it does not seem to be available at local stores any longer.  It is a great product!  After only a few weeks of use (as directed) my feet are greatly improved.  Much of the hard, calloused areas are gone entirely.  I would recommend it to anyone who has problems with their feet getting cry and cracked, especially in the winter months.  I haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>
            <li> The cream works exactly as advertised.  I bought it instead of refilling a prescription for the same ingredients.  I knew it would work well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem with it is its smell-which reminds me of syrup of ipecac. I didn&#x27;t read a pile of reviews so if someone else pointed this out I missed it.  I won&#x27;t buy this again because of the smell.  I just couldn&#x27;t stop gagging around it (Pavlovian response I guess!)  I&#x27;ll finish off this tube, using only at bedtime then covering hands and feet.  The smell is gone in the morning.</li>
            <li> Product does an amazing job on your feet. I have had dry feet and have tried every product under the sun. This is the best product I have ever used. I have even used this at Christmas and given with fuzzy socks.</li>
            <li> The AmLactin foot cream therapy is unbelievable.  It really does eliminate cracks, callouses and rough patches on the feet in less than ten days.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Does not relieve or diminish dry skin.  Overrated and overpriced.  fraudulent advertising  Woulld never recommend or use again.  Very disappointed..</li>
            <li> My heels have been an embarrassment to me for decades - dry, cracked, peeling (yuck!), no matter what I did. A few years ago, I started a nightly routine of swabbing my heels with Stridex Medicated Pads, letting my heels dry before following up with heavy lotion and cotton socks. This works well but is time-consuming, and I don&#x27;t always want to sleep in socks. Then, on a whim, after my dermatologist recommended AmLactin lotion for my hands, I decided to try AmLactin Foot Cream. It works better than the Stridex routine, and soaks in and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on the sheets when I skip wearing socks. My heels have not been so smooth since I was a kid. No more embarrassment over the appearance of my feet!</li>
            <li> Excellent foot therapy. It made my feet look and feel like a human&#x27;s feet. I am not claiming to be extraterrestrial - it just came out that way.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist, and I must say she was right! It is not greasy, no scent, and makes my feet soooo soft!</li>
            <li> This product is worth every Dollar. As promised it relieves dry feet and moisturizes them when used as directed. Repairs cracked heels, leaving them smooth so they don&#x27;t fray over the sheets at night. Also a little goes a long way, the tube lasts me 3 to 4 months. Thumbs up on this one!!!!  [[ASIN:B0024GT9NC AmLactin Foot Cream Therapy (3 oz)]]</li>
            <li> I love this cream and it did really work on my very cracked heels. But it is such a small tube that it didn&#x27;t last for very long.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  Have to use it more regularly than I do currently.  However, it does a good job when you do use it.</li>
            <li> My heels can get to feeling as rough and scratchy as my labradoodle&#x27;s foot pads but this stuff really softens them.  This brand was actually recommend to my husband by his podiatrist so I thought I would try it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is great to use between pedicure visits, makes it easier for the technician too.....she doesn&#x27;t have to bring out the cheese grater file anymore.</li>
            <li> This product was purchased, along with the Emjoi Micro-Pedi, as a Christmas gift for my husband.  He said both products work well and he is happy with the results.  I gave it only 4 stars simply becasue I,personally, have not used it yet and can&#x27;t make a claim.</li>
            <li> I had really rough, cracked heels.  This stuff is A-MAZING!!  Especially if you use it consistently.  My heels have never looked and felt smoother !</li>
            <li> This is the first over the counter product that has actually helped my dishydrosis. I only wish it came in a larger size.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist. Seems good so far. A little pricy but if it works it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This was a recommendation by my Podiatrist.  It is a great product.  I recommend this to customers.  It really helps to soften your heals and other areas of your feet that need extra care.</li>
            <li> Actually, rating should be NA - but am saying &amp;#34;I hate it&amp;#34; - not the product but the fact that it was unavailable when it was in fact advertised as available. Wasted my time.</li>
            <li> This substance is very effective as stated above, used daily on the toes...  It&#x27;s application is such that just the smallest amount spreads to a surprisingly large area...</li>
            <li> Must have tried every cream on the market, tons of flax and fish and other supplements, and finally found a fix for dry, dry, dry heals.  I got a microplane file and file the dry skin on my heels and put this cream on and it is wonderful.  Need to do this about every four days but it I finally have heels I can live with and not be embarrased.</li>
            <li> So far so good. The cream is thick and feels really good going on. I think this cream may work out.</li>
            <li> its not as great as the Amlactin XL but it helps dried cracked feet. I will order it again when needed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using AmLactin Foot Cream Therapy faithfully for about three weeks now, twice a day.  It has softened my feet a bit, but I still have big calluses on my heels that just won&#x27;t go away.  A bit disappointed, but will keep using it until I find something better for my calluses.</li>
            <li> This product had been recommended by a podiatrist and it has really softened my feet as promised. The price and delivery were outstanding.</li>
            <li> I have used so many foot creams and this is by the far the best I have ever used.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve rated this exact product at least a dozen times but Amazon isn&#x27;t saving it for some reason. Annoying. It&#x27;s lotion, it works.</li>
            <li> This product quickly heals any cracks I have on the bottom of my heels.  It&#x27;s not just a moisturizer but something that actually fosters healthy skin.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a better foot or skin cream. After a few days your dry skin will look noticeably better.</li>
            <li> I tried this foot lotion because it got such great reviews. I have been using Miracle Foot cream and really can&#x27;t notice any difference, enough to justify the greater cost.</li>
            <li> I saw this on a segment of the Today show. I have tried so many products that really didn&#x27;t do anything more than just a regular lotion would do. After using this on the rough spots on my feet, I tried it on other areas. I noticed a big difference after only a few days. This is by far the best product I have ever found and I have a lot of other products. It doesn&#x27;t have any perfume, it is a thick cream that goes on nicely, not overly greasy, just a great cream that really does the job. I have no reason to recommend this product other than to let others know there is  a product out there that will really help those dry, cracked heels. Good price too!</li>
            <li> This foot cream helped my chronic dry and peeling feet.  I applied twice a day and saw an improvement in the overall look and feel of my feet.</li>
            <li> since it said it was cream i expected it to be thick, when i first squeezed some out it came rushing out, very watery, i thought it might be because i just received it and it had been in the mail but i waited 2 days and it is still very watery and kinda greasy. if i ever try it again it will be from a store and not online, is it supposed to be this watery??</li>
            <li> Really softens rough spots on feet.</li>
            <li> I really like this foot cream. It has become difficult to find in our local stores so I was happy to find it on Amazon. It is a little pricey but it works well on my dry callous feet.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Getting ready to order more! My feet have never looked so good.Going to Cancun in January and my feet will be ready!!</li>
            <li> Turned my rough feet into baby-soft feet in less than a week.  AmLactin products really do what the manufacturer says they will.</li>
            <li> My mom loved using this on her feet.  She was very much a senior with very tired feet. This helped alot. Thank you. Jan Burn</li>
            <li> This was recommended for dry elbows - it is helping, still a way to go. It has helped my feet.</li>
            <li> The product came as expected and in good time.  The product works great on feet and doesn&#x27;t have any type of bad smell or anything of that sort.</li>
            <li> This is the best foot cream for runners, it was recommended to me by my dermatologist and it met all of my expectations</li>
            <li> Use for cracked heels or cracked hands!  Amazing products!  I have psoriasis it helps .  Use fepoot cream on hands it is wonderful.  Thank you never stop making it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please read update;  Returned did not work for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a coullebof weeks and the calluses are starting to com off</li>
            <li> This stuff seems to work but it really watery. I am not sure if the tube I got was defective but it literally spills out. It&#x27;s messy, but does seem to moisturize. Unfortunately it&#x27;s so watery I went through the entire tube in one week so I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with how well this foot cream works. It softened my heels and helped sooth any cracks. No sticky residue, seems to absorb quickly. I normally put it on at night before bed, let it dry for a minute or two, then I&#x27;m good to go.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Non greasy&lt;br /&gt;No smell&lt;br /&gt;Nice for hands as well.&lt;br /&gt;Was working extremely well until I hurt my back and could no longer apply nightly.</li>
            <li> Ok.. we have all been there when you wear your flip flops all day and then look to see your feet need a little TLC. this is is. Slap some on before bed, put on socks, and BAM wake up with amazing feet in the morning. Smells weird, not great, but results speak for themselves.</li>
            <li> This is the best foot cream I have ever used to keep my feet smooth and soft. I would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Love it :-)</li>
            <li> hasnt changed much for me yet...but the purple pumice thing really rocks! you should try that instead. i&#x27;ll keep y&#x27;all posted on my progress, because I know you cant wait to hear about it.</li>
            <li> This foot cream actually helps keep your skin smooth. I&#x27;ve used a lot of different foot creams and this one has worked the best at keeping my skin smooth. I&#x27;ve also starting using their body lotion and love that as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to have smooth skin again.  Bought for use on my elbows that get very dry and rough. Use sparingly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. As far as I can tell, this product is what stands between me and soft feet. I used it morning and night for about a week and did nothing else. I could start to see and feel the difference in only a few days. It is not terribly harsh and I was happy to spread any remaining lotion on my hands (I have dry hands and thick skin too). There was a slightly noticeable smell, but I only noticed it on my hands if they were near my face, so I wouldn&#x27;t worry about it.  I was very surprised at how effective this was. I actually have soft feet! That being said, you do have to continue to use it on a regular basis, at least daily. I got better results using it twice a day. I would much rather lotion up then have to scrub my feet with a stone daily. I will be ordering my second bottle soon. I do have very very thick and dry skin on my feet, (even hands) and even though this is gentle, it really did work.</li>
            <li> If you have dry, cracked feet, this is the product for you.  My dermatologist recommended this to me and I have been using it since.  It is hard to find in stores but always available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This goes on easy, I put this on first, then heavy cream, and put socks on, a great overnight moisturizing treatment for the feet!!!</li>
            <li> A doctor suggested I try it for foot neuropathy. It seems to help although it is quite expensive, and I have not been able to find it locally.</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of foot products and this is one that is nice, but does not really help with dry skin.  It makes areas of the foot soft that are not rough or calloused.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase one, just to try it out, It really does work, my feet&lt;br /&gt;were very dry, and now they become soft. I will Purchase More.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended AmLactin Foot Cream Therapy for treating my cracked skin at the back of my heel, as nothing else was very effective.  I tried to get this product at several big chain stores as well as local and largest chain pharmacies, to no avail.  I then went on-line and got the product within 2 days from Amazon and have been using it for 2-3 weeks now.  It has been very effective in healing the crack completely and I am continuing to use it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charley&lt;br /&gt;Portland, Oregon</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Helps keep heels soft.  My sister recommended it.  My husband and I both use it now.</li>
            <li> I have not used it long, but so far it isbgreat.</li>
            <li> My hands are extremely dry. I have a type of psoriasis that leaves my hands and feet very dry. This lotion really helps exfoliate the slouchy dry skin off and leaves my hands feeling soft. It absorbs well, leaving no trace of oily or filmy residue. It could use just a hint of fragrance in my opinion, as it has a unique smell but better for sensitive skins this way I suppose.</li>
            <li> Used this product on several occasions and don&#x27;t know if it is much better than any other foot cream with alpha-hydroxy in it.</li>
            <li> I have had a terrible fungus foot problem for years.  I find this foot cream used 2-3 x daily has really helped my feet look so much better.  My dermatologist highly recommended it to me.  I carry it with me wherever I go.</li>
            <li> This is the best foot cream ever.  I will be giving it the x-mas as gifts. I never write reviews but had to this time.</li>
            <li> My daughter told me how much she loved this product. I immediately ordered the product and it was delivered very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I have a habit of running around barefoot, and in time my feet were getting sore and forming callused areas. I appled it&lt;br /&gt;immediately and my feet felt better the next morning. The cream smoothed out dry callused areas on my feet and healed sore&lt;br /&gt;areas quickly especially around my toes. My feet are much softer. I should know for I have been walking on them for 73 years.</li>
            <li> Where I live is super dry...no humidity.  This cream is awesome.  Smells horrible for the first 15 minutes but who cares if the product works.</li>
            <li> I have a cabinet full of foot cream products that say they will solve my rough, dry, gross feet, but this one really works. Like with any cream, use it often, but I found this one to finally make me feel like I can wear flip-flops without embarassement.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love!! Cannot say enough good things about this product. My heels were atrocious. I&#x27;m an avid gardener so I&#x27;m outside A LOT and my heels were really UGLY! They were cracked to the point of bleeding. After a month, I&#x27;m not embarrassed to wear sandals any more! Yaaaay!</li>
            <li> Have been using it for my dry hands for a long time and works great.  This is first time for the foot cream, but quickly saw results in the softness of my feet.</li>
            <li> This is a great cream. I just have to use it consistently. I am hypothyroid and my feet are a mess...but this cream definitely helps.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this based on the other reviews &amp; I had hoped this was going to help w/my dry &amp; cracking heels but alas, for me it was just another cream.  So I&#x27;m still on the hunt for something that will help my wintertime dry feet.</li>
            <li> This is THE stuff if your feet are prone to getting dry and cracked. The best. Must be used pretty regularly.</li>
            <li> A doctor recommended this to treat dry cracked heels. One application already has made a big inprovement.</li>
            <li> I really love this lotion. It&#x27;s the only product that got rid of the dry cracks on my heels. I bought it for my mother, too. I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> great product, doesnt yellow your skin like vaseline, no strong perfumey odor either. callusses disapear, feet get soft, nails look better too!</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff.  My feet have never been so soft or looked so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it is expensive, a little goes a LONG way, so it is well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be a life long customer!</li>
            <li> Bought this along with Conair Fb52 Hydrotherapy Massaging Foot Spa, and Johnson&#x27;s Foot Soap Economy Size 8-Count.  The best foot cream!  I do believe you should only use half a packet of the foot soap for just your feet.  After a 20 minute soak and then a pumice stone, my feet are so soft!  I finish it all off with AmLactin Foot Cream Therapy (3 oz) for the softest feet ever!  After having the hardest calluses ever, you would never know by looking at my feet now!  A must buy combination!!</li>
            <li> This cream is the best for arid climates.  This has been a life saver this winter.  My feet and hands are surviving without cracks and bleeding. I have been using the body lotion and it has kept the itching on the rest of me away.  A great product!  It has a really nice non greasy, creamy feel.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after a couple of months of using this product, I didn&#x27;t see much improvement in preventing calluses.  It does have a slight &amp;#34;sour&amp;#34; smell, but it&#x27;s not too bad. The cream is rich but not too greasy.  I just wished it worked better on preventing the built up of calluses.</li>
            <li> Awesome...  It got rid the thick callusing on my feet as well as the cracking around my toes. You have to use it 2x&#x27;s a day to see results and at the 2 week mark your feet are callus free. At that point you can go to once a day. I also like it for my hands.&lt;br /&gt;Originally you had to ask for this as the pharmacy.</li>
            <li> When I asked my podiatrist about what foot cream she recommended, she immediately wrote down Amlactin for me and I have used it ever since.  It is not always easy to find locally (I usually have to ask for it at the pharmacy counter in Wal-Mart) so I was delighted to find it on Amazon under Prime.  Now I have a regular supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works very well on keeping your feet in condition, and is particularly helpful for those with diabetes.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love the crab but the tube was punctured when I got it.</li>
