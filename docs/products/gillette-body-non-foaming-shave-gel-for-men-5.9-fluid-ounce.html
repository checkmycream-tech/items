            <li>Probably my own fault for not using lotion or whatever, but damnit!</li>
            <li>Smells good too.</li>
            <li>Plus, if you use the auto-subscribe feature, it is a good deal.</li>
            <li>Love the scent, suds well, good value!</li>
            <li>This Body wash is great, its the thicker kind, which created greater lather.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of like how the smell of Axe can be overpowering.</li>
            <li>Id relate it to the kind of scent you&#x27;d find in Nautica or Polo Sport colognes, The \\&quot;blue\\&quot; type colognes.</li>
            <li>The Gillette, applied on a washcloth, felt silky smooth and lathered very nicely.</li>
            <li>Lathers up well, smells great and most importantly it hydrates.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like this body wash better than dove men+care body wash products because it is a thicker formula and creates a nice lather when used with a loofah.</li>
            <li>Honestly this one smells better to me too.</li>
            <li>I liked it immediately because I wash with a loofa, and it was easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it lots.</li>
            <li>I guess this might possibly be OK if you had severely dry/cracked skin and don&#x27;t want any cleaning whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>One of the better body washes that I have found.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most moisturizing soap/body-wash I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>What more do you want?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a great product, I wish they made it for women, with a woman&#x27;s scent!</li>
            <li>and I think it is a better deal than using bar soup.</li>
            <li>I have used this for many years.</li>
            <li>A drop the size of a quarter, produces a very rich, lather, with moisturizing cream in it.</li>
            <li>Gillette Dry Skin Hydrator Body Wash is best.  </li>
            <li>It has a good consistency so that I can lather up my whole body</li>
            <li>, it cleans very well and smells really good after i&#x27;m all showered up.</li>
            <li>It lathers up well and is easy to apply and rinse.</li>
            <li>container is rather easy to use.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong, manly scent but</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>The little manly beads it has feels awesome.</li>
            <li>It just felt comfortable with the cloth gliding effortlessy over every inch of skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes you feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li>One good squirt on washcloth is all you need for complete body coverage.  </li>
            <li>Love this bodywash and bought these consistently while I was deployed to Afghanistan.  </li>
            <li>It also rinses right off leaving a really clean feeling to my skin!</li>
            <li>It keeps me clean.</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t think this is going to be a good wash for those with normal skin because I could imagine it feeling pretty oily/dirty for those people but</li>
            <li>Gets you really clean and doesn&#x27;t leave a smell on you.  </li>
            <li>If you have wimpy skin, or even skin conditions, this soap will get you clean without the need for anti-itch cream.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for men with dry skin.  </li>
            <li>During the winter, my skin drys up pretty easily.</li>
            <li>the other two reviewers here have been using, but this wash is great if you use it in a washcloth or shower ball / loofah.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy it very much.</li>
            <li>that is about all I can say good about this Gillete Dry Skin Hydrator Body Wash.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s just as good for dry skin</li>
            <li>This makes it easy to apply evenly to the whole body.</li>
            <li>this helped treat my oily/dry skin after the first wash!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Gillette dry skin hydrator hits the perfect middle path and is quite economically priced.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>it is easy to control exactly how much you want.</li>
            <li>The smell is okay - better than some of the other gillete products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Seems counter productive right?</li>
            <li>This is the type of smell that makes you feel modern, clean, and confident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My girlfriend is very sensitive to strong smells.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every major brand and most off brands.</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t clean dirt or oil or pretty much anything off.  </li>
            <li>The smell is fresh and clean, very masculine.</li>
            <li>When I first tried this body wash</li>
            <li>The first time I ever used this product it was a gift from my sister in law.  </li>
            <li>Great value and it last a long time.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, the consistency took me aback.</li>
            <li>It can be a nuisance, but not enough to prevent this from being my favorite body wash.</li>
            <li>more, sometimes you get that extra, sometimes not.</li>
            <li>However, there are better products out there that I would use in that case such as a gentle baby product.    </li>
            <li>Boy was I happy, I have pretty dry skin &amp; try to find Body washes which promote dry skin relief.</li>
            <li>It so happens that my skin, unlike the rest of me, is pretty much a wimp.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy whatsoever, cleans dirt and grime just fine, and the other guy must have the most sensitive grout ever in his shower to have this product stain it.</li>
            <li>Most hydrating soaps tend to dry your skin out despite the label.</li>
            <li>If you want a real clean smell Irish spring offers a moisture blast body wash, but it didn&#x27;t have the hydrating power</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to flip open.</li>
            <li>It really does help keep my skin moist, and I like the scent.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot</li>
            <li>I found this to be really yucky.  </li>
            <li>, you get way too much with the slightest squeeze.</li>
            <li>This body wash lathered very well and didn&#x27;t take much to wash my body.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product on Amazon using subscribe and save and the coupon option which came out to a total of $6 with free shipping that&#x27;s $3 a bottle.</li>
            <li>Gillette has a real winner with this product.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t get in my eyes and stays on until I am ready to rinse off.  </li>
            <li>i really like this stuff</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fresh spring time natural scent.</li>
            <li>Rather, it is a opaque light blue colored foam.</li>
            <li>I definitely like this one better than Old Spice&#x27;s offering.</li>
            <li>This product works as advertised and does not dry out my skin like some off brand washes; the fragrance imo is not overwhelming and smells great.</li>
            <li>I just bought this for my husband and after he used it, I touched his back and it was more dry than after any other body wash he has used in many years!</li>
            <li>Not only does it clean well, but it also lathers and hydrates your skin whilst in the shower.</li>
            <li>Dove men&#x27;s body wash added on to my problem of dry skin and old spice body washes were more like (almost)</li>
            <li>My skin used to get really dry and flaky in the winter and now it stays flake free.  </li>
            <li>It is a deep stain, and I will more than likely have to dig out the grout and replace it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely thick and gives a nice lather, don&#x27;t put too much of it on at once (</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I still have to use lotion but its a little better.</li>
            <li>For what it is worth, I have always been of the opinion that this body wash has a very mild scent, especially in comparison to other brands of body wash.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Looks like they&#x27;re finally getting it right when it comes to men&#x27;s skin care products.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t like certain soaps, detergents, and so on; needless to say, finding a good soap</li>
            <li>I have dry and sensitive skin and am always looking for something that gets you feeling squeaking clean without drying out your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kinda expensive, but its so nice on my skin that its completely worth it.</li>
            <li>A small blob used on a shower sponge or bath pouf (yes, real men use bath poufs:)) goes a long way--far further than the more fluid washes out there.  </li>
            <li>tried Dove and Old Spice before I moved on to this.</li>
            <li>I prefer the body washes like this over the straight-up liquid washes since a smaller amount of this type of wash goes a much longer way to lathering up and cleaning yourself.  </li>
            <li>So I went to the store and sniffed each gel, from Axe to Old Spice and whatnot.</li>
            <li>I tried Old Spice once</li>
            <li>and I needed too much thumb strength to pop it open.</li>
            <li>Also doesn&#x27;t work for dry skin that well - had more dry skin after using this compared to a regular old bar of dove soap.</li>
            <li>I live in a dry climate and this product really helps my skin&#x27;s moisture levels.</li>
            <li>A very small amount of gel generates much more lather</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this wash for at least 2 years now, it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find it in regular stores around town; almost everything is becoming that crappy liquid-style body wash that takes half the damn bottle per shower to get the same lathering power as a little teaspoon of this awesome Gillette wash.  </li>
            <li>Ive tried them all from Axe, Old Spice, Irish Spring and Gillette</li>
            <li>Be warned its a thicker type gel, so if you&#x27;re used to the old spice or axe type body washes it will be VERY DIFFERENT when you try it.</li>
            <li>When I sniffed Gillete&#x27;s gel, I was surprised at how it smelled just like Lacoste Essential cologne.</li>

            <li> I still have to use lotion but its a little better.</li>
            <li> For what it is worth, I have always been of the opinion that this body wash has a very mild scent, especially in comparison to other brands of body wash.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Looks like they&#x27;re finally getting it right when it comes to men&#x27;s skin care products.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t like certain soaps, detergents, and so on; needless to say, finding a good soap</li>
            <li> I have dry and sensitive skin and am always looking for something that gets you feeling squeaking clean without drying out your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda expensive, but its so nice on my skin that its completely worth it.</li>
            <li> A small blob used on a shower sponge or bath pouf (yes, real men use bath poufs:)) goes a long way--far further than the more fluid washes out there.  </li>
            <li> tried Dove and Old Spice before I moved on to this.</li>
            <li> I prefer the body washes like this over the straight-up liquid washes since a smaller amount of this type of wash goes a much longer way to lathering up and cleaning yourself.  </li>
            <li> So I went to the store and sniffed each gel, from Axe to Old Spice and whatnot.</li>
            <li> I tried Old Spice once</li>
            <li> and I needed too much thumb strength to pop it open.</li>
            <li> Also doesn&#x27;t work for dry skin that well - had more dry skin after using this compared to a regular old bar of dove soap.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate and this product really helps my skin&#x27;s moisture levels.</li>
            <li> A very small amount of gel generates much more lather</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this wash for at least 2 years now, it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find it in regular stores around town; almost everything is becoming that crappy liquid-style body wash that takes half the damn bottle per shower to get the same lathering power as a little teaspoon of this awesome Gillette wash.  </li>
            <li> Ive tried them all from Axe, Old Spice, Irish Spring and Gillette</li>
            <li> Be warned its a thicker type gel, so if you&#x27;re used to the old spice or axe type body washes it will be VERY DIFFERENT when you try it.</li>
            <li> When I sniffed Gillete&#x27;s gel, I was surprised at how it smelled just like Lacoste Essential cologne.</li>
            <li> I have never experienced such a soothing lather and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a issue with washing myself far more than I need to which leads to dry skin, my body attempts to counter the dryness by releasing oils to my skin which in turn makes me feel dirty, so I end up taking another shower to get rid of the oil..</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the last few gel-type body washes for guys out there (Old Spice used to carry one, but did away with it recently).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a competitive swimmer with dry skin for a really long time, and this is the only stuff that seems to help.</li>
            <li> I could not believe how little of this hydrating wash, goes as far as it does.</li>
            <li> Since I have discovered Gillette Dry Skin Hydrator Body Wash, I can shower daily without making my skin dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> so so strange.</li>
            <li> but it was a sheer wastage since it took a lot of it&#x27;s quantity to generate sufficient lather as compared to any other body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So before you buy this product check some of the other big box wholesale stores</li>
            <li> only other Body wash</li>

            <li> those of us with dry skin or oily skin brought on by over washing, there isn&#x27;t a body wash yet that has treated my skin condition as well as this.</li>
            <li> your like me and dry out like a raisin after a shower this is the ticket.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> When I first tried this body wash I was astonished! Having used practically every other body wash on the market I figured why not try this one too. I have dry and sensitive skin and am always looking for something that gets you feeling squeaking clean without drying out your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Gillette, applied on a washcloth, felt silky smooth and lathered very nicely. It just felt comfortable with the cloth gliding effortlessy over every inch of skin. I have never experienced such a soothing lather and clean feeling. My skin also tells me that this product is a winner. No after shower itch when my skin is dry. Love it!</li>
            <li> The first time I ever used this product it was a gift from my sister in law.  I liked it immediately because I wash with a loofa, and it was easy to apply.  After trying some other brands that were cheaper I&#x27;m back to using Gillette.  It really does help keep my skin moist, and I like the scent.</li>
            <li> I just bought this for my husband and after he used it, I touched his back and it was more dry than after any other body wash he has used in many years! No thanks to this and I bought 2 bottles of it! :( Lame.</li>
            <li> This junk stained my SEALED grout!  It is a deep stain, and I will more than likely have to dig out the grout and replace it.  How in the heck does a body wash stain so bad?  I took all that I bought and threw it in the trash.  Thanks a lot Gillette. &gt;:(</li>
            <li> I have a problem of dry skin, so I have to be careful in my selection of body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Dove and Old Spice before I moved on to this. Dove men&#x27;s body wash added on to my problem of dry skin and old spice body washes were more like (almost) liquid watery body washes which did help me to avoid dry skin but it was a sheer wastage since it took a lot of it&#x27;s quantity to generate sufficient lather as compared to any other body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette dry skin hydrator hits the perfect middle path and is quite economically priced. A very small amount of gel generates much more lather and I don&#x27;t seem to be getting any dry skin.</li>
            <li> Since I have discovered Gillette Dry Skin Hydrator Body Wash, I can shower daily without making my skin dry and flaky. It is the only body wash that I have found that will accomplish this. I love it.</li>
            <li> Great value and it last a long time. I enjoy it very much. It keeps me clean. Love it lots.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the worst body wash I have ever purchased. It leaves a waxy coat on the bottom oh my tub making it so slippery my wife almost broke her neck getting in the tub after I showered. Will not be buying these brand again.</li>
            <li> Seems counter productive right? Use a hydrating body wash on oily skin?  I&#x27;ve had a issue with washing myself far more than I need to which leads to dry skin, my body attempts to counter the dryness by releasing oils to my skin which in turn makes me feel dirty, so I end up taking another shower to get rid of the oil.. a vicious cycle to say the least.  Anyway I bought this one on a wim just to see how it works out and to my surprise this helped treat my oily/dry skin after the first wash! I was thoroughly impressed and now I don&#x27;t feel \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; 12 hours later because of oils that accumulate on my skin, this stuff seemed to help balance it out.  Now I don&#x27;t think this is going to be a good wash for those with normal skin because I could imagine it feeling pretty oily/dirty for those people but those of us with dry skin or oily skin brought on by over washing, there isn&#x27;t a body wash yet that has treated my skin condition as well as this.</li>
            <li> I found this to be really yucky.  It just doesn&#x27;t clean dirt or oil or pretty much anything off.  It feels like I am smearing a layer of blobs of cream around on my body.  It leaves an oily/waxy layer, but it cleans nothing.  It&#x27;s not \\&quot;hydrating\\&quot; -- just greasy-feeling.    I guess this might possibly be OK if you had severely dry/cracked skin and don&#x27;t want any cleaning whatsoever.  However, there are better products out there that I would use in that case such as a gentle baby product.    It does have a strong, manly scent but that is about all I can say good about this Gillete Dry Skin Hydrator Body Wash.</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the last few gel-type body washes for guys out there (Old Spice used to carry one, but did away with it recently).  I prefer the body washes like this over the straight-up liquid washes since a smaller amount of this type of wash goes a much longer way to lathering up and cleaning yourself.  I&#x27;ve been using this wash for at least 2 years now, it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find it in regular stores around town; almost everything is becoming that crappy liquid-style body wash that takes half the damn bottle per shower to get the same lathering power as a little teaspoon of this awesome Gillette wash.  I have no idea what the heck the other two reviewers here have been using, but this wash is great if you use it in a washcloth or shower ball / loofah.  It&#x27;s not greasy whatsoever, cleans dirt and grime just fine, and the other guy must have the most sensitive grout ever in his shower to have this product stain it.</li>
            <li> One of the better body washes that I have found.  Gets you really clean and doesn&#x27;t leave a smell on you.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell that great. Also doesn&#x27;t work for dry skin that well - had more dry skin after using this compared to a regular old bar of dove soap.</li>
            <li> Smells all-right, my wife thought I was wearing cologne.  Seems impossible to get just a little, you get way too much with the slightest squeeze.</li>
            <li> It so happens that my skin, unlike the rest of me, is pretty much a wimp.  It doesn&#x27;t like certain soaps, detergents, and so on; needless to say, finding a good soap is a tedious process, one that involves a bit of scratching.  If you have wimpy skin, or even skin conditions, this soap will get you clean without the need for anti-itch cream.  Smells good too.</li>
            <li> This body wash lathered very well and didn&#x27;t take much to wash my body. The reason I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars is because the scent is a little too overpowering. After showering, the entire bathroom would smell like a &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; smell that would stick around for 15-20 mins. It&#x27;s kind of like how the smell of Axe can be overpowering.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a client &amp; he loves how it works. Smells &amp; feels great! I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Well it&#x27;s a bodywash... However it&#x27;s different as someone else stated it&#x27;s not a liquid, but a soft gel type.&lt;br /&gt;i have been using Gillette Hydrating for roughly 6months now since the pro glide came with a sample.&lt;br /&gt;since i reide in gemany not one px sells this so amazon is where i go. smells great cleans great and makes my kin feel moisturized. i have not had any problem with grout stains, or grimey slippery shower walls, bath tubs etc, the only problem i have with it is its almost always sold out XD...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so if your wanting to try it and haven&#x27;t decided go ahead and buy it, Amazon ships it out superfast</li>
            <li> I receive compliments on the way i smell all the time. Not only does it clean well, but it also lathers and hydrates your skin whilst in the shower.</li>
            <li> Lather Monster!!  Perfect for men.  One good squirt on washcloth is all you need for complete body coverage.  Smells terrific too!</li>
            <li> The quality is badddd!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> So body wash is one of those things I buy whatever is on sale, as it&#x27;s not face soap or shampoo, so who cares, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this when Amazon had the coupon, and received it via Prime two days later. The first time I used it, the consistency took me aback. It&#x27;s a blueish greenish brownish grey color (I know, vague, but don&#x27;t know how to describe it)... the closest thing I can think of is some sort of substance that would come out of a baby&#x27;s mouth or a#$... very odd. It&#x27;s thick and somewhat lumpy. Gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell was obnoxious as well. It&#x27;s like a sour stale smell, and it gets in the air and when I breathe in the shower I can feel it in my throat and nostrils... so so strange. It&#x27;s NOT a pleasant smell or taste. I&#x27;ve never had this issue with any other body wash or soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This product works as advertised and does not dry out my skin like some off brand washes; the fragrance imo is not overwhelming and smells great. I like this body wash better than dove men+care body wash products because it is a thicker formula and creates a nice lather when used with a loofah. I purchased this product on Amazon using subscribe and save and the coupon option which came out to a total of $6 with free shipping that&#x27;s $3 a bottle. Then I when I went shopping at S**&#x27;s Club and they were selling the same product and size in a 3-pack for $6.91 (with tax that&#x27;s: $7.48) $2.49 a bottle. So before you buy this product check some of the other big box wholesale stores you may just find it cheaper...</li>
            <li> I could not believe how little of this hydrating wash, goes as far as it does. A drop the size of a quarter, produces a very rich, lather, with moisturizing cream in it. It cleans so well and never leaves a residue on your skin. The scent is like an expensive men&#x27;s cologne &amp; even the women in my life have asked to use it, when they bathe. I buy two of these per month for about $7 and change and they last well over a month or two in some cases. I like to keep a reserve of it in my home. Gillette has a real winner with this product.</li>
            <li> Lathers up well, smells great and most importantly it hydrates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks like they&#x27;re finally getting it right when it comes to men&#x27;s skin care products.</li>
            <li> My wife loves how this stuff makes me smell.  It lathers up well and is easy to apply and rinse.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have tried a lot of body washes and this is the best. The little manly beads it has feels awesome. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> During the winter, my skin drys up pretty easily. This doesn&#x27;t rehydrate it immediately, but it&#x27;s one of the hygiene products I switched. It&#x27;s definitely thick and gives a nice lather, don&#x27;t put too much of it on at once (which is what the other reviewers tried). I definitely like this one better than Old Spice&#x27;s offering. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that you can still find this cheaper at times during a sale at Target.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands but Gillette Dry Skin Hydrator Body Wash is best.  My skin used to get really dry and flaky in the winter and now it stays flake free.  It has a good consistency so that I can lather up my whole body and it doesn&#x27;t get in my eyes and stays on until I am ready to rinse off.  It also rinses right off leaving a really clean feeling to my skin!</li>
            <li> This has been my standard body wash for a few years now.  A small blob used on a shower sponge or bath pouf (yes, real men use bath poufs:)) goes a long way--far further than the more fluid washes out there.  It cleans well enough for my skin--which is relatively dry--and has never caused me any irritation, including on my face.  I like the smell a lot, and so does my wife.  The only caveat I would note--and the reason for not giving it five stars--is that the product will stain wash cloths, sponges, poufs, etc. a blue color, sort of like liquid fabric softener does.  These will wash out in the washer.  It can be a nuisance, but not enough to prevent this from being my favorite body wash.</li>
            <li> This stuff is like the nectar of the gods. It&#x27;s the most moisturizing soap/body-wash I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s kinda expensive, but its so nice on my skin that its completely worth it. I&#x27;ve tried every major brand and most off brands. Everything else just dries out my skin like crazy. I&#x27;ve been a competitive swimmer with dry skin for a really long time, and this is the only stuff that seems to help. I highly recommend it to everyone I know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. For what it is worth, I have always been of the opinion that this body wash has a very mild scent, especially in comparison to other brands of body wash.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes you feel silky smooth. Best soap ever. I&#x27;ll be buying this from now on. The price is cheaper than Wal Mart. What more do you want?</li>
            <li> This product is great for men with dry skin.  The scent is made foe a man. It&#x27;s such a great product, I wish they made it for women, with a woman&#x27;s scent!</li>
            <li> Great liquid soap with no scent inducing hullicinations.&lt;br /&gt;If your like me and dry out like a raisin after a shower this is the ticket.</li>
            <li> This continues to be a great deal for this product. The product itself works wonderfully and I think it is a better deal than using bar soup.</li>
            <li> Most hydrating soaps tend to dry your skin out despite the label. This one, I feel that effect a bit less. I still have to use lotion but its a little better. The smell is okay - better than some of the other gillete products I&#x27;ve used. Not great though. Would consider buying again.</li>
            <li> I have used this for many years. It&#x27;s definitely made for men. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance. Plus, if you use the auto-subscribe feature, it is a good deal. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This Body wash is great, its the thicker kind, which created greater lather. Gillette usually has coupons for these &amp; on a whim (my cheapness) I picked up 2.  Boy was I happy, I have pretty dry skin &amp; try to find Body washes which promote dry skin relief. This one actually worked! Ive tried them all from Axe, Old Spice, Irish Spring and Gillette is the one I keep coming back to. Not only for the coupons but because it works. The smell is fresh and clean, very masculine. Id relate it to the kind of scent you&#x27;d find in Nautica or Polo Sport colognes, The \\&quot;blue\\&quot; type colognes. If you want a real clean smell Irish spring offers a moisture blast body wash, but it didn&#x27;t have the hydrating power this one does.&lt;br /&gt;The only other Body wash that&#x27;s just as good for dry skin is the Dove for men brand but this one is usually at least a dollar cheaper. Honestly this one smells better to me too. The only reason I took a star off is the inconsistency in sizes. The picture shows x% more, sometimes you get that extra, sometimes not. Its not Amazons fault, its Gillette I never understand why they cant stick with one size.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, if you have dry skin, try this! Be warned its a thicker type gel, so if you&#x27;re used to the old spice or axe type body washes it will be VERY DIFFERENT when you try it.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, suds well, good value!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend is very sensitive to strong smells. (Like man smell)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually I landed on this one, which she approved of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a 4 star because my skin is still damn dry after using (albeit not as dry as bar soap and some other body washes I tried). Probably my own fault for not using lotion or whatever, but damnit! It says hydrator!</li>
            <li> Love this bodywash and bought these consistently while I was deployed to Afghanistan.  However, not that I&#x27;m back, Target and Walmart are cheaper</li>
            <li> i really like this stuff, it cleans very well and smells really good after i&#x27;m all showered up. think i&#x27;ll use it in the morning.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate and this product really helps my skin&#x27;s moisture levels. I also like the smell.</li>
            <li> 4 years ago, I decided to switch from bar soap to bodywash+ lufa combo. So I went to the store and sniffed each gel, from Axe to Old Spice and whatnot. When I sniffed Gillete&#x27;s gel, I was surprised at how it smelled just like Lacoste Essential cologne. It&#x27;s a fresh spring time natural scent. It smells like a forrest and creek with a minty citrus aroma. This is the type of smell that makes you feel modern, clean, and confident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillete&#x27;s bodywash is not a gel, like all the other competitors. Rather, it is a opaque light blue colored foam. This makes it easy to apply evenly to the whole body. As it is already a foam, you don&#x27;t necessary need a lufa to make it sudsy. The foam also doesn&#x27;t uncontrollably flow everywhere when you squeeze it out - it is easy to control exactly how much you want. I hate competitor&#x27;s neon colored gels that look like dish detergent and feel like a cheap motel freebie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container is rather easy to use. It&#x27;s easy to flip open. I tried Old Spice once and I needed too much thumb strength to pop it open.</li>
