            <li>It&#x27;s best to put socks on your feet after putting on the cream in order to make sure it doesn&#x27;t rub off while walking around on carpet or something, though I never had a problem putting it on my feet just before bedtime.&lt;br</li>

            <li>The price when I bought it back in August was $18.45 which was the best price anywhere, online or in stores.  </li>
            <li>I used to buy it at Walmart but for some reason they don&#x27;t seem to carry it any more.</li>
            <li>Works great on skin  for such a good price</li>
            <li>Keeps feet feeling better when used before going to sleep.</li>
            <li>and I all love this foot cream.</li>
            <li>My husband uses it more often and he loves it.</li>
            <li>My husband and I love the product.  </li>
            <li>Really love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Tried another product before using goldbond and I thought it worked OK.</li>
            <li>For better results, apply and then put on socks for 4-8 hours.</li>
            <li>I do honestly love this.</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s FABULOUS!</li>
            <li>And to make it even better, it is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>My favorite foot cream out there.</li>
            <li>Make sure to use it right after you shower for maximum benefit and moisture absorption!!</li>
            <li>Excellent product for dry skin and feet.</li>
            <li>, My feet get some dry and this works great!</li>
            <li>The best medicine for dry, cracked sore feet and heals.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many different products, but none felt as good or worked as well as this!  </li>
            <li>Not much to say about this product, except it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I really like that it smells good and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>and he&#x27;s easily tried over a dozen.  </li>
            <li>This is far away the best and nearly the most economical.</li>
            <li>This product has made a world of difference in my ability to enjoy walking and going without shoes around the house.</li>
            <li>My feet are smooth but not greasy after four days.  </li>
            <li>Does the trick in keeping skin moist and wrinkle free.  </li>
            <li>The 4 pack is really a great value and this is something that I use regularly.  </li>
            <li>I am happy to finally have found a product that I can count on!!</li>
            <li>I love the fact this cream absorbs right into your foot without a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have purchased this product first :)</li>
            <li>Great product as the cream does smoothen the cracks and all the dry skin on my feed and ankles.  </li>
            <li>Now, my feet are comfortable, the skin is soft, there is no pain from cracking, burning skin and my feet look nice.</li>
            <li>fantastic for your feet, it leaves them nice and soft</li>
            <li>This is no different, but got 4 stars because it is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>Nothing special about it.</li>
            <li>So if you want to make your significant other happy when lying in bed get this foot cream</li>
            <li>The Gold Bond Ultimate Healing Foot Cream is exactly what we were looking for and the price is great</li>
            <li>My feet are already soft  and look nice.</li>
            <li>This is seriously the best foot cream I have used.</li>
            <li>The odor dissipates quickly but is yucky while it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li>needless to say she is very happy :)</li>
            <li>It really does do the job for which it is intended, and your feet become more and more soft and supple feeling.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the Gold Bond Ultimate Healing foot cream.  </li>
            <li>have had good result with Gold-Bond hand cream before, so the other day i bought this four-pack of foot cream, and gave it to my wife with a home made coupon for free foot massages...</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, is not greasy and absorbs beautifully.  </li>
            <li>My new job requires me to wear boots and be on my feet most of the day.</li>
            <li>I will shop with them again in the future :)!</li>
            <li>Upon the first use of this cream I noticed a significant improvement in my foot skin.  </li>
            <li>So far, it is the best foot cream I have tried, and I have tried a few.  </li>
            <li>it says it has a fresh scent...</li>
            <li>Far better than some of the jars of grease designed for cracked feet.</li>
            <li>You rub it into your feet and lotion it mostly absorbed in your feet.</li>
            <li>My hands take a real beating day in and day out, I am a salon owner and between my job and my dry cracking/splitting skin, I have tried many products, slept with gloves on my hands, special lotions and potions and although they smell lovely..</li>
            <li>I get monthly pedicures, scrub my feet like every other day with a rasp or electronic scrubber so to be fair</li>
            <li>The price was right.</li>
            <li>Try to rub it no harder than you would stroke a babies cheek :)</li>
            <li>It is greaseless, absorbing into the skin quickly and disappearing soon after application.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t brag enough how great this Gold Bond foot cream is especially for guys.  </li>
            <li>Gold Bond Ultimate Healing Foot cream is quickly absorbed and my feet love it.  </li>
            <li>My heels are now smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>Fast Service - Product is as it was described and pictured!</li>
            <li>These really work!</li>
            <li>I tried many foot and moisturizing creams, even from this same company, that were recommended for diabetics.</li>
            <li>So it gives more lasting relief.</li>
            <li>I put it on at night, put socks on, and when I woke up, my feet felt ten times better.</li>
            <li>I first got it off a drugstore shelf in my area, but then the drugstore stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li>Absorbs pretty fast, doesn&#x27;t leave a very greasy feel (unless you use a ton of it), and has a mild non-offensive smell.</li>
            <li>This is a perfect heavy cream for dry cracked feet.  </li>
            <li>It must be from one of the effective active ingredients.</li>
            <li>Just put a small amount on the problem area every day until your foot is in good condition.  </li>
            <li>You only need a little and it soaks in beautifully.  </li>
            <li>I love this cream, it really cures dry skin.</li>
            <li>my feet just look great after a short time of use and they were all dry and cracked as I frequently run 1/2 marathons</li>
            <li>I will always purchase this particular brand!</li>
            <li>I can honestly say, my hands are only this good when I visit a humid state for a few day, Utah is a dry state.</li>
            <li>Only foot cream that helps my feet stay smooth</li>
            <li>It absorbs fast so I can put it on before bed</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Really Amazon...2 months after my review</li>
            <li>Delivered fast.</li>
            <li>It has worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>What I really like about the product is that it is not greasy.</li>
            <li>there is to say really.</li>
            <li>Makes my feet feel much softer.</li>
            <li>I used it 3 or 4 times the first day, during Christmas break, by New years</li>
            <li>as before I&#x27;d never pay attention to my feet, it&#x27;s a lot more less dry and more</li>
            <li>I tried other foot creams, but this leaves your skin the smoothest and most moisturized</li>
            <li>there is an even better (but much more expensive)</li>
            <li>My feet looked old, dry, cracked, and now they look like they did many years ago, young!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>My choice of it has little to do with price and a lot more to do with its efficacy.</li>
            <li>is selling the same exact product for $4.84!  </li>
            <li>I compared the cost locally and found real savings buying thru Amazon, especially with Amazon Prime free shipping.</li>
            <li>This is a way better deal than in stores and this lotion is so thick and really makes a difference on diabetic feet!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this cream, in a few days I saw results.  </li>
            <li>And what makes it even BETTER, is that it costs less on Amazon as well!</li>
            <li>As a diabetic, I have tried many different foot creams with a wide variety of pricing.</li>
            <li>My wife had a dry patch on her elbow and this Cream healed that quickly</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I saw a difference in the first day or two, and it does work if you use it regularly.</li>
            <li>I have found the &amp;#34;Gold Bond Triple Action Relief&amp;#34; to be a significantly better product than the &amp;#34;Gold Bond Ultimate Healing Foot Cream.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve tried them both and found that Triple Action product absorbs quicker provides longer relief from dryness where the &amp;#34;Ultimate Healing actually dries out the skin with repeated daily use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started using this every day, once in the morning and once in the evening, and in about a week the problem was almost completely solved.  </li>
            <li>but this stuff makes them soooo soft.</li>
            <li>It keeps my feet soft and I even use it on my legs sometimes.</li>
            <li>Soft feet by morning.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft</li>
            <li>and my girlfriend can&#x27;t believe how soft my feet are now.  </li>
            <li>This product is the ticket to having soft feet.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing a lot more walking as of late.  </li>
            <li>Within a week, it was completely healed.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like lotions that don&#x27;t absorb completely into your skin.</li>
            <li>Our feet are soft and well cared for.  </li>
            <li>Use it after every shower and my feet are soft.</li>
            <li>Between that and the hot weather where I live, it&#x27;s rough on my feet.  </li>
            <li>This lotion does not leave a residue and just sinks right in to my feet.  </li>
            <li>On application, its slightly greasier than the equivalent Gold Bond hand cream, but that quickly goes away.  </li>
            <li>In the month that I have been using this product my feet are almost back to normal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had certain presistent dry areas before I tried this cream.</li>
            <li>Out daughter doesn&#x27;t live at home, so I don&#x27;t know her practices with it, but she recently dogsat when we went away several days and, when we got home, our creams were all moved to different places, so we know she certainly used it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The soles of the feet tend to be rather desensitized (the thickest skin), but for most people the arch of the foot is very delicate and sensitive.</li>
            <li>It really works on dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have used this cream for year and it really works on dry cracked skin.</li>
            <li>I find this cream to be very moisturizing for my dry feet.  </li>
            <li>They soften my feet like no other product.</li>
            <li>Curel foot cream is acceptable (I love Curel hand cream!), and again while I like Neutrogena for hands, the foot cream makes my feet feel sticky and uncomfortable in the sheets.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easy, doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but tubes go by very quickly.</li>
            <li>Ive always believed in GOLD BOND PRODUCTS but this went far beyond my expectations after only one application.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used kerasal, cetaphil body cream, tea tree oil mint foot cream by earth therapeutics, honey heel glaze by farm fresh goods to name a few.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve lived in some pretty lame dry places and tried many foot creams.</li>
            <li>Have been using it for the last year and a half, ever since I first tried it.</li>
            <li>I am a loyal Amazon customer but until Amazon adjusts their price to be at least competitive with Walmart</li>

            <li> my feet are in really good condition.</li>
            <li> I could not believe that this lotion was as good as everyone said, but it is.</li>
            <li> I have nothing but good to say about this product.  </li>
            <li> Awesome stuff and totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product nightly before going to bed and she&#x27;s very pleased with the results.  </li>

            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re getting into summer and my wife loves to wear flip-flops or go barefoot, showing off her cute nails!</li>

            <li> then that is where I will be purchasing this amazing cream.  </li>
            <li> NOT with this amazing Gold Bond product.  </li>

            <li> Gold Bond product, &amp;#34;Gold Bond Ultimate Diabetic Skin Relief Skin Protectant Foot Cream&amp;#34; which is the best foot cream product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>

            <li> I WISH they would change the scent so I could use it on more than just my feet.</li>
            <li> If ur heals r too chapped it won&#x27;t do magic.</li>
            <li> This Gold Bond Ultimate Healing Foot Cream is wonderful!  </li>
            <li> I love this foot cream.  </li>
            <li> seems to revive my feet even better, the skin feels better too.</li>
            <li> The price when I bought it back in August was $18.45 which was the best price anywhere, online or in stores.  </li>
            <li> I used to buy it at Walmart but for some reason they don&#x27;t seem to carry it any more.</li>
            <li> Works great on skin  for such a good price</li>
            <li> Keeps feet feeling better when used before going to sleep.</li>
            <li> and I all love this foot cream.</li>
            <li> My husband uses it more often and he loves it.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love the product.  </li>
            <li> Really love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Tried another product before using goldbond and I thought it worked OK.</li>
            <li> For better results, apply and then put on socks for 4-8 hours.</li>
            <li> I do honestly love this.</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s FABULOUS!</li>
            <li> And to make it even better, it is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> My favorite foot cream out there.</li>
            <li> Make sure to use it right after you shower for maximum benefit and moisture absorption!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product for dry skin and feet.</li>
            <li> , My feet get some dry and this works great!</li>
            <li> The best medicine for dry, cracked sore feet and heals.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many different products, but none felt as good or worked as well as this!  </li>
            <li> Not much to say about this product, except it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I really like that it smells good and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> and he&#x27;s easily tried over a dozen.  </li>
            <li> This is far away the best and nearly the most economical.</li>
            <li> This product has made a world of difference in my ability to enjoy walking and going without shoes around the house.</li>
            <li> My feet are smooth but not greasy after four days.  </li>
            <li> Does the trick in keeping skin moist and wrinkle free.  </li>
            <li> The 4 pack is really a great value and this is something that I use regularly.  </li>
            <li> I am happy to finally have found a product that I can count on!!</li>
            <li> I love the fact this cream absorbs right into your foot without a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have purchased this product first :)</li>
            <li> Great product as the cream does smoothen the cracks and all the dry skin on my feed and ankles.  </li>
            <li> Now, my feet are comfortable, the skin is soft, there is no pain from cracking, burning skin and my feet look nice.</li>
            <li> fantastic for your feet, it leaves them nice and soft</li>
            <li> This is no different, but got 4 stars because it is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about it.</li>
            <li> So if you want to make your significant other happy when lying in bed get this foot cream</li>
            <li> The Gold Bond Ultimate Healing Foot Cream is exactly what we were looking for and the price is great</li>
            <li> My feet are already soft  and look nice.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best foot cream I have used.</li>
            <li> The odor dissipates quickly but is yucky while it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li> needless to say she is very happy :)</li>
            <li> It really does do the job for which it is intended, and your feet become more and more soft and supple feeling.  </li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the Gold Bond Ultimate Healing foot cream.  </li>
            <li> have had good result with Gold-Bond hand cream before, so the other day i bought this four-pack of foot cream, and gave it to my wife with a home made coupon for free foot massages...</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, is not greasy and absorbs beautifully.  </li>
            <li> My new job requires me to wear boots and be on my feet most of the day.</li>
            <li> I will shop with them again in the future :)!</li>
            <li> Upon the first use of this cream I noticed a significant improvement in my foot skin.  </li>
            <li> So far, it is the best foot cream I have tried, and I have tried a few.  </li>
            <li> it says it has a fresh scent...</li>
            <li> Far better than some of the jars of grease designed for cracked feet.</li>
            <li> You rub it into your feet and lotion it mostly absorbed in your feet.</li>
            <li> My hands take a real beating day in and day out, I am a salon owner and between my job and my dry cracking/splitting skin, I have tried many products, slept with gloves on my hands, special lotions and potions and although they smell lovely..</li>
            <li> I get monthly pedicures, scrub my feet like every other day with a rasp or electronic scrubber so to be fair</li>
            <li> The price was right.</li>
            <li> Try to rub it no harder than you would stroke a babies cheek :)</li>
            <li> It is greaseless, absorbing into the skin quickly and disappearing soon after application.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t brag enough how great this Gold Bond foot cream is especially for guys.  </li>
            <li> Gold Bond Ultimate Healing Foot cream is quickly absorbed and my feet love it.  </li>
            <li> My heels are now smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> Fast Service - Product is as it was described and pictured!</li>
            <li> These really work!</li>
            <li> I tried many foot and moisturizing creams, even from this same company, that were recommended for diabetics.</li>
            <li> So it gives more lasting relief.</li>
            <li> I put it on at night, put socks on, and when I woke up, my feet felt ten times better.</li>
            <li> I first got it off a drugstore shelf in my area, but then the drugstore stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li> Absorbs pretty fast, doesn&#x27;t leave a very greasy feel (unless you use a ton of it), and has a mild non-offensive smell.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect heavy cream for dry cracked feet.  </li>
            <li> It must be from one of the effective active ingredients.</li>
            <li> Just put a small amount on the problem area every day until your foot is in good condition.  </li>
            <li> You only need a little and it soaks in beautifully.  </li>
            <li> I love this cream, it really cures dry skin.</li>
            <li> my feet just look great after a short time of use and they were all dry and cracked as I frequently run 1/2 marathons</li>
            <li> I will always purchase this particular brand!</li>
            <li> I can honestly say, my hands are only this good when I visit a humid state for a few day, Utah is a dry state.</li>
            <li> Only foot cream that helps my feet stay smooth</li>
            <li> It absorbs fast so I can put it on before bed</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Really Amazon...2 months after my review</li>
            <li> Delivered fast.</li>
            <li> It has worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> What I really like about the product is that it is not greasy.</li>
            <li> there is to say really.</li>
            <li> Makes my feet feel much softer.</li>
            <li> I used it 3 or 4 times the first day, during Christmas break, by New years</li>
            <li> as before I&#x27;d never pay attention to my feet, it&#x27;s a lot more less dry and more</li>
            <li> I tried other foot creams, but this leaves your skin the smoothest and most moisturized</li>
            <li> there is an even better (but much more expensive)</li>
            <li> My feet looked old, dry, cracked, and now they look like they did many years ago, young!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My choice of it has little to do with price and a lot more to do with its efficacy.</li>
            <li> is selling the same exact product for $4.84!  </li>
            <li> I compared the cost locally and found real savings buying thru Amazon, especially with Amazon Prime free shipping.</li>
            <li> This is a way better deal than in stores and this lotion is so thick and really makes a difference on diabetic feet!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this cream, in a few days I saw results.  </li>
            <li> And what makes it even BETTER, is that it costs less on Amazon as well!</li>
            <li> As a diabetic, I have tried many different foot creams with a wide variety of pricing.</li>
            <li> My wife had a dry patch on her elbow and this Cream healed that quickly</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I saw a difference in the first day or two, and it does work if you use it regularly.</li>
            <li> I have found the &amp;#34;Gold Bond Triple Action Relief&amp;#34; to be a significantly better product than the &amp;#34;Gold Bond Ultimate Healing Foot Cream.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve tried them both and found that Triple Action product absorbs quicker provides longer relief from dryness where the &amp;#34;Ultimate Healing actually dries out the skin with repeated daily use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started using this every day, once in the morning and once in the evening, and in about a week the problem was almost completely solved.  </li>
            <li> but this stuff makes them soooo soft.</li>
            <li> It keeps my feet soft and I even use it on my legs sometimes.</li>
            <li> Soft feet by morning.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft</li>
            <li> and my girlfriend can&#x27;t believe how soft my feet are now.  </li>
            <li> This product is the ticket to having soft feet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing a lot more walking as of late.  </li>
            <li> Within a week, it was completely healed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like lotions that don&#x27;t absorb completely into your skin.</li>
            <li> Our feet are soft and well cared for.  </li>
            <li> Use it after every shower and my feet are soft.</li>
            <li> Between that and the hot weather where I live, it&#x27;s rough on my feet.  </li>
            <li> This lotion does not leave a residue and just sinks right in to my feet.  </li>
            <li> On application, its slightly greasier than the equivalent Gold Bond hand cream, but that quickly goes away.  </li>
            <li> In the month that I have been using this product my feet are almost back to normal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had certain presistent dry areas before I tried this cream.</li>
            <li> Out daughter doesn&#x27;t live at home, so I don&#x27;t know her practices with it, but she recently dogsat when we went away several days and, when we got home, our creams were all moved to different places, so we know she certainly used it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The soles of the feet tend to be rather desensitized (the thickest skin), but for most people the arch of the foot is very delicate and sensitive.</li>
            <li> It really works on dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for year and it really works on dry cracked skin.</li>
            <li> I find this cream to be very moisturizing for my dry feet.  </li>
            <li> They soften my feet like no other product.</li>
            <li> Curel foot cream is acceptable (I love Curel hand cream!), and again while I like Neutrogena for hands, the foot cream makes my feet feel sticky and uncomfortable in the sheets.  </li>
            <li> Goes on easy, doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but tubes go by very quickly.</li>
            <li> Ive always believed in GOLD BOND PRODUCTS but this went far beyond my expectations after only one application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used kerasal, cetaphil body cream, tea tree oil mint foot cream by earth therapeutics, honey heel glaze by farm fresh goods to name a few.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lived in some pretty lame dry places and tried many foot creams.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for the last year and a half, ever since I first tried it.</li>
            <li> I am a loyal Amazon customer but until Amazon adjusts their price to be at least competitive with Walmart</li>
            <li> Even though I get pedicures regularly, my feet tend to dry out and harden, especially in the winter months.  </li>
            <li> If you use daily you will never have a problem with dry scaly heels.  </li>
            <li> I have dry feet, foot pain from various causes and calluses.</li>
            <li> My feet were heavily calloused, especially the heels and with a buffer made by Tweezerman and Gold Bond&#x27;s cream they are now baby soft.  </li>
            <li> Four 4oz tubes of this cost about the same as a single 3oz tube of another brand that worked, but not as well as the Gold Bond.</li>
            <li> The moisturizers are awesome and used regularly I can avoid the very painful excessive dryness and cracking on my feet.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t need to use it everyday, just a little bit every few days as needed, and my feet are fine.  </li>
            <li> As the old &amp;#34;Brylcream&amp;#34; ad said: &amp;#34;A little dab will do you...</li>
            <li> I noticed that my feet seemed to be drier than usual, probably because I&#x27;m getting older, and the bottom of my feet would get hard so fast.</li>
            <li> Used daily, Gold Bond foot cream really helps the skin on my feet from getting tough; especially my heals.</li>
            <li> I wear sandals and flip flops nearly year round</li>
            <li> After several applications, the rough spots on my feet disappeared.</li>
            <li> I have noticed the same odor with other foot creams.</li>
            <li> I also use this on other dry spots, such as my elbows or hands.</li>
            <li> I have had problem skin for a very long time, over 40 years</li>
            <li> My feet get so dry</li>
            <li> Although I get pedicures, I am cursed with dry, cracked feet.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t dry them at all.</li>
            <li> I had extremely dry, cracked, calloused feet.</li>
            <li> For as long as I can remember, my feet have been rough with callouses.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has dry, rough feet.</li>
            <li> My father is a diabetic and his feet get very dry and cracked.  </li>
            <li> In just a short few days the dry skin/cracks are gone.  </li>
            <li> So it needs to be continued in those dry and other areas of concern.</li>
            <li> This lotion may be a little expensive but the benefits are so worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Mine are now as pink as a babies bottom.  </li>
            <li> Didnt work as i expected, i would say avrg.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m diabetic and have to carefully care for my feet.</li>
            <li> It only took a few days for the product to kick in.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> Was in the military for about 8 years and my feet were tore up from wearing boots all the time.</li>
            <li> but other foot creams seem to work just as well.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a ton of other products and to NO avail.  </li>
            <li> My husband and daughter both have recurring athlete&#x27;s foot and other fungal type foot problems.</li>
            <li> GBUH foot cream has worked extremely well for me.</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble with dry skin on my feet, so I have tried just about every product on the market.</li>
            <li> Gold Bond Ultimate Healing Foot Cream and hard to get in stores in our area.</li>
            <li> I use it at least three times per week, especially at night.  </li>
            <li> They hurt a lot less when I apply it twice a day, once in the morning before work, and once at night before bed.</li>
            <li> As a cream it is thicker that the lotion I previously used.</li>
            <li> It helps a little bit.</li>
            <li> They get rough and hard to walk on.</li>
            <li> Being an athlete and playing baseball/softball, tennis, golf, and umpiring and refereeing basketball, football and baseball only made the problems worse.</li>
            <li> I received this product a few days ago and I can see the results already.</li>
            <li> Heels can get dry and broken down.</li>
            <li> it is not worth $7.50 a tube!!  </li>
            <li> It was a large painful crack.</li>
            <li> I may be a little slow ( I just came across this gem about 4 weeks ago)</li>
            <li> Too often, I would officiate a game and then drive home for an hour in wet socks.</li>
            <li> As a Type 2 Diabetes person, I suffered from small, paper-like cuts on the bottom of my feet.</li>
            <li> I have used the foot cream in the past, but I find the cream with CoQ10 in it</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t need expensive products for the same results.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than where I usually buy it.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t believe in all these online reviews about products, but I gotta say,</li>
            <li> Yes I&#x27;m a guy, so I&#x27;m very tough on my feet, if I don&#x27;t use this cream they are all cracked, sore, and the skin is actually discolored.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, going barefoot tends to dry out the soles of her feet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It IS hard to get in stores</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as thick and doesn&#x27;t do the job as well on the thicker skin on your feet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more sandpaper feet!  </li>
            <li> It does smell weird though (bad), but who cares, it does the trick, fast !</li>
            <li> But in less than 3 months the price has jumped to $29.99!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For diabetics (or anyone else who is driven crazy by dry skin)</li>
            <li> I had really bad heels with very deep cracks splitting them.  </li>
            <li> I expected this to be a disappointment, and it&#x27;seems not.  </li>

            <li> I had really bad heels with very deep cracks splitting them.  It was quite painful at times.  I started using this every day, once in the morning and once in the evening, and in about a week the problem was almost completely solved.  My heels are now smooth and soft.  No scrubbing, no scraping, no graters or anything like that.  Just put a small amount on the problem area every day until your foot is in good condition.  Now I don&#x27;t need to use it everyday, just a little bit every few days as needed, and my feet are fine.  It&#x27;s best to put socks on your feet after putting on the cream in order to make sure it doesn&#x27;t rub off while walking around on carpet or something, though I never had a problem putting it on my feet just before bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all is the price.  Four 4oz tubes of this cost about the same as a single 3oz tube of another brand that worked, but not as well as the Gold Bond.</li>
            <li> Fast Service - Product is as it was described and pictured! I will shop with them again in the future :)!</li>
            <li> Only foot cream that helps my feet stay smooth</li>
            <li> I have found the &amp;#34;Gold Bond Triple Action Relief&amp;#34; to be a significantly better product than the &amp;#34;Gold Bond Ultimate Healing Foot Cream.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve tried them both and found that Triple Action product absorbs quicker provides longer relief from dryness where the &amp;#34;Ultimate Healing actually dries out the skin with repeated daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For diabetics (or anyone else who is driven crazy by dry skin) there is an even better (but much more expensive) Gold Bond product, &amp;#34;Gold Bond Ultimate Diabetic Skin Relief Skin Protectant Foot Cream&amp;#34; which is the best foot cream product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I am diabetic and would not be without this cream.  If you use daily you will never have a problem with dry scaly heels.  Mine are now as pink as a babies bottom.  When I started using my heels were cracked and bleeding and were very painful.</li>
            <li> My feet get so dry but this stuff makes them soooo soft. Going 3 weeks w/o a pedicure is no problem. It keeps my feet soft and I even use it on my legs sometimes. It absorbs fast so I can put it on before bed and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m sticking to the sheets. Make sure to use it right after you shower for maximum benefit and moisture absorption!! And make sure you get the FOOT cream. I tried to substitute it with regular Gold Bond (thinking that it wouldn&#x27;t be much different) but it is. It&#x27;s not as thick and doesn&#x27;t do the job as well on the thicker skin on your feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said......it says it has a fresh scent...but it has this god awful smell. It smells like hippies. I WISH they would change the scent so I could use it on more than just my feet. WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!</li>
            <li> As a diabetic, I have tried many different foot creams with a wide variety of pricing. This is far away the best and nearly the most economical. My choice of it has little to do with price and a lot more to do with its efficacy.</li>
            <li> Great product as the cream does smoothen the cracks and all the dry skin on my feed and ankles.  I use this every morning and it does the job, as before I&#x27;d never pay attention to my feet, it&#x27;s a lot more less dry and more smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic product, will definitely buy again when it runs out.</li>
            <li> These really work! They soften my feet like no other product.</li>
            <li> Best foot cream I have ever used. Far better than some of the jars of grease designed for cracked feet. This product works and works very good. Both my wife and I use this on our feet and if you put it on every morning and every night, all cracks disappear. This is the only foot cream I will use and I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li> Didnt work as i expected, i would say avrg. If ur heals r too chapped it won&#x27;t do magic. It helps a little bit.</li>
            <li> this is a GREAT money saver</li>
            <li> This Gold Bond Ultimate Healing Foot Cream is wonderful!  So far, it is the best foot cream I have tried, and I have tried a few.  Now I&#x27;m sticking with this one.  It really does do the job for which it is intended, and your feet become more and more soft and supple feeling.  I use it every night before going to bed.</li>
            <li> Heels can get dry and broken down. They get rough and hard to walk on. This stuff works terrific when used on the heel and the bottom of the foot.</li>
            <li> Used daily, Gold Bond foot cream really helps the skin on my feet from getting tough; especially my heals. I compared the cost locally and found real savings buying thru Amazon, especially with Amazon Prime free shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this foot cream.  I put it on my feet every night before bed.  You only need a little and it soaks in beautifully.  Soft feet by morning.  I put it on my heels and between my toes.</li>
            <li> I actually use this on my hands.  On application, its slightly greasier than the equivalent Gold Bond hand cream, but that quickly goes away.  Does a great job.</li>
            <li> I wish I had known about this product sooner. I have had skin problems with my feet off and on for decades, since being in Southeast Asia in the 1970s. Being an athlete and playing baseball/softball, tennis, golf, and umpiring and refereeing basketball, football and baseball only made the problems worse. Too often, I would officiate a game and then drive home for an hour in wet socks. By the time I got home, my feet were in bad shape. I could never find a product that would relieve the pain and itching without burning like alcohol in an open wound. Then, I discovered Gold Bond Ultimate Healing Foot Cream. It is greaseless, absorbing into the skin quickly and disappearing soon after application. A short time after applying it, I an walk barefoot across the floor with no noticable residue. I used to have such thick callouses on my feet that they looked awful. Now, my feet are comfortable, the skin is soft, there is no pain from cracking, burning skin and my feet look nice. This product has made a world of difference in my ability to enjoy walking and going without shoes around the house.</li>
            <li> As a Type 2 Diabetes person, I suffered from small, paper-like cuts on the bottom of my feet. The pain was pretty awful. I tried many foot and moisturizing creams, even from this same company, that were recommended for diabetics. After applying them 2 or 3 times a day over the course of a year or so I had given up hope until I tried this product. It is just great, smells good too.</li>
            <li> I bought several of these.  I keep avtube in my suitcase and the size is perfect and doesn&#x27;t take up too much room.  I keep a tube by the bed and I use it every night at bedtime.</li>
            <li> Product the best by far for feet..Gold Bond Ultimate Healing Foot Cream and hard to get in stores in our area.</li>
            <li> I have used the foot cream in the past, but I find the cream with CoQ10 in it seems to revive my feet even better, the skin feels better too. They hurt a lot less when I apply it twice a day, once in the morning before work, and once at night before bed. Yes I&#x27;m a guy, so I&#x27;m very tough on my feet, if I don&#x27;t use this cream they are all cracked, sore, and the skin is actually discolored. (no explanation from the skin doc) but the restoring cream helps.</li>
            <li> Great. I love this cream, it really cures dry skin. Does not leave a greasy feeling either. Leaves skin soft</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this foot cream for almost 2 weeks and I love it!!! My feet are already soft  and look nice. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My father is a diabetic and his feet get very dry and cracked.  This product works the best out of all the foot products we have bought for him.</li>
            <li> For as long as I can remember, my feet have been rough with callouses.  I have tried several different lotions; however, this is the only one I have found that has worked.  My feet are smooth but not greasy after four days.  I buff my feet at night, put lotion on, and then put on socks.</li>
            <li> I use GB Ultimate Healing, Foot Cream regularly on my lower legs and feet. I&#x27;m diabetic and have to carefully care for my feet. This is soothing and moisturizing. I&#x27;ve had certain presistent dry areas before I tried this cream. Using it just 2 days a week they were gone by the second week and have stayed away. As a cream it is thicker that the lotion I previously used. So it gives more lasting relief. My wife had a dry patch on her elbow and this Cream healed that quickly so she quite using it. The dryness came back. So it needs to be continued in those dry and other areas of concern. As the old &amp;#34;Brylcream&amp;#34; ad said: &amp;#34;A little dab will do you...&amp;#34;  I will continue to use this as will my wife, and can hardily recommend it.</li>
            <li> I got it for my wife, She said that it is O.K. but other foot creams seem to work just as well. Nothing special about it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t brag enough how great this Gold Bond foot cream is especially for guys.  I have been using it for 2 months now and my girlfriend can&#x27;t believe how soft my feet are now.  No more sandpaper feet!  So if you want to make your significant other happy when lying in bed get this foot cream now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT...The price when I bought it back in August was $18.45 which was the best price anywhere, online or in stores.  But in less than 3 months the price has jumped to $29.99!!! If I&#x27;m not mistaken that is a 63% increase!! I&#x27;m sorry but as much as I love this stuff it is not worth $7.50 a tube!!  So I decided to check prices again online and in stores and low and behold Walmart is selling the same exact product for $4.84!  I am a loyal Amazon customer but until Amazon adjusts their price to be at least competitive with Walmart then that is where I will be purchasing this amazing cream.  Sorry Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 11/30/13.  Really Amazon...2 months after my review and you raised the price...again by 38 cents!  I can still buy it at Walmart for $4.84 a tube, at that price I can buy 6 tubes (and have some change left over) versus 4 tubes here.  You need to find where Walmart buys it from because you are being ripped off by your distributors, or your trying to rip us off.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY lotion I use on my feet. It even transforms my dad&#x27;s scales, which is saying a lot!</li>
            <li> Great product with the ability to pick from several PRICE packages to make sure you get the very best price on your order</li>
            <li> This product is the ticket to having soft feet.  I wear sandals and flip flops nearly year round and my feet suffer from dryness, but NOT with this amazing Gold Bond product.  I highly recommend it.  I have purchased a ton of other products and to NO avail.  I wish I would have purchased this product first :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lived in some pretty lame dry places and tried many foot creams. This one is the best by far. I&#x27;ve used kerasal, cetaphil body cream, tea tree oil mint foot cream by earth therapeutics, honey heel glaze by farm fresh goods to name a few. I get monthly pedicures, scrub my feet like every other day with a rasp or electronic scrubber so to be fair my feet are in really good condition. This is about as good as the original formulation of kerasal.</li>
            <li> Gold Bond made my skin look healthier and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;Great product &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> Wow!  I&#x27;ve been doing a lot more walking as of late.  Between that and the hot weather where I live, it&#x27;s rough on my feet.  This cream works incredibly well.  My wife grabbed it and used it twice.  Once in the morning and once before bed.  The next morning she exclaimed about how well it was working on her feet after just the one day of use.</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble with dry skin on my feet, so I have tried just about every product on the market. This one is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I used to buy it at Walmart but for some reason they don&#x27;t seem to carry it any more. I was THRILLED to find it at Amazon! And what makes it even BETTER, is that it costs less on Amazon as well! I will not be without this lotion. It&#x27;s the BEST!</li>
            <li> Delivered fast. Works great on skin  for such a good price you don&#x27;t need expensive products for the same results. I will keep using this product.</li>
            <li> Absorbs pretty fast, doesn&#x27;t leave a very greasy feel (unless you use a ton of it), and has a mild non-offensive smell. I also use this on other dry spots, such as my elbows or hands.</li>
            <li> It really works on dry skin.</li>
            <li> I could not believe that this lotion was as good as everyone said, but it is. I saw a difference in the first day or two, and it does work if you use it regularly.</li>
            <li> Keeps feet feeling better when used before going to sleep.</li>
            <li> My husband, grown daughter and I all love this foot cream. My husband and daughter both have recurring athlete&#x27;s foot and other fungal type foot problems. I have dry feet, foot pain from various causes and calluses. This cream works for all of us, so I placed a bulk order. I don&#x27;t use it as often as they do - I find a couple times a week rids me of the calluses and skin splintering. My husband uses it more often and he loves it. Out daughter doesn&#x27;t live at home, so I don&#x27;t know her practices with it, but she recently dogsat when we went away several days and, when we got home, our creams were all moved to different places, so we know she certainly used it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is a way better deal than in stores and this lotion is so thick and really makes a difference on diabetic feet!</li>
            <li> It performs as advertised compared to others with the same claim. I plan to continue to use this product in the future.</li>
            <li> Best cream that I purchased for the price.  Does the trick in keeping skin moist and wrinkle free.  Use it on hands as well as it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
            <li> Works well but I don&#x27;t like the smell. The odor dissipates quickly but is yucky while it&#x27;s there. I have noticed the same odor with other foot creams. It must be from one of the effective active ingredients.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for dry skin and feet. It has worked very well for me. It only took a few days for the product to kick in.</li>
            <li> GBUH foot cream has worked extremely well for me. My feet look and feel great. I use this product every day.</li>
            <li> This is a repurchase which I would recommend to anyone wish to keep their feet moisturized</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for year and it really works on dry cracked skin. I use it on my hands, feet and elbows. Last month the skin on my thumb cracked open. It was a large painful crack. I put this cream on it and I could feel it heal the crack. Within 2 or 3 day the crack was healing and closing. Within a week, it was completely healed. I highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> The Gold Bond Ultimate Healing Foot Cream is exactly what we were looking for and the price is great Thank You</li>
            <li> I received this product a few days ago and I can see the results already. What I really like about the product is that it is not greasy. You rub it into your feet and lotion it mostly absorbed in your feet. Then you rub your hands together to absorb any left over and they get some TLC as well. I don&#x27;t like lotions that don&#x27;t absorb completely into your skin. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> This is the only cream that works on my husband&#x27;s feet and he&#x27;s easily tried over a dozen.  Have used it for years.</li>
            <li> I have nothing but good to say about this product.  In just a short few days the dry skin/cracks are gone.  The downside...your family will want their own tube. :)</li>
            <li> My husband and I love the product.  Our feet are soft and well cared for.  When we have house guests, I leave a tube in a welcome basket.</li>
            <li> I use this on my heels every morning before work and it works great.</li>
            <li> When I can&#x27;t afford my beloved Aveda foot cream, this is absolutely the best alternative!  It IS hard to get in stores (I did find it at Walgreen&#x27;s but not Target, WM, or my grocer).  Curel foot cream is acceptable (I love Curel hand cream!), and again while I like Neutrogena for hands, the foot cream makes my feet feel sticky and uncomfortable in the sheets.  LOVE this GOLD BOND foot lotion - effective, clean scent, not sticky, and price very good!!</li>
            <li> Works great, but my dogs circle like sharks trying to lick the cream.</li>
            <li> This thing works. Thats all there is to say really. It softens your feet noticeably after just one usuage and last all day.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the Gold Bond Ultimate Healing foot cream.  I use it at least three times per week, especially at night.  The moisturizers are awesome and used regularly I can avoid the very painful excessive dryness and cracking on my feet.</li>
            <li> My new job requires me to wear boots and be on my feet most of the day. Needless to say my feet began drying out and cracking. This product softened my feet and helped the cracking after the initial application. I put it on at night, put socks on, and when I woke up, my feet felt ten times better. After several applications, the rough spots on my feet disappeared. I don&#x27;t even have to use it daily anymore.</li>
            <li> This lotion may be a little expensive but the benefits are so worth the extra money. My feet cracked open and bled after using a mr. pumice bar and this was the only thing that healed them up. My feet were healed in about 3 days. Thank God for this stuff.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about this product, except it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried.  The 4 pack is really a great value and this is something that I use regularly.  It feels great on thirsty skin.</li>
            <li> Really love this stuff.  My feet looked old, dry, cracked, and now they look like they did many years ago, young!</li>
            <li> fantastic for your feet, it leaves them nice and soft</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different products, but none felt as good or worked as well as this!  Although I get pedicures, I am cursed with dry, cracked feet.  I am happy to finally have found a product that I can count on!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Works as expected.</li>
            <li> Tried another product before using goldbond and I thought it worked OK. Then I came across Gold Bond Ultimate Healing and boy what a difference! Awesome stuff and totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Have been using it for the last year and a half, ever since I first tried it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and it is the only foot cream that I have found that actually works.  I do daily yoga and walk for exercise.  My feet were heavily calloused, especially the heels and with a buffer made by Tweezerman and Gold Bond&#x27;s cream they are now baby soft.  Wouldn&#x27;t be without it ever again.  It goes on smoothly, is not greasy and absorbs beautifully.  I highly recommend it.  Cheryl C.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous products on my heels. Gold Bond works best.</li>
            <li> nice product, non greasy!</li>
            <li> my feet just look great after a short time of use and they were all dry and cracked as I frequently run 1/2 marathons</li>
            <li> This product does the trick.  My wife uses this product nightly before going to bed and she&#x27;s very pleased with the results.  Gold Bond is the best she&#x27;s found.</li>
            <li> This is the softest cream ever for my feet.  Keeps them hydrated longer too.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> This cream works great. I have tried many and this is the best and fastest working cream, I would highly recommend this cream</li>
            <li> Product works great. I use it every day and my feet feel great. I would recommend this product to anyone who has dry, rough feet.</li>
            <li> This lotion does not leave a residue and just sinks right in to my feet.  I will always purchase this particular brand!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned not to believe in miracles when it comes to beauty products. This is no different, but got 4 stars because it is the best I&#x27;ve found so far. For better results, apply and then put on socks for 4-8 hours.</li>
            <li> I may be a little slow ( I just came across this gem about 4 weeks ago) I have had problem skin for a very long time, over 40 years, My feet get some dry and this works great! My hands take a real beating day in and day out, I am a salon owner and between my job and my dry cracking/splitting skin, I have tried many products, slept with gloves on my hands, special lotions and potions and although they smell lovely.. my poor hands were still not good. I decided it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try a sturdy cream. I used it 3 or 4 times the first day, during Christmas break, by New years I can honestly say, my hands are only this good when I visit a humid state for a few day, Utah is a dry state. 1 time per day is working well now! I am soooo HAPPY with this (new to me) product!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best cream for its purpose that I&#x27;ve ever used. I first got it off a drugstore shelf in my area, but then the drugstore stopped carrying it. I tried other foot creams, but this leaves your skin the smoothest and most moisturized it can be. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect heavy cream for dry cracked feet.  Even though I get pedicures regularly, my feet tend to dry out and harden, especially in the winter months.  This cream is absolutely wonderful for the feet and, as a result, for the hands too.  I highly recommend this wonderful foot cream.</li>
            <li> Upon the first use of this cream I noticed a significant improvement in my foot skin.  The cream is greaseless and has a pleasant fragrance.  I bought some for my daughter too.  I was using Burt&#x27;s Bee but found it to be too greasy.  Gold Bond Ultimate Healing Foot cream is quickly absorbed and my feet love it.  I am sold.  Will continue using it forever.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best foot cream I have used. It works great!</li>
            <li> The price was right. Cheaper than where I usually buy it. The foot cream is excellent, it works great for calluses &amp; cuticles. All &amp; all a great purchase.</li>
            <li> Best foot cream ever! Use it after every shower and my feet are soft.</li>
            <li> I do honestly love this. Way smoother and thicker than regular lotions, and even when I wash my hands almost every minute ( I work in a health care setting ) it doesn&#x27;t dry them at all. Especially these winter months.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while and I think it&#x27;s FABULOUS! I noticed that my feet seemed to be drier than usual, probably because I&#x27;m getting older, and the bottom of my feet would get hard so fast. But once I started using this product my feet were beautiful again! And to make it even better, it is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I had extremely dry, cracked, calloused feet. Tried the GOLD BOND FOOT CREAM  and overnight my feet were 1000%&lt;br /&gt;better. I am amazed how well it worked. Ive always believed in GOLD BOND PRODUCTS but this went far beyond my expectations after only one application. GREAT STUFF!!</li>
            <li> The best medicine for dry, cracked sore feet and heals.  Apply as directed.  Works wonders after a couple of days of use.</li>
            <li> I expected this to be a disappointment, and it&#x27;seems not.  It works as advertised.</li>
            <li> great product, works so well, great way to buy in pack of 4</li>
            <li> My favorite foot cream out there. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Dad uses these for his cracked heels. Goes on easy, doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but tubes go by very quickly.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t believe in all these online reviews about products, but I gotta say, I&#x27;m glad I bought this cream, in a few days I saw results.  It does smell weird though (bad), but who cares, it does the trick, fast !</li>
            <li> I find this cream to be very moisturizing for my dry feet.  I really like that it smells good and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> I love the fact this cream absorbs right into your foot without a greasy feeling. I use it daily after showering. Makes my feet feel much softer.</li>
            <li> Was in the military for about 8 years and my feet were tore up from wearing boots all the time. now I work offshore and wear boots still. In the month that I have been using this product my feet are almost back to normal. I use every day and the change is amazing.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re getting into summer and my wife loves to wear flip-flops or go barefoot, showing off her cute nails! Unfortunately, going barefoot tends to dry out the soles of her feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had good result with Gold-Bond hand cream before, so the other day i bought this four-pack of foot cream, and gave it to my wife with a home made coupon for free foot massages...needless to say she is very happy :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: if you haven&#x27;t given a foot rub before try to remember that it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of pressure. The soles of the feet tend to be rather desensitized (the thickest skin), but for most people the arch of the foot is very delicate and sensitive. Try to rub it no harder than you would stroke a babies cheek :)</li>
