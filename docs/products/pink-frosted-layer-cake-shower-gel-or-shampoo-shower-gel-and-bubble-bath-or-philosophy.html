            <li>Read more at [...]</li>
            <li>I love Philosophy products.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love Philosophy products and will continue to buy them.</li>
            <li>I was astonished to have found such a perfect present for my beloved sis!!</li>
            <li>It smells better than what you can imagine..</li>
            <li>A must try! :)</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re still mourning the loss of your favorite sweet treats, wipe off your tears and hop into the shower!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sweet smelling like frosted cupcakes.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft and moisturized, and it is equally great as a bubble bath and shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It shipped very quickly, BUT</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s silky smooth feeling and</li>
            <li>Some of the unique ingredients listed that I suspect give this lotion</li>
            <li>I was excited when I got on to track my item.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try it</li>
            <li>Aside from the scent, the lather is rich and foamy and you will feel clean and revitalized.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t overly sweet, so don&#x27;t let me scare you off by saying that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I would have known I would have had to pay more for shipping than I had originally, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have bought it because the shipping cost was more than the cost of the actual product.</li>
            <li>I have used Philosophy products before, and so far I think this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Your locks will smell like sugar and spice and everything nice all day long!    </li>
            <li>It smells fabulous and makes your skin as soft as silk.</li>
            <li>These products are absolutely fab!  </li>
            <li>The scent does not last beyond the shower, but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>She said it was so thick and creamy and smells great.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>A major part of this is, of course, cutting back on many of the delicious goodies that added inches to your waistline in the first place.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been over a month with absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>The Philosophy products from Amazon are still the older batches and will keep ordering them until they are gone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even used this as a shampoo, and it makes my hair soft and clean, but it would be too drying to use on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>My hair was as silky with just the shampoo as it normally is when I wash my hair with shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more, but absolutely not from this seller.</li>
            <li>Typical fantastic shower gel from Philosophy.  </li>
            <li>The pink frosted layer cake smells similar to the christmas cookie to me, the cookies seemed a little sweeter (which I also loved).</li>
            <li>I used it on my six year old&#x27;s hair and it left her hair very shiny and silky.  </li>
            <li>Philosophy has recently released a whole plethora of yummy three-in-one shampoo / shower gel / bubble bath products.  </li>
            <li>I checked on why it didn&#x27;t deliver and the notification I got was that the carrier couldn&#x27;t make a secure delivery which was strange because this item was small enough to fit in the mailbox</li>
            <li>For using it as a body wash or shampoo, however, it is a little too sweet smelling for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little too sweet for me, so I&#x27;ll probably just use this as a bubble bath.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me, your New Year&#x27;s resolution probably involved something about finally &#x27;getting in shape.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>This body wash smells completely rancid and made me literally dry heave.</li>
            <li>My skin was so soft after made my hair dry and frizzy though...</li>
            <li>There are many other sellers that sell for less and have at least decent service, go with someone else.</li>

            <li> The only downside is that the scent doesn&#x27;t linger long on your skin after you get out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> Two days later it finally arrived, but it had a note on the package saying I still had postage due.</li>
            <li> a little while later, I received another one, at no cost.</li>
            <li> think 1940s Hollywood pink.  </li>
            <li> This Pink Frosted Layer Cake Shampoo/Shower Gel was a birthday gift for my sister, who was born on December 25th.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how the other reviewers could stand it.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have never tried any and was little unsure because of the price.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call it a gel or even a lotion; it is definitely a heavy cream.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;d like to smell like a bakery all day (which I do) just work the gel into your hair, let it sit for a few minutes, and rinse.  </li>
            <li> So, even if you can&#x27;t eat a slice of pink frosted layer cake at least you can smell like one!</li>
            <li> She has dietary restrictions, so a common birthday cake is not part of her celebrations.  </li>
            <li> Philosophy sold out to another company and now their products are terrible.</li>

            <li> This body wash smells completely rancid and made me literally dry heave. I don&#x27;t know how the other reviewers could stand it. I&#x27;m returning it immediately.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!  It smells sooooooo good, and feels amazing.  I think this may be my favorite Philosophy product. It leaves my skin feeling nice and soft.  And have I mentioned the scent?</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product.  Smells delicious, great for a bubble bath, leaves skin silky and soft.  I used it on my six year old&#x27;s hair and it left her hair very shiny and silky.  She loved the fragrance too. I want to order more philosophy products after trying this one!</li>
            <li> The scent is amazing!  When you use it, you&#x27;ll swear you are latherng your body with cake batter.  Aside from the scent, the lather is rich and foamy and you will feel clean and revitalized.</li>
            <li> Typical fantastic shower gel from Philosophy.  It smells fabulous and makes your skin as soft as silk.</li>
            <li> Great product and arrived quickly. Philsophy 3 in 1 bubble bath, shower gel, &amp; shampoo are the best bathing products out there.  I can&#x27;t get enough! Thank you.</li>
            <li> I received this body gel as a gift from a neighbor...what a treat! I have used Philosophy products before, and so far I think this is my favorite. I think she chose this one because it matches my \\&quot;vintage pink\\&quot; bathroom...think 1940s Hollywood pink.  It also happens to smell like a birthday cake, which is my very favorite food! It isn&#x27;t overly sweet, so don&#x27;t let me scare you off by saying that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pink pearlescent cream is much thicker and creamier than typical shower gels.  I wouldn&#x27;t call it a gel or even a lotion; it is definitely a heavy cream.  It makes my skin feel soft and moisturized, and it is equally great as a bubble bath and shampoo.  I always use it when shaving. Some of the unique ingredients listed that I suspect give this lotion it&#x27;s silky smooth feeling and great fragrance are aloe leaf juice, camellia leaf, and strawberry fruit extract. I&#x27;ve been using it liberally for several months and still have a lot left.  A small amount goes a long way.  This would make a terrific hostess gift, and it will definitely be on my shopping list when this one runs out.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, your New Year&#x27;s resolution probably involved something about finally &#x27;getting in shape.&#x27;  A major part of this is, of course, cutting back on many of the delicious goodies that added inches to your waistline in the first place.  If you&#x27;re still mourning the loss of your favorite sweet treats, wipe off your tears and hop into the shower!  Philosophy has recently released a whole plethora of yummy three-in-one shampoo / shower gel / bubble bath products.  So, even if you can&#x27;t eat a slice of pink frosted layer cake at least you can smell like one! Nom, nom, nom ... These products are absolutely fab!  Can you tell I&#x27;m a big fan?  The delicious concoctions lather like a dream, moisturize well and smell divine - DIVINE!  The only downside is that the scent doesn&#x27;t linger long on your skin after you get out of the shower.

            <li> I love Philosophy products. This one is no exception. For using it as a body wash or shampoo, however, it is a little too sweet smelling for me. It literally smells like frosting consisting entirely of sugar. I&#x27;ll stick with using this one as a bubble bath.</li>
            <li> I really loved this product. I have never tried any and was little unsure because of the price. SO glad I did! The pink frosted layer cake smells similar to the christmas cookie to me, the cookies seemed a little sweeter (which I also loved). My skin was so soft after made my hair dry and frizzy though...but I still used it but had to use a conditioner as well. But the sweet creamy frosting lotion was my absolute FAVORITE!!!! :) I will b buying again.</li>
            <li> Philosophy products rock. Well they did. Philosophy sold out to another company and now their products are terrible. I even break out from them. The Philosophy products from Amazon are still the older batches and will keep ordering them until they are gone. Thank you Amazon!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was excited when I got on to track my item. It shipped very quickly, BUT once it arrived at my local post office, the item was supposed to deliver that day and it never came. I checked on why it didn&#x27;t deliver and the notification I got was that the carrier couldn&#x27;t make a secure delivery which was strange because this item was small enough to fit in the mailbox and we were home all day to receive it. Two days later it finally arrived, but it had a note on the package saying I still had postage due. If I would have known I would have had to pay more for shipping than I had originally, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have bought it because the shipping cost was more than the cost of the actual product. Just beware. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side of things, this is a great product. I was excited to try it so I hopped in the shower as soon as it came. As a shampoo it lathered up wonderfully. My hair was as silky with just the shampoo as it normally is when I wash my hair with shampoo and conditioner. I will definitely buy more, but absolutely not from this seller. I prefer to not pay shipping twice!</li>
            <li> I received the product and it was opened. Some of it had leaked all over the packaging. I sent them an email about the issue and a little while later, I received another one, at no cost. Great customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of this does smell like a layered cake. It&#x27;s a little too sweet for me, so I&#x27;ll probably just use this as a bubble bath. I love Philosophy products and will continue to buy them.</li>
            <li> Got an email at some point after order saying the product was on back order. It&#x27;s been over a month with absolutely nothing. There are many other sellers that sell for less and have at least decent service, go with someone else. Would give no stars if I could.</li>
            <li> Never used this product BUT my daughter raved about it but couldn&#x27;t find at out Philosophy vendor. Found and sent it to her in another state. So delighted, her delight crossed state lines!!!</li>
            <li> This shower gel makes me feel like I am indulging in something sinful...LOL It&#x27;s very sweet smelling like frosted cupcakes. As with all Philosophy shower gels, this lathers very well and a little bit goes a long way. The scent does not last beyond the shower, but that&#x27;s ok. I definitely don&#x27;t want to go to work or anywhere else smelling like cupcakes. I&#x27;ve even used this as a shampoo, and it makes my hair soft and clean, but it would be too drying to use on a regular basis. I recommend this product and it would make a great gift for a teenager.</li>
            <li> This Pink Frosted Layer Cake Shampoo/Shower Gel was a birthday gift for my sister, who was born on December 25th.  She has dietary restrictions, so a common birthday cake is not part of her celebrations.  The color, aroma, and caress of this gel are my birthday hug for her on her Christmas birthday!  I was astonished to have found such a perfect present for my beloved sis!!</li>
            <li> This smells sooo good! One of my favorites and have also bought several for gifts! It smells better than what you can imagine.. A must try! :)</li>
            <li> Received this as a gift after my son was born. I look forward to taking a shower just so I can use this stuff. Smells like heaven.</li>
            <li> My daughter had this on her wish list so I purchased for her.  She absolutely loved it!  She said it was so thick and creamy and smells great.  Thanks for the fast shipping too!</li>
