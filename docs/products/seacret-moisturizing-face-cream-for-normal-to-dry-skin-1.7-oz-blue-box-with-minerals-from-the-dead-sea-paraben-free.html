            <li> It has fragrance ( parfum) that is unhealthy and can cause health issues. I will not take any that has chemicals or fragrances/ parfum in t! It is not chemical free!</li>
            <li> This product is great! My skin is kind of weird, sometimes its dry sometimes its oily but this moisturizer makes it feek great &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I use this product in tandem with their Mineral Rich Peeling Gel. The combination of the two reduces fine lines and makes fine lines out of deep lines. I am in my late 60&#x27;s and am so pleased with how my face feels as well. Must use sun block if you use the Peeling Gel on a regular basis!</li>
            <li> This is one amazing moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of moisturizers and they were either too oily or they didn&#x27;t moisturize enough. This one is just perfect. Moisturizes skin deeply and provides moisture all day.  I love Seacret products but this is by far my favorite so far.  Love it and will definitely repurchase it.</li>
            <li> I saw this product at a kiosk at a local mall for a LOT more than I paid buying this on line.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s wonderful and I&#x27;ll certainly continue buying it.  It has such a pleasant fragrance and I love how it softens my complexion.</li>
            <li> If I could afford to purchase this on a regular basis I would. It is everything that it says it is and more. Not just because it comes from the dead sea minerals but the other ingredients and blends work to make this a quality product for the right person.</li>
            <li> I only use products from this company and have for several years, the prices very but found I would not use the high end products from the department store as this has water from the Dead Sea and their products I trust to use on my skin without hesitation.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product and the fact that I can get it here for a fraction of the price makes me love it all the more.  I&#x27;ve been using this face cream for more than two years now and I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> I BEGAN USING IT AS I WAS INTRODUCED TO THIS CREAM BY GORGEOUS YOUNG MEN IN KEYWEST, FLA.-I ENJOY IT&lt;br /&gt;\AND I LIKE THE CREAMY FEEL-JB</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful product, not heavy at all, I have used it now for almost two years, and its the best Ihave found.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of this moisturizer, it light yet lasts all day or night.  I have used many top beauty brands and I would say this works just as well if not better.  I use it with the Seacret Minerals Cleansing Milk for great results.</li>
            <li> After using it a few times--this jar now sits with my &amp;#34;give aways&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;It did nothing to improve or moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li> Made my face even drier</li>
            <li> I got talked into trying seacret by the mall kiosk salesmen. Definitely on the expensive side, but I love all of the products I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> Love this cream!  Won a free jar of it 4 months ago, and can&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> I love these products.  They can be very high priced, but if you watch carefully, you can get them cheaper.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with Seacret products.  I had the body lotion as my son purchased it for me for my birthday a year ago.  I discovered the face cream on the Amazon website and was so pleased I could order it.  It is very light and refreshing and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Love this !! Glad to find this!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful facial moisturizer.  Not overly greasy.  Light and has a wonderful feel to it.</li>
