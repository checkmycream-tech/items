            <li> Woody&#x27;s is the best Pom that I have ever used!  Non greasy, no flakes, styles my hair perfectly, and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> My favorite pomade.  Great seller</li>
            <li> Woody&#x27;s has reduced the portion size. The product is the same as I had last time. It&#x27;s a great pomade. A little on your towel dry hair really does the trick.</li>
            <li> Favorite pomade so far. Low shine, good hold that continues, doesn&#x27;t lock in place then break when you run your hands through your hair. Smells nice too. Soluble wax like consistency</li>
            <li> Great and I will order it again</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for this pomade felt like I wasted my money there are better ones out there at around the same price point. I have been trying new ones for about a year and this has let me down by far the worse buy for your buck. It doesn&#x27;t have the best smell and can&#x27;t keep my hair in line I have not tried using large amounts but I shouldn&#x27;t have to check out a diffrent product.</li>
            <li> Good for everyday use</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Highly recommend it.  Does not give off an offensive odor.  Keeps hair in shape all day.  Not greasy.  Feels a little like wax but goes on and when worked into the hair becomes easily manageable.  Washes out of the hair very easily.</li>
            <li> boyfriend loves the product</li>
            <li> Did not receive the pomade. The bag was marked wrong and had the clay in it.</li>
            <li> This product is basically gelatinous olive oil with the scent of cheap cologne and rubbing alcohol. There is virtually no hold on the hair, and it will make you look like you don&#x27;t shower. If you actually think this product holds your hair, you&#x27;ve yet to try a quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you enjoy rubbing toxic olive oil into your hair, then disregard this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Easy to put on and holds very well to all types of hair. It&#x27;s also very easy to remove from hair when shampooing unlike most other types of pomade products.</li>
            <li> Excellent pomade with decent hold.  I use this when my hair is starting to get a bit long, or is wet.  It is good for styling straight back or to the side.  Smell is fairly strong, fresh or clean, maybe citrus, as opposed to perfume-like.</li>
            <li> Very great product. When used on hair that has been dried after the shower, it makes my hair have that natural look without being too greasy. If you&#x27;re looking for a quick fix up after the shower, I recommend this. If you want that grease head look, it will get you there, but not for long. It will give that greased look for about 2-4 hours. After that, it begins to dry up and look like natural hair.</li>
            <li> Some of the best pom i have used, firm but when it gets messed up alittle water and its moldable again. Also doesn&#x27;t leave that ridiculous amount of crap lest over from other poms</li>
            <li> Smells great, gives a nice hold without the wet look. Easy to clean up</li>
