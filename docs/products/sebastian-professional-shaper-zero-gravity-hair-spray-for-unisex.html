            <li>Smell isn&#x27;t very good, but not horrible and goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>VERY FINE MIST.</li>
            <li>I went through this huge can in a week!</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray - was introduced to it by my stylist.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS HAIR SPRAY</li>
            <li>Takes a lot for me to take the time to review a product I buy here, but when I returned to order more I decided I would because this is simply the BEST hairspray I have ever used</li>
            <li>I just love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>This product is simply the best.  </li>
            <li>This is another one of my favorite products.  </li>
            <li>So light!  </li>
            <li>Love the fact that I can comb through and still have my hair inplace.  </li>
            <li>So glad we can still get it here.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite.</li>
            <li>I guess I just need more hold.</li>
            <li>GLAD</li>
            <li>Just like I but at the salon but at a much better price.  </li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming, although I still turn the bathroom fan on and leave the room after I finish.</li>
            <li>The vendor shipped it fast and it was an easy transaction with a great price.</li>
            <li>It has good hold yet very lightweight so it will not give you the hairspray helmet head.</li>
            <li>And If I don&#x27;t like the way my hair looks, I can brush it out and start over; it&#x27;s that easy to work with.</li>
            <li>You can comb through your hair easily.</li>
            <li>Really strong smell.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that needs hold.</li>
            <li>light, easy to comp out</li>
            <li>This is the best hair spray that I have used so far; and yes, I have the experience of using many different brands before.</li>
            <li>I used Sebastian Shaper light spray for years, then they discontinued it.  </li>
            <li>fantastic hold and light weight on the hair.</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge; it is worth of $.</li>
            <li>I have fine thinning hair and it is perfect to provide a little texture prior to styling then a tad more to finish off and hold the style.  </li>
            <li>but it dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li>After you use it, your hair stays in place and still feels soft, you can also brush through it very easy.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely continue using as long as they supply this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>It is so worth the price</li>
            <li>Good but smells a little strong or funky upon first spray...</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of hold.</li>
            <li>It came in a timely manner and the price was right.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic hairspray that I particularly like for curling my hair with my straightener.</li>
            <li>Great for fine, thin, static-prone hair.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re someone who needs things to smell flowery and pretty, this is not the right hairspray for you.</li>
            <li>Shaper Zero is not heavy  and it easy to style hair after using.</li>
            <li>This provides good hold, but seems to leave a slightly sticky residue.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely fine, wavy, somewhat curly hair and while I have no trouble styling it exactly as I want, keeping it that way without looking like someone out of the 50&#x27;s lacquer-coated, is quite a task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can get good hold without the sticky/weighed down results from other popular hairsprays.</li>
            <li>Overall OK</li>
            <li>I like white sands better.</li>
            <li>I love that this hair spray is light and holds, yet it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li>I have really fine straight hair and most hairsprays are too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Until you&#x27;ve used a hairspray for a while you don&#x27;t really know whether it&#x27;s going to work for you</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I also like that it doesn&#x27;t take much to set my hair.</li>
            <li>It is fine and goes on with a very light spray but the hair looks greasy and weighted down within hours of using, especially if I brush it.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve spoiled myself, I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do if this product disappears the way so many of my other favorites do.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit more than I usually spend, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It provides just the right (light) hold I need without weighing the hair down or leaving a sticky residue.</li>
            <li>Tresemme works a lot better for a lot less.</li>
            <li>So, when i ordered this particular spray, I had high hopes.  </li>
            <li>and I wanted to try something new</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to all smells</li>
            <li>It is good to use to style my hair without being heavy and weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>I am 60yrs old</li>
            <li>Not only was the can different but the spray was much heavier and had a much stronger scent.</li>
            <li>and this product tames the beast like no other.  </li>
            <li>It looks like teenage greasy hair would look when you were young and needed to wash your hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this hairspray; however, the spray function completely shut down and the bottle is full :/</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a strong herbal scent that actually can be quite irritating if you don&#x27;t use another product to cancel out the smell.</li>

            <li> Blows out in a wind, but by then the general shape I want is in place and all I do is run my fingers or a wide tooth comb through my hair.  </li>
            <li> but as it say zero grafvity so it doesnt hold long or anything… cheaper stuff at target do the same trick.</li>
            <li> its good hair spray that doesnt leave white crap on the hair</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair in place but doesn&#x27;t really feel like &#x27;hard hair&#x27;.</li>
            <li> ALWAYS KEEPS MY HAIR IN PLACE ALL DAY LONG.</li>
            <li> I have been using Shaper Zero for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Regular Sebastian Shaper hairspray is my favorite, but this stuff stinks!</li>
            <li> The last few times I went to get some they were sold out.  </li>
            <li> I used it, and it provided the quality experience in styling my hair that I expected.</li>
            <li> and I find it doesn&#x27;t hold my thin hair very well.  </li>
            <li> so I need products with a minimal one.</li>
            <li> and I would never use any other.  </li>
            <li> In addition,  it never leaves any reside in your hair like some other products.  </li>
            <li> I just hope that before I&#x27;m around other people, that the smell will dissipate some.  </li>
            <li> This time, the product was in a different can than usual.</li>
            <li> so a lot of half empty cans of hairspray find their way to the trash.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the expense in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a hairspray that didn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and let it look like it hadn&#x27;t been sprayed.</li>
            <li> the product doesn&#x27;t weigh down my curls, I can add volume without helmet-head</li>
            <li> I have really thick, long hair for a guy</li>
            <li> I can use as much or as little as I need.  </li>
            <li> I use this hair spray everyday..</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get sticky or heavy.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t heavy and sticky.</li>
            <li> Being used to a spray that is firm</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t heavy or stiff, so I recommend it to anyone to try.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s not going to make anything sticky or stiff.</li>
            <li> It also is not sticky or stiff.</li>
            <li> Recently I have found it difficult to get, the closest salon that sells it is about 30 mins away.  </li>
            <li> Just started buying it on line since it is difficult to find in local salons and stores.</li>
            <li> However, the smell is the worst of all; at first I thought this product has passed the expire day.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but found that the style returned to place even after a windy day blew it around.</li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t get me wrong...</li>
            <li> BUT it smells bad.  </li>
            <li> I hate using hair spray.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER it smells AWFUL.</li>
            <li> The scent is terrible and as soon as I sprayed it, I started sneezing every time.</li>

            <li> I love this hairspray - was introduced to it by my stylist.  It is not sticky and it does not build up.  Hair is touchable and does not feel tacky at all</li>
            <li> I have only used PM hairspray for years and I wanted to try something new so bought this hairspray because of the reviews and I love it!!  It holds all day and you don&#x27;t even feel that you have it on. I will be purchasing again in the future!!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair spray that I have used so far; and yes, I have the experience of using many different brands before. However, the smell is the worst of all; at first I thought this product has passed the expire day. lol&lt;br /&gt;  I am the kind of person care about functions of a product rather than smell or packaging, so I decide continue using it (just hold my breath when I use it - breath in and hold! ^^ ) The bottle is huge; it is worth of $.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Just the right amount of hold. Smell isn&#x27;t very good, but not horrible and goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS HAIR SPRAY ALWAYS KEEPS MY HAIR IN PLACE ALL DAY LONG.</li>
            <li> I used Sebastian Shaper light spray for years, then they discontinued it.  I tried this one thinking it would be comparable as it was the same brand.  It is not!  It is fine and goes on with a very light spray but the hair looks greasy and weighted down within hours of using, especially if I brush it. It looks like teenage greasy hair would look when you were young and needed to wash your hair. I am 60yrs old will be finding something else.  This stuff is awful.</li>
            <li> Takes a lot for me to take the time to review a product I buy here, but when I returned to order more I decided I would because this is simply the BEST hairspray I have ever used and I&#x27;ve used hundreds ... literally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until you&#x27;ve used a hairspray for a while you don&#x27;t really know whether it&#x27;s going to work for you so a lot of half empty cans of hairspray find their way to the trash.  I have extremely fine, wavy, somewhat curly hair and while I have no trouble styling it exactly as I want, keeping it that way without looking like someone out of the 50&#x27;s lacquer-coated, is quite a task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very simply, Zero Gravity does the trick.  After styling and spraying I can brush it through a bit and it&#x27;s perfect.  I just love it.  Now that I&#x27;ve spoiled myself, I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do if this product disappears the way so many of my other favorites do.  It&#x27;s a bit more than I usually spend, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic hairspray that I particularly like for curling my hair with my straightener. I know it&#x27;s not going to make anything sticky or stiff. HOWEVER it smells AWFUL. For me, it&#x27;s not an issue but if you&#x27;re someone who needs things to smell flowery and pretty, this is not the right hairspray for you. I just try not to breathe while I&#x27;m spraying! haha</li>
            <li> Spray doesn&#x27;t work well and the product that does come out has NO hold. Would not recommend this product. Word of caution, not returnable. I am told I will receive a refund.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I hate using hair spray. I can&#x27;t stand the stiffness and stickiness.  With this product I have neither problem.  And If I don&#x27;t like the way my hair looks, I can brush it out and start over; it&#x27;s that easy to work with.</li>
            <li> This product is simply the best.  It is so worth the price and I would never use any other.  My hair is always movable yet keeps it&#x27;s shape.  Never sticky or molded looking.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Non-oily or sticky.  Just what the hairdresser recommended!  Will definitely continue using as long as they supply this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I have been using Shaper Zero for a very long time.  Recently I have found it difficult to get, the closest salon that sells it is about 30 mins away.  The last few times I went to get some they were sold out.  So I tried Amazon, and here it is! Perfect.  This is the best hair spray EVER!  It never feels sticky or makes your hair feel crunchy.  After you use it, your hair stays in place and still feels soft, you can also brush through it very easy.  The smell isn&#x27;t the greatest but it dissipates quickly.  In addition,  it never leaves any reside in your hair like some other products.  Try it, you will love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair spray on earth.  I have really thick, long hair for a guy and this product tames the beast like no other.  Great online deal with SS shipping and a great product makes for a happy customer.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I use this hair spray everyday..I have fine hair that needs hold. Shaper Zero is not heavy  and it easy to style hair after using.</li>
            <li> This is another one of my favorite products.  Keeps my hair in place but doesn&#x27;t really feel like &#x27;hard hair&#x27;. Nice product.</li>
            <li> Great for fine, thin, static-prone hair. I can use as much or as little as I need.  It doesn&#x27;t get sticky or heavy.  Blows out in a wind, but by then the general shape I want is in place and all I do is run my fingers or a wide tooth comb through my hair.  Used it for years.</li>
            <li> Good but smells a little strong or funky upon first spray...</li>
            <li> I really like this hairspray; however, the spray function completely shut down and the bottle is full :/</li>
            <li> I order this all the time from Amazon.  Hair stays nice after you apply it.</li>
            <li> I wanted a hairspray that didn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and let it look like it hadn&#x27;t been sprayed. This is the product.</li>
            <li> There was no lack that I could determine in this product. I used it, and it provided the quality experience in styling my hair that I expected.</li>
            <li> I have been using this hairspray for a couple of years. I really like it. It isn&#x27;t heavy and sticky. You can comb through your hair easily. I  would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this one of the best holding sprays ever used.. u can still move your  curls the way you want to. This spray don&#x27;t leave an flakes either  great product.</li>
            <li> So light!  But it works.  Love the fact that I can comb through and still have my hair inplace.  Not at all sticky</li>
            <li> We could no longer find this product in our town after getting hooked on it. So glad we can still get it here.</li>
            <li> This lightweight spray is great for baby-fine hair. It provides just the right (light) hold I need without weighing the hair down or leaving a sticky residue. I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> fantastic hold and light weight on the hair. the product doesn&#x27;t weigh down my curls, I can add volume without helmet-head</li>
            <li> Best spray ever invented!</li>
            <li> The best holding non&#x27;sticky hair spray!!!</li>
            <li> Great product - light hold &amp; not sticky.</li>
            <li> This hairspray is everything they claim it to be. Holds the style, controls frizz but you can&#x27;t tell it is there. Being used to a spray that is firm I was skeptical but found that the style returned to place even after a windy day blew it around. It came in a timely manner and the price was right.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s provides great hold as a finish to volumized hairstyles, but the smell isn&#x27;t quite pleasing. It&#x27;s like a strong herbal scent that actually can be quite irritating if you don&#x27;t use another product to cancel out the smell. It does give a nice flexible hold as advertised.</li>
            <li> light, easy to comp out</li>
            <li> A bit costly but the best hair spray</li>
            <li> I have used Sebastian products forever.  At times I would try something different but ALWAYS went back to this product line.  So, when i ordered this particular spray, I had high hopes.  And don&#x27;t get me wrong...it is a good hairspray BUT it smells bad.  I just hope that before I&#x27;m around other people, that the smell will dissipate some.  Really strong smell.</li>
            <li> I do like the Sebastian Shaper, but sometimes the can quits spraying.  So I hesitate to rate it 5 stars.  However, the one time the can quit spraying all together, I was reimbursed so Yes I guess I should rate it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> My aunt recommended this to hold hair in Oklahoma humidity.  Here I am back home in Virginia and I find it doesn&#x27;t hold my thin hair very well.  Not worth the expense in my opinion.  Tresemme works a lot better for a lot less.</li>
            <li> This is the only hairspray I use. It isn&#x27;t heavy or stiff, so I recommend it to anyone to try.</li>
            <li> I should have returned this when I had the chance. The scent is terrible and as soon as I sprayed it, I started sneezing every time. Regular Sebastian Shaper hairspray is my favorite, but this stuff stinks!</li>
            <li> It is good to use to style my hair without being heavy and weighing it down.  It also is not sticky or stiff.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite. I guess I just need more hold. I went through this huge can in a week!</li>
            <li> This provides good hold, but seems to leave a slightly sticky residue.  Overall OK</li>
            <li> its good hair spray that doesnt leave white crap on the hair but as it say zero grafvity so it doesnt hold long or anything… cheaper stuff at target do the same trick. if want something stronger go to something called fierce fierce.. same brand</li>
            <li> THOUGHT THEY STOPPED MAKING THIS.  GLAD I FOUND IT. VERY FINE MIST.</li>
            <li> I have been using this hairspray for about 3 years now and will not change.  I have fine thinning hair and it is perfect to provide a little texture prior to styling then a tad more to finish off and hold the style.  It has good hold yet very lightweight so it will not give you the hairspray helmet head.</li>
            <li> Yes this was perfect.  Just like I but at the salon but at a much better price.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> I love that this hair spray is light and holds, yet it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair. There is still movement. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t take much to set my hair. The smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming, although I still turn the bathroom fan on and leave the room after I finish. I am very sensitive to all smells so I need products with a minimal one. The vendor shipped it fast and it was an easy transaction with a great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 10yrs. Just started buying it on line since it is difficult to find in local salons and stores. This time, the product was in a different can than usual. Not only was the can different but the spray was much heavier and had a much stronger scent. Don&#x27;t think I will purchase again. I will have to expand my local search for this product and stop buying on line.</li>
            <li> I like white sands better.</li>
            <li> I have really fine straight hair and most hairsprays are too heavy for my hair. However, this product works great  I can get good hold without the sticky/weighed down results from other popular hairsprays.</li>
            <li> Great stuff...really makes my hair manageable.</li>
            <li> Creates &#x27;memory&#x27; for my hair style without stiffness.  Best I have found so far and the price is very good.</li>
