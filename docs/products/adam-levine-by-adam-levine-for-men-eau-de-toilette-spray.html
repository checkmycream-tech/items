            <li>I love this, I know this for men</li>
            <li>but I wear it as well and have received many compliments</li>
            <li>I bought for my husband and love how it smells on him.</li>
            <li>Could not have asked for a better product.</li>
            <li>i love it if you think this is a rip off</li>
            <li>Must have an adventurous nose before ordering.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to have found this product online.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for it for over a year and haven&#x27;t been able to find it at a price I could afford until now.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it.</li>
            <li>Got here really fast and smells AMAZING!</li>
            <li>At first whiff/spray, it smells good.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find it at such a great price.</li>
            <li>CLEAN AND ALWAYS COMPLIMENTED BY MANY PEOPLE</li>
            <li>The smell is clean and citrus as a top note.</li>
            <li>It has a strong citrus smell, not my type of cologne</li>
            <li>Bought it for a teenager bc not so strong.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure his HOT BEAUTIFUL YOUNG MODEL girlfriends don&#x27;t smell so MATURE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first smelled the colonge in a department store and liked it.  </li>
            <li>This is a rushed through cheap cologne that smells musty.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic, if you like a citrus scent, spring like scent</li>
            <li>For me, it goes alright if used on pulse points, preferably in combination with a light citrus smell..</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li>I know everyone&#x27;s chemistry is unique and have proven this with my friends.&lt;br /&gt;Cut</li>
            <li>this fragrance is very different from any others that I have it has a very grapefruit citrus type of smell to it but don&#x27;t be deterred because it smells very good</li>
            <li>Perfect- fast on time just like I expected and smells delish</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell if it is the real thing or not</li>
            <li>but it smells good to me, especially for $17.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, masculine scent...</li>
            <li>I waited and the price was finally something I felt good with.</li>
            <li>Smells good but the scent does not last.</li>
            <li>I heard from others that it smelled good and was not a in your face kind smell not sure what they was smelling</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s scent is long lasting,however I will prefer something with more of a refreshing summer scent like a blvgari aqua or a fragrances such as good life by David Davidoff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice for when going to Save Mart or some place where you&#x27;ll be running a quick errand and don&#x27;t want to waste better, high end cologne when there won&#x27;t be many people socializing around</li>
            <li>First off, I have a cat and his pee doesn&#x27;t smell like Adam Levine&#x27;s cologne!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about how this smells on me.  </li>
            <li>Bottle is bigger than I expected, great value for the money!  </li>
            <li>Tis scent is by far the most manly scent ever.  </li>
            <li>I like the combination of grapefruit and bergamot as it  gives you a sexy and masculine scent.</li>
            <li>it is very distinct because most public figures that have their own fragrance they all tend to smell similar</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a great scent but not to wear when its extra humid.</li>
            <li>also if you dislike the smell of grapefruit, you probably would not like this fragrance very much.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is a little strong at first to the senses, but after a few minutes it fades and sets in perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I was interested because I have a man crush on Adam</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>If possible, it&#x27;s best to go try before you buy - especially since everyone&#x27;s body makeup is different.</li>
            <li>Would definitely buy again! :)</li>
            <li>This is the only cologne I have bought that I am reordering for I have used it so much more than all the others.</li>
            <li>while at the same time being light and having sweet notes.</li>
            <li>I thought that when the price of the cologne was $50 for this bottle, that it was going to be a hot seller.</li>
            <li>Scent is light yet masculine with citrus notes that I like in a men&#x27;s Fragrance.</li>
            <li>IS THIS REAL!?</li>
            <li>I actually got this at Ross for a discount price compared to most.</li>
            <li>I am someone who wears fragrances often (whether cologne or Perfume, I honestly don&#x27;t care) and was curious about Adam Levine&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li>Will be getting another bottle just to have for when this first bottle runs out.</li>
            <li>The impression when i first opened it and tried it was very citrusy and woodsy.</li>
            <li>It ended up being the cologne though, and the smell was pure B.O.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was a very timely delivery.</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It has a very grapefruit smell to it, not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>But I really like this for it</li>
            <li>Fast delivery 5 stars</li>
            <li>I really hope that Adam Levine smells like his cologne...</li>
            <li>Smells really yummy.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to my smell so it might work for someone else.</li>
            <li>My grandsons really like this cologne.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it has something to do with the clothes you spray it on, the temperature you wear it in, your own perspiration, but sometimes it doesn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li>Iam surprised this is still on the market !!</li>
            <li>, I was expecting a little more of SOMETHING, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>Some would say it smells fantastic and other would say it smelled like body odor.  </li>
            <li>, I thought it was just me until other people confirmed it.</li>
            <li>I still  can smell it as it is with other cologne I have brought, such as Eternity, my favorite.</li>
            <li>, Im a big fan of Adam, but ill say it is really good!</li>
            <li>i tried to trade my 15 yr old for some of his cheaper cologne he received on christmas, and HE wouldnt even take it!</li>
            <li>had ordered it before I went to Target the next day and saw that they had a Tester out and the first thought that came to mind was &amp;#</li>
            <li>mature, how old is Adam Levine!?</li>
            <li>The citrus hues to me are hard to miss and what I like most about this brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He tells me that he gets compliments on it at work quite frequently.</li>
            <li>jeez if you youre used to smelling old spice or jovan</li>
            <li>girl version I bought for my sister when I ordered this one smells like an old lady, you know, 30 years and UP.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells gross...like underarms and motor oil with an old grapefruit squeezed over it.</li>
            <li>I went ahead anyway, but I&#x27;m afraid that the reviews were kind of right.</li>
            <li>This spray has a very lite smell that did not last long.</li>
            <li>I got this at Macy&#x27;s in San Francisco in 2013 and so far this is the only place I have found it.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I like Adam Levine, which is kind of lame to begin with (not that I like Adam Levine</li>
            <li>Smell a little funny after a while...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Truthfully I half bought it as a joke with my wife, but it turns out it really is pleasant.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is a faint pleasant smell, typically you will most likely have to put on a lot to actually smell it on your clothes because of the faint smell.</li>

            <li> Perfect- fast on time just like I expected and smells delish</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell if it is the real thing or not</li>
            <li> but it smells good to me, especially for $17.</li>
            <li> It has a nice, masculine scent...</li>
            <li> I waited and the price was finally something I felt good with.</li>
            <li> Smells good but the scent does not last.</li>
            <li> I heard from others that it smelled good and was not a in your face kind smell not sure what they was smelling</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s scent is long lasting,however I will prefer something with more of a refreshing summer scent like a blvgari aqua or a fragrances such as good life by David Davidoff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice for when going to Save Mart or some place where you&#x27;ll be running a quick errand and don&#x27;t want to waste better, high end cologne when there won&#x27;t be many people socializing around</li>
            <li> First off, I have a cat and his pee doesn&#x27;t smell like Adam Levine&#x27;s cologne!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about how this smells on me.  </li>
            <li> Bottle is bigger than I expected, great value for the money!  </li>
            <li> Tis scent is by far the most manly scent ever.  </li>
            <li> I like the combination of grapefruit and bergamot as it  gives you a sexy and masculine scent.</li>
            <li> it is very distinct because most public figures that have their own fragrance they all tend to smell similar</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a great scent but not to wear when its extra humid.</li>
            <li> also if you dislike the smell of grapefruit, you probably would not like this fragrance very much.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is a little strong at first to the senses, but after a few minutes it fades and sets in perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I was interested because I have a man crush on Adam</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> If possible, it&#x27;s best to go try before you buy - especially since everyone&#x27;s body makeup is different.</li>
            <li> Would definitely buy again! :)</li>
            <li> This is the only cologne I have bought that I am reordering for I have used it so much more than all the others.</li>
            <li> while at the same time being light and having sweet notes.</li>
            <li> I thought that when the price of the cologne was $50 for this bottle, that it was going to be a hot seller.</li>
            <li> Scent is light yet masculine with citrus notes that I like in a men&#x27;s Fragrance.</li>
            <li> IS THIS REAL!?</li>
            <li> I actually got this at Ross for a discount price compared to most.</li>
            <li> I am someone who wears fragrances often (whether cologne or Perfume, I honestly don&#x27;t care) and was curious about Adam Levine&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li> Will be getting another bottle just to have for when this first bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> The impression when i first opened it and tried it was very citrusy and woodsy.</li>
            <li> It ended up being the cologne though, and the smell was pure B.O.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was a very timely delivery.</li>
            <li> fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It has a very grapefruit smell to it, not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> But I really like this for it</li>
            <li> Fast delivery 5 stars</li>
            <li> I really hope that Adam Levine smells like his cologne...</li>
            <li> Smells really yummy.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to my smell so it might work for someone else.</li>
            <li> My grandsons really like this cologne.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it has something to do with the clothes you spray it on, the temperature you wear it in, your own perspiration, but sometimes it doesn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> Iam surprised this is still on the market !!</li>
            <li> , I was expecting a little more of SOMETHING, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> Some would say it smells fantastic and other would say it smelled like body odor.  </li>
            <li> , I thought it was just me until other people confirmed it.</li>
            <li> I still  can smell it as it is with other cologne I have brought, such as Eternity, my favorite.</li>
            <li> , Im a big fan of Adam, but ill say it is really good!</li>
            <li> i tried to trade my 15 yr old for some of his cheaper cologne he received on christmas, and HE wouldnt even take it!</li>
            <li> had ordered it before I went to Target the next day and saw that they had a Tester out and the first thought that came to mind was &amp;#</li>
            <li> mature, how old is Adam Levine!?</li>
            <li> The citrus hues to me are hard to miss and what I like most about this brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He tells me that he gets compliments on it at work quite frequently.</li>
            <li> jeez if you youre used to smelling old spice or jovan</li>
            <li> girl version I bought for my sister when I ordered this one smells like an old lady, you know, 30 years and UP.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells gross...like underarms and motor oil with an old grapefruit squeezed over it.</li>
            <li> I went ahead anyway, but I&#x27;m afraid that the reviews were kind of right.</li>
            <li> This spray has a very lite smell that did not last long.</li>
            <li> I got this at Macy&#x27;s in San Francisco in 2013 and so far this is the only place I have found it.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I like Adam Levine, which is kind of lame to begin with (not that I like Adam Levine</li>
            <li> Smell a little funny after a while...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Truthfully I half bought it as a joke with my wife, but it turns out it really is pleasant.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is a faint pleasant smell, typically you will most likely have to put on a lot to actually smell it on your clothes because of the faint smell.</li>
            <li> and I really like the smell at the dry down stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wife is super sensitive to fragrances )hard to dump a few I had)</li>
            <li> Reading prior reviews I was not sure if I really wanted to buy this.  </li>
            <li> , the scent does not last long.</li>
            <li> and it smells strange initially, by that</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s last for a long time on my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I hate overbearing strong scents prefer the modern</li>
            <li> I was scared that it would not smell the same on my skin due to body chemistry...</li>
            <li> Echo by Davidoff, Paris Hilton(blue bottle), Kenneth Cole T-Shirt, Black by Ron Marone (off brand but last forever)</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s the first time I buy a celebrity cologne, how wrong I was, this smells just like arm pit, or deodorant mixed with sweat, I wore it for a week and always got that smell</li>
            <li> I was not ready.....</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with this purchase there is nothing lite smelling or clean about this fragrance if anything it smells like someone&#x27;s arm pit after sweating for a month !!</li>
            <li> read some other online reviews</li>
            <li> I have a love and hate relationship with this cologne.</li>
            <li> ordsering through this seller is half the price of purchasing this fragrance in store.  </li>
            <li> The odd thing is that this doesn&#x27;t always happen.</li>
            <li> Reminds me a little of Eternity.</li>
            <li> The next day it loses at least 50% of its fragrance</li>
            <li> I just embrace it and use it to my advantage by wearing his cologne and not shaving everyday.</li>
            <li> This is my everyday cologne, but this one you have to try before you buy.</li>
            <li> I did smell slight BO notes, however I usually spray it in the air and let it float onto me.</li>
            <li> Such a disappointment to have spent hard earned money on this.</li>
            <li> usually will wear Lacoste Challenge or D&amp;G</li>
            <li> Please dont waste yours!</li>
            <li> This has a spice note that some people will find hard to like.</li>
            <li> Let it sit for a while though, and it slowly fades into a B.O. smell.</li>
            <li> I mean it smells like some cheaper fragrance from the dollar store once it starts to dissipate</li>
            <li> Is he into cougar women or something, I mean, SERIOUSLY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I like it at its subtle state.  </li>
            <li> Not happy with this purchase at all</li>
            <li> ARE YOU SERIOUS!?</li>
            <li> Otherwise if you are used to the real serious brands of colognes then avoid.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it smells like the gym after a whIle stinks</li>
            <li> it or hate it&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It has a strong citrus smell, not my type of cologne</li>
            <li> Seems like everyone likes it.  I was interested because I have a man crush on Adam but the stuff turned out great.  I am going to have to hide it because every one want to use it.</li>
            <li> It was a very timely delivery. The price was great, wonderful bargain</li>
            <li> fast shipping. the bottle was well protected in the package. love it. thanks!</li>
            <li> Light and Smells so Fresh!!!! Awesome cologne</li>
            <li> I had skipped over this cologne simply because it had Adam Levine&#x27;s name on it, as I tend to stay away from celebrity colognes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually will wear Lacoste Challenge or D&amp;G The One \\&quot;Man\\&quot; but, for some reason my wife wanted me to try this on a whim while we were at Kohls.  She loved it and honestly, I didn&#x27;t mind it either.  It has grown on me and I really like the smell at the dry down stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see a lot of reviews saying it smells like B.O. (body odor) and I simply do not get that.  Maybe they are smelling themselves?  One thing I have learned is that everyone&#x27;s nose is different, so take every review with a grain of salt.  If possible, it&#x27;s best to go try before you buy - especially since everyone&#x27;s body makeup is different.</li>
            <li> Very nice cologne for the price. Reminds me a little of Eternity. Seems to last.</li>
            <li> The citrus hues to me are hard to miss and what I like most about this brand.&lt;br /&gt;Truthfully I half bought it as a joke with my wife, but it turns out it really is pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the only cologne/spray in my cabinet and the only one I&#x27;ve had there for years.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Super fast delivery. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it smells like the gym after a whIle stinks</li>
            <li> Perfect! ON TIME and perfect fragance for men.</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering this cologne. It smells amazing, I love it.</li>
            <li> I have never bought this before so I wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell if it is the real thing or not but it smells good to me, especially for $17.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this. Citrus deliciousness.</li>
            <li> excelent i bought this for my father and he love it smell so nice...</li>
            <li> I heard from others that it smelled good and was not a in your face kind smell not sure what they was smelling but neither me or my wife or my son liked it so gave it to the neighbor.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!! Smells awesome and great deal! Double the $$ in stores! Bought it for a teenager bc not so strong.</li>
            <li> its doesn&#x27;t  have any fragrance  at all !!!</li>
            <li> This smells great!  I have never bought a celebrity named perfume or cologne for anyone.  This one is great.  :)</li>
            <li> Got here really fast and smells AMAZING! Got it for my hubby for Christmas because he was out. I got a 3.4 oz bottle on here for $23.00 he bought his 1oz bottle he had at Kholes for $40.  So this is really affordable and a great deal! Would definitely buy again! :)</li>
            <li> I was not ready.....it exudes manliness!! After putting this on....i feel MANTASTIC!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about how this smells on me.  It has a very grapefruit smell to it, not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I bought this not knowing how it smelled. This is one great fresh scented cologne. I like to think this is how Adam Levine might smell when he wakes up in the morning. I would purchase this again. Lots of compliments on this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s scent is long lasting,however I will prefer something with more of a refreshing summer scent like a blvgari aqua or a fragrances such as good life by David Davidoff. Overall it&#x27;s a great scent but not to wear when its extra humid.</li>
            <li> Smell a little funny after a while...</li>
            <li> I AM A COLOGNE FREAK AND HAVE A CLOSET FULL&lt;br /&gt;THIS HAS TO BE ONE OF MYFAVORITESGOES ON SMELLING GREAT AND LASTS A GOOD 10 HOURS&lt;br /&gt;VERY CLEAN AND ALWAYS COMPLIMENTED BY MANY PEOPLE</li>
            <li> I got this at Macy&#x27;s in San Francisco in 2013 and so far this is the only place I have found it. But I really like this for it has hints of grapefruit and lemongrass and just like how it smells on me. Plus have had many compliments. Like any cologne it is best to first smell it on yourself but the price here at Amazon is outstanding. This is the only cologne I have bought that I am reordering for I have used it so much more than all the others. And I have about 15 men&#x27;s colognes all really good and nice stuff but this is a great scent for me that I am proud to wear.</li>
            <li> Perfect- fast on time just like I expected and smells delish and these next words are because I have to</li>
            <li> This spray has a very lite smell that did not last long. Some men like the non-lasting smell for me personal I like it  when in  a hour I still  can smell it as it is with other cologne I have brought, such as Eternity, my favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan and have never bought celeb scents. But I was looking for something different and my last one was Aqua Gio Armani.&lt;br /&gt;So I know everyone&#x27;s chemistry is unique and have proven this with my friends.&lt;br /&gt;Cut to the chase.....I did smell slight BO notes, however I usually spray it in the air and let it float onto me. As it dries it gets better.&lt;br /&gt;So 4 stars cause I&#x27;m waiting for a compliment which will determine my future use.</li>
            <li> OMG this literally smells like Adam Levine. If he were to be in a bottle, this would be him. Period.</li>
            <li> This cologne has improved my marriage. Well, sort of. My wife has a thing for Adam Levine. I just embrace it and use it to my advantage by wearing his cologne and not shaving everyday. Marriage is work. Adam Levine&#x27;s signature sent makes it easier!</li>
            <li> I love this cologne! It has a nice, masculine scent...while at the same time being light and having sweet notes. This one seems to be an either &amp;#34;love it or hate it&amp;#34; fragrance, so try to get a sample of it before purchasing.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne! My husband smells wonderful. Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> It smell awesome, I bought it just for Adam, Im a big fan of Adam, but ill say it is really good!</li>
            <li> Perfect Scent love the Fresh Grapefruit Scent.  I hate overbearing strong scents prefer the modern touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similar Product that I currently use n recommend: Sunset Heat by Escada, Echo by Davidoff, Paris Hilton(blue bottle), Kenneth Cole T-Shirt, Black by Ron Marone (off brand but last forever)</li>
            <li> The smell is for spring and summer and smells really good if you&#x27;re into scents like that. I thought that when the price of the cologne was $50 for this bottle, that it was going to be a hot seller. When Adams clothes landed up in K-Mart of all places around the time that this came out, I knew that I wasn&#x27;t going to pay that price for it. I waited and the price was finally something I felt good with.</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant after reading several &amp;#34;B.O.&amp;#34; after effect scent to this cologne but not at all the case with me. Wife is super sensitive to fragrances )hard to dump a few I had) but this one is great and she loves it as well.</li>
            <li> Save your money!! This is a rushed through cheap cologne that smells musty. It was so bas i tried to trade my 15 yr old for some of his cheaper cologne he received on christmas, and HE wouldnt even take it! Such a disappointment to have spent hard earned money on this. Please dont waste yours! Horrible!</li>
            <li> Bottle is bigger than I expected, great value for the money!  Scent is light yet masculine with citrus notes that I like in a men&#x27;s Fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is my everyday cologne, but this one you have to try before you buy. Some people have commented to me it smells good, while others say it smells like floor cleaner/chemicals. So make sure you find out what it smells like on you.</li>
            <li> Great scent with an awesome citrus note.  ordsering through this seller is half the price of purchasing this fragrance in store.  Fast delivery 5 stars</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic, if you like a citrus scent, spring like scent this is ideal. I loved it and I will be order my 2 bottle soon.</li>
            <li> Great price and LOVE the scent on my man!</li>
            <li> Love Love Love the smell of this colonge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone thinks it smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for my son for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I have a love and hate relationship with this cologne. I bought it because I like Adam Levine, which is kind of lame to begin with (not that I like Adam Levine but that I bought a celebrity cologne just because of that). I hadn&#x27;t smelled the cologne prior to purchasing it, but I had read a bunch of reviews on another website that ripped it apart. I went ahead anyway, but I&#x27;m afraid that the reviews were kind of right. At first whiff/spray, it smells good. There is a musty smell mixed with grapefruit. Let it sit for a while though, and it slowly fades into a B.O. smell. The odd thing is that this doesn&#x27;t always happen. I&#x27;m not sure if it has something to do with the clothes you spray it on, the temperature you wear it in, your own perspiration, but sometimes it doesn&#x27;t happen. When it does though, you know it. I remember sniffing my pits in the car because I thought my deodorant had suddenly stopped working. It ended up being the cologne though, and the smell was pure B.O.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the scent does not last long. You can spray it on yourself, and about 2 hours later, it&#x27;s like you never sprayed on cologne at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using it for now, but I definitely would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I first smelled the colonge in a department store and liked it.  I found it online cheaper and in a larger bottle.</li>
            <li> This cologne definitely smells awesome. It is a light, clean smell that I would think would smell great on anyone.</li>
            <li> My wife bought it for me, if she likes it, I like it. She loves Adam Levine everything.</li>
            <li> Makes an excellent gift</li>
            <li> Reading prior reviews I was not sure if I really wanted to buy this.  Some would say it smells fantastic and other would say it smelled like body odor.  Now for $19.99/PRIME it was a no brainer.  Now I tried it as soon as I received the item and it smells strange initially, by that I mean it smells like some cheaper fragrance from the dollar store once it starts to dissipate it started to smell refreshing.  The next day it loses at least 50% of its fragrance but I like it at its subtle state.  Would I have bought this fragrance knowing what I know now?  Yes I would, this is now my daytime fragrance and Terre D&#x27; Hermes for nightime..</li>
            <li> I love this, I know this for men but I wear it as well and have received many compliments</li>
            <li> This cologne was a Christmas present to my eldest son who is a professor. He is somewhat prickly about colognes. So, it was with some apprehension that I purchased it. The price was excellent so I decided to take a chance. My son likes the cologne and does wear it often, I am told.</li>
            <li> Very pleasant and the scent lasts.</li>
            <li> I really hope that Adam Levine smells like his cologne... OMG it is so good... I was scared that it would not smell the same on my skin due to body chemistry... but it smells just as good... Please let Adam Levine smell like this...</li>
            <li> The fragrance is a little strong at first to the senses, but after a few minutes it fades and sets in perfectly.  Great, clean smell.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with this purchase there is nothing lite smelling or clean about this fragrance if anything it smells like someone&#x27;s arm pit after sweating for a month !! Iam surprised this is still on the market !! Iam really shocked Adam would put his name on it !!</li>
            <li> Smells really yummy. I bought for my husband and love how it smells on him. He tells me that he gets compliments on it at work quite frequently.</li>
            <li> The smell is clean and citrus as a top note. But there is a definite hint of body odor to the fragrance. The scent doesn&#x27;t last long. Probably lots of alcohol in it as a filler. Would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Smells Awesome ,fast delivery. I will purchase in the future,my husband even likes this and he&#x27;s picky so that&#x27;s a plus</li>
            <li> I bought this item after reading a ton of great reviews, ...jeez if you youre used to smelling old spice or jovan this could be a great step up from your cologne taste. Otherwise if you are used to the real serious brands of colognes then avoid. This is a real cheap aroma...although can be used now as body spray after workout. Never use on a date unless youre going to a barn dance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice for when going to Save Mart or some place where you&#x27;ll be running a quick errand and don&#x27;t want to waste better, high end cologne when there won&#x27;t be many people socializing around you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s smells like citrus, I was expecting a little more of SOMETHING, I don&#x27;t know. This just isn&#x27;t what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had ordered it before I went to Target the next day and saw that they had a Tester out and the first thought that came to mind was &amp;#34;NO WAY! ARE YOU SERIOUS!? IS THIS REAL!? CAN I CANCEL MY ORDER, OR IS IT TOO LATE!?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And riiiiiiiiiiiiiight when I was going to cancel, I saw that the item had already shipped, in which case I was like, &amp;#34;F***!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The girl version I bought for my sister when I ordered this one smells like an old lady, you know, 30 years and UP.&lt;br /&gt;Very mature, how old is Adam Levine!? Is he into cougar women or something, I mean, SERIOUSLY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure his HOT BEAUTIFUL YOUNG MODEL girlfriends don&#x27;t smell so MATURE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take my review for what it is, people--THE HONEST TRUTH.</li>
            <li> I bought this because Im a fan of Adam Levine and thought this must smell really good, it&#x27;s the first time I buy a celebrity cologne, how wrong I was, this smells just like arm pit, or deodorant mixed with sweat, I wore it for a week and always got that smell, I thought it was just me until other people confirmed it.</li>
            <li> Smells good but the scent does not last.</li>
            <li> Great cologne. Could last alittle longer. Great product and it it so.nice to smell something that has grapefruityness like lacoste</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome I read a lot of reviews and saw it on Good Mythical Morning, and it turned out awesome.</li>
            <li> this fragrance is very different from any others that I have it has a very grapefruit citrus type of smell to it but don&#x27;t be deterred because it smells very good it is very distinct because most public figures that have their own fragrance they all tend to smell similar but this one is very nice distinct.</li>
            <li> Tis scent is by far the most manly scent ever.  Adam was not playing around and knows what men should smell like.  5 STARS all the way around.  The scent is tantalizing.</li>
            <li> This stuff came in a timely manner and smells really good! Could not have asked for a better product.</li>
            <li> Smells gross...like underarms and motor oil with an old grapefruit squeezed over it. yeah. like that.</li>
            <li> I actually got this at Ross for a discount price compared to most. I am someone who wears fragrances often (whether cologne or Perfume, I honestly don&#x27;t care) and was curious about Adam Levine&#x27;s scent. The impression when i first opened it and tried it was very citrusy and woodsy. It&#x27;s a nice, non-overpowering scent. Plus it&#x27;s last for a long time on my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read some other online reviews and they said it smelled like B.O. or cat pee. First off, I have a cat and his pee doesn&#x27;t smell like Adam Levine&#x27;s cologne! As for B.O, I also don&#x27;t get that so maybe it&#x27;s something personally? It may not be for everybody but I give this a cologne a solid A.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item on a Monday and I received it on Wednesday. The shipping was fast and the item came wrapped perfectly. I will definitely be ordering for them again. My boyfriends loves the smell. Great buy and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this scent!! Lasts all day and you can&#x27;t not beat the price. Arrived quickly and I always received compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> This smells really good i love it if you think this is a rip off well its not..this fragrance is legit</li>
            <li> Love this scent! For a 1.0 ounce bottle at Target it&#x27;s $25, this is a steal!!! Will be getting another bottle just to have for when this first bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> Did not like the smell at all.. Kind of a arm pit smell to it idk how else to describe it.. Not happy with this purchase at all.. But I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to my smell so it might work for someone else.</li>
            <li> if you dont like the pungent smell of perfume on you, you will definitely like this. it is a faint pleasant smell, typically you will most likely have to put on a lot to actually smell it on your clothes because of the faint smell. also if you dislike the smell of grapefruit, you probably would not like this fragrance very much. the packaging is exceptionally nice, the box as well as the perfume bottle is definitely one to keep.</li>
            <li> My son wanted this and Macy&#x27;s ran out. I was thrilled to find it at such a great price. He loves it.</li>
            <li> Must have an adventurous nose before ordering. If your comfort zone is traditional smells like CK Eternity etc., do not order this. This has a spice note that some people will find hard to like. For me, it goes alright if used on pulse points, preferably in combination with a light citrus smell..</li>
            <li> My grandsons really like this cologne.  I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I like the combination of grapefruit and bergamot as it  gives you a sexy and masculine scent.Good job, Adam Levine!</li>
            <li> I was pleased to have found this product online. I have been looking for it for over a year and haven&#x27;t been able to find it at a price I could afford until now. I love the smell of it. It will make a great gift :)</li>
