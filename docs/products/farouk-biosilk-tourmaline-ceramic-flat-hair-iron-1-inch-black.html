            <li>Great iron!</li>
            <li>But what I&#x27;m so impressed with is the seller.</li>
            <li>Very happy to see that the cord design was changed to provide additional years of use.</li>
            <li>Have been very happy with this iron.  </li>
            <li>The Biosilk Ceramic iron I purchased is great!</li>
            <li>It is a great buy!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m beyond happy.</li>
            <li>It works great</li>
            <li>This iron works great.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy with the price AND the shipping time was amazing.</li>
            <li>The ceramic while 10 times hotter, will heat up and not burn your hands, but the plates are designed to smooth and silk the hair with the heat, and it&#x27;s awesome.  </li>
            <li>Purchasing this item turned out to be a good investment.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty impressed with this product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve received many compliments on my hair!</li>
            <li>and I feel a better value!</li>
            <li>Works as good as the Chi with a better price.  </li>
            <li>Honestly.</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair that frizzes up, but this iron keeps my hair straight and shiny, it even makes beautiful shiny curls!</li>
            <li>By far the best styling tool I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>This is easy to use and does the trick!</li>
            <li>This product was much better for my hair</li>
            <li>My suggestion is just don&#x27;t buy Farouk products, they may say they&#x27;re top of the line, but their quality is at the bottom.</li>
            <li>and it did a wonderful job straightening out my hair, but about a week later when I would plug it in</li>
            <li>but once I got it home, I was more than pleased.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in hair love.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure my baby could&#x27;ve done another year or so, but it won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS IRON...</li>
            <li>I purchased this iron after borrowing it many times from my mom.  </li>
            <li>This is probably the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for over a year and it works just as good as it did the first day</li>
            <li>3 years is pretty darn good.</li>
            <li>Luckily I contacted the seller via Amazon and they kindly offered to replace my iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After buying this product nearly 2 years ago, I was happy with it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- lightweight, easy to use&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was a bargain and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Nice flat iron, not quite as a good</li>
            <li>Once it&#x27;s on, it&#x27;s fine, and the straightener works as well as the Chi I had before it.  </li>
            <li>it dries my hair in fraction of the time and leaves it smooth.  </li>
            <li>This iron is FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>It is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I chose this flat iron, like I said, after reading everyones review of how great it was.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited</li>
            <li>The first for me from a hairdressers warehouse and it cost me much more than the one I purchased on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I almost bought a CHI (original), but this was $20 cheaper and allowed me to control the temperature.</li>
            <li>The CHI Turbo was more than I wanted to spend because I&#x27;m a pretty cautious spender.</li>
            <li>it was this one, I ordered one right away!</li>
            <li>Contacted the seller and received a full refund.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- heats up quickly</li>
            <li>It does a beautiful job with little effort and never snags my hair.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron and the adjustable heat settings make it even better.</li>
            <li>It gets very hot and i have to go over my hair once.</li>
            <li>It straightens my hair quickly, and does leave it very shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li>iron works fine either, but was really turned off by it being a used product.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still the same amazing machine</li>
            <li>I love this product, and not only does it smooth and silk out your hair, but I now know the difference between a iron and ceramic one.  </li>
            <li>It does straighten my hair, but I feel like my old straightener did a much better job.  </li>
            <li>Iron is right out of the box and it won&#x27;t turn on.  </li>
            <li>only concern is that the \\&quot;on\\&quot; light quickly flickers once it&#x27;s at full heat.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice long cord and it is very slender.</li>
            <li>I love this straightener when I can actually get it to turn on.  </li>
            <li>i bought the hair dryer and in under 6months it stopped blowing hot.  </li>
            <li>I have a Conair ceramic iron that does okay, but the poof comes back to my hair too soon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d read wonderful reviews about this Biosilk flat iron, so I was really anxious to get it in the mail.  </li>
            <li>and I see why, it has helped me uncover the magic of the flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I would gladly recommend this flat iron.</li>
            <li>If it flickers then I need to concentrate on getting the cord in just a certain spot to get the straightener to turn on.  </li>
            <li>Easy to go straight or curly with this flat iron.</li>
            <li>if I spent more time sectioning it, it would&#x27;ve been really straight.</li>
            <li>This iron by far is the BEST one I&#x27;ve had, all the really expensive ones would stop working within a year or so.</li>
            <li>it really took me about 20-30 minutes just to get it on.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves her biosilk as much as I do.  </li>
            <li>This iron heats to 420 degrees and has real ceramic plates (not metal plates coated in ceramic) resulting in even heating.</li>
            <li>a a Chi, but very close.</li>
            <li>So after only 2 years, I am looking to buy a different kind of straightener.  </li>
            <li>loved it, it JUST died on me this morning because my roommate kept pushing the heat past the 420 mark to NO HEAT TERRITORY!</li>
            <li>It seemed to flat iron hair smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I read many reveiws before purchasing this flat iron and I agree with everything I read that this flat iron is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than a regular iron, it does not damage your hair, and since using it, my hair has started back to grow faster now.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this iron.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I also find it extremely funny that its from the same makers as the chi, yet so much cheaper</li>
            <li>That alone would make the flat iron not even worth the money.</li>
            <li>so I needed to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: Received brand new replacement iron.</li>
            <li>First off, I have to say I ordered it and received it within three days instead of ten!</li>
            <li>The side of my hair that was straightened with my wigo did not remain straight while the side I used the Biosilk flat iron was still straight, shiny, and silky.</li>
            <li>I had previously bought the exact same flat iron from a reputable hair supply store and it had lasted for nearly 6 years.</li>
            <li>I have been using this item for several months now and would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>it does not slide as well as my old one did.  </li>
            <li>My old flat iron (GVP brand) kept my hair silky and straight in all kinds of weather and even after I&#x27;d slept on it.      </li>
            <li>/&gt;Conair&#x27;s light flashes slow and steadily until it&#x27;s reached the desired temp.</li>
            <li>Some irons get HOT on the outside, but I had this one all the way up to 420F at some parts and the outside</li>
            <li>Possibly it was a floor model,  but it is clear the box was not in new condition nor was the way the iron was packed.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I would definitely spend a little extra money to ensure healthy hair.</li>
            <li>Does a great job straightening my hair, heats up quickly, and is less expensive than some of the other models.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a five was that it claims that it locks out humidity, and for the most part it does, but when humidity here is bad and I walk for a 10-15 minutes, I find my hair not as straight and as smooth as when I left.  </li>
            <li>Manufacturer of the product only honors the 12 month warranty if you purchase the item directly from them or a professional salon, so use caution when buying elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>It heats up fast, runs through my hair without pulling or getting loose hairs stuck on the edges as I&#x27;ve had happen with</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and thin and requires high heat to straighten without frizz but is also susceptible to frying which requires a ceramic plate that heats evenly.</li>
            <li>I had completely forgotten the name of it up until recently when I found out</li>
            <li>It seems I have to have the plug horizontal, the temperature at the highest setting, and then slowly rotate the the cord and watch for the light to flicker.  </li>
            <li>I had a lot of trouble finding the right iron.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product to anyone who has a busy schedule or does not have the time to play around with the flat iron before even getting a chance to do your hair.</li>
            <li>they did replace the flat iron and so far it hasnt had any repeat problems.  </li>
            <li>I received it while I was in the middle of straightening my hair with my messed up old, Wigo flat iron.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted close to two years before I had trouble.</li>
            <li>My hair is super thick and layered to my shoulders.</li>
            <li>I had to laugh because this product received such high reviews and of course I got the broken one.  </li>
            <li>The first time it lasted about 6 months, this last time it was about 1 month with very little use.</li>

            <li> they did replace the flat iron and so far it hasnt had any repeat problems.  </li>
            <li> I received it while I was in the middle of straightening my hair with my messed up old, Wigo flat iron.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted close to two years before I had trouble.</li>

            <li> I had to laugh because this product received such high reviews and of course I got the broken one.  </li>

            <li> I bought this flat iron after my Chi broke.  </li>
            <li> the flat iron stopped working in one week.</li>
            <li> If Chi standards are what you are looking for in a flat iron...</li>
            <li> and it took 10 minutes to make it flat.</li>
            <li> I ordered it, the expected arrival date was like, 20 something days later</li>
            <li> I ordered a black flat iron and received a blue one</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair... not super curly or thick, but not straight either, so I don&#x27;t have a difficult time finding straightening irons that work, but I wanted one that would leave my hair shiny and smooth, and do it quickly, so I started looking at irons that were a bit more expensive than my usual 25 dollar range.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very careful, and it still catches it on the inside end of the actual iron.      </li>
            <li> I was outside for over an hour and a half getting shopping carts and bringing them inside, and later I did some extreme mopping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this iron going on 3 years and now am having to replace it and only due to wear and tear!  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, long unruly hair that doesn&#x27;t do much of anything</li>
            <li> I wonder if there is a difference in quality between this black version and the blue model, because my mother owns the blue model and has for the past two years without issue...just a thought.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling the same as my chi did if not better.</li>
            <li> I have extremely frizzy and curly hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement due to the cord wearing through.</li>
            <li> I checked other websites for reviews and apparently this is a common problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed since I really love this iron, but purchased a Remington as a replacement.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a Farouk thing because I am very careful that my cord does not get kinked in any way ever since my Chi started giving me problems.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It usually takes around 20-30min to flat iron my hair.</li>
            <li> If I lay down, my hair is frizzy and/or a little wavy when I get up.  </li>
            <li> The way this iron flickers just seems a little odd, so I&#x27;m checking [...] to see what&#x27;s up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Kinda funny that I have tried a few really expensive irons in the past, I have had at least 3 chi&#x27;s and 2 paul mitchell irons.</li>
            <li> It was recommended to me by by hair stylist and is apparently made by CHI but is less expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a picky person when it comes to my hair, but this was definitely a poor choice in a flat iron.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After buying this product nearly 2 years ago, I was happy with it.  It seemed to flat iron hair smoothly.  Now, everytime I use it, I break hair and it gets stuck in the flat iron.  So after only 2 years, I am looking to buy a different kind of straightener.  I would not recommend this product.  I would definitely spend a little extra money to ensure healthy hair.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron and the adjustable heat settings make it even better. It has a nice long cord and it is very slender. I can even use it to get close to my scalp. It gets very hot and i have to go over my hair once. I&#x27;ve had it for over a year and it works just as good as it did the first day i used it.</li>
            <li> I love this product, and not only does it smooth and silk out your hair, but I now know the difference between a iron and ceramic one.  The ceramic while 10 times hotter, will heat up and not burn your hands, but the plates are designed to smooth and silk the hair with the heat, and it&#x27;s awesome.  This product was much better for my hair and I see why, it has helped me uncover the magic of the flat iron.  It&#x27;s better than a regular iron, it does not damage your hair, and since using it, my hair has started back to grow faster now.</li>
            <li> I love this straightener when I can actually get it to turn on.  About two weeks after I bought the Biosilk straightener, it began to not turn on when I would plug it in.  It seems I have to have the plug horizontal, the temperature at the highest setting, and then slowly rotate the the cord and watch for the light to flicker.  If it flickers then I need to concentrate on getting the cord in just a certain spot to get the straightener to turn on.  Once it&#x27;s on, it&#x27;s fine, and the straightener works as well as the Chi I had before it.  I had similar problems with shorts in the cord with my Chi.  I think it&#x27;s a Farouk thing because I am very careful that my cord does not get kinked in any way ever since my Chi started giving me problems.  I would DEFINITELY NOT suggest this straightener to anyone.  A friend of mine also has one of these and her&#x27;s surged and burned off a chunk of her hair.  My hairdresser has said she&#x27;s heard of several people who have had similar troubles.  My suggestion is just don&#x27;t buy Farouk products, they may say they&#x27;re top of the line, but their quality is at the bottom.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I have owned. The first one lasted close to two years before I had trouble. This is easy to use and does the trick!</li>
            <li> This is probably the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever bought. And the price is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> when i recieved my flat iron I was so excited and it did a wonderful job straightening out my hair, but about a week later when I would plug it in, it would not turn on. I had to keep pressing the reset button for a while and trying different outlets it really took me about 20-30 minutes just to get it on. That alone would make the flat iron not even worth the money. If I could find my recipt I would definently return it. I would not recommend this product to anyone who has a busy schedule or does not have the time to play around with the flat iron before even getting a chance to do your hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron after my Chi broke.  The ceramic heat plates on my chi started chipping and before I noticed it was chipping it had fried my hair. It was expensive and I anticipated having it for years so  I dissapointed when it lasted only a year.  I read many reveiws before purchasing this flat iron and I agree with everything I read that this flat iron is worth the money.  I dont think you can beat the price.  It leaves my hair feeling the same as my chi did if not better. I have thick, long high lighted hair and it has not dried out my hair what so ever.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the second Biosilk flat iron I have purchased.  The first for me from a hairdressers warehouse and it cost me much more than the one I purchased on Amazon.  My daughter loves her biosilk as much as I do.  Now I have plans to purchase yet another biosilk for another daughter.</li>
            <li> this product is A+... when it is working.  the flat iron stopped working in one week. it would just turn off by itself.  they did replace the flat iron and so far it hasnt had any repeat problems.  i also bought the blow dryer at the same time.  it dries my hair in fraction of the time and leaves it smooth.  however it will break on you asap.  i bought the hair dryer and in under 6months it stopped blowing hot.  i have returned my blow dryer for service. still waiting for my replacement.</li>
            <li> I bought this item after reading the reviews... however, I regret it.  I had a Chi for 4 years.. it quit turning on..  I couldnt find my box and receipt (go figure!)..  so I needed to buy a new one.  I chose this flat iron, like I said, after reading everyones review of how great it was.  If Chi standards are what you are looking for in a flat iron... Buy a chi!!  Not this one.. Dont settle!</li>
            <li> I ordered a black flat iron and received a blue one and it took over 3 weeks to receive a refund after I made a claim. I will never order from DiscountJungle again!</li>
            <li> First off, I have to say I ordered it and received it within three days instead of ten! I received it while I was in the middle of straightening my hair with my messed up old, Wigo flat iron. I work at a Publix(grocery store) in Florida where humidity is ridiculous. I was outside for over an hour and a half getting shopping carts and bringing them inside, and later I did some extreme mopping. I have extremely frizzy and curly hair. The side of my hair that was straightened with my wigo did not remain straight while the side I used the Biosilk flat iron was still straight, shiny, and silky. I would gladly recommend this flat iron.(:</li>
            <li> By far the best styling tool I&#x27;ve ever owned. It does a beautiful job with little effort and never snags my hair. Easy to go straight or curly with this flat iron.</li>
            <li> Works as good as the Chi with a better price.  I was skeptical about buying it but once I got it home, I was more than pleased.  Great iron!</li>
            <li> My hair is super thick and layered to my shoulders. I am Black/African American and have 2 types of curls- tight and soft, then the coarse naps at the middle-back of my head (about 3\\&quot; in diameter). This iron is FANTASTIC. Seriously. I have a Conair ceramic iron that does okay, but the poof comes back to my hair too soon. This Farouk Biosilk iron is big time goodness. It&#x27;s totally fighting the friz for me. I also use the CHI Iron Guard Spray. I almost bought a CHI (original), but this was $20 cheaper and allowed me to control the temperature. The CHI Turbo was more than I wanted to spend because I&#x27;m a pretty cautious spender. What else? Oh! Some irons get HOT on the outside, but I had this one all the way up to 420F at some parts and the outside never got hot.&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is that the \\&quot;on\\&quot; light quickly flickers once it&#x27;s at full heat.  My&lt;br /&gt;Conair&#x27;s light flashes slow and steadily until it&#x27;s reached the desired temp. That makes sense to me. The way this iron flickers just seems a little odd, so I&#x27;m checking [...] to see what&#x27;s up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, BUY THIS IRON. Seriously. I don&#x27;t leave a LOT of immediate reviews (not many at all for that matter). I&#x27;m in hair love.</li>
            <li> I had this straightener about 5 years ago but unfortunately left it at a hotel in LA :( I had completely forgotten the name of it up until recently when I found out it was this one, I ordered one right away! I had always gotten compliments on how my hair looked and felt with this straightener and it&#x27;s still the same amazing machine :) But what I&#x27;m so impressed with is the seller. I am so happy with the price AND the shipping time was amazing. I ordered it, the expected arrival date was like, 20 something days later but I ended up receiving it  literally two days later! I&#x27;m beyond happy.</li>
            <li> 2014&lt;br /&gt;I loved it, it JUST died on me this morning because my roommate kept pushing the heat past the 420 mark to NO HEAT TERRITORY! Honestly. Anyways. I&#x27;m sure my baby could&#x27;ve done another year or so, but it won&#x27;t. I&#x27;ll miss it :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2010&lt;br /&gt;It usually takes around 20-30min to flat iron my hair. I tried it earlier today before I went to work and it took 10 minutes to make it flat. I&#x27;m sure if I spent more time sectioning it, it would&#x27;ve been really straight. I am pretty impressed with this product. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Possibly it was a floor model,  but it is clear the box was not in new condition nor was the way the iron was packed.&lt;br /&gt;The iron works fine either, but was really turned off by it being a used product.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement due to the cord wearing through. Very happy to see that the cord design was changed to provide additional years of use.</li>
            <li> Have been very happy with this iron.  Does a great job straightening my hair, heats up quickly, and is less expensive than some of the other models.  This is my second one; would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair... not super curly or thick, but not straight either, so I don&#x27;t have a difficult time finding straightening irons that work, but I wanted one that would leave my hair shiny and smooth, and do it quickly, so I started looking at irons that were a bit more expensive than my usual 25 dollar range.  I came across a review for this on another site and decided to try it.  It straightens my hair quickly, and does leave it very shiny and smooth.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a five was that it claims that it locks out humidity, and for the most part it does, but when humidity here is bad and I walk for a 10-15 minutes, I find my hair not as straight and as smooth as when I left.  Overall I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read wonderful reviews about this Biosilk flat iron, so I was really anxious to get it in the mail.  It does straighten my hair, but I feel like my old straightener did a much better job.  If I lay down, my hair is frizzy and/or a little wavy when I get up.  It does the same thing in humid weather.  My old flat iron (GVP brand) kept my hair silky and straight in all kinds of weather and even after I&#x27;d slept on it.      Another thing that bothers me about this straightener is the fact that it catches my hair and pulls some out each time I use it.  I&#x27;m very careful, and it still catches it on the inside end of the actual iron.      I&#x27;m not a picky person when it comes to my hair, but this was definitely a poor choice in a flat iron.  I&#x27;m going to try to contact the company to see if I can return it.</li>
            <li> The Biosilk Ceramic iron I purchased is great! It was recommended to me by by hair stylist and is apparently made by CHI but is less expensive. It works great and I&#x27;ve received many compliments on my hair! It is a fantastic product. My hair is fine and thin and requires high heat to straighten without frizz but is also susceptible to frying which requires a ceramic plate that heats evenly. I had a lot of trouble finding the right iron. This iron heats to 420 degrees and has real ceramic plates (not metal plates coated in ceramic) resulting in even heating. I highly recommend this iron.</li>
            <li> Kinda funny that I have tried a few really expensive irons in the past, I have had at least 3 chi&#x27;s and 2 paul mitchell irons. This iron by far is the BEST one I&#x27;ve had, all the really expensive ones would stop working within a year or so. I&#x27;ve had this iron going on 3 years and now am having to replace it and only due to wear and tear!  3 years is pretty darn good. I also find it extremely funny that its from the same makers as the chi, yet so much cheaper and I feel a better value! I have wavy hair that frizzes up, but this iron keeps my hair straight and shiny, it even makes beautiful shiny curls! I LOVE THIS IRON...would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I purchased this iron after borrowing it many times from my mom.  I have very thick, long unruly hair that doesn&#x27;t do much of anything but frizz when left alone.  This iron works great.  It heats up fast, runs through my hair without pulling or getting loose hairs stuck on the edges as I&#x27;ve had happen with cheaper brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is the iron stopped working after only six months of use (1-3 times a week).  I plug it in and it won&#x27;t turn on, not even if I use the reset button.  I checked other websites for reviews and apparently this is a common problem. Manufacturer of the product only honors the 12 month warranty if you purchase the item directly from them or a professional salon, so use caution when buying elsewhere.  Luckily I contacted the seller via Amazon and they kindly offered to replace my iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Received brand new replacement iron. Iron is right out of the box and it won&#x27;t turn on.  Contacted the seller and received a full refund.  I&#x27;m disappointed since I really love this iron, but purchased a Remington as a replacement. I wonder if there is a difference in quality between this black version and the blue model, because my mother owns the blue model and has for the past two years without issue...just a thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- lightweight, easy to use&lt;br /&gt;- heats up quickly&lt;br /&gt;- different temperature settings&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Iron stopped working after only 6 months&lt;br /&gt;- No automatic shut off button&lt;br /&gt;- No snap closure for travel</li>
            <li> Nice flat iron, not quite as a good a a Chi, but very close. I would recommend this product for the price.</li>
            <li> Purchasing this item turned out to be a good investment.  It was a bargain and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I can only give two stars because I received a defective unit.  It would shut off after 30 seconds.  I had to laugh because this product received such high reviews and of course I got the broken one.  I returned it for a refund and purchased another brand.</li>
            <li> I have been using this item for several months now and would highly recommend it! It is a great buy!</li>
            <li> It catches on my hair and pulls it.  it does not slide as well as my old one did.  I will not buy another one like it again.</li>
            <li> I have bought this item twice now from Amazon from this vendor. The first time it lasted about 6 months, this last time it was about 1 month with very little use. I had previously bought the exact same flat iron from a reputable hair supply store and it had lasted for nearly 6 years. I would not recommend buying ANYTHING from this vendor.</li>
