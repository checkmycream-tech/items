            <li>Although Aurora and Phillip do not actually get married in this film, it is still talked about like they will be getting married very soon, like at age 16.</li>

            <li>Other than those two things, this is a very sweet young love story of a prince and princess who fall for each other, when they don&#x27;t even know they are betrothed to one another already.</li>

            <li>Also, If you have a child who is scared of &amp;#34;villians&amp;#34; in stories, then the bad fairie Maleficent is pretty scary, lol, so you may want to wait until your child is older and can handle it better.</li>
