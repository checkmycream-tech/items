            <li>I have been impressed with every Real Techniques brush that I own.  </li>
            <li>It tends to absorb oil or foundation from my face and make the brush kind of icky/sticky/yucky.</li>
            <li>This real Techniques Powder Brush is awesome.</li>
            <li>Nice quality.</li>

            <li>So soft and perfectly tapered.</li>
            <li>I was not too sure about this brush because it was so cost effective, but after reading some of the reviews posted here</li>
            <li>Again, purchased as a christmas gift for my daughter to complete the set and she was very happy with it!!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best brush for applying it.</li>

            <li>since it&#x27;s so cheap.</li>
            <li>If you want light coverage, then this will probably suit your needs.  </li>
            <li>This brush is fantastic.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.  </li>
            <li>Great big brush and</li>
            <li>This is a great powder brush if you are looking for something that will give low coverage.</li>
            <li>and it so easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Such a great brush.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and does not glob all the makeup in one spot, spreads evenly.  </li>
            <li>This brush is FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>They just don&#x27;t move smoothly across my skin.</li>
            <li>The handle is so comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>The size is fit for foundation.</li>
            <li>I wear my mineral powder with a light hand</li>
            <li>Smooth application.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the brush was smooth and had no complains with it.</li>
            <li>Real Techniques brushes are amazing AND affordable.  </li>
            <li>your basic powder brush, great quality.</li>
            <li>feels smooth on the skin, picks up perfect amount of product, not too heavy or light.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use liquid foundation, only powder, so I need a brush that gives me great coverage, and this one does the trick.  </li>
            <li>As professional makeup artists, we know great artistry is only as good as your techniques and tools.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It does gather a bunch, so touch lightly.  </li>
            <li>fantastic brush.</li>
            <li>It is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Just bought the starter set since I liked this brush so much.</li>
            <li>Can barely fit it into my powder</li>
            <li>cheap makeup brushes do.  </li>
            <li>To get this kind of quality for that kind of price is quite simply, amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love Love Real Tech Brushes-</li>
            <li>I have Sigma, Sedona Lace, Coastal Scents (which are pretty darn good) and Mac brushes and the Real Techniques are my favorites!</li>
            <li>It is really nice, the only thing I am concerned with is I think it might shed at some point, but I am hoping it won&#x27;t because for the price the quality seems nice.</li>
            <li>The bristles are extremely soft and of good quality.</li>
            <li>At first I was super impressed by it but second week into it....</li>
            <li>Love this brush to death, so I got another one for my boyfriend&#x27;s little sister, who loved it!</li>
            <li>Super easy to apply my powders and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The powder brush, in particular, is perfect for powdering &amp; I also use it to bronze occasionally.</li>
            <li>I love it very much.</li>
            <li>the bristles are so soft - really easy to apply a nice and even coat of face powder.  </li>
            <li>u cant beat the price and quality :) very soft and dense :)</li>
            <li>I was so excited about getting this brush.</li>
            <li>For the price they are well worth it!</li>
            <li>Love Real Techniques and this brush is no exception!</li>
            <li>I love Real Techniques brushes!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite real techniques brush!</li>
            <li>Love Real Techniques brushes!</li>
            <li>I LOVE REAL TECHNIQUES!</li>
            <li>I love this so much!</li>
            <li>I usually spend ALOT more on Mac brushes and this one is just as good!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s large, but not annoying so, and I love it for putting powder on my face.</li>
            <li>It is a very large brush, best for over the whole face, you will need a smaller powder brush for under the eyes</li>
            <li>Soft  and big, great for any powders!!</li>
            <li>Nice and soft, and the handle feels ergonomic and is really comfortable to hold and maneuver.</li>
            <li>so ot does a quick job, but not so huge that i can&#x27;t have it in my make-up bag...</li>
            <li>I love that it stands up on end too, comes in handy when you&#x27;re putting on makeup outside of home.</li>
            <li>The brush is so soft and such a perfect size!</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a soft big powder brush for awhile and this one is perfect.  </li>
            <li>NO HAIRS FALL OFF, SUPER SMOOTH,</li>
            <li>i recommend this for everyone who wants good and reasonably priced brush.</li>
            <li>I have tried many make up brushes from high end to more economical.</li>
            <li>The hairs are very soft and nice.</li>
            <li>This brush is amazing quality and is so soft!</li>
            <li>This brush is sooo soft, I love it!</li>
            <li>GREAT FOR LOOSE POWDERS OR YOUR SETTING POWDERS...</li>
            <li>Real Techniques makes super soft and great quality brushes for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean with some gentle soap and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>so Im VERY happy &amp; am a new life long customer of this brand of brushes!</li>
            <li>Like all real techniques brushes, the bristles are smooth, very soft, and really good quality.</li>
            <li>Brush is very nice but also VERY long on bristles.</li>
            <li>I work as a MUA on wknds &amp; for special occasions, so</li>
            <li>head of the brush is really large, which is okay, but the brush lacks the stiffness that helps control application.</li>
            <li>Great brush, I&#x27;m not a makeup artist or even accustomed to using brushes much but found this one fairly easy to use and pretty soft.</li>
            <li>These &#x27;Real Techniques&#x27; brushes are soooo gentle, and they hold the mineral makeup really well, and they wash-up great.  </li>
            <li>Cheap and well worth it.  </li>
            <li>It is a good deal to buy a such high-quality brush with this price.</li>
            <li>Natural no makeup makeup kind of effect.</li>
            <li>I love all real Techniques brushes.  </li>
            <li>In comparison to the Bare Minerals Full Flawless Face it is 25% bigger</li>
            <li>im in love with my real tecniques brushes,</li>
            <li>I love the real Techniques brushes.  </li>
            <li>I love all of the Real Techniques brushes.</li>
            <li>I like full coverage</li>
            <li>I Love all the Real Techniques Brushes .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Awesome...soooo soft, i wash it with my shampoo and another kind of cleanser and none of its bristles came out yet...</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, and I love to use this brush to apply setting powder (HD powder, etc.)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this brush so much.</li>
            <li>Foundation if you want a full coverage looked lightweight, or blush or bronze</li>
            <li>One of my favorite brushes from Real Techniques p.  </li>
            <li>I squeeze out the excess with a towel and its good to go the next morning.</li>
            <li>works like a good powder brush, doesn&#x27;t shed and washes well, it is quite big, didn&#x27;t have any problems with it</li>
            <li>I used it recently with my dream matte powder and loved it.</li>
            <li>So in love with real techniques brushes.  </li>
            <li>I love all of the real Techniques brushes.</li>
            <li>The Real Techniques line of brushes truly is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bristles feel nice and soft</li>
            <li>The brush is nice and soft and does what I need it too.</li>
            <li>Love real Techniques brushes.</li>
            <li>I love real Techniques brushes.  </li>
            <li>Cant believe the price for such a good quality brush.</li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I love it so so much.</li>
            <li>Pretty soft, ginormous brush, fairly dense--great for the price.</li>
            <li>It is easy to wash and dries off very fast.</li>
            <li>Lastly, they look good after washing with a mild shampoo and retain their bristles.  </li>
            <li>it is soft and easy to use :)</li>
            <li>With this brush you&#x27;ll get the exact same quality or BETTER than those you pay 30 or more!</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at how soft it is, and it feels great in the hand to use.</li>
            <li>So soft, does the job and very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve discovered that it picks up just the right amount of product and is so smooth on the skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it to apply loose powder every morning and love it leave a nice, even application.</li>
            <li>By far the best, most soft, dense brush I have ever used ( above Costal Scents, Aveda, Napoleon, Sephora)</li>
            <li>They are soft, pick up enough--but not too much--make-up to blend easily, they clean easily without breakage, don&#x27;t cost a fortune, and</li>
            <li>These brushes are super soft, but most important, do not shed.</li>
            <li>This brush dries quickly too -</li>
            <li>This brush does the trick and feels and functions more like a high priced brush.  </li>
            <li>I needed a new brush to apply my bronzer and the Real Techniques Powder Brush is the most wonderful giant super soft brush ever!</li>
            <li>You Tube fame are beautiful in their workmanship: they do not shed, they are extremely soft(made of Taklon synthetic), and they are not expensive.</li>
            <li>I own some other brushes of Samantha Chapman line and love them all.</li>
            <li>This brush is so large and is easy to apply finishing powder with it.</li>
            <li>The price is super affordable for those who do not want or can&#x27;t spend money on higher ends ones!</li>
            <li>My new favorite for applying powder.</li>
            <li>Great quality which is to be expected with Real Techniques!</li>
            <li>It is beautiful and sturdy and the brush is big and soft.  </li>
            <li>She opened it first time last week after six months of purchase and loved it.</li>
            <li>Very soft, able to pick up pigments well and no shedding!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved every single brush in this range.</li>
            <li>Will buy the others from Real Technique!!</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it so far!</li>
            <li>These girls and this brand can do no wrong!</li>
            <li>I love this powder brush, it works so well, and has kept it&#x27;s shape nicely so far!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more of their brushes!</li>
            <li>I will buy others brushes from real Techniques!!</li>
            <li>Very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I didnt expect anything less... very nice quality for the price.</li>
            <li>- I have loved every single one I have bought!</li>
            <li>Real Techniques products are all very good and have never let me down!</li>
            <li>Such an amazing brush.</li>
            <li>A great firm brush that you could use for both powder and blush.</li>
            <li>Sooooo soft, and the quality is over the top.</li>
            <li>I seriously love the whole Real Techniques line.</li>
            <li>It has a big handle which is nice because you can just stand it upright, but not convenient for traveling because it takes up quite a bit of space.</li>
            <li>I needed a nice, big fluffy brush for my setting powder and this is absolutely perfect and so soft.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite brush so far.</li>
            <li>Second, after using them I find that they pick up and apply products smoothly and without wasting excess product so they help me save even more money on foundation, blush and eye makeup.</li>
            <li>Great quality brush, nice big and fluffy.  </li>
            <li>They are a really nice quality, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I decided it was worth a shot.  </li>
            <li>So my opinion of okay may be far from someone who uses and have used them for awhile.</li>
            <li>but it is kind of too big for me.</li>
            <li>I love the whole real techniques line.</li>
            <li>glad I didn&#x27;t have to drive far out to get it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for awhile too, and you just wash it to keep it fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>It is really fluffy, soft and big.&lt;br /&gt;Great brush for a great price!</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about Real Techniques make up brushes.</li>
            <li>I have always purchased MAC assuming since their make up is so nice the quality of their brushes are the same, but I have to disagree.</li>
            <li>Really was expecting more from real techniques brush.</li>
            <li>The bristles are nice and soft but you can also press a bit of powder on for areas that tend to get really oily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My fav powder so far will still be my XXL Kevyn Aucion, but real Techniques surprise me, good make-up tools with a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I used with it for more full coverage with Bare Minerals foundation.</li>
            <li>The plastic box that came had so many scatches and it would have been mistaken as an old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These brushes are sooo soft, no shedding and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, so big, so soft, easy to clean, met the expectations at all.</li>
            <li>Worth your money.</li>
            <li>This brand  is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Next I will buy the travel brushes kit to keep handy when travelling.</li>
            <li>I have all of Sam (pixiwoo from youtube) brushes and love them they are soft and had no problem with shedding.</li>
            <li>it was brand new, and i love it, thanks five star for this one!</li>
            <li>Is picking just the right amount of product and what is very important , don&#x27;t shed like many other brushes.</li>
            <li>I like the other brushes better by this brand better.  </li>
            <li>Most other brushes seem like blush brushes, and this is definitely more than that.  </li>
            <li>use a stiffer brush for the first layer, then do a quick once-over with this brush.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice fluffy brush.</li>
            <li>Love all of the real Techniques brushes- great quality and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Good bye other brushes.</li>
            <li>right where I want it just prefect</li>
            <li>It picks up just the right amount of powder and distributes the powder evenly.</li>
            <li>its take just the right amount of powder .</li>
            <li>It picks up the right amount of product without over doing it.</li>
            <li>I will find a use for it at some point, but right now it is just sitting in my brush cup.</li>
            <li>so it applies just the right amount of powder.</li>
            <li>Have never had such a great, large, soft powder brush!</li>
            <li>The powder brush in particular is HUGE.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This powder brush is large and full.  </li>
            <li>Very soft, provides all types of coverage depending on my needs, and is easy to wash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very natural and easily blended.</li>
            <li>I love these brush super high quality, very soft bristles.</li>
            <li>Light and fluffy and great for a light, overall dusting of color.</li>
            <li>They are all made of super soft synthetic hair so they are cruelty free, but they function as well as any goat haired brush could.</li>
            <li>also, the bristles are super soft and light, so a ton of product doesn&#x27;t get on your face.</li>
            <li>It really is very full and soft.</li>
            <li>This make-up brush is wonderful!.I love the large size and the large full soft brush it has.</li>
            <li>The brush is a lot bigger than it looks, so setting your make up is very quick!</li>
            <li>Good but not what i was expecting, there are other brushes with the same price wich are so much better.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t truly understand how large this brush is until you see it in person!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a large powder brush and this was it!</li>
            <li>I am a cosmetics professional and absolutely love the Real Techniques brushes.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a great price and apply makeup just like the more expensive \\&quot;professional\\&quot; brushes.</li>
            <li>They are soft and easy to work with.  </li>
            <li>It demonstrates a softer side for those it gets close to, all the while being strong enough to go through the wash and come out clean.</li>
            <li>Super soft, very versatile, and I love it so much.</li>
            <li>Very big and fluffy, perfect for all over the face powder application.</li>
            <li>Extremely soft bristles, easily applies my makeup.</li>
            <li>I  have used this about a week and currently am using it with my Laura Geller Balance-n-Brighten baked foundation and it picked up the product nicely, but not too much product.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shed, the bristles are very soft, and its a huge head of bristles..</li>
            <li>Prior to buying the powder brush, the expert face brush was by far my favorite of my real Techniques brushes; now, it is competing with the powder brush for the top spot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it dries very fast.</li>
            <li>washed the brush before I used it and could not get over how soft and fine</li>
            <li>I use a light facial cleanser or baby shampoo to clean it.  </li>
            <li>It is a big brush, it will spread any powder you use all around your face easily and quickly</li>
            <li>I love a large, soft powder brush and this one is a real keeper.  </li>
            <li>I also love that the bottom of the brush is flat so you can stand it up right.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really soft and just high quality for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing more of these for my friends and myself.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s huge and soft.</li>
            <li>Powder brush is huge, soft and luxurious</li>
            <li>I did not like this brush at all when I first received it.</li>
            <li>but .. I bought the same brush from another website (iherb) and the iherb one was MUCH better</li>
            <li>Im glad they are open now for US customers cause I want the whole line!</li>
            <li>This brush is pretty generously sized.</li>
            <li>First, the brushes are aesthetically pleasing.</li>
            <li>This is my first product from RealTechniques</li>
            <li>This is one of several reasons why I love them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do yourself a favor and add a real Techniques brush (or two) to your collection today!</li>
            <li>It makes the powder look so different and smooth on the skin!</li>
            <li>first time&lt;br /&gt;recommend</li>
            <li>Very affordable and has the quality of high-end brushes!</li>
            <li>Pretty upset.</li>
            <li>These brushes are soft and fantastic at the price.</li>
            <li>I had been using a cheaper brush recently and decided to get myself a better powder brush</li>
            <li>BEAUTY BLENDER IS MY FIRST CHOICE</li>
            <li>I love the grip too and all the colors of the travel essential set, which I also got.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty picky on anything I use on my face.  </li>
            <li>I love it, this is a 2nd one, the first one i purchased from ULTA, and I HAD TO GET ANOTHER ONE.</li>
            <li>Soft to the skin and comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>I already have a MAC powder brush, but wanted something bigger and better, but didn&#x27;t want to spend $40+ on a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brush may not be able to launder money, but it does know when to take out any proof that might rat a girl out when she claims to the local police she wasn&#x27;t wearing makeup when she keyed her exboyfriend&#x27;s truck.</li>
            <li>Haha!)  </li>
            <li>I definitely will be buying more.</li>
            <li>, it is a LOT better than the similarly priced EcoTools brush.  </li>
            <li>This line is a lot better than the similarly priced EcoTools line.</li>
            <li>These are very well made, and they passed the functionally check by my fiance!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time using a powder brush</li>
            <li>Works very well!</li>
            <li>The brush hair is soft and comfortable on skin</li>
            <li>Will purchase more brushes in the future</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, but they truly are the best drugstore brushes out..</li>
            <li>I like so much!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s is proving to be very durable!</li>
            <li>Love the brush, its really big which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li>This was my most recent purchase of theirs.</li>
            <li>ok, I can buy a different brush for that, but this one does do everything that I need it for.</li>
            <li>This is the first time to use this brush.</li>
            <li>This was my first RT brush, and I&#x27;ve since went on to purchase a set.</li>
            <li>Great quality product that should last a long time with the poper care and cleaning.</li>
            <li>Really fluffy, good quality handle and bristles.</li>
            <li>This one already seems to be better quality and at less than half of the price, now I&#x27;m happy that my dog chewed up my MAC brush</li>
            <li>It is a bit large (the circumference of the hairs/bristles), but it does a fantastic job as far as blending and coverage.</li>
            <li>It is so amazing compared to all the other brands.</li>
            <li>and I love that the bottom is flat</li>
            <li>They are far superior to other brushes in the same price range and although I apply makeup every day, I just cannot justify spending 2-5 times the amount (or more in some cases) for a makeup brush that has a &amp;#34;name&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Soft and really big, it applies powder and mineral foundation smoothly and easily.</li>
            <li>So soft, my favorite by far.</li>
            <li>I now have several real Techniques brushes and love them all.</li>
            <li>The brush head is pretty large too, so it applies a generous layer of powder over the face.</li>
            <li>Large brush to apply power, exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li>And it is super soft!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a fan of Real Technique brushes for a while now, and this Powder brush was one of the first I purchased.</li>
            <li>This reasonably priced powder brush works just as well as the higher priced ones.  </li>
            <li>When it arrived the first thing I noticed is that it feels and looks like it is very well made.  </li>
            <li>I first bought a Real Techniques Face brush while on vacation in the UK</li>
            <li>I have some higher priced brushes that don&#x27;t begin to compare to real Techniques products.</li>
            <li>It picks up my pressed &amp; my loose powder just fine &amp; it does not leave any stray hairs on my face!</li>
            <li>Super soft and works like a charm to apply powder or even bronzer.</li>
            <li>Super soft</li>
            <li>This brush is super soft but still applies powder to your face.</li>
            <li>It feels super soft and does not shed.</li>
            <li>It is super soft, doesn&#x27;t have a smell, and doesn&#x27;t shed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I wash the brush does not shed, it&#x27;s super soft.</li>
            <li>but that is easily remedied after deep cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Love this brush, it&#x27;s sof on my skin and helped reduce dry patches</li>
            <li>; brushes this is super soft.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been looking for a large powder brush for ages now&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting this brush to be so large.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no issues using it daily so far, creates such a nice look for all over powder!</li>
            <li>Super soft and gentle on your face.</li>
            <li>Its super soft, and the fact that it stands has been really helpful.</li>
            <li>in all, this brush is gently, does not leave brush hairs behind, and the handle on it is super stylish and comfortable.</li>
            <li>not as smooth as other real techniques brushes but it not bad in density and the shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend the real techniques brushes!</li>
            <li>They are easy to clean w little to no shedding.</li>
            <li>The brush is large, thick, soft, and of great quality.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pick up too much powder which makes my makeup natural and fresh.</li>
            <li>BIG AND FLUFFY WITH GREAT UNSHEDDING QUALITY.</li>
            <li>The coverage isn&#x27;t too much but covers lightly and enough for me.</li>
            <li>I personally find the bristles to be a bit rough/sharp feeling on the skin, which is a huge problem for me.</li>
            <li>This whole Real Techniques line is the living proof of it.</li>
            <li>luv luv all my real technique brushes.</li>
            <li>I read so much about it, and how it makes your skin look pixel-perfect.</li>
            <li>The  brush applies powder very well.  </li>
            <li>the real tech brush by smantha chapman that I have tried is the powder brush.</li>
            <li>I like the finish after which is very flattering on me.</li>
            <li>so I ordered this one, even when I dont wear too much powder.</li>
            <li>It applies foundation and BB cream very well.</li>
            <li>So when I was looking for a powder brush I didn&#x27;t even think twice about getting a real techniques brand brush.</li>
            <li>I would recommend all real techniques brushes.</li>
            <li>It allows for very even makeup application.  </li>
            <li>I am considering getting the rest of the brushes by real techniques</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>The color coded handles are very helpful too.</li>
            <li>rinsed well, wrapped a cloth around it and gave it a gentle squeeze</li>
            <li>I will be replacing all of my brushes with Real Techniques brushes.  </li>
            <li>I really like the feeling of this brush on my face.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in the process of converting all of my brushes over to Real Techniques.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This is a very well made brush.</li>
            <li>Thank you for shipping it so fast.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for making a &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; brush.</li>
            <li>I have ALMOST all of the real technique brushes....</li>
            <li>I didnt expect to like it too much</li>
            <li>I bough all of the real techniques brushes.</li>
            <li>it is the big end on the handle as it won&#x27;t fit in a brush roll.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li>It also feels very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this brush for powder make up application!</li>
            <li>Real techniques brush just freaking blew my mind.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend these make up brushes.</li>
            <li>I have the whole collection of real technique brushes.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Real Techniques Powder Brush about two years ago.  </li>
            <li>This brush is one of my favorites out of their whole collection.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem cheap like some (different brands)</li>
            <li>I wish I had picked up the whole kit while there.</li>
            <li>And I didn&#x27;t try them for the longest time because I turned my nose up at the fact that they were synthetic brushes, however they are soooo much softer than real hair</li>
            <li>Highly recommended !</li>
            <li>Real Technique brushes are my favorites.</li>
            <li>one wonder if these are real products?</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this in the future - let&#x27;s just hope the quality remains the same (or gets better), because otherwise I&#x27;ll have to go hunting for my next favorite brush.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t pick up too much powder though.  </li>
            <li>Do not hesitate to ditch your store-bought brushes and try out the real Techniques brushes</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>I tried it because it was a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I also use this as a buffer brush if I&#x27;ve used too much bronzer or blush.</li>
            <li>That was the whole purpose</li>
            <li>I really like real Techniques brushes.  </li>
            <li>This really does help to get an even application of powder everywhere on the face.</li>
            <li>I have bought a lot of brushes despite not using that much make up.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and the price beats retail stores.</li>
            <li>real techniques brushes &amp; i guess this is d</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s gentle on my face and the bristles don&#x27;t shed like</li>
            <li>I needed a nice fluffy powder brush to help blend my contouring powder into my face.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and smooth and give help give my makeup a really natural finish.</li>
            <li>Really nice and fluffy</li>
            <li>I was delighted to have felt such a soft brush for a low price.</li>
            <li>I own a few others and decided to try this powder brush.</li>
            <li>Soft,  giant, love it.</li>
            <li>this powder brush is so good , soft fluffy n applies well.</li>
            <li>wow!!!</li>
            <li>The brush looked good, I&#x27;ve used other real Techniques brushes, but this one i felt that was just too big for me.</li>
            <li>They are awesome, even in comparison with much more expensive sable hair and other brushes, these girls rock!!!</li>
            <li>very soft, works nicely, wish it was SLIGHTLY less rounded.</li>
            <li>but I was finding that some of the brushes were more coarse than others, even the exact same model.  </li>
            <li>The synthetic bristles are obviously animal friendly.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about this brush is how incredibly soft it is!</li>
            <li>I wash my brushes once a week, but this brush seems like it needs to be washed more often than other brushes for some reason.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll not try other brushes of this brand any more.</li>
            <li>I had  a nice set of MAC brushes that I have used for a long time and they finally wore out.</li>
            <li>All the products I have purchased were amazing and for a little price!</li>
            <li>The brush is very thick, hasn&#x27;t lost many bristles after 6+ months of use, and can be easily cleaned.  </li>
            <li>They are good quality and works better than more expensive brushes!!!</li>
            <li>This powder brush was a lot bigger than I thought it would be but it works great, is very fluffy, and has not shed at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend buying all the brushes from real Techniques.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend Real Techniques.</li>
            <li>The touch was soft and easy to even the extra powder.</li>
            <li>bristles are so soft and it applies my powder even and when I do put my powder on with this brush, the bristles are super soft on my skin</li>
            <li>Its okay thought it was a little large for the size of my compact powder</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend getting it, after trying this brush I will definitely be purchasing more real technique brushes.</li>
            <li>Overall I will be looking for something smaller because this one is too big to create good and even coverage.</li>
            <li>They also clean it very well and dry fast.</li>
            <li>I have been slowly collecting all the Real Technique brushes because i love them!</li>
            <li>Love this brush, I use it for my loose powder on my face, it&#x27;s so soft, hold the product.</li>
            <li>Apart from loose powder, I use this to apply my blush and it gives the most natural look.</li>
            <li>Previously, I had used MAC and bare escentuals brushes and they were okay, but I always had issues with them shedding... on my face!</li>
            <li>I have so far loved every brush from real Techniques, but this one is a definite let down.</li>
            <li>I had a powder brush and didn&#x27;t think I really needed a new one.</li>
            <li>Love this brush, so soft and does the job for loose powders!</li>
            <li>I love the brush but the black part on the bottom, fell off.....</li>
            <li>I love how I can now apply less powder and it is always applied so evenly.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more of these brushes in the future.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly to apply bronzer and blush.  </li>
            <li>I tend to be fairly particular about the brushes that I use/purchase.</li>
            <li>After perusing many reviews I finally settled on this brand for several brushes.</li>
            <li>I use this mainly for blush or powders.</li>
            <li>This brush does a good job with finishing powder and is big and fluffy.  </li>
            <li>This one in particular is very soft and works very well with a setting powder.</li>
            <li>Very soft and spreads powder very evenly.</li>
            <li>There are sets available in this collection that do not duplicate any of the single brushes.</li>
            <li>Very soft too!</li>
            <li>It covers so much, and it&#x27;s so soft!</li>
            <li>Bristles are also very soft!  </li>
            <li>This brush is very soft!</li>
            <li>I have almost all of the real techniques brushes and they are soooo soft and they dont shed!</li>
            <li>High quality, affordable price.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these make up brushes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush.  </li>
            <li>,I look like I got my make up done by a professional:)very highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I decided to get a brush to see how it would work, and this one was so highly rated I went for it.</li>
            <li>It looks and feels high end, I have had no problems with shedding.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i highly reccommend.</li>
            <li>High recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brand for brushes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>but I have high hopes that it will work for that as well.  </li>
            <li>The handle of it just seems so high quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The real techniques brushes are such good quality, so soft and last for a long time.</li>
            <li>This brush is so large and soft</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about this brush, but I am very glad I bought it!</li>
            <li>no animals had their little hairs pulled out to make me look fabulous!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not awful, just a little irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellant bristles soft and functional, use powderapplication with this brush a little at a time, you will love it, hand washout often and gently.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to clean and maintains it&#x27;s shape which has been a real problem for me with other brushes purchased in the past.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and very densely packed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>My old real techniques brush lasted about a year</li>
            <li>It lightly covers my foundation but does not really even look like I have applied any powder.</li>
            <li>They are soft but dense and I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>Could use it for contouring with a light, careful hand.</li>
            <li>They are soft and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I used to be a stubborn natural hair brush fan, but this brush does the work no worse than my Kevyn Aucion, Sonia Kashuk, Laura Mercier and adesigh brushes.</li>
            <li>Very dense, soft bristles, picks up and distributes color evenly.</li>
            <li>the real techniques brushes are so soft and versatile.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s synthetic, unlike natural bristles, this brush does not absorb too much product.  </li>
            <li>The powder doesnt seem cakey, not even pressed powder, which I normally use as a set for foundation.</li>
            <li>The tape was stretched out and top open when it arrived.</li>
            <li>It came in a normal brown box</li>
            <li>Where the stippling brush didn&#x27;t soak the product up enough and just left it dewey on top of your face, the powder does the exact opposite, keeping all the powder for itself.</li>
            <li>Most of my brushes are MAC, but I&#x27;ve had a few new ones that haven&#x27;t been the quality they used to.  </li>
            <li>A tad big for my face, but overall, it works really well with almost any kind of powder (compact or loose).</li>
            <li>I ordered this brush and several other of the real Techniques brushes and really love them.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft enough to feel great against my skin, but firm enough to hold their shape.</li>
            <li>This one is quite large and too big for what I really wanted it for</li>
            <li>I mean she has used her old brush for about 8 years of more?!</li>
            <li>It must have been because it was new.</li>
            <li>Have it already for an about a year and still like new</li>
            <li>Easy to wash, has never EVER shed--and I&#x27;ve had this brush for half a year now.</li>
            <li>I use all MAC products and to be honest to spend $26 on brushes that shed is ridiculous,  </li>
            <li>It is also very durable, and has stood up very well against multiple washes, travel and wear.</li>
            <li>I have do many brushes, cheap and expensive.</li>
            <li>so big and soft worth the money</li>
            <li>Worth spending the money, and is pretty inexpensive compared to other &amp;#34;higher end&amp;#34; brushes!</li>
            <li>Also, it is very soft and none of the hairs have come out since my purchase.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and plush.</li>
            <li>The brush spreads the color evenly and is very soft on the face.</li>
            <li>I am a beauty blogger on youtube so brushes are very vital to my work.</li>
            <li>Very soft and flexible</li>
            <li>very soft brush..</li>
            <li>It takes me a shorter time to apply my powder aswell, since it&#x27;s a pretty big brush.</li>
            <li>the brush is really soft!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this brush to others looking to try out something by Real Techniques!</li>
            <li>It is extremely soft!</li>
            <li>These are the first go to brushes I use, can&#x27;t get enough!</li>
            <li>I received it today and the brush is incredibly soft!</li>
            <li>definitely an added bonus from the creators of Real Techniques!</li>
            <li>and WOW what a difference!  </li>
            <li>so SOFT!....</li>
            <li>I use with my MAC compact mineral powder and get compliments especially when I take the time to apply evenly ;-)</li>
            <li>So incredibly soft!</li>
            <li>This is a big brush, haha!</li>
            <li>(I rarely wear full coverage foundation), I set my makeup with either the Almay Nearly Naked Loose Powder or the Bare Minerals Hydrating Mineral Veil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s holding up well even under trimming down to fit.</li>
            <li>It is soft, I will give it that, but after only a few uses I have already decided I will not be purchasing any more real Techniques brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes</li>
            <li>It is definitely comparable with high end brushes for a much lower price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for applying a thin or thick layer of powder to your face, and it it incredibly soft with a very quality feel to the bristles as well as the handle.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s huge, fluffy, and so soft!!</li>
            <li>Over the past year or so, I have become a huge fan of real Techniques face brushes.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t apply the product so heavy that you look like a cake face, and allows for easy blending.</li>
            <li>It also dried very quickly and retained it shape.</li>
            <li>is handy when switching between this other other brushes.  </li>
            <li>They are very soft and do no irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The brush is very soft and I have not had any fall out of bristles so far.</li>
            <li>since its large, its easy to do a sweep of powder over your entire face quickly without disturbing your foundation too much.</li>
            <li>Soft, professional grade...must buy!</li>
            <li>So far, every time I have washed the brush, any coloring that was on it has come out and the brush still feels just as soft as day one!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s big (but not too big), plush, and it get&#x27;s the job done super well.  </li>
            <li>i use this daily instead of using my mac 134 large powder brush.</li>
            <li>It is a huge fluffy powder brush.</li>
            <li>brush is huge and fluffy, and SO soft on the skin.</li>
            <li>It come in clear plastic  packageing with tape over the opening</li>
            <li>but the water ran clear.</li>
            <li>I am late to the greatness of Real Teachniques brushes, but really glad that I finally joined.</li>
            <li>I like this brush because it is soft and dense.</li>
            <li>and I am surprised with the quality of this one by the price</li>
            <li>The hairs are soft.</li>
            <li>They all work very well and are an essential in your makeup kit.</li>
            <li>Lightweight bristles feel soft on skin.  </li>
            <li>I used to use MAC brushes, and now have only one that I could not find a real Techniques substitute for.  </li>
            <li>The hairs are so soft.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li>soft</li>
            <li>the brissels are so soft &amp; the brush does not shed.</li>
            <li>IT is soft though</li>
            <li>Will be replacing all my old Sephora brushes with these.</li>
            <li>It applies my powder so natural.</li>
            <li>Totally recommend this brush and their whole line.</li>
            <li>cuz it&#x27;s soft yet packed.</li>
            <li>It is holding up very well even after being cleaned and it is still the same texture it was when I bought it.  </li>
            <li>It looks god so far after every day use during a couple of months</li>
            <li>I use this to set my makeup with setting powder or to bronze my face for a natural look.</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase a lot of real technique brushes.</li>
            <li>These days I am using only Real Techniques for my make-up needs.</li>
            <li>bristles don&#x27;t fall out, and are soft on the skin.</li>
            <li>I went through FIVE before finally getting the real techniques brush.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it would work well because it was so soft</li>
            <li>The brushes are always soft and the bristles never shed.  </li>
            <li>, it is a soft brush</li>
            <li>I use this frequently when I am not using my beauty blender.</li>
            <li>I also bought a complete brush set here on amazon called pueen and</li>
            <li>Bristles also were not as soft as the blush brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Washes well, no shedding so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft, and effortlessly applies my finishing powder, bronzer...</li>
            <li>This brush is Sooooooo soft.</li>
            <li>And so soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft but dense.  </li>
            <li>This brush is so soft.  </li>
            <li>No shedding at all, soft but not too soft (does that make sense?</li>
            <li>And when I did begin to use it the bristles aren&#x27;t soft at all.</li>
            <li>The fur is soft.</li>
            <li>This brush is soft, softer than my sigma or eco tool brushes.</li>
            <li>It is not limp like some soft brushes can be.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised with this brush.</li>
            <li>The brush is soft and I like the way it&#x27;s cover the face.</li>
            <li>It distributes the product so well and feels so soft.</li>
            <li>I purchased this brush because I saw the blog of a professional makeup artist in which she notes that this brush is one of her old favorites.</li>
            <li>The finish was clear and natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft that it&#x27;s basically just</li>
            <li>and it was such high quality!</li>
            <li>Soft and no shedding.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is as soft as I thought.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, doesn&#x27;t lose hairs, and is a vegan option for those of us who care.</li>
            <li>I love this brush because its so big and fluffy.</li>
            <li>and she loved it since it wasn&#x27;t expensive</li>
            <li>This one feels like the center is longer than the sides and does not brush on right?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a huge set for only $28 and its pink!</li>
            <li>and they dry fast too!</li>
            <li>So soft and actually measures up to my high end brush.</li>
            <li>Fluffy and super soft!</li>
            <li>Always go back to this name brand for my powder brush since it&#x27;s a decent price.</li>
            <li>feels little too coarse and gets out or place easily.</li>
            <li>I have others from various high ends</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend it, the only reason why i gave it 4 stars is because the packaging was opened when i received it.</li>
            <li>I usually pat on my powder since I have an oily face and the cheap brushes I use to use irritate my face.  </li>
            <li>I use this for applying powder blush and am pretty rough with it.</li>
            <li>big almost same size of sigman large powder brush</li>
            <li>I needed a new powder brush so of coarse</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of these Real Techniques brushes, especially the stippling brush</li>
            <li>I spent the extra money for shipping because it is so worth it.</li>
            <li>Very soft brush and distributes powder equally around my face and</li>
            <li>This is my first RT brush purchase along with 5 other RT brushes.</li>
            <li>Finally figured I&#x27;d break down and buy a new one (after being introduced to Real Techniques eye shadow brushes!)</li>
            <li>way better than the classic expensive brushes..</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t as soft as my other real techniques brushes, and it&#x27;s far too big.</li>
            <li>This soft and fluffy brush is my favorite powder brush for my round face.</li>
            <li>and I was really in need of a powder brush because the one I purchased from elf was a bit too rough.</li>
            <li>the bare minerals brushes seemed to irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have been using ID Bare Minerals brushes for years</li>
            <li>I bought this to apply my bare minerals foundation, and it does not work for me.  </li>
            <li>after several washes, the bristles are all still intact and just as soft as the day I got it.</li>
            <li>This brush is soft and big.</li>
            <li>Bought for bare minerals min veil, which was returned.  </li>
            <li>This is a BIG, soft brush.</li>
            <li>A big brush, really soft.</li>
            <li>Soft &amp; big ...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks now and have no regrets.</li>
            <li>big soft and makes ur make up</li>
            <li>Real Techniques is a good brand, doesn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li>Very, very close in size, shape and texture to the buffing brush from Core Collection set I have previously purchased.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so so soft, and just the right amount of fluffy, and I have never once had to pick any of the hairs off my face!  </li>
            <li>First of all you must use loose powder with this brush because it&#x27;s too big to pick up compacted powder well enough.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very large brush, so it&#x27;s not precise at all.</li>
            <li>Along with all the other real techniques brushes.</li>
            <li>I will try other brushes from real Techniques.</li>
            <li>Just the fact that this brush does not shed makes me want to buy other brushes from Real Techniques as I need them.  </li>
            <li>Bought this and the other matching set by Real Techniques for my fiance...</li>
            <li>Very dense compared to other brushes havent troed washing it yet..</li>
            <li>The brush is also VERY soft on your face and lasts long!</li>
            <li>Fluffy, soft, and durable; can&#x27;t think of much to complain about.</li>
            <li>They are soft, fluffy and appear to be very well made.</li>
            <li>but no, the bristles feel greasy, are hard to clean and do not go back into the shape they should be.</li>
            <li>If you put too small of a handle on it, it won&#x27;t work right.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this, and any of the other RT brushes you are considering.</li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t be happier with this foundation brush!it saves me so much make up!i use about half the amount of product that I did before.it doesn&#x27;t get soaked up by the brush.</li>
            <li>I wanted a big powder brush with long soft bristles.</li>
            <li>I find them the right size and don&#x27;t have a problem with some brushes being too big or too small to do the job.  </li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ve had brushes in the past where bristles of the brush fall out left and right, or the handle falls apart, this is not the case with this brush.</li>
            <li>We belive its not original Real Techniques</li>
            <li>I need brushes I can depend on and real technique never lets me down!</li>
            <li>read the reviews for this brush and considering the price point, thought how good, or bad</li>

            <li> /&gt;Short story, real Technique brushes work great and won&#x27;t break the bank!</li>
            <li> I make my own face powder using cocoa and corn starch</li>
            <li> Real Techniques are the best brushes that I&#x27;ve found for the cost</li>
            <li> Feels really nice on my face and applies the powder evenly.</li>
            <li> I have been impressed with every Real Techniques brush that I own.  </li>
            <li> It tends to absorb oil or foundation from my face and make the brush kind of icky/sticky/yucky.</li>
            <li> This real Techniques Powder Brush is awesome.</li>
            <li> Nice quality.</li>
            <li> But then again it could be some kind of dupe.</li>
            <li> Nice brush.</li>
            <li> Nice feel in hand.</li>
            <li> The brush doesn&#x27;t pick up too much - it picks up the perfect amount.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really one of the best brushes I ever used.</li>
            <li> Real Techniques are the best brushes I have used all year.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice to use to diffuse over-blushing or -bronzing.  </li>
            <li> Nice size to do all over face.</li>
            <li> just go on soo nice.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this company makes just as nice a brush.</li>

            <li> Best brush that I&#x27;ve used so far!!</li>

            <li> They clean up great and are so easy to use!</li>

            <li> so soft, the powder application is perfect, you don&#x27;t look like a cake</li>
            <li> So soft and perfectly tapered.</li>
            <li> I was not too sure about this brush because it was so cost effective, but after reading some of the reviews posted here</li>
            <li> Again, purchased as a christmas gift for my daughter to complete the set and she was very happy with it!!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best brush for applying it.</li>
            <li> This brush is, however, fantastic quality wise.  </li>

            <li> It is so nice, full and seems to be of good quality.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally use it for powder, I like to use this brush as an all over buffing brush, after I finish my makeup to be sure everything is perfectly blended.</li>
            <li> But it does work great for me just to dust a setting powder all over my face, and it is very high quality, so I love it!</li>

            <li> Its huge.</li>
            <li> Her normal set was a Bobbi Brown set, so I was thinking if she uses hundreds of dollars in brushes but stands by this $7 brush, then it must be pretty great.</li>

            <li> Soft  and big, great for any powders!!</li>
            <li> Nice and soft, and the handle feels ergonomic and is really comfortable to hold and maneuver.</li>

            <li> Brush is very nice but also VERY long on bristles.</li>
            <li> I work as a MUA on wknds &amp; for special occasions, so</li>
            <li> head of the brush is really large, which is okay, but the brush lacks the stiffness that helps control application.</li>

            <li> So soft, does the job and very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve discovered that it picks up just the right amount of product and is so smooth on the skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it to apply loose powder every morning and love it leave a nice, even application.</li>
            <li> By far the best, most soft, dense brush I have ever used ( above Costal Scents, Aveda, Napoleon, Sephora)</li>
            <li> They are soft, pick up enough--but not too much--make-up to blend easily, they clean easily without breakage, don&#x27;t cost a fortune, and</li>
            <li> These brushes are super soft, but most important, do not shed.</li>
            <li> This brush dries quickly too -</li>
            <li> This brush does the trick and feels and functions more like a high priced brush.  </li>
            <li> I needed a new brush to apply my bronzer and the Real Techniques Powder Brush is the most wonderful giant super soft brush ever!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve loved every single brush in this range.</li>
            <li> Will buy the others from Real Technique!!</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it so far!</li>
            <li> These girls and this brand can do no wrong!</li>
            <li> I love this powder brush, it works so well, and has kept it&#x27;s shape nicely so far!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more of their brushes!</li>
            <li> I will buy others brushes from real Techniques!!</li>
            <li> Very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I didnt expect anything less... very nice quality for the price.</li>
            <li> - I have loved every single one I have bought!</li>
            <li> Real Techniques products are all very good and have never let me down!</li>
            <li> Such an amazing brush.</li>
            <li> A great firm brush that you could use for both powder and blush.</li>
            <li> Sooooo soft, and the quality is over the top.</li>
            <li> I seriously love the whole Real Techniques line.</li>
            <li> It has a big handle which is nice because you can just stand it upright, but not convenient for traveling because it takes up quite a bit of space.</li>
            <li> I needed a nice, big fluffy brush for my setting powder and this is absolutely perfect and so soft.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite brush so far.</li>
            <li> Second, after using them I find that they pick up and apply products smoothly and without wasting excess product so they help me save even more money on foundation, blush and eye makeup.</li>
            <li> Great quality brush, nice big and fluffy.  </li>
            <li> They are a really nice quality, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I decided it was worth a shot.  </li>
            <li> So my opinion of okay may be far from someone who uses and have used them for awhile.</li>
            <li> but it is kind of too big for me.</li>
            <li> I love the whole real techniques line.</li>
            <li> glad I didn&#x27;t have to drive far out to get it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for awhile too, and you just wash it to keep it fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> It is really fluffy, soft and big.&lt;br /&gt;Great brush for a great price!</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about Real Techniques make up brushes.</li>
            <li> I have always purchased MAC assuming since their make up is so nice the quality of their brushes are the same, but I have to disagree.</li>
            <li> Really was expecting more from real techniques brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles are nice and soft but you can also press a bit of powder on for areas that tend to get really oily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My fav powder so far will still be my XXL Kevyn Aucion, but real Techniques surprise me, good make-up tools with a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I used with it for more full coverage with Bare Minerals foundation.</li>
            <li> The plastic box that came had so many scatches and it would have been mistaken as an old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These brushes are sooo soft, no shedding and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, so big, so soft, easy to clean, met the expectations at all.</li>
            <li> Worth your money.</li>
            <li> This brand  is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Next I will buy the travel brushes kit to keep handy when travelling.</li>
            <li> I have all of Sam (pixiwoo from youtube) brushes and love them they are soft and had no problem with shedding.</li>
            <li> it was brand new, and i love it, thanks five star for this one!</li>
            <li> Is picking just the right amount of product and what is very important , don&#x27;t shed like many other brushes.</li>
            <li> I like the other brushes better by this brand better.  </li>
            <li> Most other brushes seem like blush brushes, and this is definitely more than that.  </li>
            <li> use a stiffer brush for the first layer, then do a quick once-over with this brush.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice fluffy brush.</li>
            <li> Love all of the real Techniques brushes- great quality and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Good bye other brushes.</li>
            <li> right where I want it just prefect</li>
            <li> It picks up just the right amount of powder and distributes the powder evenly.</li>
            <li> its take just the right amount of powder .</li>
            <li> It picks up the right amount of product without over doing it.</li>
            <li> I will find a use for it at some point, but right now it is just sitting in my brush cup.</li>
            <li> so it applies just the right amount of powder.</li>
            <li> Have never had such a great, large, soft powder brush!</li>
            <li> The powder brush in particular is HUGE.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This powder brush is large and full.  </li>
            <li> Very soft, provides all types of coverage depending on my needs, and is easy to wash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very natural and easily blended.</li>
            <li> I love these brush super high quality, very soft bristles.</li>
            <li> Light and fluffy and great for a light, overall dusting of color.</li>
            <li> They are all made of super soft synthetic hair so they are cruelty free, but they function as well as any goat haired brush could.</li>
            <li> also, the bristles are super soft and light, so a ton of product doesn&#x27;t get on your face.</li>
            <li> It really is very full and soft.</li>
            <li> This make-up brush is wonderful!.I love the large size and the large full soft brush it has.</li>
            <li> The brush is a lot bigger than it looks, so setting your make up is very quick!</li>
            <li> Good but not what i was expecting, there are other brushes with the same price wich are so much better.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t truly understand how large this brush is until you see it in person!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a large powder brush and this was it!</li>
            <li> I am a cosmetics professional and absolutely love the Real Techniques brushes.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a great price and apply makeup just like the more expensive \\&quot;professional\\&quot; brushes.</li>
            <li> They are soft and easy to work with.  </li>
            <li> It demonstrates a softer side for those it gets close to, all the while being strong enough to go through the wash and come out clean.</li>
            <li> Super soft, very versatile, and I love it so much.</li>
            <li> Very big and fluffy, perfect for all over the face powder application.</li>
            <li> Extremely soft bristles, easily applies my makeup.</li>
            <li> I  have used this about a week and currently am using it with my Laura Geller Balance-n-Brighten baked foundation and it picked up the product nicely, but not too much product.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shed, the bristles are very soft, and its a huge head of bristles..</li>
            <li> Prior to buying the powder brush, the expert face brush was by far my favorite of my real Techniques brushes; now, it is competing with the powder brush for the top spot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it dries very fast.</li>
            <li> washed the brush before I used it and could not get over how soft and fine</li>
            <li> I use a light facial cleanser or baby shampoo to clean it.  </li>
            <li> It is a big brush, it will spread any powder you use all around your face easily and quickly</li>
            <li> I love a large, soft powder brush and this one is a real keeper.  </li>
            <li> I also love that the bottom of the brush is flat so you can stand it up right.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really soft and just high quality for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing more of these for my friends and myself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s huge and soft.</li>
            <li> Powder brush is huge, soft and luxurious</li>
            <li> I did not like this brush at all when I first received it.</li>
            <li> but .. I bought the same brush from another website (iherb) and the iherb one was MUCH better</li>
            <li> Im glad they are open now for US customers cause I want the whole line!</li>
            <li> This brush is pretty generously sized.</li>
            <li> First, the brushes are aesthetically pleasing.</li>
            <li> This is my first product from RealTechniques</li>
            <li> This is one of several reasons why I love them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do yourself a favor and add a real Techniques brush (or two) to your collection today!</li>
            <li> It makes the powder look so different and smooth on the skin!</li>
            <li> first time&lt;br /&gt;recommend</li>
            <li> Very affordable and has the quality of high-end brushes!</li>
            <li> Pretty upset.</li>
            <li> These brushes are soft and fantastic at the price.</li>
            <li> I had been using a cheaper brush recently and decided to get myself a better powder brush</li>
            <li> BEAUTY BLENDER IS MY FIRST CHOICE</li>
            <li> I love the grip too and all the colors of the travel essential set, which I also got.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky on anything I use on my face.  </li>
            <li> I love it, this is a 2nd one, the first one i purchased from ULTA, and I HAD TO GET ANOTHER ONE.</li>
            <li> Soft to the skin and comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> I already have a MAC powder brush, but wanted something bigger and better, but didn&#x27;t want to spend $40+ on a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush may not be able to launder money, but it does know when to take out any proof that might rat a girl out when she claims to the local police she wasn&#x27;t wearing makeup when she keyed her exboyfriend&#x27;s truck.</li>
            <li> Haha!)  </li>
            <li> I definitely will be buying more.</li>
            <li> , it is a LOT better than the similarly priced EcoTools brush.  </li>
            <li> This line is a lot better than the similarly priced EcoTools line.</li>
            <li> These are very well made, and they passed the functionally check by my fiance!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time using a powder brush</li>
            <li> Works very well!</li>
            <li> The brush hair is soft and comfortable on skin</li>
            <li> Will purchase more brushes in the future</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but they truly are the best drugstore brushes out..</li>
            <li> I like so much!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is proving to be very durable!</li>
            <li> Love the brush, its really big which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This was my most recent purchase of theirs.</li>
            <li> ok, I can buy a different brush for that, but this one does do everything that I need it for.</li>
            <li> This is the first time to use this brush.</li>
            <li> This was my first RT brush, and I&#x27;ve since went on to purchase a set.</li>
            <li> Great quality product that should last a long time with the poper care and cleaning.</li>
            <li> Really fluffy, good quality handle and bristles.</li>
            <li> This one already seems to be better quality and at less than half of the price, now I&#x27;m happy that my dog chewed up my MAC brush</li>
            <li> It is a bit large (the circumference of the hairs/bristles), but it does a fantastic job as far as blending and coverage.</li>
            <li> It is so amazing compared to all the other brands.</li>
            <li> and I love that the bottom is flat</li>
            <li> They are far superior to other brushes in the same price range and although I apply makeup every day, I just cannot justify spending 2-5 times the amount (or more in some cases) for a makeup brush that has a &amp;#34;name&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Soft and really big, it applies powder and mineral foundation smoothly and easily.</li>
            <li> So soft, my favorite by far.</li>
            <li> I now have several real Techniques brushes and love them all.</li>
            <li> The brush head is pretty large too, so it applies a generous layer of powder over the face.</li>
            <li> Large brush to apply power, exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li> And it is super soft!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Real Technique brushes for a while now, and this Powder brush was one of the first I purchased.</li>
            <li> This reasonably priced powder brush works just as well as the higher priced ones.  </li>
            <li> When it arrived the first thing I noticed is that it feels and looks like it is very well made.  </li>
            <li> I first bought a Real Techniques Face brush while on vacation in the UK</li>
            <li> I have some higher priced brushes that don&#x27;t begin to compare to real Techniques products.</li>
            <li> It picks up my pressed &amp; my loose powder just fine &amp; it does not leave any stray hairs on my face!</li>
            <li> Super soft and works like a charm to apply powder or even bronzer.</li>
            <li> Super soft</li>
            <li> This brush is super soft but still applies powder to your face.</li>
            <li> It feels super soft and does not shed.</li>
            <li> It is super soft, doesn&#x27;t have a smell, and doesn&#x27;t shed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I wash the brush does not shed, it&#x27;s super soft.</li>
            <li> but that is easily remedied after deep cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Love this brush, it&#x27;s sof on my skin and helped reduce dry patches</li>
            <li> ; brushes this is super soft.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been looking for a large powder brush for ages now&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting this brush to be so large.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no issues using it daily so far, creates such a nice look for all over powder!</li>
            <li> Super soft and gentle on your face.</li>
            <li> Its super soft, and the fact that it stands has been really helpful.</li>
            <li> in all, this brush is gently, does not leave brush hairs behind, and the handle on it is super stylish and comfortable.</li>
            <li> not as smooth as other real techniques brushes but it not bad in density and the shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend the real techniques brushes!</li>
            <li> They are easy to clean w little to no shedding.</li>
            <li> The brush is large, thick, soft, and of great quality.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pick up too much powder which makes my makeup natural and fresh.</li>
            <li> BIG AND FLUFFY WITH GREAT UNSHEDDING QUALITY.</li>
            <li> The coverage isn&#x27;t too much but covers lightly and enough for me.</li>
            <li> I personally find the bristles to be a bit rough/sharp feeling on the skin, which is a huge problem for me.</li>
            <li> This whole Real Techniques line is the living proof of it.</li>
            <li> luv luv all my real technique brushes.</li>
            <li> I read so much about it, and how it makes your skin look pixel-perfect.</li>
            <li> The  brush applies powder very well.  </li>
            <li> the real tech brush by smantha chapman that I have tried is the powder brush.</li>
            <li> I like the finish after which is very flattering on me.</li>
            <li> so I ordered this one, even when I dont wear too much powder.</li>
            <li> It applies foundation and BB cream very well.</li>
            <li> So when I was looking for a powder brush I didn&#x27;t even think twice about getting a real techniques brand brush.</li>
            <li> I would recommend all real techniques brushes.</li>
            <li> It allows for very even makeup application.  </li>
            <li> I am considering getting the rest of the brushes by real techniques</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> The color coded handles are very helpful too.</li>
            <li> rinsed well, wrapped a cloth around it and gave it a gentle squeeze</li>
            <li> I will be replacing all of my brushes with Real Techniques brushes.  </li>
            <li> I really like the feeling of this brush on my face.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the process of converting all of my brushes over to Real Techniques.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> This is a very well made brush.</li>
            <li> Thank you for shipping it so fast.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for making a &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; brush.</li>
            <li> I have ALMOST all of the real technique brushes....</li>
            <li> I didnt expect to like it too much</li>
            <li> I bough all of the real techniques brushes.</li>
            <li> it is the big end on the handle as it won&#x27;t fit in a brush roll.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> It also feels very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this brush for powder make up application!</li>
            <li> Real techniques brush just freaking blew my mind.  </li>
            <li> I really recommend these make up brushes.</li>
            <li> I have the whole collection of real technique brushes.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Real Techniques Powder Brush about two years ago.  </li>
            <li> This brush is one of my favorites out of their whole collection.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem cheap like some (different brands)</li>
            <li> I wish I had picked up the whole kit while there.</li>
            <li> And I didn&#x27;t try them for the longest time because I turned my nose up at the fact that they were synthetic brushes, however they are soooo much softer than real hair</li>
            <li> Highly recommended !</li>
            <li> Real Technique brushes are my favorites.</li>
            <li> one wonder if these are real products?</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this in the future - let&#x27;s just hope the quality remains the same (or gets better), because otherwise I&#x27;ll have to go hunting for my next favorite brush.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t pick up too much powder though.  </li>
            <li> Do not hesitate to ditch your store-bought brushes and try out the real Techniques brushes</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> I tried it because it was a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I also use this as a buffer brush if I&#x27;ve used too much bronzer or blush.</li>
            <li> That was the whole purpose</li>
            <li> I really like real Techniques brushes.  </li>
            <li> This really does help to get an even application of powder everywhere on the face.</li>
            <li> I have bought a lot of brushes despite not using that much make up.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and the price beats retail stores.</li>
            <li> real techniques brushes &amp; i guess this is d</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s gentle on my face and the bristles don&#x27;t shed like</li>
            <li> I needed a nice fluffy powder brush to help blend my contouring powder into my face.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and smooth and give help give my makeup a really natural finish.</li>
            <li> Really nice and fluffy</li>
            <li> I was delighted to have felt such a soft brush for a low price.</li>
            <li> I own a few others and decided to try this powder brush.</li>
            <li> Soft,  giant, love it.</li>
            <li> this powder brush is so good , soft fluffy n applies well.</li>
            <li> wow!!!</li>
            <li> The brush looked good, I&#x27;ve used other real Techniques brushes, but this one i felt that was just too big for me.</li>
            <li> They are awesome, even in comparison with much more expensive sable hair and other brushes, these girls rock!!!</li>
            <li> very soft, works nicely, wish it was SLIGHTLY less rounded.</li>
            <li> but I was finding that some of the brushes were more coarse than others, even the exact same model.  </li>
            <li> The synthetic bristles are obviously animal friendly.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this brush is how incredibly soft it is!</li>
            <li> I wash my brushes once a week, but this brush seems like it needs to be washed more often than other brushes for some reason.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll not try other brushes of this brand any more.</li>
            <li> I had  a nice set of MAC brushes that I have used for a long time and they finally wore out.</li>
            <li> All the products I have purchased were amazing and for a little price!</li>
            <li> The brush is very thick, hasn&#x27;t lost many bristles after 6+ months of use, and can be easily cleaned.  </li>
            <li> They are good quality and works better than more expensive brushes!!!</li>
            <li> This powder brush was a lot bigger than I thought it would be but it works great, is very fluffy, and has not shed at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend buying all the brushes from real Techniques.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend Real Techniques.</li>
            <li> The touch was soft and easy to even the extra powder.</li>
            <li> bristles are so soft and it applies my powder even and when I do put my powder on with this brush, the bristles are super soft on my skin</li>
            <li> Its okay thought it was a little large for the size of my compact powder</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend getting it, after trying this brush I will definitely be purchasing more real technique brushes.</li>
            <li> Overall I will be looking for something smaller because this one is too big to create good and even coverage.</li>
            <li> They also clean it very well and dry fast.</li>
            <li> I have been slowly collecting all the Real Technique brushes because i love them!</li>
            <li> Love this brush, I use it for my loose powder on my face, it&#x27;s so soft, hold the product.</li>
            <li> Apart from loose powder, I use this to apply my blush and it gives the most natural look.</li>
            <li> Previously, I had used MAC and bare escentuals brushes and they were okay, but I always had issues with them shedding... on my face!</li>
            <li> I have so far loved every brush from real Techniques, but this one is a definite let down.</li>
            <li> I had a powder brush and didn&#x27;t think I really needed a new one.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, so soft and does the job for loose powders!</li>
            <li> I love the brush but the black part on the bottom, fell off.....</li>
            <li> I love how I can now apply less powder and it is always applied so evenly.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more of these brushes in the future.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly to apply bronzer and blush.  </li>
            <li> I tend to be fairly particular about the brushes that I use/purchase.</li>
            <li> After perusing many reviews I finally settled on this brand for several brushes.</li>
            <li> I use this mainly for blush or powders.</li>
            <li> This brush does a good job with finishing powder and is big and fluffy.  </li>
            <li> This one in particular is very soft and works very well with a setting powder.</li>
            <li> Very soft and spreads powder very evenly.</li>
            <li> There are sets available in this collection that do not duplicate any of the single brushes.</li>
            <li> Very soft too!</li>
            <li> It covers so much, and it&#x27;s so soft!</li>
            <li> Bristles are also very soft!  </li>
            <li> This brush is very soft!</li>
            <li> I have almost all of the real techniques brushes and they are soooo soft and they dont shed!</li>
            <li> High quality, affordable price.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these make up brushes.</li>

            <li> /&gt;i highly reccommend.</li>
            <li> High recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brand for brushes.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> but I have high hopes that it will work for that as well.  </li>
            <li> The handle of it just seems so high quality.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The real techniques brushes are such good quality, so soft and last for a long time.</li>
            <li> This brush is so large and soft</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this brush, but I am very glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> no animals had their little hairs pulled out to make me look fabulous!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not awful, just a little irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Excellant bristles soft and functional, use powderapplication with this brush a little at a time, you will love it, hand washout often and gently.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to clean and maintains it&#x27;s shape which has been a real problem for me with other brushes purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and very densely packed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> My old real techniques brush lasted about a year</li>
            <li> It lightly covers my foundation but does not really even look like I have applied any powder.</li>
            <li> They are soft but dense and I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> Could use it for contouring with a light, careful hand.</li>
            <li> They are soft and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I used to be a stubborn natural hair brush fan, but this brush does the work no worse than my Kevyn Aucion, Sonia Kashuk, Laura Mercier and adesigh brushes.</li>
            <li> Very dense, soft bristles, picks up and distributes color evenly.</li>
            <li> the real techniques brushes are so soft and versatile.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s synthetic, unlike natural bristles, this brush does not absorb too much product.  </li>
            <li> The powder doesnt seem cakey, not even pressed powder, which I normally use as a set for foundation.</li>
            <li> The tape was stretched out and top open when it arrived.</li>
            <li> It came in a normal brown box</li>
            <li> Where the stippling brush didn&#x27;t soak the product up enough and just left it dewey on top of your face, the powder does the exact opposite, keeping all the powder for itself.</li>
            <li> Most of my brushes are MAC, but I&#x27;ve had a few new ones that haven&#x27;t been the quality they used to.  </li>
            <li> A tad big for my face, but overall, it works really well with almost any kind of powder (compact or loose).</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush and several other of the real Techniques brushes and really love them.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are soft enough to feel great against my skin, but firm enough to hold their shape.</li>
            <li> This one is quite large and too big for what I really wanted it for</li>
            <li> I mean she has used her old brush for about 8 years of more?!</li>
            <li> It must have been because it was new.</li>
            <li> Have it already for an about a year and still like new</li>
            <li> Easy to wash, has never EVER shed--and I&#x27;ve had this brush for half a year now.</li>
            <li> I use all MAC products and to be honest to spend $26 on brushes that shed is ridiculous,  </li>
            <li> It is also very durable, and has stood up very well against multiple washes, travel and wear.</li>
            <li> I have do many brushes, cheap and expensive.</li>
            <li> so big and soft worth the money</li>
            <li> Worth spending the money, and is pretty inexpensive compared to other &amp;#34;higher end&amp;#34; brushes!</li>
            <li> Also, it is very soft and none of the hairs have come out since my purchase.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft and plush.</li>
            <li> The brush spreads the color evenly and is very soft on the face.</li>
            <li> I am a beauty blogger on youtube so brushes are very vital to my work.</li>
            <li> Very soft and flexible</li>
            <li> very soft brush..</li>
            <li> It takes me a shorter time to apply my powder aswell, since it&#x27;s a pretty big brush.</li>
            <li> the brush is really soft!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this brush to others looking to try out something by Real Techniques!</li>
            <li> It is extremely soft!</li>
            <li> These are the first go to brushes I use, can&#x27;t get enough!</li>
            <li> I received it today and the brush is incredibly soft!</li>
            <li> definitely an added bonus from the creators of Real Techniques!</li>
            <li> and WOW what a difference!  </li>
            <li> so SOFT!....</li>
            <li> I use with my MAC compact mineral powder and get compliments especially when I take the time to apply evenly ;-)</li>
            <li> So incredibly soft!</li>
            <li> This is a big brush, haha!</li>
            <li> (I rarely wear full coverage foundation), I set my makeup with either the Almay Nearly Naked Loose Powder or the Bare Minerals Hydrating Mineral Veil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s holding up well even under trimming down to fit.</li>
            <li> It is soft, I will give it that, but after only a few uses I have already decided I will not be purchasing any more real Techniques brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes</li>
            <li> It is definitely comparable with high end brushes for a much lower price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for applying a thin or thick layer of powder to your face, and it it incredibly soft with a very quality feel to the bristles as well as the handle.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s huge, fluffy, and so soft!!</li>
            <li> Over the past year or so, I have become a huge fan of real Techniques face brushes.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t apply the product so heavy that you look like a cake face, and allows for easy blending.</li>
            <li> It also dried very quickly and retained it shape.</li>
            <li> is handy when switching between this other other brushes.  </li>
            <li> They are very soft and do no irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The brush is very soft and I have not had any fall out of bristles so far.</li>
            <li> since its large, its easy to do a sweep of powder over your entire face quickly without disturbing your foundation too much.</li>
            <li> Soft, professional grade...must buy!</li>
            <li> So far, every time I have washed the brush, any coloring that was on it has come out and the brush still feels just as soft as day one!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s big (but not too big), plush, and it get&#x27;s the job done super well.  </li>
            <li> i use this daily instead of using my mac 134 large powder brush.</li>
            <li> It is a huge fluffy powder brush.</li>
            <li> brush is huge and fluffy, and SO soft on the skin.</li>
            <li> It come in clear plastic  packageing with tape over the opening</li>
            <li> but the water ran clear.</li>
            <li> I am late to the greatness of Real Teachniques brushes, but really glad that I finally joined.</li>
            <li> I like this brush because it is soft and dense.</li>
            <li> and I am surprised with the quality of this one by the price</li>
            <li> The hairs are soft.</li>
            <li> They all work very well and are an essential in your makeup kit.</li>
            <li> Lightweight bristles feel soft on skin.  </li>
            <li> I used to use MAC brushes, and now have only one that I could not find a real Techniques substitute for.  </li>
            <li> The hairs are so soft.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li> soft</li>
            <li> the brissels are so soft &amp; the brush does not shed.</li>
            <li> IT is soft though</li>
            <li> Will be replacing all my old Sephora brushes with these.</li>
            <li> It applies my powder so natural.</li>
            <li> Totally recommend this brush and their whole line.</li>
            <li> cuz it&#x27;s soft yet packed.</li>
            <li> It is holding up very well even after being cleaned and it is still the same texture it was when I bought it.  </li>
            <li> It looks god so far after every day use during a couple of months</li>
            <li> I use this to set my makeup with setting powder or to bronze my face for a natural look.</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase a lot of real technique brushes.</li>
            <li> These days I am using only Real Techniques for my make-up needs.</li>
            <li> bristles don&#x27;t fall out, and are soft on the skin.</li>
            <li> I went through FIVE before finally getting the real techniques brush.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would work well because it was so soft</li>
            <li> The brushes are always soft and the bristles never shed.  </li>
            <li> , it is a soft brush</li>
            <li> I use this frequently when I am not using my beauty blender.</li>
            <li> I also bought a complete brush set here on amazon called pueen and</li>
            <li> Bristles also were not as soft as the blush brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Washes well, no shedding so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft, and effortlessly applies my finishing powder, bronzer...</li>
            <li> This brush is Sooooooo soft.</li>
            <li> And so soft.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft but dense.  </li>
            <li> This brush is so soft.  </li>
            <li> No shedding at all, soft but not too soft (does that make sense?</li>
            <li> And when I did begin to use it the bristles aren&#x27;t soft at all.</li>
            <li> The fur is soft.</li>
            <li> This brush is soft, softer than my sigma or eco tool brushes.</li>
            <li> It is not limp like some soft brushes can be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised with this brush.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft and I like the way it&#x27;s cover the face.</li>
            <li> It distributes the product so well and feels so soft.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush because I saw the blog of a professional makeup artist in which she notes that this brush is one of her old favorites.</li>
            <li> The finish was clear and natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft that it&#x27;s basically just</li>
            <li> and it was such high quality!</li>
            <li> Soft and no shedding.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is as soft as I thought.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, doesn&#x27;t lose hairs, and is a vegan option for those of us who care.</li>
            <li> I love this brush because its so big and fluffy.</li>
            <li> and she loved it since it wasn&#x27;t expensive</li>
            <li> This one feels like the center is longer than the sides and does not brush on right?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a huge set for only $28 and its pink!</li>
            <li> and they dry fast too!</li>
            <li> So soft and actually measures up to my high end brush.</li>
            <li> Fluffy and super soft!</li>
            <li> Always go back to this name brand for my powder brush since it&#x27;s a decent price.</li>
            <li> feels little too coarse and gets out or place easily.</li>
            <li> I have others from various high ends</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend it, the only reason why i gave it 4 stars is because the packaging was opened when i received it.</li>
            <li> I usually pat on my powder since I have an oily face and the cheap brushes I use to use irritate my face.  </li>
            <li> I use this for applying powder blush and am pretty rough with it.</li>
            <li> big almost same size of sigman large powder brush</li>
            <li> I needed a new powder brush so of coarse</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of these Real Techniques brushes, especially the stippling brush</li>
            <li> I spent the extra money for shipping because it is so worth it.</li>
            <li> Very soft brush and distributes powder equally around my face and</li>
            <li> This is my first RT brush purchase along with 5 other RT brushes.</li>
            <li> Finally figured I&#x27;d break down and buy a new one (after being introduced to Real Techniques eye shadow brushes!)</li>
            <li> way better than the classic expensive brushes..</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t as soft as my other real techniques brushes, and it&#x27;s far too big.</li>
            <li> This soft and fluffy brush is my favorite powder brush for my round face.</li>
            <li> and I was really in need of a powder brush because the one I purchased from elf was a bit too rough.</li>
            <li> the bare minerals brushes seemed to irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have been using ID Bare Minerals brushes for years</li>
            <li> I bought this to apply my bare minerals foundation, and it does not work for me.  </li>
            <li> after several washes, the bristles are all still intact and just as soft as the day I got it.</li>
            <li> This brush is soft and big.</li>
            <li> Bought for bare minerals min veil, which was returned.  </li>
            <li> This is a BIG, soft brush.</li>
            <li> A big brush, really soft.</li>
            <li> Soft &amp; big ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks now and have no regrets.</li>
            <li> big soft and makes ur make up</li>
            <li> Real Techniques is a good brand, doesn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very, very close in size, shape and texture to the buffing brush from Core Collection set I have previously purchased.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so so soft, and just the right amount of fluffy, and I have never once had to pick any of the hairs off my face!  </li>
            <li> First of all you must use loose powder with this brush because it&#x27;s too big to pick up compacted powder well enough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very large brush, so it&#x27;s not precise at all.</li>
            <li> Along with all the other real techniques brushes.</li>
            <li> I will try other brushes from real Techniques.</li>
            <li> Just the fact that this brush does not shed makes me want to buy other brushes from Real Techniques as I need them.  </li>
            <li> Bought this and the other matching set by Real Techniques for my fiance...</li>
            <li> Very dense compared to other brushes havent troed washing it yet..</li>
            <li> The brush is also VERY soft on your face and lasts long!</li>
            <li> Fluffy, soft, and durable; can&#x27;t think of much to complain about.</li>
            <li> They are soft, fluffy and appear to be very well made.</li>
            <li> but no, the bristles feel greasy, are hard to clean and do not go back into the shape they should be.</li>
            <li> If you put too small of a handle on it, it won&#x27;t work right.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this, and any of the other RT brushes you are considering.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t be happier with this foundation brush!it saves me so much make up!i use about half the amount of product that I did before.it doesn&#x27;t get soaked up by the brush.</li>
            <li> I wanted a big powder brush with long soft bristles.</li>
            <li> I find them the right size and don&#x27;t have a problem with some brushes being too big or too small to do the job.  </li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve had brushes in the past where bristles of the brush fall out left and right, or the handle falls apart, this is not the case with this brush.</li>
            <li> We belive its not original Real Techniques</li>
            <li> I need brushes I can depend on and real technique never lets me down!</li>
            <li> read the reviews for this brush and considering the price point, thought how good, or bad</li>
            <li> High quality product for less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various brushes from high end to low end, and this brush was actually a little larger than I thought I&#x27;d prefer my brushes to be.</li>
            <li> I have a few other brushes from techniques and I really like them because they are really soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty positive this brush is a fake.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars, because it is not near as soft as I expected.</li>
            <li> The white ends of the brush are soft but the black parts are very coarse and you will no doubt feel them when you&#x27;re pressing this brush against your face.</li>
            <li> I am totally obsessed with this powder brush now, i&#x27;d say it&#x27;s as good, if not better than the sigma powder</li>
            <li> It is an apropriate size (not too small and not too large).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really that fluffy!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used brushes in the past</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not soft enough for me.</li>
            <li> and I feel like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> would of desired a smaller powder head but did like the long handle.</li>
            <li> After a few spot cleaning rounds, the brush hair tends to fluff up more and loses it&#x27;s compact shape</li>
            <li> It will be worth the little money spent on it, trust me!!!</li>
            <li> I love that it has a large base and often stand it up on the counter.</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s soft and puts the makeup on your skin soooo beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing bad to say about it.</li>
            <li> The one brush I used started getting rough, so went back to using this brush, and can&#x27;t believe how different it works once it is wore in.</li>
            <li> It is much larger than I expected which actually worked out well for me.</li>
            <li> Long enough but not too long.</li>
            <li> this powder brush is big &amp; fluffy h/ever d bristle is not as soft as recommended.</li>
            <li> A Very soft and fluffy brush that distributes face powders evenly.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make the powder go on heavy and is very soft.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I do really recommend this, and even bought my sister one for Christmas this past year as well!</li>
            <li> I use it to apply bronzer when I&#x27;m feeling pale, it applies the product evenly and is very soft.</li>
            <li> It is so fluffy and soft, and the powder sticks on it, leaving no fallout and no powder flying everywhere.</li>
            <li> If what you are looking for is a soft fluffy brush don&#x27;t buy this brush.</li>
            <li> I read in another review that the same company makes eco tools and I looked in a few stores and noted that the packaging looks the same and the manufacturer is the same.</li>
            <li> Sooo soft and fluffy</li>
            <li> so far no bristles have fallen out, its been a few months.</li>
            <li> it was bigger than I expected</li>
            <li> so I decided to get her something she would use everyday to replace her old ones.</li>
            <li> Fluffy brush, soft with no shedding.  </li>
            <li> It is just a bit bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it is not really good for anything else - its large size and loose bristles are ill suited for applying makeup in a precise way.</li>
            <li> OBSESSED with Real Techniques brushes!!!</li>
            <li> have had several other brands of brushes drop hairs on my face, but I have never had a RT brush drop hairs.</li>
            <li> Some of the other reviewers said it is too big but this type of brush is needed in a make up set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stopped using other brushes altogether and those from RT are the only ones I use now.</li>
            <li> other reviewers said the bristles don&#x27;t shed, and after about a month of daily use they haven&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I leave this to air dry</li>
            <li> then let it air dry over night</li>
            <li> would that make it rough, and not soft anymore?</li>
            <li> I do like that it has a flat base that allows it to stand on its own on table tops.  </li>
            <li> so I need to set my makeup with loose powder every day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve applied loose powder and pressed powder with it and had no problems.</li>
            <li> i use it with loose powder</li>
            <li> It holds both loose and pressed powder well and doesn&#x27;t shed at all.</li>
            <li> This is a very fluffy and soft brush.</li>
            <li> Because the bristles are synthetic, it takes a while to dry after I&#x27;ve cleaned it, but that&#x27;s not really a problem.</li>
            <li> even its only a slight pain but quite irritate me...</li>
            <li> This brush is so thick, soft and luxurious I am still amazed by it, even after 6 months of use!  </li>
            <li> I wish it was a LITTLE bit larger</li>
            <li> Samantha color coded her brushes:Purple for the eyes, Pink for finishing, and Gold for face.</li>
            <li> Its big, fluffy, and dense.</li>
            <li> A few of them even had some mysterious liquid on the bristles causing them to be clumped when I received them...</li>
            <li> feel like a fool to have spent hundreds of dollars on brushes from MAC and Bobbi Brown over the years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a BIG fluffy brush to apply my powdered foundation</li>
            <li> The brush head is big and fluffy with medium density.  </li>
            <li> it there was ABSOLUTELY NO SHEDDING.</li>
            <li> , it was so rough even though it was branded.</li>
            <li> It is really not good,and  the brush hair not soft,All in all I am disappointed！</li>
            <li> It stands up on its own, which I like, but as a consequence it has a wide base and takes up a lot of room in my brush holder.  </li>
            <li> and as Ive been using it, the finish of the products I used before, applied with my other brushes, has been left far behind with this brush.</li>
            <li> I ordered this instead of getting another Bare Minerals brush which I have a hard time spending $25 on-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to try some of the other brushes in this line.</li>
            <li> Something is off but not sure, feels like the powder is not evenly distributed when brushed on</li>
            <li> and I like that the &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; does not fall every time you use the brush like some of my other ones.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ever have hairs that fall out like some of my other brushes.</li>
            <li> I prefer these brushes over Mac, Lancome, or any other brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll look to this brand before any other.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this brush -- as well as other &amp;#34;real Techniques&amp;#34; brushes.</li>
            <li> my other powder brush from eco tools.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s not really what it&#x27;s for anyways, so no complaints from me!</li>
            <li> It applies makeup just as well as my other brush, without leaving bits of itself on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Happy me.</li>
            <li> I use it to apply loose powder when setting my foundation and also for blending if I have been a little heavy-handed with the blush or bronzer.  </li>
            <li> only negative is that this brush is really big, making it hard to store.  </li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d never again try an expensive brush, until I heard about real Techniques.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so weird every time I use it I feel like a princess because it&#x27;s so big and fluffy and soft</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong buying real Techniques brushes.  </li>
            <li> After trying out a set of the real Techniques eyeshadow brushes and blush brushes, I knew I could not go wrong purchasing the Powder Brush.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are unevenly cut and the writing is off center.</li>
            <li> so you know it wasn&#x27;t opened but mine was clearly forced open.</li>
            <li> Other reviews sold me on these, and was not let down!</li>
            <li> No one enjoys finding black brush bristles on their face when they look in the mirror.</li>
            <li> This brush is a hidden gem.</li>
            <li> but I wanted a powder brush to use for finishing powder that was denser than my EcoTools powder brush and less dense than my Tarte foundation brush.  </li>
            <li> The brush head broke after less than a year of ownership.</li>
            <li> This brush is one of my favorites it blends so well and help me used less foundation.</li>
            <li> This brush is not scared to knock off a little powder.</li>
            <li> and I wash them with a little dish soap every week,</li>
            <li> I took a risk buying something I had little knowledge of.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at how the brush spread an even coat of powder across my face with little effort required.</li>
            <li> I put my Sigma down and can&#x27;t stop using this one since I got it!</li>
            <li> Hands down!</li>
            <li> I realised that I don&#x27;t need heavy coverage</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday</li>
            <li> it was my mistake and waste of money.</li>
            <li> I was tired of wasting money on brushes that left bristles all over my face, read the reviews here and decided to give this brush a try.</li>
            <li> which I thought would resolve when washed a few times</li>
            <li> I was looking for a nice replacement for my powder brush which shed horribly.  </li>
            <li> I grab for it everyday to set my powder.</li>
            <li> I have a few MAC brushes that I have had forever.  </li>
            <li> the brush dried, I used it to apply Makeup</li>
            <li> foundation.&lt;br /&gt;It distributes products evenly and not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I use this brush everyday for setting my makeup.</li>
            <li> i have a few.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday instead of my Mac and Bobbi brown brushes now.</li>
            <li> The brush got here quickly, I&#x27;m not used to it yet because I usually use a denser brush.</li>
            <li> You really cannot go wrong with these!</li>
            <li> usually I apply with a cotton ball.</li>
            <li> not sure how to wash it tho?</li>
            <li> It is inexpensive and it works the same, if not better, than expensive</li>
            <li> Not sure why.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how this brush will hold up for others if they like heavier applications.</li>
            <li> and I bought a set, plus this individual brush, and needless to say</li>
            <li> Alot of brushes I have tried usually started shedding or the handle separated from brush part.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with the drugstore brushes because they shed so bad and don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Because of it&#x27;s size, it also takes quite a while to dry after washing (about a day and half to two days), which I don&#x27;t really mind terribly at all.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used and washed it a lot and have not experienced shedding or any other problems.</li>
            <li> A lot of ppl have complained that the base is too big: guess what, the bristles are bigger.</li>
            <li> I previously used Mac and Bobbi Brown brushes, but I got tired of picking all the shedding hairs off my face every time I applied my makeup.  </li>
            <li> it was hard to buff on the foundation without getting it all over my eyebrows and hairline.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush seem hard.</li>
            <li> Like all the reviews stated, thick, plush and doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> I purchased a few brushes from &#x27;Paris Presents Incorporated&#x27; and they are all poorly made.</li>
            <li> I grew tired of my Elf brushes breaking and after a few washes the quality deterred</li>
            <li> It is so fluffy!!  </li>
            <li> WOW - I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> I feel little bit uncomfortable with it but hope to get used to it soon...</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m confused.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve washed it twice and have not experienced any shedding.</li>
            <li> poor quality，handle position have many&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will say that because the bristles seem to be hard it does get sort of deformed when it is slightly dirty.</li>
            <li> You will not be sorry to have these brushes.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t prove that this is FAKE</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> : i just saw that this is definitely a fake because it does not even have the logo on it</li>
            <li> - Goldilocks would be pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Major con for me - it just feels weird.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this brand.  </li>
            <li> bought this from amazon and this shades like crazy..</li>
            <li> Wrong!  </li>
            <li> &#x27;&#x27;Quality things are always expensive&#x27;&#x27; WRONG!!</li>
            <li> I have never been disappointed in their products.  </li>
            <li> it did nothing for my face but just flop around awkwardly!  </li>
            <li> Either way I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> As disappointed in this brush as I was the stippling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;scratch，the printed character of logo on the handle is overlap，feel disappointed</li>
            <li> cause I&#x27;m obsessed!!</li>
            <li> This is annoying at best.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The packaging of the item was terrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am late to the greatness of Real Teachniques brushes, but really glad that I finally joined. Sooooo soft, and the quality is over the top. I do plan to purchase more, and plan to purchase soon.</li>
            <li> Love this! Cruelty free!</li>
            <li> Excellent brush! It is an apropriate size (not too small and not too large). Also, it is very soft and none of the hairs have come out since my purchase. Great buy</li>
            <li> I love these brush super high quality, very soft bristles. It&#x27;s just perfect for apply powder.</li>
            <li> Very soft and good quality.</li>
            <li> We belive its not original Real Techniques</li>
            <li> Love this brush for my powder.</li>
            <li> Real techniques what can I say am in love with this brush add very good apply my powder right where I want it just prefect no complain here</li>
            <li> The brush got here quickly, I&#x27;m not used to it yet because I usually use a denser brush.It&#x27;s SOO soft though, so it feels great on your skin. It takes me a shorter time to apply my powder aswell, since it&#x27;s a pretty big brush. I would definitely recommend getting it, after trying this brush I will definitely be purchasing more real technique brushes.</li>
            <li> I love Techniques brushes sooooooo much!!! They are awesome, even in comparison with much more expensive sable hair and other brushes, these girls rock!!!</li>
            <li> I have a few other brushes from techniques and I really like them because they are really soft. This one is quite large and too big for what I really wanted it for but it&#x27;s great for dusting powder on to set your foundation if that is what you are intending it for.</li>
            <li> I seriously love the whole Real Techniques line. I have almost every brush and this one did not disappoint. yes!</li>
            <li> &#x27;&#x27;Quality things are always expensive&#x27;&#x27; WRONG!! This whole Real Techniques line is the living proof of it. You can get extremely good quality products for a good price. They are beyond affordable and do not feel cheap at all. I am very pleased with my brushes and wish all the luck to Sam Chapman. If you&#x27;re still wondering about getting this, don&#x27;t think again, just get it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> Real Techniques brand is amazing, I have more of  Real Technique&#x27;s brushes and of all of the brushes I own this brand its the best. High quality, affordable price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Real Technique brushes for a while now, and this Powder brush was one of the first I purchased. WOW - I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. This brush is amazing quality and is so soft! I tend to use this more for my loose powers and applies effortlessly whilst leaving you with a flawless complextion . It&#x27;s very easy to clean and maintains it&#x27;s shape which has been a real problem for me with other brushes purchased in the past. This brush dries quickly too - I leave this to air dry and it&#x27;s good to use again within 2-3 hours. Excellent buy - I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate in recommending this brush to others and the complete Real Techniques range.</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft and it works great with my powder products, and it doesn&#x27;t cut into the powder and there is not a lot of &amp;#34;fall out&amp;#34; from the products.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this brush. This is now an every day powder brush for me and I use it to set my foundation with powder. The brush is huge and covers a lot of area quickly which make it perfect for hectic mornings before work.</li>
            <li> luv luv all my real technique brushes. this powder brush is so good , soft fluffy n applies well.</li>
            <li> as always real techniques brushes are made well and work great.</li>
            <li> I use this for applying my mineral powder. Love how it is very light but thorough in its application.  I realised that I don&#x27;t need heavy coverage so this was great.  Also washed it many times but so plush</li>
            <li> Fluffy, soft, and durable; can&#x27;t think of much to complain about. It&#x27;s a very large brush, so it&#x27;s not precise at all. It&#x27;s just good for dusting powder. I used it to apply mineral foundation for awhile, but it was so big it was hard to buff on the foundation without getting it all over my eyebrows and hairline. It has a big handle which is nice because you can just stand it upright, but not convenient for traveling because it takes up quite a bit of space. It has held up nicely to repeated and thorough washings. No shedding!</li>
            <li> Love this brush!!! Soft  and big, great for any powders!! I use my banana powder all over my face, also my mineral powder.</li>
            <li> I have this brush and use it every day. All the brushes in this collection from Samantha Chapman of Pixiwoo You Tube fame are beautiful in their workmanship: they do not shed, they are extremely soft(made of Taklon synthetic), and they are not expensive. There are sets available in this collection that do not duplicate any of the single brushes. Samantha color coded her brushes:Purple for the eyes, Pink for finishing, and Gold for face. You will not be sorry to have these brushes. Nice to see them here on Amazon. They were (and still are) available at Ulta Stores. You can go see these amazing brushes and see the sets which also include cases that can stand up!</li>
            <li> Great brush at a great price!</li>
            <li> OMG! i love this powder brush!! Cheap and well worth it.  Its big, fluffy, and dense. NO shedding!  I think it is just as good as Mac and Sephora powder brushes.  I plan to buy more brushes from this line</li>
            <li> perfect! the brush is really soft!</li>
            <li> This brush is AMAZING! I work as a MUA on wknds &amp; for special occasions, so I KNOW good brushes &amp; this one is simply wonderful! I&#x27;m not even gonna say for the price, bc price shouldn&#x27;t even go into factor at how nice &amp; dense this brush is!!..&amp; even better, it&#x27;s never shed that I&#x27;ve seen!..so Im VERY happy &amp; am a new life long customer of this brand of brushes! Best money I&#x27;ve ever spent on a brush! ❤️</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome.  I needed a nice, big fluffy brush for my setting powder and this is absolutely perfect and so soft.  Love it. Great price too.</li>
            <li> Great brush and will buy again</li>
            <li> This soft and fluffy brush is my favorite powder brush for my round face. Definitely a good buy!</li>
            <li> love this brush, it&#x27;s so soft and feels great on skin.</li>
            <li> This make-up brush is wonderful!.I love the large size and the large full soft brush it has.Recommend this make-up powder brush.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Very soft too!</li>
            <li> This is a soft, good quality brush for a good value.</li>
            <li> My favorite foundation brush</li>
            <li> Meh....brush quality is not as good as the reviews claim.  I liked most of brushes by real techniques buy this one&#x27;s brush hair feels little too coarse and gets out or place easily.</li>
            <li> Very nice, soft and good quality. It is a very large brush, best for over the whole face, you will need a smaller powder brush for under the eyes</li>
            <li> This brush is nice and soft - works perfectly for loose powder application.</li>
            <li> My favorite brush powder!</li>
            <li> I love love love this brush! Along with all the other real techniques brushes. It is so fluffy and soft, and the powder sticks on it, leaving no fallout and no powder flying everywhere. Would highly recommend the real techniques brushes!</li>
            <li> My skin is oily so I need to set my makeup with loose powder every day. I like this brush because it is soft and dense. It doesn&#x27;t pick up too much powder which makes my makeup natural and fresh. It is a good deal to buy a such high-quality brush with this price. I will try other brushes from real Techniques.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about getting this brush. I read so much about it, and how it makes your skin look pixel-perfect. I did not like this brush at all when I first received it. It must have been because it was new. The one brush I used started getting rough, so went back to using this brush, and can&#x27;t believe how different it works once it is wore in. I love the feel. The next one I buy, I will give it some time to wear it in.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t prove that this is FAKE but .. I bought the same brush from another website (iherb) and the iherb one was MUCH better quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend buying on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t as soft as my other real techniques brushes, and it&#x27;s far too big.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this brush, but I am very glad I bought it! The bristles are soft and very densely packed.  The  brush applies powder very well.  I would definitely recommend this brush to others looking to try out something by Real Techniques!</li>
            <li> Really fluffy, good quality handle and bristles. I was about to purchase the Sigma and I am surprised with the quality of this one by the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for months and the quality is terrific. No hairs falling out. I will purchase this brand again.</li>
            <li> A Very soft and fluffy brush that distributes face powders evenly.</li>
            <li> This powder brush is great! I was very surprised at how soft it is, and it feels great in the hand to use. I took off one star just because this is probably the largest brush I own! Seriously, it is huge! I wish it were just a bit smaller. But it does work great for me just to dust a setting powder all over my face, and it is very high quality, so I love it! Because of it&#x27;s size, it also takes quite a while to dry after washing (about a day and half to two days), which I don&#x27;t really mind terribly at all. Overall, I do really recommend this, and even bought my sister one for Christmas this past year as well!</li>
            <li> Real Techniques is a good brand, doesn&#x27;t disappointed. nice brush</li>
            <li> This brush is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried! Super soft and gentle on your face. Suitable for applying press powder and blush. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> the real tech brush by smantha chapman that I have tried is the powder brush. I bought some others and will check those. Bought them becoz of the glowing reviews on mkupalley. Have to say it&#x27;s excellent powder brush and applies very nicely. I like the finish after which is very flattering on me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like cacky powdery finishing of my makeup, when anyone can notice and say, oh yeah she has powder on her face. This brush gives me the finishing that I crave for. Natural no makeup makeup kind of effect. When people they are like, does she has powder in her face or not? Is she wearing makeup or not? let them puzzling and you enjoy and love yourself.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft, and the handle feels ergonomic and is really comfortable to hold and maneuver. I would buy more products from this company</li>
            <li> I wanted to get as many RT brushes as I could so I ordered this one, even when I dont wear too much powder. I got it, in perfect conditions and as Ive been using it, the finish of the products I used before, applied with my other brushes, has been left far behind with this brush. The powder doesnt seem cakey, not even pressed powder, which I normally use as a set for foundation. Its super soft, and the fact that it stands has been really helpful. Im glad they are open now for US customers cause I want the whole line!</li>
            <li> The BEST powder brush I have come across. better than some of the HIgh-end brushes I&#x27;ve purchase.  This is my favorite brush so far. Will buy the others from Real Technique!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these make up brushes. For the price they are well worth it! Very soft, able to pick up pigments well and no shedding!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This powder brush is large and full.  It is better than MAC&#x27;s powder brush or Sigmas.&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased the kabuki brush and the 4 brush set!</li>
            <li> Such an amazing brush. It applies foundation and BB cream very well. It leaves a flawless finish. Will probably buy another for travel.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different powder blushes, and this is the best one ever. The bristles are very soft and plush. It picks up just the right amount of powder and distributes the powder evenly. The brush head is pretty large too, so it applies a generous layer of powder over the face. Really love this brush! Have been using it for some time and it does not shed, so that&#x27;s another plus.</li>
            <li> The hairs are soft. Good for applying setting powder. Everyone who makes up should get one.</li>
            <li> The brush does not shed whatsoever. I have others from various high ends and this is one of the best out there. It is easy to wash and dries off very fast.</li>
            <li> This brush is pretty generously sized. Like all real techniques brushes, the bristles are smooth, very soft, and really good quality. Easy to wash, has never EVER shed--and I&#x27;ve had this brush for half a year now. It stands up on its own which is very useful, and is pretty lightweight considering its size. Nice grip.</li>
            <li> I already owned the core collection, the eye brush collection and the expert face brush. So when I was looking for a powder brush I didn&#x27;t even think twice about getting a real techniques brand brush. If what you are looking for is a soft fluffy brush don&#x27;t buy this brush. I wanted a big powder brush with long soft bristles. The bristles on this brush seem hard. On the bright side, it does get the job done. I&#x27;ve applied loose powder and pressed powder with it and had no problems. Have also deep cleaned it and spot cleaned it and had no shedding. I will say that because the bristles seem to be hard it does get sort of deformed when it is slightly dirty. Nothing that doesn&#x27;t get resolved with soap and water.</li>
            <li> I had  a nice set of MAC brushes that I have used for a long time and they finally wore out. I more than received my money&#x27;s worth for them and I was in the market for a set of brushes at a low price. After reviewing the brushes on Sephora and Amazon I decided to give these a try. I am so glad I tried them. First, the brushes are aesthetically pleasing. They look more expensive then they are, which I love. Second, after using them I find that they pick up and apply products smoothly and without wasting excess product so they help me save even more money on foundation, blush and eye makeup. Lastly, they look good after washing with a mild shampoo and retain their bristles.  I read in another review that the same company makes eco tools and I looked in a few stores and noted that the packaging looks the same and the manufacturer is the same. For the prices at Amazon however, I would order additional brushes from Amazon. I like the appearance of the brushes and I received them so quickly that it is more convenient to order them.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this brush and this brand! I would recommend it to anyone!!</li>
            <li> It is extremely soft! I would recommend all real techniques brushes. They all work very well and are an essential in your makeup kit.</li>
            <li> Love it! when iTell u iUse this more then my M.A.C brushes .... YES MAAM !</li>
            <li> This is my first product from RealTechniques and I absolutely love it so far! The bristles are super soft and the application is perfect. Am already thinking about what my next RealTechniques purchase is going to be.</li>
            <li> does the job well.  I like it</li>
            <li> So soft, my favorite by far. Love it</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the brush yet, but at this price point I am astonished. It is so nice, full and seems to be of good quality. Previously, I had used MAC and bare escentuals brushes and they were okay, but I always had issues with them shedding... on my face! This one already seems to be better quality and at less than half of the price, now I&#x27;m happy that my dog chewed up my MAC brush and I found this!</li>
            <li> The best powder brush I&#x27;ve ever tried! Soft and really big, it applies powder and mineral foundation smoothly and easily. After washing it also dries quickly, I really love this product</li>
            <li> This powder brush was a lot bigger than I thought it would be but it works great, is very fluffy, and has not shed at all.</li>
            <li> all my real techniques brushes are my favorite, and I can&#x27;t believe how inexpensive they are! I plan to own everyone of them.</li>
            <li> Love this brush and I would definitely buy again.  The brush is very thick, hasn&#x27;t lost many bristles after 6+ months of use, and can be easily cleaned.  It allows for very even makeup application.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great for applying powder all over. By far the best, most soft, dense brush I have ever used ( above Costal Scents, Aveda, Napoleon, Sephora)</li>
            <li> I had heard a lot of great reviews about this brush from all over and I was really in need of a powder brush because the one I purchased from elf was a bit too rough. This brush is sooo soft, I love it! My setting powder goes on so nicely. I am considering getting the rest of the brushes by real techniques</li>
            <li> I use this everyday. Super easy to apply my powders and easy to clean. Love this brand of brushes.</li>
            <li> I love this brush!! I use it everyday and I&#x27;m so happy I purchased it.  I would recommend it to all of my friends!</li>
            <li> I Absolutely love this brush it is one of the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever bought and I would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> This powder brush is Amazing, I have been using makeup for years and all I ever wanted was a Good set of brushes, I finally found what I was looking for. I use all MAC products and to be honest to spend $26 on brushes that shed is ridiculous,  So I saw this brush and ordered it, I am in love with this brush. I couldn&#x27;t ask for better. It doesn&#x27;t shed, the bristles are very soft, and its a huge head of bristles.. I recommend this product to anyone looking for that perfect powder brush!!</li>
            <li> Lightweight bristles feel soft on skin.  Great price.</li>
            <li> Love the texture. Always go back to this name brand for my powder brush since it&#x27;s a decent price.</li>
            <li> I tried these out b/c the bare minerals brushes seemed to irritate my skin.  These &#x27;Real Techniques&#x27; brushes are soooo gentle, and they hold the mineral makeup really well, and they wash-up great.  100% recommend!!</li>
            <li> Over the past year or so, I have become a huge fan of real Techniques face brushes. I have two expert face brushes, the stippling brush, the foundation brush and this powder brush. Prior to buying the powder brush, the expert face brush was by far my favorite of my real Techniques brushes; now, it is competing with the powder brush for the top spot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is huge and fluffy, and SO soft on the skin. It works perfectly in applying a light layer of powder to the face. I use it as a setting powder. After I&#x27;ve put on my concealer and CC cream (I rarely wear full coverage foundation), I set my makeup with either the Almay Nearly Naked Loose Powder or the Bare Minerals Hydrating Mineral Veil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had several other brands of brushes drop hairs on my face, but I have never had a RT brush drop hairs. This is one of several reasons why I love them. Another is that they are synthetic and therefore cruelty free. Finally, because they are non-porous and therefore don&#x27;t trap bacteria and such in the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last year, I tried another inexpensive line of brushes and had to stop using all the face brushes in the set because they were constantly dropping hairs all over my face. I thought I&#x27;d never again try an expensive brush, until I heard about real Techniques. To get this kind of quality for that kind of price is quite simply, amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and add a real Techniques brush (or two) to your collection today!</li>
            <li> Great quality brush, nice big and fluffy.  Super soft and works like a charm to apply powder or even bronzer.</li>
            <li> I love it! It covers so much, and it&#x27;s so soft! It makes the powder look so different and smooth on the skin!</li>
            <li> I have 14 or 15 Real Technique brushes, and this is just another great one. Sam did an amazing&lt;br /&gt;job with these, truly. These are the first go to brushes I use, can&#x27;t get enough!</li>
            <li> If you want a lighter application for a setting powder, this is perfect! The brush is a lot bigger than it looks, so setting your make up is very quick! Love.</li>
            <li> I love all real Techniques brushes.  They are a fantastic value for the quality.  I used to use MAC brushes, and now have only one that I could not find a real Techniques substitute for.  This brush is amazingly soft and feels great on the skin.  It washes beautifully, and is exactly what I need in a powder brush.</li>
            <li> I love all the RealTechniques brushes! This powder brush is no different from the rest in terms of quality. It&#x27;s big so ot does a quick job, but not so huge that i can&#x27;t have it in my make-up bag...</li>
            <li> It is a big brush, it will spread any powder you use all around your face easily and quickly and it feels so good! The hairs are so soft. Amazing purchase.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive. Feel itchy when using it to apply powder. It&#x27;s just not soft enough for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush for $2. I received it today and the brush is incredibly soft! High quality product for less. Can&#x27;t wait to use it. :-)</li>
            <li> A great setting powder brush. Very soft, provides all types of coverage depending on my needs, and is easy to wash. It is also very durable, and has stood up very well against multiple washes, travel and wear. Worth spending the money, and is pretty inexpensive compared to other &amp;#34;higher end&amp;#34; brushes!</li>
            <li> just give me a perfect cover for my lose powder foundation its take just the right amount of powder .</li>
            <li> At first I was super impressed by it but second week into it....the bristles are falling out in clumps out of one side. I am still debating between sending it back or just throwing it away and finding a replacement</li>
            <li> Just added this baby to my collection.Worth every penny!!! Uber soft, great application and inexpensive. What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> I just love this brush!  Purchased at a beauty store and liked it so much bought one for my sisters!  Tip:  to clean, swish brush in a bit of rubbing alcohol...works great!</li>
            <li> nice price and good product</li>
            <li> I am madly in love with this brush! I put my Sigma down and can&#x27;t stop using this one since I got it! Definitely ordering a back up! I use it for my setting powder on my face. It&#x27;s perfect with my MAC mineralize skinfinish.</li>
            <li> Best Powder brush i&#x27;ve owned in my life! Love Real Techniques and this brush is no exception! The bristles are extremely soft, have great quality at great price!</li>
            <li> Great finishing brush. I also use it for bronzer sometimes .</li>
            <li> First of all you must use loose powder with this brush because it&#x27;s too big to pick up compacted powder well enough. Overall I will be looking for something smaller because this one is too big to create good and even coverage.</li>
            <li> I have had this brush for a while and have been very pleased with it. The brush works well and i have not had a problem with any of the bristles falling out. I think im going to order the blush brush tool</li>
            <li> Best powder brush EVER! Soft, professional grade...must buy! Will definitely buy again and definitely recommend others to buy it. It will be worth the little money spent on it, trust me!!!</li>
            <li> i use it with loose powder</li>
            <li> reaaaaalllllly very nice&lt;br /&gt;great quality&lt;br /&gt;veeery big almost same size of sigman large powder brush&lt;br /&gt;extra soft&lt;br /&gt;no shedding noted when I washe it first time&lt;br /&gt;recommend it to every one personal or for prefessional use</li>
            <li> I ordered this instead of getting another Bare Minerals brush which I have a hard time spending $25 on- this brush is lovely. Super soft and I love that the bottom is flat so you can stand it up. The brush head is much larger than I anticipated, although not problematic. In comparison to the Bare Minerals Full Flawless Face it is 25% bigger I&#x27;d estimate. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week or so now and I really like it. I&#x27;d like to try some of the other brushes in this line. It was a great value for the quality.</li>
            <li> amazing quality &amp; for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. the brissels are so soft &amp; the brush does not shed. i use this daily instead of using my mac 134 large powder brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to give it one anyways! I needed a nice fluffy powder brush to help blend my contouring powder into my face. This works perfectly for that. The bristles are soft and smooth and give help give my makeup a really natural finish. I will definitely be purchasing more of these brushes in the future. I love that it stands up on end too, comes in handy when you&#x27;re putting on makeup outside of home. Great product at an amazing price!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush.  I used it to apply loose powder every morning and love it leave a nice, even application.</li>
            <li> Excellent! im in love with my real tecniques brushes, so soft, the powder application is perfect, you don&#x27;t look like a cake</li>
            <li> I am a cosmetics professional and absolutely love the Real Techniques brushes. They are a really nice quality, especially for the price. They hold up well after washing, fit comfortably in your hand, and do a great job of applying! Make sure you check out the pixiwoo video tutorials on youtube... definitely an added bonus from the creators of Real Techniques!</li>
            <li> I love the quality and price of these brushes. I almost bought a set from another brand for 3x the amount. this is a no brainer!!</li>
            <li> I love it. It&#x27;s soft and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I like the other brushes better by this brand better.  This one feels like the center is longer than the sides and does not brush on right?  Something is off but not sure, feels like the powder is not evenly distributed when brushed on so I had to keep running it over my face to make sure it is even.  IT is soft though and I like that the &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; does not fall every time you use the brush like some of my other ones.</li>
            <li> So soft and perfectly tapered. I love this brush. My new favorite for applying powder. No need to spend hundreds of dollars on brushes to get a quality product. You&#x27;ve found it.</li>
            <li> The brush looked good, I&#x27;ve used other real Techniques brushes, but this one i felt that was just too big for me.</li>
            <li> real brushes are by far the best quality of all the brushes</li>
            <li> So glad I purchase the real.techniques started kit. Now I want all the brushes. Great price and so soft. The color coded handles are very helpful too.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful, soft brush. It is definitely comparable with high end brushes for a much lower price. Will be replacing all my old Sephora brushes with these.</li>
            <li> what can I say about this brush, its great... just its much bigger then I thought it would be.... I feel little bit uncomfortable with it but hope to get used to it soon... I will use it to apply finish powder</li>
            <li> Love this brush! It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve ever found that doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;shed.&amp;#34;  No one enjoys finding black brush bristles on their face when they look in the mirror. This is the solution.</li>
            <li> It applies my powder so natural. I am in love with this brush!! I recommend this brush. Does a fantastic job!</li>
            <li> Perfect brush for powder!</li>
            <li> I can be a bit of a makeup snob.  Most of my brushes are MAC, but I&#x27;ve had a few new ones that haven&#x27;t been the quality they used to.  This brush was extremely affordable and soft and have not had any problems with shedding whatsoever!</li>
            <li> The brush is so soft and such a perfect size! Very affordable and has the quality of high-end brushes! I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This reasonably priced powder brush works just as well as the higher priced ones.  Perfect size for finishing powder or anything else you want to use it for.</li>
            <li> Please buy it from their actual website. . U will b satisfied. .I bought this from amazon and this shades like crazy..it was my mistake and waste of money.</li>
            <li> I had a powder brush and didn&#x27;t think I really needed a new one. It was drugstore brand, cheap, and every time I used it I&#x27;d be picking the hairs off my face. Finally figured I&#x27;d break down and buy a new one (after being introduced to Real Techniques eye shadow brushes!) and WOW what a difference!  It&#x27;s so so soft, and just the right amount of fluffy, and I have never once had to pick any of the hairs off my face!  I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now, have washed it a couple of times with no problem. I used my own shampoo (sulfate free blah blah blah) rinsed well, wrapped a cloth around it and gave it a gentle squeeze then let it air dry over night and it&#x27;s good as new.  Totally recommend this brush and their whole line.</li>
            <li> I love the brush but the black part on the bottom, fell off..... I don&#x27;t get why. I only cleaned it once, and I didn&#x27;t stand it up so i&#x27;m confused. I keep my brushes in a glass container and they are all treated nicely.</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes. Amazing price. These are all my go to brushes now. I have them all.  They are cruelty free and work lovely. Don&#x27;t hesitate to try them !!!</li>
            <li> Really nice and fluffy</li>
            <li> I was tired of wasting money on brushes that left bristles all over my face, read the reviews here and decided to give this brush a try. Glad I did... I use this for applying powder blush and am pretty rough with it. No bristle loss. Great size too!</li>
            <li> My daughter has a severe allergy to most makeups &amp; brushes.  We were told to try these &amp; we both are amazed at how much better her skin is.  These brushes are finer silk &amp; therefore don&#x27;t clog up with tons of makeup &amp; facial oils.  Even though she could go longer between cleanings, she chooses to clean them more often than recommended without any degradation to the brushes.  Very impressed.</li>
            <li> Always loved Real Technique brushes. No shedding, perfect condition when received, no complaints. Shipping was on point. Thanx again! :-)</li>
            <li> A lot of ppl have complained that the base is too big: guess what, the bristles are bigger. If you put too small of a handle on it, it won&#x27;t work right. Second, I like this brush cuz it&#x27;s soft yet packed. It picks up the right amount of product without over doing it. Use it mostly for finishing powders.</li>
            <li> Really great brush! So soft and actually measures up to my high end brush. Don&#x27;t bother with the drugstore brushes because they shed so bad and don&#x27;t last very long. I have had this one a good while with no shed and works great in my powders.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush!  I have been using ID Bare Minerals brushes for years but I was finding that some of the brushes were more coarse than others, even the exact same model.  I was not too sure about this brush because it was so cost effective, but after reading some of the reviews posted here I decided it was worth a shot.  Man am I ever glad I took the chance.  I use it for my face powder and application is perfect every, single time.  This brush is so thick, soft and luxurious I am still amazed by it, even after 6 months of use!  It is holding up very well even after being cleaned and it is still the same texture it was when I bought it.  I will be replacing all of my brushes with Real Techniques brushes.  I am a fan.</li>
            <li> I really like the feeling of this brush on my face. It looks god so far after every day use during a couple of months</li>
            <li> very soft, works nicely, wish it was SLIGHTLY less rounded.</li>
            <li> It is a huge fluffy powder brush.</li>
            <li> The real techniques brushes are such good quality, so soft and last for a long time. I would definitely recommend these brushes they are a great purchase.</li>
            <li> Very good brush for powder. Is picking just the right amount of product and what is very important , don&#x27;t shed like many other brushes.</li>
            <li> I use this to set my makeup with setting powder or to bronze my face for a natural look. Sooo soft and fluffy I look forward to using this brush!</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t be happier with this foundation brush!it saves me so much make up!i use about half the amount of product that I did before.it doesn&#x27;t get soaked up by the brush.The brush blends so well,I look like I got my make up done by a professional:)very highly recommended.I will be buying a lot more as presents!fantastic</li>
            <li> I love the real Techniques brushes.  They are soft, pick up enough--but not too much--make-up to blend easily, they clean easily without breakage, don&#x27;t cost a fortune, and no animals had their little hairs pulled out to make me look fabulous!  I find them the right size and don&#x27;t have a problem with some brushes being too big or too small to do the job.  Frankly, since the user is in control of the brush and cosmetics, I&#x27;ve never understood it when people leave comments like that anyway.  I&#x27;m very happy with them.  They are far superior to other brushes in the same price range and although I apply makeup every day, I just cannot justify spending 2-5 times the amount (or more in some cases) for a makeup brush that has a &amp;#34;name&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short story, real Technique brushes work great and won&#x27;t break the bank!</li>
            <li> I love all of the Real Techniques brushes. This one is no exception. It is a great shape for applying powder, is soft and easy to use. The handle has some heft and they can &amp;#34;stand up&amp;#34; if needed. Great.</li>
            <li> Just another brush to me, I use it from time to time. I make my own face powder using cocoa and corn starch usually I apply with a cotton ball. I decided to get a brush to see how it would work, and this one was so highly rated I went for it. I do not have knowledge of powder brushes, because I never use them before. So my opinion of okay may be far from someone who uses and have used them for awhile.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, I use it for my loose powder on my face, it&#x27;s so soft, hold the product. You could use it as a blush brush too. And you can&#x27;t beat the price! It looks and feels high end, I have had no problems with shedding. I have not washed it yet.</li>
            <li> These girls and this brand can do no wrong! I&#x27;ve loved every single brush in this range. They are all made of super soft synthetic hair so they are cruelty free, but they function as well as any goat haired brush could.</li>
            <li> Great brush.  So happy about this brush because of the price and the quality is so good.  I will definitely purchase a lot of real technique brushes.</li>
            <li> Like all the reviews stated, thick, plush and doesn&#x27;t shed. I recommend this brush to all the powder foundation users! Best brush that I&#x27;ve used so far!!</li>
            <li> I really like this brush. It is much larger than I expected which actually worked out well for me. The hairs are very soft and nice. I&#x27;ve had a problem with brushes shedding the hairs and this one doesn&#x27;t do that at all.</li>
            <li> Real Techniques are the best brushes that I&#x27;ve found for the cost and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use anything else. These brushes NEVER shed and feel amazing. The powder brush, in particular, is perfect for powdering &amp; I also use it to bronze occasionally.</li>
            <li> My old real techniques brush lasted about a year so I decided to buy another! It&#x27;s super soft and the perfect size powder brush. I gave it four stars because after a while some of the bristles start to fall out</li>
            <li> Again, purchased as a christmas gift for my daughter to complete the set and she was very happy with it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty positive this brush is a fake. I purchased a few brushes from &#x27;Paris Presents Incorporated&#x27; and they are all poorly made. The bristles are unevenly cut and the writing is off center. A few of them even had some mysterious liquid on the bristles causing them to be clumped when I received them...which I thought would resolve when washed a few times (maybe it was a protective coating?) but no, the bristles feel greasy, are hard to clean and do not go back into the shape they should be. Pretty upset.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush and It&#x27;s absolutely perfect for foundation or powders. Definitely, comparable to MAC and Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> I love the way this brush applies the powder to my face. It lightly covers my foundation but does not really even look like I have applied any powder. I will be using this brush from now on.</li>
            <li> My favorite bronzer is Chocolate Soliel by Too Faced. This is by far the best brush for applying it. Light and fluffy and great for a light, overall dusting of color.</li>
            <li> This brush is a steal. You can&#x27;t pass up the quality for the price. I have do many brushes, cheap and expensive. This is one of the cheapest and best brushes I own</li>
            <li> One of my favorite brushes. Very, very close in size, shape and texture to the buffing brush from Core Collection set I have previously purchased. Use this as another blush/powder brush. These days I am using only Real Techniques for my make-up needs.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I each have one and we use it primarily for applying mineral make up. The brush spreads the color evenly and is very soft on the face. I prefer it over more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> I like to softness of this brush but it is kind of too big for me.</li>
            <li> the brush works well with powder make up. bristles don&#x27;t fall out, and are soft on the skin.</li>
            <li> i love this powder brush!! it&#x27;s huge, fluffy, and so soft!! it does a great job of applying finishing powder without messing up your foundation. the bristles feel like silk and just glide across the skin. it is my powder brush of choice and i have a lot of brushes. i&#x27;ve used and washed it a lot and have not experienced shedding or any other problems.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a good powder brush. I went through FIVE before finally getting the real techniques brush. This is AMAZING! It holds the product perfectly and does exactly what I need it to do. I am a beauty blogger on youtube so brushes are very vital to my work. I need brushes I can depend on and real technique never lets me down! They are soft but dense and I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> the best ever, esp. since it&#x27;s so cheap.</li>
            <li> This brush is super soft but still applies powder to your face. I didn&#x27;t think it would work well because it was so soft but it was amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought this to apply my bare minerals foundation, and it does not work for me.  I like full coverage, so only dense brushes seem to work.  If you want light coverage, then this will probably suit your needs.  This brush is, however, fantastic quality wise.  I will find a use for it at some point, but right now it is just sitting in my brush cup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so weird every time I use it I feel like a princess because it&#x27;s so big and fluffy and soft&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s great for dusting powder on.</li>
            <li> A tad big for my face, but overall, it works really well with almost any kind of powder (compact or loose).</li>
            <li> so big and soft worth the money great brush i will purchase another one of these much better than my crown brush.</li>
            <li> i recommend this for everyone who wants good and reasonably priced brush. it is soft and easy to use :)</li>
            <li> The price and softness of this brush is definitely a steal you can&#x27;t go wrong. I was delighted to have felt such a soft brush for a low price. A tiny bit of gold on the ferrule was chipped but it didn&#x27;t matter. It&#x27;s THE powder brush to buy especially when you&#x27;re on a budget. I tested it out by jabbing it on my face- no irritation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Low price&lt;br /&gt;*Great quality&lt;br /&gt;*Great reviews&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can you not want it? Save yourself time from thinking whether to buy it or not. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Love this brush.  It is beautiful and sturdy and the brush is big and soft.  Feels really nice on my face and applies the powder evenly.</li>
            <li> I was recommended to buy this by my sister, and I love using it. It is so amazing compared to all the other brands. I would definitely recommend this brush</li>
            <li> Perfect for applying bronzer to neck and chest. Could use it for contouring with a light, careful hand. Very soft and flexible</li>
            <li> I use it to dust off any extra powder I have after I set my liquid foundation with the smashbox halo powder. It feels super soft and does not shed.</li>
            <li> 5 Star Make-Up Brush I Love all the Real Techniques Brushes .&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend everyone Try this Make-Up Brush !!</li>
            <li> I love this brush because its so big and fluffy. I use it to apply my powder, or even bronzer. Would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use this to apply my MU4E powder foundation.  It doesn&#x27;t make the powder go on heavy and is very soft.  Seems durable too.</li>
            <li> I love this. It&#x27;s perfect and costs way less that anything you&#x27;ll find at Sephora. Picks up enough powder, puts it one my face evenly, and it hasn&#x27;t shed at all (I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months)</li>
            <li> love these brushes... hold up well to washing as well.</li>
            <li> These brushes are soft and fantastic at the price. I love the whole real techniques line. The synthetic bristles are obviously animal friendly. They are easy to clean w little to no shedding. Blends beautifully. Cant ask for more for the price!</li>
            <li> So pleased, thank you!</li>
            <li> Love this brand!  I have never been disappointed in their products.  The brushes are always soft and the bristles never shed.  I&#x27;m in the process of converting all of my brushes over to Real Techniques.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this brush is how incredibly soft it is! I had been using a cheaper brush recently and decided to get myself a better powder brush and I noticed the difference of what a good brush can make right away. It applied my powder flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even after several washes, the bristles are all still intact and just as soft as the day I got it. I definitely recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> Awesome...soooo soft, i wash it with my shampoo and another kind of cleanser and none of its bristles came out yet...Excellent quality and excellent price!!!!</li>
            <li> I love it and it is just as nice as the powder brushes at Ulta and Sephora</li>
            <li> I have been impressed with every Real Techniques brush that I own.  The quality is phenomenal for the price.  This is one of my favorites.  It is so soft and creates a beautiful, flawless finish with anything from powder foundation to bronzer to setting powder.  I highly recommend this, and any of the other RT brushes you are considering. I just bought my second powder brush. I use one for my powder foundation and one for my bronzer.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a soft big powder brush for awhile and this one is perfect.  I usually pat on my powder since I have an oily face and the cheap brushes I use to use irritate my face.  This one is affordable and the best powder brush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> very soft brush.. I like it.. not sure how to wash it tho? I use powder only, 2 simple ingredients.. no oil..can i just use soap. would that make it rough, and not soft anymore? suggestions? Thanks</li>
            <li> IT MAKES MY LIQUID FOUNDATION LOOK SO FLAWLESS....I USE THIS WHEN I DONT HAVE MY BEAUTY BLENDER. BEAUTY BLENDER IS MY FIRST CHOICE AND THIS IS DEFINITELY ONE TO COMPARE TO IT</li>
            <li> A must have brush for your collection!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutly love this brush. It is a great all over the face brush. It is super soft, doesn&#x27;t have a smell, and doesn&#x27;t shed.&lt;br /&gt;It is too big for a blush brush though. I use it for my bronzer &amp; finishing powder.&lt;br /&gt;It is my go to powder brush...Even over some Mac &amp; Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, and I love to use this brush to apply setting powder (HD powder, etc.) before and after application of foundation. It&#x27;s huge and soft.</li>
            <li> I love the brush, because it picks up powder evenly and distributes onto my face well. I wash my brushes once a week, but this brush seems like it needs to be washed more often than other brushes for some reason. It tends to absorb oil or foundation from my face and make the brush kind of icky/sticky/yucky. Also, the handle of the brush is too bulky and takes up most of the space in my brush holder Besides that, it is a soft brush and I love it</li>
            <li> Love this brush, so soft and does the job for loose powders!</li>
            <li> This brush is fantastic. I use this frequently when I am not using my beauty blender. It applies all foundations flawlessly.</li>
            <li> LOOOOOOVE THIS BRUSH OMG. MY SISTER HAS ONE AND I JUST HAD TO FOLLOW. BIG AND FLUFFY WITH GREAT UNSHEDDING QUALITY. PERFECT FOR MY LOOSE POWDER APPLICATIONS.</li>
            <li> great for a flawless application of liquid foundation. very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;all of these brushes are great for makeup users.&lt;br /&gt;i highly reccommend.</li>
            <li> The brush is large, thick, soft, and of great quality. I&#x27;ve had no issues using it daily so far, creates such a nice look for all over powder!</li>
            <li> This is a very well made brush. However, I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars, because it is not near as soft as I expected. It holds up great to washing, but if you are looking for a soft brush, this is not it.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty nice brush for the price. The reason I only gave it three starsis because when it arrived it was already open! It come in clear plastic  packageing with tape over the opening so you know it wasn&#x27;t opened but mine was clearly forced open. Gross! The tape was stretched out and top open when it arrived. It came in a normal brown box so I know it wasn&#x27;t squished in transportation.</li>
            <li> not as smooth as other real techniques brushes but it not bad in density and the shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: i just saw that this is definitely a fake because it does not even have the logo on it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the coverage the powder brush leaves on. It picks up powder easily and leaves your face flawless! Thank you for shipping it so fast.</li>
            <li> I love this powder brush, it works so well, and has kept it&#x27;s shape nicely so far! I love the grip too and all the colors of the travel essential set, which I also got.</li>
            <li> This brush is a hidden gem. I use it mainly to apply bronzer and blush.  It&#x27;s good quality and doesn&#x27;t shed.  I prefer it over my MAC face brush.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush so much. It&#x27;s not too big so i don&#x27;t feel like i&#x27;m drowning myself in face powder when i use this. It&#x27;s also very easy to clean and the drying time is just a couple of hours. The design of the handles makes it very comfortable to use since it&#x27;s just the right length.</li>
            <li> This real Techniques Powder Brush is awesome. I adore all their brushes.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a nice replacement for my powder brush which shed horribly.  This is a great choice!  No shedding and it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.  Bristles are also very soft!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky on anything I use on my face.  Being on a budget I had to research the brushes and keep in mind the cost.  To my surprise, this brush is the best I&#x27;ve ever had.  It&#x27;s soft to touch and covers wonderfully.  I will definitely purchase all the brushes I need.  Thank you so much for making a &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; brush. mmdz28</li>
            <li> This powder brush is the bomb.com. I love it, this is a 2nd one, the first one i purchased from ULTA, and I HAD TO GET ANOTHER ONE. It&#x27;s just awesome, evenly applies the powder all over, covers a large space and great for down the neck areas.....I have ALMOST all of the real technique brushes....i have 2 more on my list. YOU WON&#x27;T BE DISSAPOINTED</li>
            <li> This brush is soft and big. Perfect for setting your foundation with powder. I love the quality. I didnt expect to like it too much but I do. I bough all of the real techniques brushes. I also bought a complete brush set here on amazon called pueen and wow!!! It&#x27;s a huge set for only $28 and its pink! Go check it out!</li>
            <li> Great big brush and so far no bristles have fallen out, its been a few months. Very nice quality.</li>
            <li> This is a great powder brush if you are looking for something that will give low coverage. It works great for a light application of powder foundation (never looks cakey) or for finishing powder. It is very soft, holds its shape well even after washing many times, doesn&#x27;t shed, and is a good size. It is sort of big, but not too big. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the big end on the handle as it won&#x27;t fit in a brush roll. It is a great quality brush for the price and I feel like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I use this for everything, besides powder which applies perfect with this. Foundation if you want a full coverage looked lightweight, or blush or bronze</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS BRUSH. I wasn&#x27;t sure about buying from this brand but I&#x27;m so happy I did. I grab for it everyday to set my powder. It grabs the product perfectly and distributes it evenly on the skin. It&#x27;s also very natural and easily blended.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really good and works really well! i love all the brushes of the line and it&#x27;s really cheap to. everywhone should have these brushes in their collection!</li>
            <li> This brush is very big and NOT dense.  it did nothing for my face but just flop around awkwardly!  Bristles also were not as soft as the blush brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is very soft! Nice quality. I don&#x27;t ever have hairs that fall out like some of my other brushes. I love Real Techniques brushes! High recommend.</li>
            <li> Good brush for the price.  Soft to the skin and comfortable to use.  You can also purchase these at Walmart now for around the same price.</li>
            <li> Love love love this brush!! Have never had such a great, large, soft powder brush! I&#x27;m sure you would not regret buying it.</li>
            <li> Bought for bare minerals min veil, which was returned.  So This I use for pressed powder when finishing makeup. It&#x27;s perfect!!!  Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> Love love love this brush. The coverage isn&#x27;t too much but covers lightly and enough for me. The brush is also VERY soft on your face and lasts long!</li>
            <li> Great powder brush! Now I just need to buy some good powder to use it with :P</li>
            <li> Good quality. Very nice brush.</li>
            <li> This has quickly become my favorite complexion brush! I&#x27;ve used various brushes from high end to low end, and this brush was actually a little larger than I thought I&#x27;d prefer my brushes to be. However, I&#x27;ve discovered that it picks up just the right amount of product and is so smooth on the skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washes well, no shedding so far. It also feels very sturdy. Apart from loose powder, I use this to apply my blush and it gives the most natural look. I prefer a contoured look using blush, and although this brush is huge, it still manages to give me that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am getting a second one!</li>
            <li> My daughter raves about these brushes.</li>
            <li> SO SOFT!&lt;br /&gt;and fluffy!!!!&lt;br /&gt;YAAAS!!&lt;br /&gt;worth the price!&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quickly&lt;br /&gt;so glad I didn&#x27;t have to drive far out to get it!&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s my favorite real techniques brush!</li>
            <li> This brush is just what I needed. Big. Some of the other reviewers said it is too big but this type of brush is needed in a make up set. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> As a former employee of both Clinique and Estee Lauder I tend to be fairly particular about the brushes that I use/purchase. After perusing many reviews I finally settled on this brand for several brushes. I am absolutely thrilled with them! They are soft, fluffy and appear to be very well made. I will definitely be purchasing more of their brushes! You really cannot go wrong with these!</li>
            <li> I use to lightly apply blush, or translucent powder, it&#x27;s soft and awesome, I love this brush.</li>
            <li> Love this brush to death, so I got another one for my boyfriend&#x27;s little sister, who loved it! She was admiring mine before I got it for her, so I got one for her for Christmas!&lt;br /&gt;Fluffy and the hairs never fall out. I&#x27;ve had it for awhile too, and you just wash it to keep it fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;Good shipping time.&lt;br /&gt;Totally get this brush!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite brushes from Real Techniques p.  I use it daily and it so easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Very soft great for powdering face or bronzer</li>
            <li> Such a great brush. I use this mainly for blush or powders. When I wash the brush does not shed, it&#x27;s super soft. Such a great deal on these Real Techniques brushes as they work great.</li>
            <li> If you are in the market for a well priced but excellent powder brush, you must buy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like a fool to have spent hundreds of dollars on brushes from MAC and Bobbi Brown over the years. Real Techniques makes super soft and great quality brushes for a fraction of the cost. I&#x27;ve stopped using other brushes altogether and those from RT are the only ones I use now.</li>
            <li> This is great for My mineral foundation.  It goes on smooth and does not glob all the makeup in one spot, spreads evenly.  I love that it has a large base and often stand it up on the counter.</li>
            <li> god brush it was brand new, and i love it, thanks five star for this one! jhg&lt;br /&gt;jhgghgfguvg&lt;br /&gt; jgghdjfjjfkd&#x27; kkhjf kjdhhfhff kikdoslsmdufoflf idldldmdjdidld ofodldjdjhdidpd</li>
            <li> Why buy a more expensive brush? This brush is amazing, the texture of it is amazing and it picks up a lot of product (depending how you manouver it.)&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this brush is gently, does not leave brush hairs behind, and the handle on it is super stylish and comfortable. Even in the package it looked amazing,&lt;br /&gt;but when I used it for the first time it was trully wonderful. If you are looking for a high quality brush, but don&#x27;t want to spend $50 or more, this brush is just as great&lt;br /&gt;or better.</li>
            <li> I love all brushes by this brand. They are extremely well made and apply makeup beautifully! This powder brush is very full and plush and will help you lightly dust setting powder or even a powder foundation. I use it for both.  It cleans up very nicely. I use a light facial cleanser or baby shampoo to clean it.  I squeeze out the excess with a towel and its good to go the next morning. It holds its shape and never disappoints. I&#x27;d highly recommend buying all the brushes from real Techniques. I have almost every brush they offer. They&#x27;re a great price and apply makeup just like the more expensive \\&quot;professional\\&quot; brushes.</li>
            <li> This brush is FANTASTIC. It&#x27;s so soft, and effortlessly applies my finishing powder, bronzer... whatever I&#x27;m using it for that day! Because the bristles are synthetic, it takes a while to dry after I&#x27;ve cleaned it, but that&#x27;s not really a problem. I almost want a second one so that on days when I&#x27;m deep cleaning my brushes I won&#x27;t have to go without it! Highly recommend this brush for powder make up application!</li>
            <li> This brush is Sooooooo soft. I absolutely love it. Its a very big poofy powder brush. I use it every day.</li>
            <li> This is a BIG, soft brush. I don&#x27;t normally use it for powder, I like to use this brush as an all over buffing brush, after I finish my makeup to be sure everything is perfectly blended.</li>
            <li> works like a good powder brush, doesn&#x27;t shed and washes well, it is quite big, didn&#x27;t have any problems with it</li>
            <li> Best powder brush ever,, the price is so reasonable and the quality is 5star,, these are the best brushes i hv ever used and best price..u cant beat the price and quality :) very soft and dense :)</li>
            <li> Very soft and spreads powder very evenly. Love it!</li>
            <li> This brush is OK. I&#x27;ve washed it twice and have not experienced any shedding. Although, it looks like a couple of hairs have shifted out of place. It does what it says, it applies powder to your face just fine. I find it quite scratchy. The white ends of the brush are soft but the black parts are very coarse and you will no doubt feel them when you&#x27;re pressing this brush against your face. It&#x27;s not awful, just a little irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try to invest in a better brush if you can.</li>
            <li> I have a few MAC brushes that I have had forever.  They&#x27;re good brushes and good quality.  I recently decided to get a powder brush, the biggest I could find.  I already have a MAC powder brush, but wanted something bigger and better, but didn&#x27;t want to spend $40+ on a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to avoid inexpensive brushes because they shed and the blending abilities aren&#x27;t the best, but then.  WHOA, HOLD ON.  Real techniques brush just freaking blew my mind.  It is inexpensive and it works the same, if not better, than expensive brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed the brush before I used it and could not get over how soft and fine the bristles felt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the brush dried, I used it to apply Makeup Forever&#x27;s HD Microfinish Powder and holy beautiful skin that will make people jealous, Batman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush and that powder are going to do some amazing things together.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! It is really fluffy, soft and big.&lt;br /&gt;Great brush for a great price! I really love it !</li>
            <li> This is the softest, fluffiest brush ever.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been looking for a large powder brush for ages now&lt;br /&gt;and this is perfect,&lt;br /&gt;i have no negatives points&lt;br /&gt;Buy it, trust me you won&#x27;t regret it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(if your in the u.k order it from here even with shipping its still cheaper than boots!)</li>
            <li> This is by far the best powder brush I have ever used. Having used brands such as MAC and Guerlain I can say that this Real Techniques brush is much more impressive. It holds both loose and pressed powder well and doesn&#x27;t shed at all. Easy to clean with some gentle soap and easy to handle. 100% Recommend.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about Real Techniques make up brushes. I have always purchased MAC assuming since their make up is so nice the quality of their brushes are the same, but I have to disagree. I have the started set, the brush blush and I just ordered the eye shadow kit. LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li> Great product! I am totally obsessed with this powder brush now, i&#x27;d say it&#x27;s as good, if not better than the sigma powder brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very light weight, applies the perfect amount of powder and I use it sometimes to apply my bronzer as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend it, the only reason why i gave it 4 stars is because the packaging was opened when i received it. Other than that, awesome product!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s Beautiful and very practical, I like it so much, I would recommend to all buy this stuff, you Will not regret.</li>
            <li> I love all real techniques brushes!!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m in love with the whole line of Sam&#x27;s brushes , i needed this one cuz it didn&#x27;t come with the sets .. great for setting makeup or even buffing light coverage foundations !</li>
            <li> I really recommend these make up brushes. They are good quality and works better than more expensive brushes!!! I will buy others brushes from real Techniques!!</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It&#x27;s huge. And so soft. I like the fact that the brush is a nice size because it is perfect for applying powder all over your face or even applying bronzer lightly all over to bring warmth to your face. I used it recently with my dream matte powder and loved it. It doesn&#x27;t apply the product so heavy that you look like a cake face, and allows for easy blending. Highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> I have the whole collection of real technique brushes. I am in love!! way better than the classic expensive brushes.. I highly recommend it...</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft but dense.  This definitely delivers the airbrushed results stated on the packaging. This is also great for buffing and blending when you have all your color applied. The bristles are so soft and perfect for the finishing touch.</li>
            <li> So in love with real techniques brushes.  They are soft and easy to work with.  I have just about all of them</li>
            <li> A big brush, really soft. It&#x27;s great when using powder foundation or to set your make-up with. Not made of animal hair, nevertheless of good quality</li>
            <li> I love this powder brush! It&#x27;s the only brush I use for applying setting powder or powder foundation.&lt;br /&gt;It distributes products evenly and not too heavy. It&#x27;s really soft and just high quality for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing more of these for my friends and myself.</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft.  It picks up the right amount of product...and the best part is it is so SOFT!....once again a great and easy brush to clean...and they dry fast too!</li>
            <li> Does a good job of easily distributing the powder on my face for a good price.  Would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> This brush is not scared to knock off a little powder. It demonstrates a softer side for those it gets close to, all the while being strong enough to go through the wash and come out clean. This brush may not be able to launder money, but it does know when to take out any proof that might rat a girl out when she claims to the local police she wasn&#x27;t wearing makeup when she keyed her exboyfriend&#x27;s truck.</li>
            <li> I really love this brush. I&#x27;ve ordered most of the real technique brushes and love them, but this is probably my favorite. I love the size.  Its huge. Perfect for setting foundation with a powder and it never looks cakey. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Best ive ever bought !!</li>
            <li> I love all of the real Techniques brushes. They are very soft and do no irritate my sensitive skin. They apply make-up perfectly! I highly recommend this brand for brushes.</li>
            <li> This brush is HUGE and it works great. I powder with this, and sometimes a bronze with it as well. I prefer these brushes over Mac, Lancome, or any other brush. They work so well and for the price, it&#x27;s awesome! I&#x27;ve had NO shedding and I wash them with a little dish soap every week, my face brushes every time I use them.</li>
            <li> Love this brush.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a BIG fluffy brush to apply my powdered foundation and I&#x27;ve found it!  Most other brushes seem like blush brushes, and this is definitely more than that.  No shedding at all, soft but not too soft (does that make sense? Haha!)  You can&#x27;t go wrong buying real Techniques brushes.  I definitely will be buying more.</li>
            <li> My package came open so I&#x27;m guessing I received a used brush. And when I did begin to use it the bristles aren&#x27;t soft at all. Really was expecting more from real techniques brush. But then again it could be some kind of dupe.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t truly understand how large this brush is until you see it in person! also, the bristles are super soft and light, so a ton of product doesn&#x27;t get on your face. since its large, its easy to do a sweep of powder over your entire face quickly without disturbing your foundation too much. i really love it and i&#x27;m going to order another one for my mom! also, i have washed this one twice so far and haven&#x27;t had any fall out, which is great!</li>
            <li> Great and inexpensive powder brush that doesn&#x27;t shed even after years of use.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Real Techniques Powder Brush about two years ago.  When it arrived the first thing I noticed is that it feels and looks like it is very well made.  After using it for two years I can say that this brush does not shed.  I use it to apply loose powder when setting my foundation and also for blending if I have been a little heavy-handed with the blush or bronzer.  It blends perfectly.  Just the fact that this brush does not shed makes me want to buy other brushes from Real Techniques as I need them.  Great brush.</li>
            <li> .Just what I was looking for.  Now I need a good blush brush.  Guess its time to do more shopping</li>
            <li> The Real Techniques line of brushes truly is outstanding.  I totally didn&#x27;t \\&quot;need\\&quot; this brush but I wanted a powder brush to use for finishing powder that was denser than my EcoTools powder brush and less dense than my Tarte foundation brush.  I bought this one and I have to say, it is a LOT better than the similarly priced EcoTools brush.  This brush does a good job with finishing powder and is big and fluffy.  It grabs the powder well but doesn&#x27;t cake it on like the Tarte foundation brush.  The bristles are nice and soft but you can also press a bit of powder on for areas that tend to get really oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is that this brush is really big, making it hard to store.  It stands up on its own, which I like, but as a consequence it has a wide base and takes up a lot of room in my brush holder.  It&#x27;s not quite as bulky as the Tarte foundation brush though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, I have most of this brush line at this point and the quality is excellent, as is the price.  This line is a lot better than the similarly priced EcoTools line.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many of the Real Technique brushes they are extremely good quality brushes!! This brush is one of my favorites out of their whole collection. Very soft brush and distributes powder equally around my face and you can&#x27;t beat the price. The brushes last forever if you take care of them. I can say without a doubt I would 100% repurchase this product!!!</li>
            <li> Great brush, I&#x27;m not a makeup artist or even accustomed to using brushes much but found this one fairly easy to use and pretty soft. I use with my MAC compact mineral powder and get compliments especially when I take the time to apply evenly ;-)</li>
            <li> I recently needed to upgrade my make up brushes.  Seeing several Utube videos raving about this brush line, I decided to give them a try. I ordered this brush and several other of the real Techniques brushes and really love them.  They are soft and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Bought this and the other matching set by Real Techniques for my fiance... I took a risk buying something I had little knowledge of. Other reviews sold me on these, and was not let down! My fiance loves these brushes, and come to find out, this is a brand carried by ulta. These are very well made, and they passed the functionally check by my fiance! Good price, outstanding quality!</li>
            <li> One of the softest powder brushes I own!</li>
            <li> This brush is so large and is easy to apply finishing powder with it. It evenly distributes the product over the face. The brush is very soft and I have not had any fall out of bristles so far. Its easy to wash and it dries very fast.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; brush. The pros - it isn&#x27;t shedding all over my face. The hairs on the brush aren&#x27;t too compact and aren&#x27;t too sparse - Goldilocks would be pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Major con for me - it just feels weird. The hairs have a sticky feeling. Not sure why. There&#x27;s nothing ON them. They just don&#x27;t move smoothly across my skin.</li>
            <li> The brush head broke after less than a year of ownership.</li>
            <li> Soft &amp; big ... great hair quality, does not shed at all</li>
            <li> This is the only brush I use now to apply my face powder. Perfect. I think is cheap for the amazing quality it has.</li>
            <li> Great brush! Great price! What more can I say? It&#x27;s perfect for applying a thin or thick layer of powder to your face, and it it incredibly soft with a very quality feel to the bristles as well as the handle.</li>
            <li> The fur is soft.The handle is so comfortable to use.I love it very much.The package is good. The size is fit for foundation.</li>
            <li> This brush is soft, softer than my sigma or eco tool brushes. The application is about the same - I wear my mineral powder with a light hand so I&#x27;m not sure how this brush will hold up for others if they like heavier applications. However, I am in love. In love with the fluffiness. It&#x27;s really that fluffy!</li>
            <li> These brushes are super soft, but most important, do not shed. I have three and I love them. I&#x27;ll look to this brand before any other.</li>
            <li> I give 5 start cause it works for me.. definitely better than the elf brushes I was using.. I rather save the bucks and put it toward this brushes.</li>
            <li> I use this brush everyday for setting my makeup. I&#x27;ve already shampooed and washed it and I experienced no shedding. Super soft, very versatile, and I love it so much. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Nice brush. It&#x27;s large, but not annoying so, and I love it for putting powder on my face.</li>
            <li> I lover this brush! Nice feel in hand. Smooth application. Love it</li>
            <li> I needed a new brush to apply my bronzer and the Real Techniques Powder Brush is the most wonderful giant super soft brush ever! I am so happy with it!</li>
            <li> Great powder brush!  It is a bit large (the circumference of the hairs/bristles), but it does a fantastic job as far as blending and coverage. And it is super soft!  It is not limp like some soft brushes can be. Love Real Techniques brushes!</li>
            <li> I used to be a stubborn natural hair brush fan, but this brush does the work no worse than my Kevyn Aucion, Sonia Kashuk, Laura Mercier and adesigh brushes. My fav powder so far will still be my XXL Kevyn Aucion, but real Techniques surprise me, good make-up tools with a reasonable price. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Perfect for mineral makeup.  I used with it for more full coverage with Bare Minerals foundation.</li>
            <li> Love that it doesn&#x27;t shed&lt;br /&gt;Bristles feel nice and soft&lt;br /&gt; I am a big fan of these Real Techniques brushes, especially the stippling brush</li>
            <li> Love it, it&#x27;s the perfect size that I was looking for. Doesn&#x27;t seem cheap like some (different brands) I&#x27;ve ordered before. The brush is nice and soft and does what I need it too.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting this brush to be so large. It really is very full and soft. I thought it would have dyes coming out when I washed it before use but the water ran clear. It also dried very quickly and retained it shape. It picked up my pressed powder well and it came out flawless. I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised with this brush. For the price, it&#x27;s great for an all over powder brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time using a powder brush and I just love it. It&#x27;s so soft and applies very good the powder covering all my face. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The packaging of the item was terrible. The plastic box that came had so many scatches and it would have been mistaken as an old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the brush was smooth and had no complains with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been expanding my brush collection recently and this is a wonderful addition.  I love a large, soft powder brush and this one is a real keeper.  I use it for my setting/finishing powders, blushes and it&#x27;s also great for blending out and softening my face make-up in general.  I haven&#x27;t tried it with my mineral foundation yet but I have high hopes that it will work for that as well.  Real Techniques brushes are amazing AND affordable.  There&#x27;s a saying that goes, &amp;#34;You get what you pay for.&amp;#34;  Wrong!  In this case, you get so much more!  I&#x27;m doing &amp;#34;Beauty On A Budget&amp;#34; and I can&#x27;t see paying $40 for a brush when a $10 one will do the job just as well for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Great item! Works very well!</li>
            <li> This thing is huge and is perfect for setting powder or a natural sun-kissed look with bronzer.</li>
            <li> Love real Techniques brushes. This was a no-brainer. I would recommend this to everyone. The brush doesn&#x27;t pick up too much - it picks up the perfect amount.</li>
            <li> I love this line of brushes - they&#x27;re so soft, no shedding, great prices and they&#x27;re multi-taskers. What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> your basic powder brush, great quality. feels smooth on the skin, picks up perfect amount of product, not too heavy or light. no hairs have fallen out yet, had it for about a month.</li>
            <li> I first bought a Real Techniques Face brush while on vacation in the UK and I fell in love with the line. I wish I had picked up the whole kit while there. I needed a new powder brush so of coarse I spent the extra money for shipping because it is so worth it. These brushes are sooo soft, no shedding and easy to clean. Would highly recommend Real Techniques.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing. The brush is soft and I like the way it&#x27;s cover the face. It&#x27;s really one of the best brushes I ever used.</li>
            <li> Very dense compared to other brushes havent troed washing it yet..it was bigger than I expected but a very nice size for a powder brush.</li>
            <li> Love all of the real Techniques brushes- great quality and long lasting. This one in particular is very soft and works very well with a setting powder. Love it!</li>
            <li> Have it already for an about a year and still like new</li>
            <li> I love this brush!! It distributes the product so well and feels so soft.</li>
            <li> Works great. would buy it again</li>
            <li> I have so far loved every brush from real Techniques, but this one is a definite let down. I personally find the bristles to be a bit rough/sharp feeling on the skin, which is a huge problem for me. I never reach for this brush out of my collection. Perhaps I received a knock-off or something. Either way I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> Real Techniques are the best brushes I have used all year. You can&#x27;t beat them. I prefer them over MAC and any department store brushes.They have a great price and great quality. I LOVE REAL TECHNIQUES!</li>
            <li> I love real Techniques brushes.  Especially since they are affordable and are of very good quality.  The Powder Brush was one that I had contemplated purchasing because of the size (I&#x27;d seen it in ULTA prior during a trip to LA) and whether I needed yet another powder brush.  I caved and bought this brush anyways.  The brush head is big and fluffy with medium density.  I do like that it has a flat base that allows it to stand on its own on table tops.  After a few spot cleaning rounds, the brush hair tends to fluff up more and loses it&#x27;s compact shape but that is easily remedied after deep cleaning.  I&#x27;ve not had any issues with shedding or bleeding since using this brush an it&#x27;s been almost a year now which is really good.  I use this brush to apply translucent powder to set my foundation and it works great for that purpose.  It&#x27;s also nice to use to diffuse over-blushing or -bronzing.  The brush hair is soft and comfortable on skin but I think the Sigma F30 might be a tad softer.  All in all a very nice powder brush and a very affordable price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush because I saw the blog of a professional makeup artist in which she notes that this brush is one of her old favorites. Her normal set was a Bobbi Brown set, so I was thinking if she uses hundreds of dollars in brushes but stands by this $7 brush, then it must be pretty great. And it is! It is so soft and the bristles pick up my powder perfectly for very even coverage. I haven&#x27;t really used brushes in the past and I bought a set, plus this individual brush, and needless to say, I will always use them from now on!</li>
            <li> Look no further. If you are looking for cheaper brushes that dont shed these are the ones! I have almost all of the real techniques brushes and they are soooo soft and they dont shed! Not even one hair. The powder brush in particular is HUGE. Wonderful brush!</li>
            <li> Love it! I use this for my mineralized foundation, does a perfect job.</li>
            <li> So incredibly soft! It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> I washed it before I use it the next day. It dried fast. The touch was soft and easy to even the extra powder. The finish was clear and natural. Very good.</li>
            <li> Amazing brush the best brush ever you won&#x27;t regret making this purchase it will save you&#x27;re life.... Will purchase more brushes in the future</li>
            <li> This brush is okay. I use it for mineral makeup application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it b/c other reviewers said the bristles don&#x27;t shed, and after about a month of daily use they haven&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head of the brush is really large, which is okay, but the brush lacks the stiffness that helps control application. It&#x27;s so soft that it&#x27;s basically just mushy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a stiffer brush for the first layer, then do a quick once-over with this brush.</li>
            <li> the synthetic bristles allow you to use this o a variety of different products.&lt;br /&gt;washing it there was ABSOLUTELY NO SHEDDING.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this brand.  Honestly they are the best brushes I&#x27;ve tried.  And I didn&#x27;t try them for the longest time because I turned my nose up at the fact that they were synthetic brushes, however they are soooo much softer than real hair and I think they apply much better as well. I think that the powder brush is the perfect size.  I don&#x27;t use liquid foundation, only powder, so I need a brush that gives me great coverage, and this one does the trick.  It&#x27;s big (but not too big), plush, and it get&#x27;s the job done super well.  Never going back from these brushes!</li>
            <li> I love using this brush for setting my foundation. And also for applying blush and highlighter. Best brushes ever!!! Awesome for the $</li>
            <li> Love love! Very big and fluffy, perfect for all over the face powder application.I use it to set my foundation and it works amazingly.</li>
            <li> Very dense, soft bristles, picks up and distributes color evenly. Would definitely purchase again, looking to buy eye shadow brushes from this brand next.</li>
            <li> The Real Techniques line of brushes are amazing! I own a few others and decided to try this powder brush. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks now and have no regrets.</li>
            <li> Extremely soft bristles, easily applies my makeup.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.  They perform well, and they are easy to wash.  I previously used Mac and Bobbi Brown brushes, but I got tired of picking all the shedding hairs off my face every time I applied my makeup.  These are great quality at a great price.</li>
            <li> I love Love Real Tech Brushes- i have a few. I didnt expect anything less... very nice quality for the price. I use this brush as a setting powder brush- its perfect. Nice size to do all over face.</li>
            <li> when i got this brush i was really impressed how soft and easy to use and how good quality it is&lt;br /&gt;a must have!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, so big, so soft, easy to clean, met the expectations at all. Highly recommended ! you will gonna love it</li>
            <li> Love this brush, it&#x27;s sof on my skin and helped reduce dry patches</li>
            <li> I so love this brush I advise everyone to try it.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are so soft and it applies my powder even and when I do put my powder on with this brush, the bristles are super soft on my skin I use it for liquid foundation but you can use it for powder too&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great quality brush for a great price.</li>
            <li> OBSESSED with Real Techniques brushes!!! AMAZING! I love the way they feel on my face! Fav of all time for sure!</li>
            <li> Nice brush, and definitely a good price!!</li>
            <li> This brush does the trick and feels and functions more like a high priced brush.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite brush for powder! Plus it came on time</li>
            <li> I cant get enough of these brushes. I was skeptical at first, but they truly are the best drugstore brushes out.. Hands down!</li>
            <li> This brush is just amazing amazing amazing!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Its big soft and makes ur make up just go on soo nice. Took forever to order them cause i didnt think they would work. But im sooo glad I did amazing</li>
            <li> This is a nice powder brush! The bristles are very soft and it does a good job of distributing powder evently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It was my mums birthday so I decided to get her something she would use everyday to replace her old ones. I wanted to give her make up but she has it already and I&#x27;m not too sure what brand she likes. After many thoughts, this brush would be perfect! I mean she has used her old brush for about 8 years of more?! And it wasn&#x27;t even good, it was so rough even though it was branded. So I got her this and she loved it since it wasn&#x27;t expensive and it was such high quality!</li>
            <li> Excellent brush! Cant believe the price for such a good quality brush. Will be sticking with this brand for sure. Is comparable to my sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> received the blush brush</li>
            <li> Real Technique brushes are my favorites. I have Sigma, Sedona Lace, Coastal Scents (which are pretty darn good) and Mac brushes and the Real Techniques are my favorites!</li>
            <li> As disappointed in this brush as I was the stippling. Where the stippling brush didn&#x27;t soak the product up enough and just left it dewey on top of your face, the powder does the exact opposite, keeping all the powder for itself. It is soft, I will give it that, but after only a few uses I have already decided I will not be purchasing any more real Techniques brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes one wonder if these are real products? As I&#x27;ve heard great things elsewhere. I don&#x27;t know. Maybe it is one of those subjective makeup things; Works for some and not at all for others. Who knows.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush 2 or 3 times. Soft and no shedding.</li>
            <li> My review title says it all. I will continue to use this in the future - let&#x27;s just hope the quality remains the same (or gets better), because otherwise I&#x27;ll have to go hunting for my next favorite brush.</li>
            <li> I like so much! As professional makeup artists, we know great artistry is only as good as your techniques and tools.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is as soft as I thought. I&#x27;ll not try other brushes of this brand any more.</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s soft and puts the makeup on your skin soooo beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing bad to say about it.</li>
            <li> Exceptional brushes and at a bargain!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect powder brush for me! it&#x27;s the perfect size and softness. Also, I&#x27;ve had brushes in the past where bristles of the brush fall out left and right, or the handle falls apart, this is not the case with this brush. It&#x27;s is proving to be very durable!</li>
            <li> Love the brush, its really big which is what I wanted. It is really nice, the only thing I am concerned with is I think it might shed at some point, but I am hoping it won&#x27;t because for the price the quality seems nice. The quality of the bristles is great! I think I&#x27;ll be purchasing more!!</li>
            <li> Yas! This brush is so large and soft I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> This is my first RT brush purchase along with 5 other RT brushes. I love this so much! So soft, does the job and very easy to clean. What more can you ask for? :)</li>
            <li> Love this brush. Love the price. Easy to clean. I use it everyday instead of my Mac and Bobbi brown brushes now. Great brush.</li>
            <li> I just love love love this brush!  Like all &amp;#34;real Techniques&amp;#34; brushes this is super soft.  I  have used this about a week and currently am using it with my Laura Geller Balance-n-Brighten baked foundation and it picked up the product nicely, but not too much product.  The ability to stand on it&#x27;s own is handy when switching between this other other brushes.  I would recommend this brush -- as well as other &amp;#34;real Techniques&amp;#34; brushes.</li>
            <li> This is a good powder brush or blush brush.  I have had to learn how to use it so I don&#x27;t pick up too much powder though.  It does gather a bunch, so touch lightly.  Fluffy brush, soft with no shedding.  The handles on these brushes are very nice too.  Long enough but not too long.</li>
            <li> After trying out a set of the real Techniques eyeshadow brushes and blush brushes, I knew I could not go wrong purchasing the Powder Brush.  It is so fluffy!!  It washes up like a dream.  Do not hesitate to ditch your store-bought brushes and try out the real Techniques brushes - I have loved every single one I have bought!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this brush and amazed at its quality! The price is super affordable for those who do not want or can&#x27;t spend money on higher ends ones! With this brush you&#x27;ll get the exact same quality or BETTER than those you pay 30 or more! I have three all-techniques brushes, powder, blush and foundation brushes and love them all! Truly amazing, flawless finish! Thank you</li>
            <li> Best brush ever! If I can suggest adding any brush to your arsenal it&#x27;s this one.</li>
            <li> NO HAIRS FALL OFF, SUPER SMOOTH, LOVE THE BRUSH GREAT FOR LOOSE POWDERS OR YOUR SETTING POWDERS...HAPPY OVER ALL AND USE IT ALL THE TIME!</li>
            <li> Bought off a wish list for my wife just to fill an order. Can only say that she likes it and has bought before so it must be good.</li>
            <li> very nice brush.  Perfect for mineral makeup.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I use it with my setting powder the real techniques brushes are so soft and versatile. They have very good brushes for a very good price! I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> fantastic brush. will purchased more of these types. gives my MAC brush a run for the $$</li>
            <li> Great brush! It is perfect for putting on finishing powder.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I tried it because it was a reasonable price. I&#x27;ve been buying the $50, &amp; $60,  famous brand brushes. I&#x27;ve found this company makes just as nice a brush. I&#x27;ll buy their cheek and eye brushes as I need them!!!</li>
            <li> Love it! THIS IS huge. I use it to apply for setting poeder. Great!</li>
            <li> Soft,  giant, love it.</li>
            <li> This brush is giving me life! much more dense and softer that my other powder brush from eco tools. i love it already.</li>
            <li> Its okay thought it was a little large for the size of my compact powder would of desired a smaller powder head but did like the long handle.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this brush!! I usually spend ALOT more on Mac brushes and this one is just as good! It picks up my pressed &amp; my loose powder just fine &amp; it does not leave any stray hairs on my face! Big plus even Mac brushes leave hairs!</li>
            <li> This is a big brush, haha! I love how I can now apply less powder and it is always applied so evenly. And it&#x27;s super soft, which is great. I love it and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love it. Good quality. Worth your money. I am happy woth the decision I made. I recommend the product for all cosmetic lovers.</li>
            <li> A great firm brush that you could use for both powder and blush. I also use this as a buffer brush if I&#x27;ve used too much bronzer or blush. I hughly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> poor quality，handle position have many&lt;br /&gt;scratch，the printed character of logo on the handle is overlap，feel disappointed</li>
            <li> This brush is one of my favorites it blends so well and help me used less foundation. Great price !!</li>
            <li> I have been slowly collecting all the Real Technique brushes because i love them! This was my most recent purchase of theirs. I was looking for a large powder brush and this was it! These brushes are great because they are soft and they are made of synthetic hair. I&#x27;m allergic to animal/goat hair so I can&#x27;t use certain brushes but these are perfect! I also love that the bottom of the brush is flat so you can stand it up right. I wish it was a LITTLE bit larger but thats ok, I can buy a different brush for that, but this one does do everything that I need it for. They also clean it very well and dry fast. I use regular dish soap when cleaning them and they are not stained. So far, every time I have washed the brush, any coloring that was on it has come out and the brush still feels just as soft as day one!</li>
            <li> This brush is great for applying all over powder. Its very big and densely packed so it applies just the right amount of powder.</li>
            <li> I had bought it for my wife. She opened it first time last week after six months of purchase and loved it. That was the whole purpose so I am giving it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> holds together well, very soft, easy to grip and use, great for powder and blending, and I love the way these brushes look and work alltogether.</li>
            <li> I really like real Techniques brushes.  The are well made and really last. I would recommend these to my friends.</li>
            <li> This is a very fluffy and soft brush. For the price this is a really good deal and good quality</li>
            <li> Excellant bristles soft and functional, use powderapplication with this brush a little at a time, you will love it, hand washout often and gently.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s synthetic, unlike natural bristles, this brush does not absorb too much product.  Great for putting a light dusting of powder on your face!  Great quality which is to be expected with Real Techniques!</li>
            <li> I have tried many make up brushes from high end to more economical. This brand  is by far my favorite. Application is perfect, not scratchy and very reasonably priced! Powder brush is huge, soft and luxurious</li>
            <li> After I bought this brush, I ended up buying two more by Chapman. Why? The bristles are soft enough to feel great against my skin, but firm enough to hold their shape. I&#x27;m amazed at how the brush spread an even coat of powder across my face with little effort required. I love this brush, and you will too.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product. It is big, bulky, and heading to the rubbish bin. I&#x27;ll get a better powder brush at Target.</li>
            <li> Pretty soft, ginormous brush, fairly dense--great for the price.</li>
            <li> It is really not good,and  the brush hair not soft,All in all I am disappointed！</li>
            <li> great product without the steep price. works just as well as the top of the line brushes. save money and buy this instead</li>
            <li> I now have several real Techniques brushes and love them all. I like that the handles are color coordinated for their purpose, such gold handle for foundation, powder, ect. I have some higher priced brushes that don&#x27;t begin to compare to real Techniques products. These are the only brushes I will buy in the future!</li>
            <li> This really does help to get an even application of powder everywhere on the face. The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it is not really good for anything else - its large size and loose bristles are ill suited for applying makeup in a precise way. But that&#x27;s not really what it&#x27;s for anyways, so no complaints from me!</li>
            <li> This is the first time to use this brush. It is fantastic. I love it so so much. Very smooth and soft. I will buy more for sure</li>
            <li> I have purchased many brushes randomly over the years, ELF, Sephora, Ecotools, BareMinerals. I have bought a lot of brushes despite not using that much make up. However this brush is very nice. The handle of it just seems so high quality. Alot of brushes I have tried usually started shedding or the handle separated from brush part. This is the highest quality of the brushes I have used before. I can&#x27;t tell that it&#x27;s synthetic from the powder handling. Definitely buy. Just bought the starter set since I liked this brush so much.</li>
            <li> Large brush to apply power, exactly what i wanted. The bristles are extremely soft and of good quality. Applies flawless makeup</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. I use this brush to apply either mineral foundation or liquid foundation and absolutely love the brush. Shipping was fast and the price beats retail stores. Will be purchasing additional brushes for sure.</li>
            <li> Ive bought almost all real techniques brushes &amp; i guess this is d only one im not so happy with... After reading so many reviews i would hav expect more from it...this powder brush is big &amp; fluffy h/ever d bristle is not as soft as recommended. It pock my face now &amp; then....even its only a slight pain but quite irritate me...</li>
            <li> Fluffy and super soft! I love it!</li>
            <li> So quick and easy! Thank you!</li>
            <li> best powder brush ever</li>
            <li> Brush is very nice but also VERY long on bristles. Can barely fit it into my powder but I trimmed it. It&#x27;s holding up well even under trimming down to fit.</li>
            <li> Just as described and will purchase from again! :)</li>
            <li> Great brush - no hair fallout</li>
            <li> i really love this brush.  it&#x27;s gentle on my face and the bristles don&#x27;t shed like cheap makeup brushes do.  i would recommend.  plus, it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
            <li> Love this brush!!  It is a great all over powder and bronzer brush!!</li>
            <li> The best brush i have ever use. Good bye other brushes. Now i have to buy some more for use on my clients.</li>
            <li> This is a great powder brush for the price.  Its not too big and the bristles are so soft - really easy to apply a nice and even coat of face powder.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Good but not what i was expecting, there are other brushes with the same price wich are so much better. wont buy this again</li>
            <li> Awesome brush!! A must have!! I am starting to buy all of her brushes cause I&#x27;m obsessed!! Love love love!!!</li>
            <li> I love their brushes. This was my first RT brush, and I&#x27;ve since went on to purchase a set. This brush is huge, which I love. You can use it with power, cream and liquid. I love the finish and texture of the brush. The price is great, and the quality is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice fluffy brush.I own some other brushes of Samantha Chapman line and love them all. Till now it did not shed,kept it&#x27;s shape and done a good work.Next I will buy the travel brushes kit to keep handy when travelling.I would recommend this as it is very good and the price is affordable.</li>
            <li> I love every one of these brushes and I have almost all of them! They clean up great and are so easy to use!</li>
            <li> Very soft; good face powder brush.</li>
            <li> I would definetly recommend it. Great quality product that should last a long time with the poper care and cleaning. Make-up applies evenly.</li>
            <li> I grew tired of my Elf brushes breaking and after a few washes the quality deterred and I felt like they were starting to scratch my face. Not in this case these brushes are phenomenal they&#x27;re soft yet hold makeup very well and applies beautifully they give that professional airbrushed top quality look that I was searching for in a brush..simply perfect!</li>
            <li> I have all of Sam (pixiwoo from youtube) brushes and love them they are soft and had no problem with shedding. Great brushes for the price!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best powder brushes I have ever tried! Real Techniques products are all very good and have never let me down! All the products I have purchased were amazing and for a little price!</li>
            <li> Great for setting powder. It&#x27;s big and fluffy enough to gently press powder onto the skin. I wish it was a softer though, the brush I received feels quite scratchy on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have a 45.00 makeup brush I have taken excellent care of. Yet, it has always lost hairs while I applied my makeup. This is annoying at best.&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews for this brush and considering the price point, thought how good, or bad could it be?&lt;br /&gt;Well, it&#x27;s lovely. It&#x27;s soft, doesn&#x27;t lose hairs, and is a vegan option for those of us who care. It applies makeup just as well as my other brush, without leaving bits of itself on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Happy me.</li>
            <li> I like how soft the brush is and how great it works.  It is just a bit bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! I use it to apply bronzer when I&#x27;m feeling pale, it applies the product evenly and is very soft.</li>
