            <li>Cal Ben pure soap is the best.</li>
            <li>(hey it worked great and was cheap).</li>
            <li>But it smells nice, does not have a smell that lingers</li>
            <li>I just love a good bar soap, and this one is a keeper.</li>
            <li>Time will say if is cost effective.</li>
            <li>One of the things we did was to order a sample pack of Cal Ben&#x27;s more popular</li>
            <li>These are one of the best natural soaps I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Love this soap.  </li>
            <li>This is such a great product!  </li>
            <li>LOVE this product</li>
            <li>It feels better than the anti-bacterial stuff, and my body no longer itches at night.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s never been able to find a laundry detergent that didn&#x27;t cause her some pain and rash, and could never even think about using a laundry powder.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the quality of this soap and it is the only soap I use now.  </li>
            <li>It will be a while before we order any more.</li>
            <li>I might put the bars together for a better bar.</li>
            <li>It has caused zero problems, we love the smell [so clean!]</li>
            <li>Great natural product.</li>
            <li>Though not available on Amazon or through this seller that I know of, I&#x27;d like to add that we also really love the liquid dish soap (best we&#x27;ve ever used) and the powdered laundry</li>
            <li>It is a fine almond scent I like.  </li>
            <li>That is a huge price gouge.</li>
            <li>Mom has a rare auto immune disease on top of allergies to just about any and all soaps,cleaners and perfumes.</li>
            <li>I am a happy customer and will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li>The product comes with a free return form if you decide it was not for you.</li>
            <li>This is nice and natural and keeps me healthy.</li>
            <li>These are a good value - but keep in mind the bar is smaller than most soap bars.  </li>
            <li>My wife has sensitive skin and this soap was a really good buy.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the Best natural Pure soap out there &amp;</li>
            <li>The lather was so rich and creamy</li>
            <li>I have to admit I  was looking for original castile soap</li>
            <li>We just feel clean, non-itchy, non-irritated.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m glad I discovered Cal-Ben&#x27;s pure soaps.</li>
            <li>I felt more alert and in a more positive mood than normal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product with pure and simple ingredient.</li>
            <li>I received this soap quickly and it was packaged well.</li>
            <li>Most bar soaps and many shampoos would cause her to develop an itchy red rash as well.</li>
            <li>The product was shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>While I understand it&#x27;s free and clear and not like most soap, it leaves a film on the tub and my skin.</li>
            <li>This soap is so mild and rinses so well.  </li>
            <li>This stuff feeds &amp; cleans the skin in which we live :)</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my skin feel so soft!  </li>
            <li>She was reluctant to try anything new to her, so she started off with the dish soap, and when she found that it made her hands feel great, she ventured on to the bar soap, shampoo and finally the dreaded laundry powder.</li>
            <li>Six years ago, if anyone would have told me that I&#x27;d soon become passionate about a line of soaps and cleaners, I&#x27;d have laughed them right out of my shop.</li>
            <li>Does not leave the skin dry has a very nice smell and it cleans &amp; lathers very well.</li>
            <li>This is the most economical and convenient route for us, but for those who aren&#x27;t looking to lay out that much money at one time on cleaning products or who don&#x27;t have room to store a half pallet of supplies, then buying a little at a time and paying more per unit may very well be your best option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I immediately took out a razor and shaved right then and there.</li>
            <li>However this is relative as I do 2 full coats most of the time I take a shower.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, foamy lather and rinses without leaving a &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34;, dry feeling...</li>
            <li>I love the smell and again it is all natural &amp; gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>Just note that these bars are smaller than most of the \\&quot;bath bars\\&quot; of soap that you buy in the grovery store.  </li>
            <li>This may turn out to be okay if it last longer ...</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the product is touted as being natural and lightly scented, it is neither.</li>
            <li>I ordered 12 bars first.</li>
            <li>It can even make my teenage, male dancers smell good again.  </li>
            <li>There is nothing special about this soap as far as the ingredients are concerned.</li>
            <li>So of the $25.13 we originally invested in this item, we lost $14.08, more than half of what we paid for it!</li>
            <li>We order directly from Cal Ben and spend $450 (including shipping) on the \\&quot;Super Star &#x60;4800&#x27;Â® Collection\\&quot; package that includes a four year supply of bar soap, dish soap, laundry detergent and shampoo.</li>
            <li>It was just a change in mood, so it&#x27;s hard to explain, but getting out of the shower and toweling off after the first shower with Cal Ben, I just had a clean and more positive feeling.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves this brand.  </li>
            <li>The soaps smell absolutely divine.  </li>
            <li>so no worries about lotion or perfume competing, and cleans the skin gently but really well.</li>
            <li>Amazon sells it at a very affordable price.  </li>
            <li>and I feel they go fast.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Too much of a perfume smell,</li>
            <li>Like so many other people I have become more conscious of not only of the things I put in my body, but the things I put on it as well.</li>
            <li>Similar to the original Jergens body lotion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Those with sensitive skin might be interested in my mother&#x27;s experience with the Cal Ben line.</li>
            <li>This soap makes a rich, soft lather and does not dry your skin neither leave an oily creamy feel.  </li>
            <li>The product is what it says it is &amp;#34;pure soap&amp;#34; nothing more nothing less.</li>
            <li>both agreed after our first shower with the bar soap and shampoo that we could not only feel the difference on our skin, but for whatever reason, \\&quot;felt\\&quot; better mentally.</li>
            <li>I am also starting to notice that my husband&#x27;s dry skin seems to be getting better, even as the weather has turned colder and drier.  </li>
            <li>Steer clear of this product if you have significant fragrance sensitivities, if you use only truly natural products, and if you must therefore return the item!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He says it is so very soft.</li>
            <li>I use this soap since I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The bars are somewhat smaller than conventional soap bars, but what they lack in size they more than make up for with quality.</li>
            <li>clean simply with a simple, natural product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The very potent &#x27;almond&#x27; scent of the product made us ill, whereas genuinely natural &amp; pure almond fragrance does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t deny that the soap got my skin as clean as any other soap I&#x27;ve used (if not cleaner) and did it with all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>My husband says my skin feels so soft after my shower.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why anyone would not like this Soap, I am getting ready for my next order,</li>
            <li>We have family members with exceptionally sensitive skin [excema, etc.]</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon prices fluctuate wildly at times so I will leave that matter up to the shopper to decide.</li>
            <li>When I was done my skin felt soft and supple.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just when you cleanse the skin naturally</li>
            <li>I notice I don&#x27;t have to apply body lotion afterwards because the natural oils in your skin will rush to the surface and keep the skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for everyone who wants to avoid harmful ingredients and at the same time not spend a fortune.</li>
            <li>I got this for 1/2 what I normally pay for a comparable product at my local organics store.</li>
            <li>Back in the old days a lot of backyard mechanics like myself used to wash greasy parts and our hands in gasoline, diesel, turpentine, kerosene etc.</li>
            <li>Moments later I noticed a natural glow to my skin.</li>
            <li>My husband needs pure soap due to skin allergies.  </li>
            <li>wife and I had heard about Cal Ben Five Star Soap on a late night satellite radio show, and after the wife was diagnosed with Stage 3C Ovarian Cancer and began chemotherapy, we really began to make an effort at eliminating chemicals from our lives as much as we practicably could.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m reviewing the product, not this particular seller, which on Amazon can change abruptly.</li>
            <li>these bars last a long time .... considerably longer than the brands like Dial, Irish Spring, etc.</li>
            <li>Even though Mom liked the Cal Ben laundry soap, she has opted to buy Cal Ben&#x27;s liquid laundry detergent simply because of her bad experiences with other laundry powders, but has had to reluctantly admit that all these products have changed her life (she hates it when I&#x27;m right).</li>

            <li> I notice I don&#x27;t have to apply body lotion afterwards because the natural oils in your skin will rush to the surface and keep the skin soft and supple.</li>

            <li> Even though Mom liked the Cal Ben laundry soap, she has opted to buy Cal Ben&#x27;s liquid laundry detergent simply because of her bad experiences with other laundry powders, but has had to reluctantly admit that all these products have changed her life (she hates it when I&#x27;m right).</li>

            <li> Not tight and dry like it would feel after using other soap products.</li>
            <li> As some of the other reviews pointed out, it does not dry out your skin.  </li>
            <li> As long as they keep making this soap, I will keep buying.</li>
            <li> I was looking for natural soap with the idea of reducing impact in the environment and exposure to harsh chemicals.</li>

            <li> I have bought this 24 pack several times in the past from a seller called Gaiam for $19.00 + $4.99 shipping, but now the only seller with it on Amazon is TheBodyShop</li>
            <li> My skin gets very dry and the soap I was using, along with my lotion, was causing my skin to burn.  </li>
            <li> I have had absolutely no troubles with my skin since using this soap.</li>
            <li> I actually look forward to taking a bath everyday.</li>
            <li> The soap is not worth 3 times what it once sold for.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the only soap my daughter and I use (especially for our faces).  It has a nice, foamy lather and rinses without leaving a &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34;, dry feeling... but it is not greasy or oily.  My husband says my skin feels so soft after my shower.  The almond scent is pleasing and is not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  No stripping the skin of oils so there little need for moisturizer beyond the minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get clean simply with a simple, natural product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT price for bar when you buy a box!</li>
            <li> Just note that these bars are smaller than most of the \\&quot;bath bars\\&quot; of soap that you buy in the grovery store.  This may turn out to be okay if it last longer ... but I haven&#x27;t had enough experience to judge this yet.  As some of the other reviews pointed out, it does not dry out your skin.  Updated 18 Aug 2012 - these bars last a long time .... considerably longer than the brands like Dial, Irish Spring, etc.</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  It lasts ages.  Cleans just about anything.  It can even make my teenage, male dancers smell good again.  Now that&#x27;s cleaning power.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why anyone would not like this Soap, I am getting ready for my next order, the great thing&#x27;s about this, it lathers up,, and rinses off {like as in now} don&#x27;t have that soapy feel that takes forever to get off you,, So all i can say about this is its a darn good soap.</li>
            <li> Great natural product. And works . Small bars though.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel so soft!  Smells wonderful.  Doesn&#x27;t last long so keep it stored out of the water!</li>
            <li> I received this soap quickly and it was packaged well. I got this for 1/2 what I normally pay for a comparable product at my local organics store. Good quality pressed soap that lathers well. Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Cal Ben pure soap is the best. Do your research. It will last you a lot longer than the chemical loaded stuff. Buy a 24 pack. It smells great, too!    *update - 12/29/2014 - I have bought this 24 pack several times in the past from a seller called Gaiam for $19.00 + $4.99 shipping, but now the only seller with it on Amazon is TheBodyShop and they are selling it for $79.99 (shipping included). That is a huge price gouge. The soap is not worth 3 times what it once sold for.</li>
            <li> My husband needs pure soap due to skin allergies.  He absolutely loves this brand.  He says it is so very soft.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product!  We have family members with exceptionally sensitive skin [excema, etc.], and this soap is the purest and best we&#x27;ve used.  It has caused zero problems, we love the smell [so clean!], and it works great. Doesn&#x27;t dry us out. We just feel clean, non-itchy, non-irritated.  LOVE this product and it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> I use this soap since I have very sensitive skin. I love the smell and again it is all natural &amp; gentle on my skin. As long as they keep making this soap, I will keep buying.</li>
            <li> Steer clear of this product if you have significant fragrance sensitivities, if you use only truly natural products, and if you must therefore return the item!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the product is touted as being natural and lightly scented, it is neither. The very potent &#x27;almond&#x27; scent of the product made us ill, whereas genuinely natural &amp; pure almond fragrance does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We returned the product, per the vendor&#x27;s enclosed return instructions, which stated that postage-paid return shipping costs to be deducted from our refund would only be $5-$6. But to add insult to injury, we just received our piddly $11.05 refund. So of the $25.13 we originally invested in this item, we lost $14.08, more than half of what we paid for it! Our time &amp; money would have been better spent in giving the soap away from the nearest street corner instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Live &amp; learn from our sad tale. As for us, we will never patronize this company again.</li>
            <li> I use this in the shower and for hand washing. It feels better than the anti-bacterial stuff, and my body no longer itches at night.</li>
            <li> This is nice and natural and keeps me healthy. No more itchy skin after I shower.</li>
            <li> The soaps smell absolutely divine.  I am trying these out after switching from Kirk&#x27;s All Natural unscented soaps, because they keep getting more expensive!  These are a good value - but keep in mind the bar is smaller than most soap bars.  I am also starting to notice that my husband&#x27;s dry skin seems to be getting better, even as the weather has turned colder and drier.  I think I will repurchase again!</li>
            <li> Terrific soap. Not sure why it moves me so much! LOL. But it smells nice, does not have a smell that lingers so no worries about lotion or perfume competing, and cleans the skin gently but really well. I just love a good bar soap, and this one is a keeper. I also like liquid soaps like Aveeno and Dove, Dr Bronners. I wouldn&#x27;t consider this as moisturizing as those, but the best in bar soaps for sure. Hope that helps.</li>
            <li> Six years ago, if anyone would have told me that I&#x27;d soon become passionate about a line of soaps and cleaners, I&#x27;d have laughed them right out of my shop. I&#x27;ve never been one to worry about coming into contact with chemicals. Back in the old days a lot of backyard mechanics like myself used to wash greasy parts and our hands in gasoline, diesel, turpentine, kerosene etc. (hey it worked great and was cheap). I know guys who still do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I had heard about Cal Ben Five Star Soap on a late night satellite radio show, and after the wife was diagnosed with Stage 3C Ovarian Cancer and began chemotherapy, we really began to make an effort at eliminating chemicals from our lives as much as we practicably could. One of the things we did was to order a sample pack of Cal Ben&#x27;s more popular products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We both agreed after our first shower with the bar soap and shampoo that we could not only feel the difference on our skin, but for whatever reason, \\&quot;felt\\&quot; better mentally. It was just a change in mood, so it&#x27;s hard to explain, but getting out of the shower and toweling off after the first shower with Cal Ben, I just had a clean and more positive feeling. I felt more alert and in a more positive mood than normal. I didn&#x27;t expect or even want the stuff to be any different from my Dial soap, because ordering bar soap on-line seemed like it would be a hassle. I couldn&#x27;t deny that the soap got my skin as clean as any other soap I&#x27;ve used (if not cleaner) and did it with all natural ingredients. We immediately placed an order for a four year bundled supply of all the Cal Ben 5 Star Soap products. Though not available on Amazon or through this seller that I know of, I&#x27;d like to add that we also really love the liquid dish soap (best we&#x27;ve ever used) and the powdered laundry soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those with sensitive skin might be interested in my mother&#x27;s experience with the Cal Ben line. Mom has a rare auto immune disease on top of allergies to just about any and all soaps,cleaners and perfumes. She&#x27;s never been able to find a laundry detergent that didn&#x27;t cause her some pain and rash, and could never even think about using a laundry powder. Most bar soaps and many shampoos would cause her to develop an itchy red rash as well. I tried for three years to get her to try Cal Ben. Last year she finally agreed to let us give her some of the laundry powder, bar soap, shampoo and dish soap. She was reluctant to try anything new to her, so she started off with the dish soap, and when she found that it made her hands feel great, she ventured on to the bar soap, shampoo and finally the dreaded laundry powder. A week later, she called and wanted to know if we could sell her some of our personal supply. Even though Mom liked the Cal Ben laundry soap, she has opted to buy Cal Ben&#x27;s liquid laundry detergent simply because of her bad experiences with other laundry powders, but has had to reluctantly admit that all these products have changed her life (she hates it when I&#x27;m right). We ended up placing a big order with Cal Ben and dividing the product between us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon prices fluctuate wildly at times so I will leave that matter up to the shopper to decide. I&#x27;m reviewing the product, not this particular seller, which on Amazon can change abruptly. We order directly from Cal Ben and spend $450 (including shipping) on the \\&quot;Super Star &#x60;4800&#x27;Â® Collection\\&quot; package that includes a four year supply of bar soap, dish soap, laundry detergent and shampoo. Cleaning products are very heavy, so ordering in bulk really cuts down on shipping costs per unit and makes it convenient to not have to keep a close eye on our supply. This is the most economical and convenient route for us, but for those who aren&#x27;t looking to lay out that much money at one time on cleaning products or who don&#x27;t have room to store a half pallet of supplies, then buying a little at a time and paying more per unit may very well be your best option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However you do it, DO give this bar soap and all the Cal-ben Five Star Soap line a chance. I believe you&#x27;ll find, like our family, that you love the product line and will feel good about buying a product that is made here in the good ol&#x27; US of A.ever you do it, DO give this bar soap and all the Cal-ben Five Star Soap line a chance. I believe you&#x27;ll find, like our family, that you love the product line and will feel good about buying a product that is made here in the good ol&#x27; US of A.</li>
            <li> The product was shipped quickly.  I am a little disappointed with the soap though.  While I understand it&#x27;s free and clear and not like most soap, it leaves a film on the tub and my skin.</li>
            <li> This soap is so mild and rinses so well.  I will definitely buy it again.  My skin gets very dry and the soap I was using, along with my lotion, was causing my skin to burn.  I have had absolutely no troubles with my skin since using this soap.</li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d be coming to Amazon to post a review about soap. But here I am doing just that. These are one of the best natural soaps I&#x27;ve ever used. Like so many other people I have become more conscious of not only of the things I put in my body, but the things I put on it as well. And I&#x27;m glad I discovered Cal-Ben&#x27;s pure soaps. I was impressed from the moment they arrived. As soon as I opened the box my room was filled with this wonderful cherry almond scent. Similar to the original Jergens body lotion. I immediately took one of the bars and went to the bathroom to wash my face. The lather was so rich and creamy I immediately took out a razor and shaved right then and there. When I was done my skin felt soft and supple. Not tight and dry like it would feel after using other soap products. Moments later I noticed a natural glow to my skin. Now don&#x27;t be mislead. There is nothing special about this soap as far as the ingredients are concerned. The product is what it says it is &amp;#34;pure soap&amp;#34; nothing more nothing less. It&#x27;s just when you cleanse the skin naturally the skin will respond the way nature intended. When I bathe with it I notice I don&#x27;t have to apply body lotion afterwards because the natural oils in your skin will rush to the surface and keep the skin soft and supple. The bars are somewhat smaller than conventional soap bars, but what they lack in size they more than make up for with quality. These soap bar are baked hard so they won&#x27;t just melt away in the shower like Ivory soap will. One bar should last at least a week considering you bathe twice a day. I actually look forward to taking a bath everyday. I am a happy customer and will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the quality of this soap and it is the only soap I use now.  Amazon sells it at a very affordable price.  It does not have all of the additives that commercial soap has.  It makes my skin feel soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I was looking for natural soap with the idea of reducing impact in the environment and exposure to harsh chemicals. I have to admit I  was looking for original castile soap but the cost I found was prohibitive for me.  This soap makes a rich, soft lather and does not dry your skin neither leave an oily creamy feel.  It is the perfect balance between lifeguard and dove.  The smell was overpowering only after opening the box it was shipped in. The smell of the individual bar is subtle. It is a fine almond scent I like.  The bars are in the small side and I feel they go fast. However this is relative as I do 2 full coats most of the time I take a shower. The packaging of the individual bars does not disclose ingredients and this may be an issue for some people. They do have a website where they have all sort of info about their products.  Shipping was fast. I took nmt 2 days to have the box in the front door. The product comes with a free return form if you decide it was not for you. I ordered 12 bars first. Since we loved it, we ordered 24 bars. Time will say if is cost effective. I wish the bars were bigger for the price as, again, I feel bars go faster than regular soap bars, even of the same size.</li>
            <li> My wife has sensitive skin and this soap was a really good buy. There is plenty for my wife and daughter. It will be a while before we order any more.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the Best natural Pure soap out there &amp; I have tried it all. Does not leave the skin dry has a very nice smell and it cleans &amp; lathers very well. This stuff feeds &amp; cleans the skin in which we live :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product with pure and simple ingredient. I would recommend this for everyone who wants to avoid harmful ingredients and at the same time not spend a fortune.</li>
            <li> The bars are pretty small but I like the soap.  I might put the bars together for a better bar.</li>
            <li> Too much of a perfume smell, not what I thought I was getting, I&#x27;ll give it away because it causes me to itch.</li>
