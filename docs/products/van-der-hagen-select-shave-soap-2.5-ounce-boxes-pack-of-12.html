            <li>which I heard were great, but this is the best shave soap I&#x27;ve ever used and the best of the Van Der Hagen brand (I&#x27;ve tried tham all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>For now, I&#x27;ll keep using this one, as it lathers very nicely.  </li>
            <li>For the price this soap is a bargain, adds to a pleasant shave experience and doesnt have an overpowering scent.  </li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>Good stuff and</li>
            <li>If you like it, great, you know where to get a nice sized pack of them at.</li>
            <li>Van Der Hagens select shave soap is a suprisingly good shave soap.</li>
            <li>The product quality is also excellent with good beard softening characteristics &amp; good moisture retention offering a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>It appears to be a good product</li>
            <li>My friend used it for his shave and found it very refreshing.</li>
            <li>Shaving soaps make nice presents for men who use shaving brushes.  </li>
            <li>This is really nice, long-lasting soap.  </li>
            <li>Lathers up nicely and lubricates well.</li>
            <li>and I can say the Van Der Hagen brand lathers the absolute best.  </li>
            <li>Oh, wait, I use the deluxe soap from Van Der Hagen for $1.59 a cake.</li>
            <li>Now i have tried all 3 van der hagen soaps: select, deluxe, and glycerine.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was fond of the scent when I opened the package, but as it lathered I really liked it.</li>
            <li>I also like the environmentally suitable packaging, with no aerosol can to throw away.</li>
            <li>The soap is very, very, very lightly scented.</li>
            <li>I really missed the soap and was happy to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Overall Van Der Hagen select shave soap(and glycerine) is a great shave soap for the price and should not be missed or avoided!</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>I enjoy a brush lather since it is warm on the skin.</li>
            <li>and I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>It helps the razor cut the whiskers better.</li>
            <li>This is a hell a lot better then most shaving soaps and gels out there.</li>
            <li>works great for my straight razor shave.  </li>
            <li>I like this &amp;#34;select&amp;#34; soap better than the &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; by Van Der Hagen.</li>
            <li>The glycerine however is slightly better for people who suffer easily from razor burn.</li>
            <li>Smooth and lovely.</li>
            <li>It smells of almonds, and is very mild.  </li>
            <li>Smells clean, and is inexpensive, but definitely more a shaving &#x27;soap&#x27; than a cream or lather.  </li>
            <li>But you can get a perfectly fine shave using an inexpensive Bic razor and just lathering up a hand soap with you hands.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d try this since there were so many good reviews, but I found it way too hard to work up a good lather.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic value and</li>
            <li>so it is much more economical.</li>
            <li>Leaves the skin feeling smooth and changes shaving from a choir to one of pleasure.</li>
            <li>I also discovered that what passes as &amp;#34;artisan&amp;#34; soap is just cheap soap &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; with marketable stuff melted into it.</li>
            <li>Buying in bulk is an economical way to have plenty on hand; there&#x27;ll be no need to reorder for more than a year.</li>
            <li>Which  is good since this 12 pack is going to last me another 3 or 4 more years.</li>
            <li>very nice, great aroma and long lasting</li>
            <li>I say baby oil instead of preshave oil because baby oil does three things: soften the skin even more, help keep the hairs in place for an easy shave, and seems to help keep the lather from running or dissolving too fast.  </li>
            <li>Smell great and an incredible value - these little pucks last a long time and soften my skin for a great shave.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different types of shave soaps, and while van der hagen is not the best, its close enough and one of the cheapest around!</li>
            <li>The rich lather softens my beard and gives a clean start to each day.</li>
            <li>VDH, however, is by far my favorite because it &#x27;feels&#x27; very clean and smooth when applied.</li>
            <li>Nice and thick with a great mild scent.</li>
            <li>Yes there are better, but you&#x27;ll pay 10 times as much.</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of different creams and soaps but find this one to be very acceptable with a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>This soap is gentle, smooth and fragrant.</li>
            <li>Fresh out of the shower, apply baby oil to the area to be shaved, then apply the shaving soap with a shaving brush in against-the-grain strokes, like you&#x27;re painting.  </li>
            <li>well worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li>it makes my skin feel tuned and when shaving It leaves your skin with a fresh sensation too.</li>
            <li>Only kind I ever will use . .</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite soap so far.  </li>
            <li>Well worth it...</li>
            <li>This is a perfectly fine inexpensive shaving soap, and I give it high marks all around.  </li>
            <li>This seemed like a great deal on what&#x27;s regarded as a decent cheap soap, so I picked up a puck the last time I was at my local pharmacy to give this a try.</li>
            <li>love the feel of the lather, and my face does not dry out!</li>
            <li>While shaving it seemed that the razor wasn&#x27;t gliding quite as nicely as with other soap even though I just popped in a fresh blade.</li>
            <li>well worth the effort to purchase in large quantities.</li>
            <li>I shave with it sometimes, too, and it makes my legs really smooth and soft.    </li>
            <li>Better than Colgate or Williams and the same price when you buy in bulk.</li>
            <li>Mix it with a hot towel treatment and you&#x27;ll be in shaving heaven.</li>
            <li>This is my 2nd order of this product and I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick without being \\&quot;foamy\\&quot;, and applies very nicely.  </li>
            <li>It was certainly thinker and richer than the Col. Conk I&#x27;d been using.</li>
            <li>deluxe and select are almost identical but the select has a slightly better scent, so I am giving the slight edge to the select, thus making the deluxe mostly useless.</li>
            <li>As far as I have been able to tell, virtually any hand soap like Dove or Ivory will lather up well enough to shave with.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s thicker, slicker and lathers better than the other VDH soaps.</li>
            <li>I would recommend using this soap while taking a shower as it does tend to dry easily.</li>
            <li>This is an absolute steal at the price it&#x27;s listed at; highly recommended.</li>
            <li>like the new soap smell !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the water that is the main ingredient in lubricating the razor blade as you shave, not the soap itself.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried any of the high end shaving cream/soaps yet (proraso, TOBS, AOS, etc.)</li>
            <li>I rate both the product and the seller highly - both highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Now my entire face looks and feels like a fresh sunburn.  </li>
            <li>That said, it is not materially better than any plain soap you normally use to wash yourself with.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that strongly scented, but it&#x27;s subtle scent is extremely clean and masculine.</li>
            <li>People have personal preferences concerning scents of soap and there is a big industry in selling one brand over another and there are hundreds of ingredients that can be added or subtracted to make one soap appeal more than another, but in the end, as far as shaving goes, anyway, they all work much the same.</li>
            <li>http://amzn.com/lm/R3Q4Z8M61R614L You may now advance directly to the $20 experience, my fellow cheapskates!</li>
            <li>remarkable, although somewhat expensive.  </li>
            <li>It lathers very well, keeps your skin soft and never dries, provides a close shave, and has a great but faint smell!</li>
            <li>It foams well and the foam stands long enough to shave comfortably even in a desert climate.</li>
            <li>My alum block stung worse than ever and my face and neck were bright red.</li>
            <li>If you use a straight razor, a brush, and soap in a wooden box, you can make quite a show of shaving and impress the girls.  </li>
            <li>Using double edged razor blades and razor and a Dove bar would be very inexpensive and effecient way to shave.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t found anything that works near as well at twice the price.</li>
            <li>Try a Taylor of Old Bond St, which is&lt;br /&gt;truly</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this does not irritate my face at all.  </li>
            <li>That was odd for me since I don&#x27;t have super sensitive skin or anything.</li>
            <li>The nice thing about shaving soaps is their round shape which fits into a typical shaving mug or box, but this is just an aesthetic issue, and maybe even adds some convenience.  </li>
            <li>I was able to purchase locally until a few months ago when the local stores stopped carrying it.  </li>
            <li>Before buying this large pack I&#x27;d recommend buying one at a local store (almost all big stores sell these for about $2-3).</li>
            <li>Shaving soaps, assuming one shave each morning, can last a couple of months before you need to throw a new puck into the shaving cup.  </li>
            <li>This is the only shave soap I&#x27;ve used, but I&#x27;m rather new to the safety razor scene.  </li>
            <li>During shaving, the blade rinses off cleanly and easily with cold water leaving no residue on the blade.</li>
            <li>is a major plus.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s getting harder to find this stuff in drug and grocery stores - mug soap cakes and brush shaving may be getting to be a thing of the past - so being able to get a brick of it</li>
            <li>I prefer a old fashion double edge razor for a close shave.</li>
            <li>It provides a thick, rich lather when applied with a quality boar&#x27;s hair brush.  </li>
            <li>Shaving soaps usually have special moisturizers that provide for a smoother face than regular shaving foams or gels.  </li>
            <li>This shave soap does not dry my skin out</li>
            <li>I do it every morning and the end result is a much closer shave with less blade snags.    </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product.  Does not cause any irritation on my face.</li>
            <li> Smell great and an incredible value - these little pucks last a long time and soften my skin for a great shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting harder to find this stuff in drug and grocery stores - mug soap cakes and brush shaving may be getting to be a thing of the past - so being able to get a brick of it delivered to my front door at a great price is a major plus.</li>
            <li> I have used this shave soap for over 20 years and it is just great.  I was able to purchase locally until a few months ago when the local stores stopped carrying it.  I really missed the soap and was happy to find it on Amazon.  Fantastic value and well worth the effort to purchase in large quantities.</li>
            <li> Good value. Works wells and will keep you shaving for a long time.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any of the high end shaving cream/soaps yet (proraso, TOBS, AOS, etc.) which I heard were great, but this is the best shave soap I&#x27;ve ever used and the best of the Van Der Hagen brand (I&#x27;ve tried tham all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s thicker, slicker and lathers better than the other VDH soaps.</li>
            <li> This is a perfectly fine inexpensive shaving soap, and I give it high marks all around.  That said, it is not materially better than any plain soap you normally use to wash yourself with. As far as I have been able to tell, virtually any hand soap like Dove or Ivory will lather up well enough to shave with. People have personal preferences concerning scents of soap and there is a big industry in selling one brand over another and there are hundreds of ingredients that can be added or subtracted to make one soap appeal more than another, but in the end, as far as shaving goes, anyway, they all work much the same. The purpose of soap in shaving is to help keep your skin wet while you shave. It&#x27;s the water that is the main ingredient in lubricating the razor blade as you shave, not the soap itself. Try it yourself. Lather your hand soap with a shaving brush and you&#x27;ll see there&#x27;s hardly any difference in the shave between it and a brand labeled for shaving. The nice thing about shaving soaps is their round shape which fits into a typical shaving mug or box, but this is just an aesthetic issue, and maybe even adds some convenience.  Shaving soaps make nice presents for men who use shaving brushes.  If you use a straight razor, a brush, and soap in a wooden box, you can make quite a show of shaving and impress the girls.  But you can get a perfectly fine shave using an inexpensive Bic razor and just lathering up a hand soap with you hands. Just don&#x27;t let anyone see you do it. It takes the mystery out of the process.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service. I have tried Williams soap and other similar products. VDH, however, is by far my favorite because it &#x27;feels&#x27; very clean and smooth when applied. There is no &#x27;slick&#x27; feeling during and after shaving on the skin due to lubricant additives. During shaving, the blade rinses off cleanly and easily with cold water leaving no residue on the blade. After shaving, the soap washes off cleanly and completely from the face with cold water - not leaving behind any  residue or odor on the skin. The 12 pack reduces cost on a per puck basis so it is much more economical. I rate both the product and the seller highly - both highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Smooth and lovely. My friend used it for his shave and found it very refreshing. I have decided to purchase it as a gift for my dad on the Father&#x27;s Day.</li>
            <li> This is really nice, long-lasting soap.  I bought it for my husband to use with this shave kit, but I use it to remove makeup, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or leave it irritated.  I shave with it sometimes, too, and it makes my legs really smooth and soft.    It smells of almonds, and is very mild.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> This mug soap is the best combination of quality and price on Amazon! Better than Colgate or Williams and the same price when you buy in bulk. Lathers up nicely and lubricates well. I am sold!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3SH8S597BTS6S]]Not just with the soap itself, mind, but with the deal.  Shaving soaps, assuming one shave each morning, can last a couple of months before you need to throw a new puck into the shaving cup.  If you assume about 2 months per puck, and this comes in a pack of 12...well, you see where I&#x27;m going with that.  That&#x27;s a GREAT value.  It can be argued that shaving foams and gels last nearly as long, but the difference with shaving soap is how it works on your skin.  Shaving soaps usually have special moisturizers that provide for a smoother face than regular shaving foams or gels.  Also, the lather is not nearly as thick, so a lot less actually goes down your sink.    A little trick for you: Fresh out of the shower, apply baby oil to the area to be shaved, then apply the shaving soap with a shaving brush in against-the-grain strokes, like you&#x27;re painting.  I say baby oil instead of preshave oil because baby oil does three things: soften the skin even more, help keep the hairs in place for an easy shave, and seems to help keep the lather from running or dissolving too fast.  I do it every morning and the end result is a much closer shave with less blade snags.    I&#x27;ve tried the generic Williams Mug soap sold at CVS, the Colonel Conk brand, and now this - and I can say the Van Der Hagen brand lathers the absolute best.  It&#x27;s thick without being \\&quot;foamy\\&quot;, and applies very nicely.  Don&#x27;t let others who tell you \\&quot;just use bar soap\\&quot; fool you.  You can shave with bar soap, yes...but shaving soap lathers quite differently from regular soap.      Good stuff and well worth the purchase.  It&#x27;s basically a dollar and some change per - which is comparable to other soap brands - but it performs like more expensive types.  Mix it with a hot towel treatment and you&#x27;ll be in shaving heaven.</li>
            <li> like the new soap smell !</li>
            <li> This soap costs $1.59 a cake at Walmart and about the same at Target stores too. I add a drop of skin cream to the cake, lather it up viciously, spread it on and let it sit for a minute or so. does a good job and gives a wonderful shave. . . Oh, wait, I use the deluxe soap from Van Der Hagen for $1.59 a cake. Wonderful stuff. Some people use a bar of Dove for shaving too. Have to try that for the heck of it. Using double edged razor blades and razor and a Dove bar would be very inexpensive and effecient way to shave. I like Feather razor blades and the Pilot Endura double edge razor. Great shave, loooowww cost. Typically get 25 to 30 shaves from one Feather blade. Cost of blade in bulk in 34 cents. Roughly 2 cents a shave soap and blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy shaving.</li>
            <li> This seemed like a great deal on what&#x27;s regarded as a decent cheap soap, so I picked up a puck the last time I was at my local pharmacy to give this a try. Everything started off well. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was fond of the scent when I opened the package, but as it lathered I really liked it. Is subtle and, yes, it is an \\&quot;old man\\&quot; type of scent, but I found it rather pleasing.  The lather I got wasn&#x27;t bad at all. It was certainly thinker and richer than the Col. Conk I&#x27;d been using. While shaving it seemed that the razor wasn&#x27;t gliding quite as nicely as with other soap even though I just popped in a fresh blade. After a moment of being on my skin I could feel irritation starting. That was odd for me since I don&#x27;t have super sensitive skin or anything. As I finished shaving it got worse.  My alum block stung worse than ever and my face and neck were bright red. There was a small on my chest where I had dropped some lather while brushing my face and it too was red and irritated. Now my entire face looks and feels like a fresh sunburn.  I can&#x27;t bring myself to give this only 1 star despite my bad experience since so many have little to no trouble and soap is a very personal item. For whatever reason my skin completely rejected something about this soap, and I&#x27;ve tolerated quite a few. Before buying this large pack I&#x27;d recommend buying one at a local store (almost all big stores sell these for about $2-3). If you like it, great, you know where to get a nice sized pack of them at. If you hate it like me, you don&#x27;t have another 11 to throw out.</li>
            <li> Van Der Hagens select shave soap is a suprisingly good shave soap. It lathers very well, keeps your skin soft and never dries, provides a close shave, and has a great but faint smell! I have tried many different types of shave soaps, and while van der hagen is not the best, its close enough and one of the cheapest around! Now i have tried all 3 van der hagen soaps: select, deluxe, and glycerine. deluxe and select are almost identical but the select has a slightly better scent, so I am giving the slight edge to the select, thus making the deluxe mostly useless. The glycerine however is slightly better for people who suffer easily from razor burn. Overall Van Der Hagen select shave soap(and glycerine) is a great shave soap for the price and should not be missed or avoided!</li>
            <li> This shaving soap lathers extremely well. It&#x27;s not that strongly scented, but it&#x27;s subtle scent is extremely clean and masculine. This is an absolute steal at the price it&#x27;s listed at; highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This shaving soap is awesome it makes my skin feel tuned and when shaving It leaves your skin with a fresh sensation too.</li>
            <li> Bought for my father in law who loves this soap but can&#x27;t find in the stores these days</li>
            <li> Only kind I ever will use . . .I love the feel of the lather, and my face does not dry out!</li>
            <li> For such and inexpensive soap this stuff performs like a million bucks! I will never go back to \\&quot;canned\\&quot; cremes!</li>
            <li> I like this soap, It lathers well.  Just not that I had to buy 12 at a time.  The price per soap puck buying 12 is awesome, but it will take me YEARS to use them all.  So the unused ones got wrapped up and put in the bottom of the freezer so they won&#x27;t turn rancid, like all soap eventually will.  Oh well...</li>
            <li> I love this soap. I got all 12 pucks of soap so I wouldn&#x27;t have to find them at Target again (which is kinda spotty). Now I won&#x27;t need to buy soap for another 9 years or so!</li>
            <li> The product arrived promptly &amp; in excellent condition. The product quality is also excellent with good beard softening characteristics &amp; good moisture retention offering a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I prefer a old fashion double edge razor for a close shave. I enjoy a brush lather since it is warm on the skin. This shave soap does not dry my skin out and I am pleased with it. One trick I learned is to place a little baby oil on my face before I lather up. It helps the razor cut the whiskers better. I use the gel type of baby oil.  This is my 2nd order of this product and I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This is a hell a lot better then most shaving soaps and gels out there. You can not go wrong with this product. Leaves the skin feeling smooth and changes shaving from a choir to one of pleasure.</li>
            <li> It appears to be a good product</li>
            <li> I have hard water. I bought soap and cream in the $1-$10 range, and eventually figured out what lather is supposed to be like, burning my face off in the process. I also discovered that what passes as &amp;#34;artisan&amp;#34; soap is just cheap soap &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; with marketable stuff melted into it. Then discovered an EZ DIY solution: http://amzn.com/lm/R3Q4Z8M61R614L You may now advance directly to the $20 experience, my fellow cheapskates!</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite soap so far.  I&#x27;ve only been using this type of shaving soap for less than two years and have tried three or four different soaps.  It provides a thick, rich lather when applied with a quality boar&#x27;s hair brush.  I tend to order a 12 pack.  Well worth it...</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of different creams and soaps but find this one to be very acceptable with a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Hey it is white. My previous bar was beige. It works great.</li>
            <li> This is my daily go to shaving solution. It leathers great and I haven&#x27;t found anything that works near as well at twice the price. Yes there are better, but you&#x27;ll pay 10 times as much. Buy the 12 pack so you never run out.</li>
            <li> This is the soap I will use over all others. It foams well and the foam stands long enough to shave comfortably even in a desert climate. What makes any Van Der Hagen soap stand out over almost every other offering is that you can microwave it or heat it over low heat and it melts. So what? It can be poured into any shape of shaving cup or bowl and fill it uniformly without that annoying air gap you get with the usual shaving cake. Any other brand that I have tried has been destroyed by heat.</li>
            <li> This soap creates a thick,  long lasting lather.  I use a  Parker 100% Black Badger Bristle Shaving Brush.  works great for my straight razor shave.  The soap is very, very, very lightly scented. should not affect the scent of your chosen after shave lotion.  I have been using this soap for about 3 yrs. with absolutely no skin irritation.  Which  is good since this 12 pack is going to last me another 3 or 4 more years.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years... very nice, great aroma and long lasting</li>
            <li> For the price this soap is a bargain, adds to a pleasant shave experience and doesnt have an overpowering scent.  I would recommend using this soap while taking a shower as it does tend to dry easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a newbie to DSRs. I&#x27;d suggest buying them one at a time in case you&#x27;re not a fan of the razor. The 12 pack will last years!</li>
            <li> I have used this soap for a year and this last batch has made my skin break out. what are you doing to the product</li>
            <li> I like this &amp;#34;select&amp;#34; soap better than the &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; by Van Der Hagen. This is great!</li>
            <li> My husband will only use this soap he loves the way it lathers and doesn&#x27;t dry his skin.</li>
            <li> I bought a six pack supply of this soap.  What a mistake!  This soap does not lather well at all,&lt;br /&gt;and hardly provides the slickness required for DE shaving.  Try a Taylor of Old Bond St, which is&lt;br /&gt;truly remarkable, although somewhat expensive.  An alternative would be Poraso Shaving Cream&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I sent the entire package back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a beginner when it comes to wet shaving. This soap works perfectly for me. You cant beat the price and it makes a great lather. Nice and thick with a great mild scent. You&#x27;ll love it!!!</li>
            <li> This is the only shave soap I&#x27;ve used, but I&#x27;m rather new to the safety razor scene.  For now, I&#x27;ll keep using this one, as it lathers very nicely.  These have no smell or anything as I believe they are unscented.  I have sensitive skin and this does not irritate my face at all.  Perfect price, at about $2/per puck and they last forever!</li>
            <li> This soap is gentle, smooth and fragrant. The rich lather softens my beard and gives a clean start to each day. Buying in bulk is an economical way to have plenty on hand; there&#x27;ll be no need to reorder for more than a year. I also like the environmentally suitable packaging, with no aerosol can to throw away. When a cake is used up, the plastic container and chipboard box go the recycling bin.</li>
            <li> takes care of my shaving needs.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try this since there were so many good reviews, but I found it way too hard to work up a good lather.  Smells clean, and is inexpensive, but definitely more a shaving &#x27;soap&#x27; than a cream or lather.  I&#x27;ll stick with Taylor of Old Bond Street,  Art of Shaving (pretty expensive for the amount you get) or Proraso.</li>
            <li> Fianc√©e loves this shaving soap , it&#x27;s the best price on here for 12 . Walnart they are 4 something each</li>
