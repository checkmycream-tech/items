            <li>Went online on Amazon and was able to find with ease.</li>
            <li>and the shave is way much better.</li>
            <li>but I guess that&#x27;s the part of the electric razor that has the most value.  </li>
            <li>I sincerely don&#x27;t believe that it is my doing after all these sixty plus shaving years with Norelco shavers.</li>
            <li>Buying the best next time and spending the $$</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Norelco for many years.</li>
            <li>one or two years at the most.</li>
            <li>Been satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>They cut and shave OK, but they bind on the razer as I cut.  </li>
            <li>, the better it would get those stray hairs.</li>
            <li>Love a close shave with quality replacement heads on my Norelco electric razor.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed at the ease with which I was able to purchase the Norelco blades.  </li>
            <li>Such a great price!</li>
            <li>As I said, a disaster, most of it our fault.  </li>
            <li>I HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY SATISFIED WITH THESE BLADES AND WILL CONTINUE TO USE THEM.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>Cranked it up, and at this point it&#x27;s somewhat better than before.</li>
            <li>My son in law love it</li>
            <li>i was pleased with the speed in which it arrived</li>
            <li>Could do a much better job.</li>
            <li>they where workd perfect till now but second time purchased replacement heads was to bed</li>
            <li>Work OK.  </li>
            <li>They take my whiskers off better than a weed eater.</li>
            <li>Product was OK.    </li>
            <li>Tripleheaders Replacement Heads arrived in the proper time frame and was in excellent condition.  </li>
            <li>I had the shaver for one year,after one year norelco says to renew the heads for better performance.</li>
            <li>They cut better</li>
            <li>I will continue to use amazon.com for most of my online purchases.</li>
            <li>Glad they did.</li>
            <li>Amazon had them and at a better price.</li>
            <li>What more can I say?</li>
            <li>The price is substantially better than what&#x27;s offered on the Norelco website.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get better than that.</li>
            <li>These things have lasted me more than a year, although I have a beard</li>
            <li>:)   </li>
            <li>I switched one year ago from a regular razor (Schick Quattro) to the Norelco electric razor, and I am very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize there were so many Norelco razors.  </li>
            <li>what more can I say..</li>
            <li>Quality product, with a great shave at a reasonable price without gouging your pocket.  </li>
            <li>and it sure shaves closer than the Norelco ever did.</li>
            <li>every time, I love these blades.</li>
            <li>Product met all my expectations and more.  </li>
            <li>It was better for me to replace this item than to have it sharpen.</li>
            <li>This electric razor works so much better</li>
            <li>maybe even better then</li>
            <li>I have used a Norelco razor for many years.  </li>
            <li>After about 5 years I was getting a lot more shaver burn.</li>
            <li>I have no burn and get an even better shave than ever.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>really love the way amazon service handled it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Also when he reaches the mind-set to no longer do it at all, I will be able to do it for him since the heads are floaters.  </li>
            <li>It will be interesting to see if the noise is from some sort of dragging that reduces the life of a charge on the shaver.</li>
            <li>I have been using Norelco shavers for many years and still believe them to be the best of the electric shavers, but recently the heads just do not seem to hold there sharpness.</li>
            <li>Better than the heads that they replaced.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;so can count on delivery as I need more.</li>
            <li>Amazon, I love your website.</li>
            <li>, it had been a bit more than a year after all..</li>
            <li>but some times the men things are just better and who will know?</li>
            <li>* , ok?</li>
            <li>The product is OK.  </li>
            <li>There again, I have used Norelco Products for many years.</li>
            <li>I will order more.  </li>
            <li>There has to be a better way for my husband to shave.</li>
            <li>What more can I say.</li>
            <li>It is get that we are able to get replacements for my husband&#x27;s razor.  </li>
            <li>I would pay more for a product that lasted longer.</li>
            <li>Love electric shavers.</li>
            <li>Since most buyers seemed satisfied, I decided to order them.</li>
            <li>I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>OK OK OK OK&lt;</li>
            <li>These worked OK.  </li>
            <li>Most people probably don&#x27;t keep their product booklets, so it would help to include the \\&quot;how-to\\&quot; with the replacements.</li>
            <li>Satisfied.</li>
            <li>The HQ8 replacement blades are top quality</li>
            <li>Excellent Replacement parts when the current one wear out.</li>
            <li>There must be dozens of Norelco models that have similar parts however this product matched my model perfectly.</li>
            <li>I have used Norelco shavers for many years.  </li>
            <li>Need I say more?</li>
            <li>Bought them through Amazon and I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>they are blades, they cut, what more do you need to know?</li>
            <li>They fit nicely on the shaver.</li>
            <li>I love the product.  </li>
            <li>I thought I was getting more than one because it headline says &amp;#34;Heads&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Just what I needed to get my shaver in tip top shape.</li>
            <li>I love the Philip Norelco electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Bought a $15.00 travel Braun and it shaves better than a $100 Norelco, which won&#x27;t stay together.</li>
            <li>So much better now that I&#x27;ve replaced my heads.</li>
            <li>Every year I change the heads for better results.</li>
            <li>everything is outstanding.</li>
            <li>ok don&#x27;t change nothing</li>
            <li>The electric works better (for me)</li>
            <li>and I do not have to go over my face as many times compared to</li>
            <li>I might be OK with it</li>
            <li>These replacement heads are better than the originals.</li>
            <li>Grandpa is now able to cut off all those pesky gray stubbles and look handsome again.  </li>
            <li>I appreciate a smooth cheek to kiss.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li>Just make sure that you get the ones designed for your model.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I replaced them, would I still be satisfied with the shave?  </li>
            <li>These blades are actually better then the ones that came with my series 7130.  </li>
            <li>Changing the shaver heads gets you a better shave.</li>
            <li>Newer is not always better.  </li>
            <li>They will be used I am sure</li>
            <li>Heads are great replacement and cheaper than replacing the whole shaver.  </li>
            <li>Glad I bought them.</li>
            <li>After getting them from Amazon the razor cuts much better.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>Shaving goes much better with these in place</li>
            <li>I am glad I purchased my replacement heads for my shaver</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using my razor for years and have bought many replacements</li>
            <li>Be sure to replace blades yearly like the instructions say.</li>
            <li>I love my razor, now I can keep it and not replace it with something else</li>
            <li>I will not purchase any more.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There should be a better explanation of the sizing.</li>
            <li>I have used this product, or its predecessor for many years.  </li>
            <li>These are authentic Norelco heads</li>
            <li>The package arrived in time for my dad&#x27;s birthday present, which made us both very happy!</li>
            <li>i love them</li>
            <li>Works ok...</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>It arrived ok in spite of the post office&#x27;s attempt to smash it.....</li>
            <li>I love Norelco.</li>
            <li>He has the Norelco and has had it for many years.  </li>
            <li>so he thought maybe he had better do that.</li>
            <li>I am using the shaver and seems to be ok.</li>
            <li>Shaving takes longer than I&#x27;d like with this head, but I find that&#x27;s par for the course with most electric razors.</li>
            <li>I have been using Norelco razors for 25+ years &amp; am satisfied with the product &amp; replacement parts.</li>
            <li>Could use better installation instructions.</li>
            <li>By ordering this item I saved money and didn&#x27;t have to purchase more</li>
            <li>:) I recommend cleaning off the razor head with isopropyl alcohol after each use to keep it semi-sterile.</li>
            <li>Love these OEM replacement Heads for my Norelco razor.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this part, It works better than the ones</li>
            <li>Your shaving unit has the three circles on top which are the blades.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>and I suspect for most users of a Norelco shavers.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>

            <li>Amazon has always provided me with great merchandise with fast delivery.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad that I saw the replacement blades instead.</li>
            <li>Thankful to be able to replace the blades and not have to trash&lt;br /&gt;the unit, which seems to be the trend</li>
            <li>Norelco makes what I think is the best razor available, with the addition of these replacement blades, it turned my 3 year old razor back to its superb shaves again.</li>
            <li>:)</li>

            <li>Norelco is my personal choice for best electric razor.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Wonderful deal with the instant clip coupon!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I replaced the heads, it worked out well for me.</li>
            <li>could have asked for a better replacement for my razor.</li>
            <li>It pays to change the blades every so ofter for a better shave.</li>
            <li>Prompt delivery, as advertised; completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>Item satisfied my needs.</li>
            <li>we all love.  </li>
            <li>and I am enjoying</li>
            <li>more words required.....good buy, but now Michigan is calling for sales tax to be TAKEN from us.......</li>
            <li>I guess that is why they sell more electric shavers than anyone else.</li>
            <li>Great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>This was even after trying them for a couple of weeks to make sure my face got used to them.  </li>
            <li>great replacement, you can really tell the difference.</li>
            <li>fast shipping,works great.</li>
            <li>more could we ask for</li>
            <li>It replaces the razor heads and gets a much better and closer shaves.  </li>
            <li>Usually it&#x27;s more like 2 years as in my case.  </li>
            <li>I am totally satisfied with the product, but I wouldn&#x27;t say I &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; it.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with these replacement heads, made in The Netherlands.</li>
            <li>and there are many, MANY people who should and do need to svave</li>
            <li>second time buying the replacement heads from here - best price found, came as shown and working well since replaced</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably invest in a better shaver soon instead.</li>
            <li>but I do get a better shave after the change.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a better closer shave.</li>
            <li>It might take a couple of minutes now to reach that stage where no trace of facial hair can be felt, which is longer time than it used to, but still awesome.</li>
            <li>It works for the most part, but if I put pressure on the heads when I shave it starts rattling and skipping.  </li>
            <li>Having blades set up for automatic periodic shipping is great to remind you that you need to change them on some regular basis to continue to get good results from your shaver.</li>
            <li>Satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li>Able to get more use from it, rather than disposable.</li>
            <li>love this razor head -</li>
            <li>This did the trick:)</li>
            <li>Just make sure you get the correct Product number on the Blades.  </li>
            <li>On the plus side, I&#x27;m glad to have sharper blades in my electric razor again.  </li>
            <li>better shave than non-Norelco products.</li>
            <li>are the fastest and closest and, of course, the most costly.  </li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I am sure he must be taking the routine cleaning care as well.</li>
            <li>I am sure these will to.  </li>
            <li>OK  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; article.</li>
            <li>Glad I found this one on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Glad to have them, pleased with the brand and the quality. :)</li>
            <li>why do I have do write so many words</li>
            <li>Could have been better with clearer instructions.</li>
            <li>I am glad I tried this,</li>
            <li>What more can I say?  </li>
            <li>so I purchased the replacement heads and am pleased with them/</li>
            <li>I replace them as required, but I&#x27;m beginning to think it&#x27;s all a hype to sell more heads.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed at how much better they worked then</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>, the better it would get those stray hairs.</li>
            <li>The difference was stunning.  </li>
            <li>These are excellent quality and simple to install once you get them off the plastic shipping card.  </li>
            <li>good fit,  nice to get fresh blades for  a close shave</li>
            <li>Its okay.</li>
            <li>You sure don&#x27;t get what you see in the picture.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product Philips.</li>
            <li>Outstanding price on these heads.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m quite satisfied.</li>
            <li>I will add that I appreciate being able to order parts from home and not spend gas money going to stores that may or may not have what I need.</li>
            <li>Just make sure the cutters and heads stay together as they are matched pairs.</li>
            <li>It was OK but the one replacement blades</li>
            <li>I expect better from a Phillips Norelco product.</li>
            <li>Nobody does it better.</li>
            <li>These are my husbands favorite shaver heads, I buy for him all the time.</li>
            <li>It works better than stated by the Phillips people.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>(replace the blades) more often?</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great experience.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t expect anything more :)</li>
            <li>To get the best shave it is essential to change blades every year (or sooner).  </li>
            <li>so I tried replacing them and was well pleased.</li>
            <li>That was before they started manufacturing many of the models in China.</li>
            <li>I read the item description many, many times, trying to make sure it was the correct blade replacement for my shaver model.</li>
            <li>The blades are ok, but using the shaver can be a pain in the butt.  </li>
            <li>, what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>Way closer shave, feel more manly, can shave after a shower, and it is cheaper.</li>
            <li>He says they are better than the ones that came with his razor when it was purchased.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I was able to find these on amazon .</li>
            <li>These are placement heads which do what they should do - cut better than the worn heads that were replaced.</li>
            <li>She told me no because she did just that two years ago, and it was still working OK.  </li>
            <li>I will buy them again in another year or so. :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>As with most of the replacement heads, you begin to see a decrease in quality after about six weeks to two months.  </li>
            <li>For the price you pay for replacement heads, I feel the quality should be better.</li>
            <li>Well pleased.</li>
            <li>Work better than the ones that came installed on it.</li>
            <li>I am glad I used them.</li>
            <li>Better price that CVS.</li>
            <li>pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>My husband is satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Probably cost more than they should.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The razor works better now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>hopefully my dad would love it.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.  </li>
            <li>I was satisfied with the replacement.  </li>
            <li>Like several others, I was enticed by the excellent price.</li>
            <li>albeit this is a supposed reputable company in the Netherlands.  </li>
            <li>Better than stock blades.</li>
            <li>But these worked ok.</li>
            <li>So glad I found them and did not need to get the item for the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>It was ok.</li>
            <li>Great blades fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied with them.</li>
            <li>Made my razor work better</li>
            <li>Great price and fast delivery - just what I wanted.</li>
            <li>This replacement was the perfect upgrade to my shaver to get it back to tip top</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s actualy more than $25.</li>
            <li>I top reviewer claims these are fakes, perhaps his were, not the ones I received</li>
            <li>you cant ask any more than that.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>Have thru the years, made this replacement about every year, and have always been satisfied.</li>
            <li>Love the cost savings.</li>
            <li>bought online to get better price than through a box store.  </li>
            <li>Just Okay.</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with the replacement head for my shaver because it works great and was offered at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>and some might do so more often.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with Norelco razor Heads</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had to replace the heads in my shaver more than once a year.</li>
            <li>and how it shaves much better</li>
            <li>Price is okay.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They said that they need 7 more words, so now I have them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried most department stores (target, walmart, etc.)</li>
            <li>Works ok.</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was astonished at how much better the razor worked with the hew heads.  </li>
            <li>My lesson is that the heads should probably be changed more often -- perhaps every six months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better than the heads that came with shaver, they made an improvement .</li>
            <li>Shaving is quicker, and my skin feels better afterwards.  </li>
            <li>and you shave it more often</li>
            <li>I worked with them on a shipping issue and they sincerely wanted me to be a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>I made sure that these would work for my model and purchased them.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know for sure, but I suspect that that is the reason they did not work well -</li>
            <li>so I got a replacement, and was more careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I HAVE BEEN USING NORELCO PRODUCTS FOR MANY YEARS</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m now getting a better deeper shave.</li>
            <li>These are replacement blades… What more can I say?</li>
            <li>I did many years ago: fill my wallet with rubber condoms.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product</li>
            <li>that they are OK.</li>
            <li>Worthwhile replacement.  </li>
            <li>Quality seems to be ok.</li>
            <li>OK, I don&#x27;t buy the 12 month guideline for replacing heads unless you&#x27;re Grizzly Adams and grow brillo pad for hair.  </li>
            <li>We are fully satisfied with the Phillips Norelco replacement blades.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>Glad to find this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I got the product on time, it was the product i was expecting , nice, original, very cheap...</li>
            <li>Very happy with these - arrived quickly and inexpensively and fit my model exactly.</li>
            <li>Great price, and fit right in.</li>
            <li>Fit just right and work great</li>
            <li>but if you have reasonably good eyes and are patient you can see when it is right</li>
            <li>Amazing how much better these work than even the original heads did.</li>
            <li>These replacements are very easy to install and do a fine job of restoring a close shave.  </li>
            <li>Great cut, lasted very well and were easily able to clean!</li>
            <li>Good clean smooth shave, and I&#x27;m african-american.</li>
            <li>nice to be able to replace the heads instead of purchasing a whole new razor, shipping is all ways awesome</li>
            <li>shaving heads cut great and were an exact fit</li>
            <li>He said he is once again getting a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li>Worked great in my older razor .</li>
            <li>I now have a nice clean cut after shaving.</li>
            <li>I had an older Phillips Norelco model (discontinues about three years ago) that worked great for years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product at a decent price.</li>
            <li>Nice clean shave every time.  </li>
            <li>The heads do a great job and the battery still holds a long charge so it did turn out to be a good decision.</li>
            <li>Very easy to replace and made a huge difference in shaver performance.  </li>
            <li>The great bulk of reviews were on the high side</li>
            <li>Great value compared with ridiculously high price in Japan.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>works great when new,  but I can&#x27;t get more than 6 months out of them.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and easy to replace.  </li>
            <li>I was pretty excited after reading all of those great reviews.</li>
            <li>(Christmas orders from Amazon received excellent service, so I can&#x27;t understand the long delay here.)  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to be as good as when bought the shaver in the first place.</li>
            <li>These are pretty good blades</li>
            <li>Pretty good price point compared to say Wal- Mart.</li>
            <li>All in All a pretty good set of replacement set of heads ..</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have had good replacement heads.</li>
            <li>Replacement fit the razor fine, but don&#x27;t seem as good as the original heads in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>Restored original performance of my razor!  </li>
            <li>The new blades work great on my triple header.  </li>
            <li>New shaving blades are great</li>
            <li>Delivery was great on time ,i have not shaved in two days waiting for by new blades.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My husband keeps saying how great the new heads work on his razor.</li>
            <li>This is a great way to go to avoid buying new shavers.</li>
            <li>I got this for my husband and he is so happy to have a new head for his razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to have new razor heads.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise new heads work great.</li>
            <li>so i said goodby and welcome to the new one.</li>

            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sent email feedback that the HQ8 replacement heads didn&#x27;t fit my model</li>
            <li>HQ8 did fit it</li>
            <li>I had to return the blades because they didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>But they fit.</li>
            <li>He determined they are not durable because the &#x27;replace heads&#x27; light came on soon after he installed them.</li>
            <li>Replace once a year for a comfortable close shave</li>
            <li>Fortunately for me, I started up a subscription for the replaceable razors, and it worked out fantastic.  </li>
            <li>The replacement head shaves smoothly ....</li>
            <li>This is a great product by a solid</li>

            <li>not and smooth as originals</li>
            <li>Fit on my norelco shaver.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my husband and he reckons they are fantastic,</li>
            <li>I was not getting a great shave from my electric razor and decided to replace the heads instead of the entire razor.  </li>
            <li>Even though the razor head lasts a good, long time, it&#x27;s always nice to be able to have spares on hand--and at a reasonable cost!  </li>
            <li>Now I get a really comfortable close shave,</li>

            <li>But the Amazon page gave his Razor&#x27;s model number as one of the models these blades would fit in.  </li>

            <li>liked the product it went very well&lt;</li>
            <li>This is important because the grate can bend if you just throw the shaver in your luggage without its protective cover.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one is a snap, and it really does make the shave excellent and quiet!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed that these blades last a whole year.  </li>

            <li>Since there is no other alternative, I will continue using these replacement heads until I need to replace my shaver with a new one (probably not another Norelco, as they no longer get best reviews by Consumer Reports).</li>

            <li>They&#x27;re original heads and fit my AT814 razor just fine.</li>

            <li>Sure enough-she found and ordered the right one.  </li>
            <li>The heads seem to be made as well as the original ones were, so overall I&#x27;m quite happy with them.</li>
            <li>Far superior to original blades, made I china?</li>
            <li>; if you want a really good shave you have to pay more to get better heads.&amp;#34; The product descriptions seem to suggest that every item is exactly like every otehr item ecept for some extra features (which I don&#x27;t need).</li>

            <li>you purchase these HQ8 dual precision replacement heads through the Amazon Subscribe and Save program and get 15% off when ordering 5 or more subscription items at one time like I do, you will spend just about $20.00 for one set of these replacement heads - a very reasonable price indeed for a</li>
            <li>The new replacement is great and provides a really close shave.</li>
            <li>But...three days after order i saw that you can buy a totally new Norelco razor for 3$ more which would be better.</li>

            <li>Fast easy transaction..makes me a satisfied customer</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think they are original manufacturer blades.</li>
            <li>I had the original heads from 6 years ago.  </li>
            <li>so I kept the original ones rather than throwing them out</li>
            <li>Oh the difference fresh blades make!  </li>
            <li>the original shave head lasted 3 years, the replacement has worn out in 3 months</li>
            <li>No matter what stay with the original NORELCO brand.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>well worth it!</li>
            <li>Original part.</li>
            <li>the only problem was my own when i didn&#x27;t even know the model of shaver i owned!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to cut as close as the original blade.</li>
            <li>The original ones were stamped with &amp;#34;8-SERIES&amp;#34; and these are stamped with &amp;#34;Double-Precision&amp;#34;.]</li>
            <li>Paying $30 for replacement heads when the razor originally cost $40 is a bit steep.</li>
            <li>the original&#x27;s were sharper.</li>
            <li>I was pretty sure they should have worked with my Philips touchsensor device...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using for two weeks, and hope it lasts one year as the original blades.</li>
            <li>While a bit pricey, they were easy to replace and after a short break in period, provide a good clean shave.</li>
            <li>Never disappointed.</li>
            <li>Seems like they changed them from the original.</li>
            <li>It is an original Norelco product.</li>
            <li>needs better instructions for first time user</li>
            <li>But his original blades did not have this nib.  </li>
            <li>The original razor lasted about a year.  </li>
            <li>These blades do not cut as well as the original.</li>
            <li>As usual Norelco provides the best electric shaver experience.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery and working just fine.</li>
            <li>This is original manufacturer Philips product.</li>

            <li>Not an after market product arrived in two days in original packaging.</li>
            <li>It was just what we ordered, not to exciting of item, but was just what he needed for his razor!</li>
            <li>Been using original blades since receiving the razor 2yrs ago.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s from Norelco, then it ought to work as well as the original heads.  </li>
            <li>These are original Philips Norelco brand blades.</li>
            <li>I have a shaved head and this works perfect for me , no more cuts and scrapes , should have done this years ago</li>
            <li>These are replacement heads, assume they will work as well as the original.  </li>
            <li>However; they don&#x27;t sell the original heads.  </li>
            <li>Great Philips quality and long life.</li>
            <li>The shaver was originally purchased in 2003.</li>
            <li>Exactly what we needed and price is better than what I can get in store.</li>
            <li>Works  like original</li>
            <li>Restored shaver to original condition.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the cost!</li>
            <li>If there is any difference in these heads from the original</li>
            <li>My shaver now works like it did when I originally bought it.  </li>
            <li>I replaced my original stock razor heads after a year of use.</li>
            <li>The quality has dropped significantly or I keep getting lemons.</li>
            <li>then the original...</li>
            <li>I had been using the original blades in my razor for over three years.  </li>
            <li>looks like original</li>
            <li>Exact fit!  </li>
            <li>Just like the original</li>
            <li>replacement heads dropped right in and cut as good as new.</li>
            <li>Easy replacement and more cost effective than buying a whole new razor.</li>
            <li>very careful not to separate the movable cutters from their stationary housing, as they are carefully ground together for a perfect fit - and a good clean cut.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I replaced the original saving heads and blades on my aquatech electric razor after the recommended 12 months and it gives a much closer more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Fits on my Norelco razor perfectly, restores a nice sharp cut to the razor, and saves me some money over buying at the local department store!  </li>
            <li>The producto is good altough it was not the same as the original, but fit well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing what NEW blades will do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have new blades.</li>
            <li>Nice to have new blades.</li>
            <li>Nice to have a new razor.  </li>
            <li>Loving my like new razor .</li>
            <li>Loving the new razor heads.</li>
            <li>Nice to have new blades again.</li>
            <li>Effectively they restore the razor to new condition.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>forgot what a good shave you get with new heads&lt;br /&gt;gonna have to buy a new set more often&lt;</li>
            <li>It is nice to have a close shave again although I don&#x27;t understand why replacement blades cost 50% of what a new shaver would cost.</li>
            <li>Great to purchase new heads for such a great price - postponing complete razor purchase for yet another year.</li>
            <li>Good prices - doubly so with free ground-saver shipping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only a good deal if you don&#x27;t have to pay for shipping because shavers are so cheap these days</li>
            <li>These heads do not give as clean cut a shave as the orginal heads.</li>
            <li>They keep me clean shaven.</li>
            <li>I replaced the heads and viola, clean shaven again.</li>
            <li>but before doing so I decided to clean the heads.</li>
            <li>Worked perfectly and brought my old razor back to life.  </li>
            <li>course I am glad Amazon offers a choice of both cheaper and more convenient than a trip to Warmart.</li>
            <li>got them quickly but the don&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li>I use the Norelco Spray Lubricant and kept them clean.</li>
            <li>Clean shave every time.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t give a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>Ther just blades they were sihipped quickly and fit my razor of course.</li>
            <li>i am now clean shaven.</li>
            <li>It takes longer the shave but is easier to clean</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m clean shaven again.</li>
            <li>I again get a close, clean shave without any plucks.  </li>
            <li>i get a clean close shave, no nicks</li>
            <li>Thank you for having it available and sending it out so quickly.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a good product and fast service.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the good price and fast shipping..</li>
            <li>I hope your experience is a more positive one.</li>
            <li>I hope your experience is a more positive one.</li>
            <li>They certainly work a lot better than the original heads, which were probably worn out.</li>
            <li>Really good replacement kit, it is not expensive and your machine is new again.</li>
            <li>I have purchased shaver heads from Amazon in the past and have always been impressed by the quick service.</li>
            <li>Rather than buying a new razor we got new blades, it was an awesome purchase because it made the razor like new again!</li>
            <li>Exactly like the original!  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly, the new ones were not so much better than the old ones.</li>
            <li>Gives a very close shave, better than the original did.</li>
            <li>Their replacement heads are very easy to change and the new heads make a significant difference in closeness.  </li>
            <li>The replacement screens have a different pattern of holes that do not seem to be effective at catching hairs that lay at certain angles, something I did not notice with the original screens.</li>
            <li>The new heads made my shaver almost like new works great</li>
            <li>THE CUSTOMERS, SPECIALLY MEN, CAN GET IN,</li>
            <li>the item arrived in 2 days after my order with no expediting or special options.  </li>
            <li>Nothing too special.  </li>
            <li>I was worried they wouldn&#x27;t work for my Norelco 7825XL, since it wasn&#x27;t specially listed.</li>
            <li>Description was to follow to make sure I was receiving the right blades for the right razor.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re right, replace your heads every year!  </li>
            <li>The replacement blades for my Norelco razor are excellent, fit properly and provide an outstanding smooth shave in less time than those that were replaced after a year&#x27;s service.</li>
            <li>Once a year if your lucky, or replace original blades every eight months.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>These items arrived quickly and have lived up to the original equipment.  </li>
            <li>These blades were easy to install and were an exact replacement for my original blades.  </li>
            <li>Good clean shaves just like a whole brand new razor.</li>
            <li>great product value arrived promptly as expected</li>
            <li>These fit exactly and give a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Overall good product but a bit on the pricey side.</li>
            <li>Better price and fast shipping</li>
            <li>Function is good enough.  </li>
            <li>(Much cheaper and better for the environment than throwing out the razor again.)     </li>
            <li>These are cool and work well</li>
            <li>and i thought i would be able to snap the whole head out</li>
            <li>These blades last a good year or two.</li>
            <li>These are true Norelco brand and it shows.</li>
            <li>It seems I&#x27;m almost wearing the whiskers off, I go over them so many times and even then it&#x27;s nat a real close shave.</li>
            <li>Now I get my good razor back with all the bells.</li>
            <li>It is early yet, but blades are providing a nice shave&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>a real razor is better</li>
            <li>It beats replacing the whole razor for sure.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why you have to buy the whole head set when you used to be able to buy just the blades for a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li>Okay product but a bit too much &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; for my liking.</li>
            <li>Today, I shaved a full beard off in about 5 minutes with my Norelco razor.  </li>
            <li>I actually have not used these as I have boxed up the razor and put it on the shelf and returned to the good ole disposable razors.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sure thanks for a quickshipment</li>
            <li>These blades are a must for quick clean shaves with an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>My father love it, and the price is very competitive.</li>
            <li>When you want something good for a low price, do not click on the 1st picture that pops up.</li>
            <li>Wish that I had been able to fid the replacement blades much sooner</li>
            <li>But overall, this was a good purchase.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, the price with shipping was cheaper than I would have to pay at local stores.</li>
            <li>back to shaving with good blades.</li>
            <li>so I could use the full seat</li>
            <li>Good quality for a terrific price.</li>
            <li>We have used this razor for years, and I was thankful to find such a good price on  these blades.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much louder and more mechanical sounding than the stock heads that came on my shaver.</li>
            <li>(full head assemblies are $35 to $50)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i am very well satisfied with speedy service &amp; quality of replacement heads</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m getting quick, clean shaves again.</li>
            <li>makes a big difference and a good price</li>
            <li>Not bad stuff been using this brand for a while</li>
            <li>The new heads are very easy to install.</li>
            <li>I still like my old Norelco shaver, and it&#x27;s great to have options for new blades.</li>
            <li>replace the heads give a new life to your machine, slogan for Norelco for free 8-)</li>
            <li>I signed up for this to be sure that I will get new heads every 6 months for a price below the listed price and with shipping free.</li>
            <li>Good deal to replace the shaver heads instead of buying a whole new razor.  </li>
            <li>easy to swap in and out and seems to cut better than my 5 year old razor set.</li>
            <li>I only replaced my original heads because I damaged them during a cleaning, otherwise I think they would have had many more years of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fit was just right.  </li>
            <li>Pretty easy to replace.</li>
            <li>appears to be appropriatly priced, but more important they are available for replacement for the cheap enough price.</li>
            <li>One of the heads wore out quickly, perhaps because the fit wasn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li>They fit just fine and his razor is working very well.</li>
            <li>They were the exact replacement blades he needed; quickly sent to where he lives and my brother easily popped them in for Dad.</li>
            <li>Arrived very fast and worked fine.</li>
            <li>Fit great, packaging a little troublesome but well protected.</li>
            <li>They work great, never realized how wore out my other ones were till I put the news ones in.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I am happy and still using the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already noticed a great difference in the past couple days and hope it will be a great experience for my entire face!  </li>
            <li>and I can barely imagine a better product!</li>
            <li>great price, shipping time minimal!</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure I got a better shave from the old one than I have this one.</li>
            <li>Great to have sharp blades again.</li>
            <li>Great sharp razor heads.</li>
            <li>These are sharp and great.</li>
            <li>They seem to be better than the original ones when they were new.</li>
            <li>When replacing the blades, I realized that, although they look identical from the top, the new heads have about 50% fewer blades than the original heads did.  </li>
            <li>Works as expected, deliver was very prompt and price was very good, too.</li>
            <li>Purchase was very easy, product came in a short period of time and the price was right!!  </li>
            <li>to replace the blades on my husbands favorite razor than to buy a new one!</li>
            <li>I am always amazed at how much better I do with new heads!  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I forget to purchase the replacements in a timely manner, and I sure notice a difference in the shave once I do get the new ones!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad a did because after just popping out the old blades and putting in the new ones, I had a like new razor that shaves great.</li>
            <li>heads shave much closer and smoother than the original heads that came with my shaver!</li>
            <li>Great price, an exact match of original head and with little effort, was easy to install on head.</li>
            <li>The product was the solution I needed to make my shaver as good as new and a better price then I could find locally.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find these at a reasonable price instead of having to purchase a whole new razor.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with my \\&quot;Norelco Razor\\&quot; and would recommend its use by anyone interested in a comfortable clean shave.</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s price is the best around but even here the price of replacement heads is ridiculous.</li>
            <li>Work fine, razor works as well as when I first bought it.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described and works just fine on my razor.</li>
            <li>The ones that came with the razor wore out somewhat quickly.  </li>
            <li>the razor heads arrived quickly and in excellent/new condition, just as advertised.  </li>
            <li>QUICK SHIPPING</li>
            <li>Excellent price considering the ones in the stores are about 50% more expensive.</li>
            <li>It got to me quickly and they work well.</li>
            <li>They got here so quickly too.</li>
            <li>Works adequately.</li>
            <li>Quick service.</li>
            <li>and it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>The HQ8 shaver heads met all expectations and were shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and work well.</li>
            <li>The replacement heads made a tremendous improvement in the closeness of my shave.</li>
            <li>The replacement shaver heads arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quick.</li>
            <li>Oem heads arrived quickly and as described.</li>
            <li>I am lucky and do not have to replace my heads often</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied, but I will be buying myself a better razor eventually.</li>
            <li>and of course they were delivered quickly as the warehouse is in PA and so are we.  </li>
            <li>The problem with Norelco razors is that the blades wear out quickly.  </li>
            <li>and most do not carry products for older model shavers.  </li>
            <li>It came quickly.</li>
            <li>... shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Years ago the heads lasted a couple years, now I&#x27;m lucky to get 4 months out of them.</li>
            <li>Received it quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like he has a NEW RAZOR!!!!  </li>
            <li>Nice and sharp, giving a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I have used Phillips shavers for years and have been highly been highly satisfied.</li>
            <li>And, perhaps more importantly, why is there no sincere effort made to effectively describe and differentiate between the available options?  </li>
            <li>Super sharp and gives me a very nice close shave</li>
            <li>My old shaver&#x27;s about two years old, but the motor runs fine and the batteries still hold a good charge.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to change the old heads to these and they leave my boyfriend&#x27;s skin as smooth as when he first got the razor.</li>
            <li>was not getting a very comfortable shave and was thinking of getting a new shaver.decided to try the refill blades and no longer need</li>
            <li>But if you clean the right way, you can chnage once a year.</li>
            <li>Replacing the originals as recommended after almost exactly one year, these made a huge improvement in the quality and feel of my shave.</li>
            <li>It is like they don&#x27;t fit my razor exactly.   </li>
            <li>but these gave a close, comfortable shave on first use.  </li>
            <li>; I could not purchase this product locally and was very pleased to find it on the website.  </li>
            <li>Exact fit, which is what you want in a replacement.</li>
            <li>These were pretty cheap...</li>
            <li>Worked fine easily replaced the old blades on my wife&#x27;s razor!</li>
            <li>Shipped very fast!</li>
            <li>Shipped very fast!</li>
            <li>so this fit the bill exactly.  </li>
            <li>These replacement heads are an exact fit for the shaver.  </li>
            <li>I love my Norelco And will normally order a replacement head every year.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the replacement heads, I only wished I would have replaced them sooner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Apparently, vendor doesn&#x27;t have exact fit for my 7617x model.</li>
            <li>As long as I take my time and stretch my skin as instructed, I get a good shave.</li>
            <li>As long as it is made by Philips Norelco I didn&#x27;t worry about it not being good.</li>
            <li>As long as your razor and any rechargeable batteries are in good condition.</li>
            <li>He mentioned it took a long time to shave and it wasn&#x27;t doing a good job.</li>
            <li>I was about to give up on my Norelco, with these new blades it is as good as new.</li>
            <li>They are always in stock, always reasonably priced and super easy to install.</li>
            <li>Better than buying new razor.</li>
            <li>I think my shaver works better than it did when it was new with the replacement blades.</li>
            <li>you read the direction that come in the pack of three new blades you will understand better what i am saying .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The new heads work OK.  </li>
            <li>He says it shaves closer and works better than it did when it was new.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve had your shaver more than a year, you need these new blades.</li>
            <li>New blades make all the difference in the world and the price for these was outstanding.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased that I can extend the use of my Norelco, without purchasing a new one.</li>
            <li>So when the time comes I&#x27;ll buy another new one for sure.</li>
            <li>Much better shave with new cutters.</li>
            <li>Got them in a timely matter and for the price gotta love it need new replacement heads got them in a day</li>
            <li>Better than  buying a new razor.</li>
            <li>My husband enjoyed his shaves with the new blades.</li>
            <li>better than buying a new shaver</li>
            <li>It feels much better now with new blades.</li>
            <li>Still more convenient than a manual blade, the new heads have renewed  </li>
            <li>It sure makes a difference to put in new heads.  </li>
            <li>But if you replace every 6 or even every 9 months then the replacement head cost more than buying a new shaver.</li>
            <li>The new ones still hurt my face and leave some stubble, despite many passes.  </li>
            <li>Shaver works as new now :-)</li>
            <li>What a difference the new heads made in my favorite razor.  </li>
            <li>Love my new blades.</li>
            <li>Based on the performance of the replacement heads, it would be better to put the dollars towards a new razor.</li>
            <li>I have needed to buy new heads for my razor for more than six months, just kept forgetting to look around.</li>
            <li>So that no need to pay more for a new one.</li>
            <li>They do the job, but for about $15 more I think I&#x27;d rather just get a brand new razor.</li>
            <li>been using them for years with no complaints use to buy a new razor for a couple of bucks more than i paid for replacement blades.</li>
            <li>I am sure my husband will appreciate having new heads for his razor.  </li>
            <li>Beats buying Gillete Blades 4 pack @ $17.00, or more depends where you live.</li>
            <li>/&gt;All-in-all, I am pleased with the shave I get -- now that I have these new heads.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s better to buy these than a brand new razor every year.</li>
            <li>Blades cut so much better with new rotary blades..</li>
            <li>assume the housings are better [thinner] in the new ones too.</li>
            <li>good blades, fitted fine, very sharp.  </li>
            <li>His new heads were fine, but he did not understand what makes the &#x27;replace heads&#x27; light come on.</li>
            <li>If I could easily get a full refund, I&#x27;d do it right away, but I suspect it is too much busywork to get one.  </li>
            <li>Does not do that great on my neck area, but I just dry shave that with a razor to get the last hairs; it is still better than doing a full shave with a razor.</li>
            <li>This was a great buy , less money than discount department stores.</li>
            <li>Shaving time was back to normal , closeness was greatly improved,  </li>
            <li>Works great and cut my shaving time in half.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used them yet, however I&#x27;m sure they will be just as good as the originals as they always have in the past.</li>
            <li>This dealer is very prompt in shipping making this an easy online transaction.   </li>
            <li>Ordwering was easy and shipment was very prompt.</li>
            <li>The product fits the shaver very well and was easy to install.  </li>
            <li>they came fast, easy to install, they work like they are supposed to.</li>
            <li>The replacement heads were easy to replace and saved me so much time and money.</li>
            <li>and i would recommend them to others wanting a good dry shave</li>
            <li>It shipped fast, was affordable, and was easy to install.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping on this and worth it.</li>
            <li>The replacement parts are easy to put in but the product is just the razor circles, not the whole head.</li>
            <li>Size chart very functional and easy to you.</li>
            <li>Long lasting and do a wonderful job.</li>
            <li>If these last as long I will be very happy.</li>
            <li>but this one is better than brand new when I first got it!</li>
            <li>Gave my favorite old razor life!</li>
            <li>It is exactly like the original that came with the razor.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s now back to that close shave that is out of style but still his favorite!</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li>They are exact replacements for the original cutter heads.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as well as the original.</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s one way for the manufacturer to guarantee a higher profit!</li>
            <li>The price at Amazon was much better than I could find at a local store and as usual the service was superb.  </li>
            <li>The blades are great, I think, but with the new blades I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of razor rash especially in the area under my chin.</li>
            <li>Cost more than a new Philips razor and is worth it.</li>
            <li>So nice to have new blades for a much closer shave.</li>
            <li>but sure they will work fine...look easy to replace - same delivery as shown</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to forget how much faster shaving is when you have fresh heads in your razor after 6 months or a year, so in case you have forgotten...</li>
            <li>Easy drop-in fit to my 5 year old Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li>Fit &amp; installed easy as should a direct factory item</li>
            <li>was in stock, shipped quickly, fits my razor,&amp; the price was right.  </li>
            <li>The replacement HQ8 heads were new and original and  work fine.  </li>
            <li>I am only one week into my new shaving experience and so far I am greatly impressed.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the fine response to my request.</li>
            <li>Replacement was easy but the shaving result isn&#x27;t a whole lot better than the old heads.</li>
            <li>Although a real pain in the posterior to get aligned and installed correctly, the heads work just fine.</li>
            <li>These new heads cut better than the old worn heads, but not to such a great degree.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended and the shipping was quick with free super saver shipping from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Great Replacement Heads - a little pricey but</li>
            <li>These added life to my Norelco -- good product -- highly recommended -- easy to remove the old heads and snap in the new heads (although directions could have been easier to read).</li>
            <li>I would change more often but the price is pretty high.</li>
            <li>Said they were super easy to install and was amazed how closely the new heads cut.</li>
            <li>THEY GIVE ME A SMOOTH SHAVE; OFF COURSE IT HELPS WHEN YOU DON&#x27;T HAVE MUCH BEARD;</li>
            <li>Work and fit really well</li>
            <li>Really close and smooth.</li>
            <li>My razor suggests replacements every year, to save your face I think about every six months for a fast comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Fast, cheap, and just what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It would be helpful if there was a more accurate photograph of the parts that will actually be received.  </li>
            <li>Checked packaging very closely and appears to be genuine product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These fit and work very well.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price, free shipping.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s well worth spending for a replacement blade.</li>
            <li>Price was good and it was as expected</li>
            <li>Excellent product, but poor service from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li>This product is OK but even with blade replacement the razor does not work as well as my old Norelco Speed XL.</li>
            <li>I had a old 10yr triple header that did a much better and closer shave!!!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>If your razor is not cutting as it should its time you replace the blades.</li>
            <li>The pricing was worth it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>probably should have replaced them more frequently</li>
            <li>replacement blades worked great on a 7 year old shaver.... needed to add extra words for amazon to publish this</li>
            <li>I was surprised the shave was not even as good as with the old blades.  </li>
            <li>my great surprise, that was indeed the solution -- in one fell swoop, my shaves are back to what I was used to with my old Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They work as expected and shipped on time for a good price.</li>
            <li>They work a lot better than the year old (worn) ones.</li>
            <li>They work great and Much easier to install than I expected.</li>
            <li>This time I received the heads on a blank cardboard in a shrink wrap, no imprint of any kind.</li>
            <li>but they work far better then</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Back to getting a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>It is bearly better than the old worn out blades.  </li>
            <li>As good as expected.</li>
            <li>I figured it was worth a try, so I ordered this[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I definitely notice a closer, more comfortable shave after replacing the shaver heads.</li>
            <li>This item is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>My 1.5 yr old blades worked better.</li>
            <li>This is a good product, it works as expected.</li>
            <li>Worth the $20+.  </li>
            <li>Fit razor perfectly, and had trouble finding locally</li>
            <li>Had to re-install them before the blades did better than the old  ones.  </li>
            <li>Package offers trivia of how many trips to the moon your blades make yearly - as a reason to replace them.  </li>
            <li>Worth the investment.</li>
            <li>My razor was not cutting the way it should</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>gives a better shave than the old blades....</li>
            <li>/&gt;The old Norelco blades were much better</li>
            <li>Actually, my sister ordered these on our computor, but I did ask her, and she really liked them .</li>
            <li>have used Norelco shavers most of my adult life (I&#x27;m 62).</li>
            <li>Worth for price paid.</li>
            <li>value and worth while.</li>
            <li>Finally I can have a nice experience of shaving.</li>
            <li>For some reason, I keep expecting a cheap Philips razor to be able to shave my face, but I&#x27;ve had a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at 2PM every day for the last three years.  </li>
            <li>have always liked my Norelco and guys who see and hear it run, say it is so quiet</li>
            <li>Ahhhh, 2 years on the old blades and I&#x27;m in love.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price to extend life of razor.</li>
            <li>Replace your blades occasionally and you&#x27;ll still have a nice razor.</li>
            <li>Work much better than the old ones.</li>
            <li>As always, new shaver heads cut much better and are more comfortable by a long shot.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery and very reasonable price</li>
            <li>I have tried many other brands and heads, even older versions of the HQ8, but these new ones are by far the best.</li>
            <li>Great blades, easy to change out and last a long time.</li>
            <li>The shave is not as close as the original heads when they were new, however the shave was improved over the shave of the original heads when they were used for over a year.</li>
            <li>i have bought a norelco electric shaver and i was finally happy after trying a couple more, is just excellent, i felt lately that shaving was taking a little more than the usual, so i decided to get replacements</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the extra money for a clean shave; I was spending more on Gillette Mach3 cartridges every six months.</li>
            <li>These replacement heads for a relatively inexpensive Norelco razor do the job and are appropriate replacements for the original heads.</li>
            <li>I think my original electric razor cost $15 more than the regular price of these replacements.</li>
            <li>Came on time, actually a bit earlier, and package was really good!</li>
            <li>The first set dulled rather quickly (</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and was the exact replacement head for my shaver.</li>
            <li>Quick arrival of goods and exactly what was ordered.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve replaced the blades in my razor - I should get in the habit of doing that more often, as it definitely shaves much quicker and more evenly than before.</li>
            <li>My razor feels like new again with these, that simple, very smooth and maybe even better than new.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They were just barely noticeably sharper, but they do work and fit fine.</li>
            <li>Does a pretty clean shave for the first 6/7 months then the blade needs to be changed.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy replacement of old heads.  </li>
            <li>these work fine, but a bit high cost for me</li>
            <li>This site was easy to follow; I found the right model number easily and the price was low.</li>
            <li>The heads are very easy to replace and result in a much improved shave over the one-year old heads I was using.  </li>
            <li>Tha price is good compared to Wal-Mart and other retailers</li>
            <li>I had the original heads for a couple of years and they really needed changing.</li>
            <li>The heads is sharp and does a good job.</li>
            <li>I got it  fast  and is original Norelco.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not expecting \\&quot;blade close\\&quot;, but it isn&#x27;t even as good as some of my other electric razors over the years.  </li>
            <li>Do it with good lighting and not first thing in the morning when your eyes haven&#x27;t adjusted to the world.</li>
            <li>Good &amp; sharp.</li>
            <li>great fit and good cutting cheaper than a new razor.</li>
            <li>Dropped right in and works well.</li>
            <li>It arrived timely, was priced right, and I would buy again when needed.</li>
            <li>and I was right.</li>
            <li>I was to some how find a way to make it right with that person.</li>
            <li>these blades are the right ones and I would order again when I need them again.</li>
            <li>also the price is right</li>
            <li>After receiving it he put the replacement on his razor which took a matter of seconds and used it right away.</li>

            <li>The price was right</li>

            <li>Unfortunately it is not made clear many times.  </li>
            <li>they work, they are decent price, they fit the razor .</li>

            <li>Very easy to install and made a big difference in the quality of shave.</li>

            <li>The new heads were much quieter and cut much better.</li>
            <li>Best advise get new blades at least once a year.</li>
            <li>It was so nice not to have to buy a complete new razor.</li>
            <li>The shaver could be a little more powerful to be more efficient.</li>

            <li>AS USUAL, FAST DELIVERY, GOOD VALUE FOR PRICE!</li>
            <li>Replacement heads are not as good as the once came with the original, not sure why.</li>
            <li>They are sharp and give a good close shave just like when I first bought the razor.     </li>
            <li>Price was better than local stores and product is good quality, as expected.</li>
            <li>I ordered these new shaver heard for my Norelco shaver,they shipped fast and came earlier than expected they fit in the razor perfectly</li>
            <li>It fit fine but the shaving surface was different and took some getting used to.</li>
            <li>We were able to get the exact blades he needed and it&#x27;s like having a whole new razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These heads were the exact kind for my razor, just toss out the old ones, drop in the new ones and you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li>Instructions to replace the blades are a little misleading but in overall you get an excellent product for the price!</li>
            <li>I acknowledge that is not the intended use case for these but after getting a decent amount of time out of the original blades</li>
            <li>These new ones are sharp and great.</li>
            <li>It was great to have new sharp blades.</li>
            <li>, I figured that until someone decides to make a shaver that is clearly better than the one I have now, why not just keep getting these replacement heads every other year until the motor dies, which could easily be 50 years from now.</li>
            <li>easy to install, I love thny othere razor and like another sharp they need to be replaced...</li>
            <li>It quickly &amp;#34;refurbished&amp;#34; an older razor at half the cost of a new one.&lt;br /&gt;A good buy!</li>
            <li>very sharp and a good price</li>
            <li>Like shaving with a brand new razor, I had forgotten what a close comfortable shave</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just buy a new cheap razor each year instead.</li>
            <li>The new blades have enabled me to get a smooth shave in a fraction of the time it used to take for a so-so result.</li>
            <li>Heads fit both my razors and work like new.</li>
            <li>Exactly the right replacement heads for my husband&#x27;s Norelco shaver.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried replacing them on another shaver they did not cut right.</li>
            <li>The parts came on time, the replacement procedure was very easy, and the new replacement heads worked very well, making my shaver like new again!</li>
            <li>It was easy to replace the old heads.  </li>
            <li>My shaver is now over 6 years old and still going strong.</li>

            <li>The razor which I use now is one which is about four years old and still going strong.</li>
            <li>Like most users, after using an electric razor month after month, you just forget how old the blades really are.</li>
            <li>There 2 tiny angles that fit precisely into the housing.  </li>

            <li>Very easy to remove old ones and install new ones.</li>
            <li>These are very easy to replace and make your old machine new again.</li>
            <li>The blades themselves were very easy to install, and looking at the new compared to the old you&#x27;ll see why they need replacing.</li>

            <li>Made my razor work like new !!!</li>
            <li>like a brand new razor!!!</li>
            <li>I decided to get a new replacement head under DURESS!!!</li>
            <li>Now my son won&#x27;t need a new set for 1.5 to 2 years!!!</li>
            <li>Replacing these heads was very simple, very easy, and the key to a much better, smoother shave.  </li>
            <li>Works fine, same as the original that came with the shaver.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend changing blades annually to insure clean shaves in a minimum of effort.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I ordered this item for my husband--he liked it so much at the first time.</li>
            <li>just make sure you get the right heads for your specific razor.</li>

            <li>I was in very much need to change out my blades</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Merchant shipped product very fast.  </li>
            <li>I needed to be able to keep a sharp shet of blades available for my razor and this will allow me to do so.</li>
            <li>but the old style worked just fine.</li>
            <li>The blades spin fine with my old heads.  </li>
            <li>The blades are sharp and cut very close...very good quality.</li>
            <li>Like a whole new razor, cool!</li>
            <li>These are amazing, and a ton cheaper than buying an entire new shaving system like we thought we would have to!</li>
            <li>The new heads work very well and were easy to install.  </li>
            <li>was so easy to replace in razor, really does make a difference to have new blades</li>
            <li>Product is good but a little pricey</li>
            <li>The new Norelco heads returned the razor to its original capabilities.</li>
            <li>Well, I was not disappointed by the new heads.  </li>
            <li>The original disc had 14 or 15 blades and the new one has 9.</li>
            <li>Product was new and in original packaging as advertised.</li>
            <li>I replaced the original heads after about 12 months and the new ones lasted 2 months.  </li>
            <li>THE ORIGINAL AS NEW</li>
            <li>Replaced the original shaver heads in my shaver and it worked like new.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used the new heads yet but expect them to perform as well as the original heads.</li>
            <li>Easy to change and seem to give even a better shave than the previous models that i have tried....</li>
            <li>quick and easy way to make electric razor last years longer</li>
            <li>These replacement blades shipped quickly, were easy to install, and brought my electric razor back to life.</li>
            <li>This seems a bit less effective than the first replacement, but adequate for my purpose.  </li>
            <li>It was great to replace my dull blades.  </li>
            <li>Great price on an item that is hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li>I think its been more than a year since we have replaced them, but getting these heads have added new life to this razor used by my 85 year old dad!</li>
            <li>I clean the razors with a toothbrush every 30 days or so, then I buy new blades once a year.  </li>
            <li>These were quick &amp; easy to replace, and made my old razor cut like new.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I need A+++</li>
            <li>This was supposed to be the exact replacement for the cutter heads for my Phillips electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t have to make as many passes to get the same results, saving me time.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>took heed and again went with the brand name and exact replacement heads.</li>
            <li>oh well I&#x27;ll know next time to keep a better watch on time of use.</li>
            <li>First shave today with the replacement blades from Amazon.</li>
            <li>They are marked as Phillips Norelco and their appearance would indicate that they are genuine.</li>
            <li>thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>Exactly what my husband was looking for</li>
            <li>If you need HQ8 size replacement heads for your Norelco shaver, this is exactly what you want.</li>
            <li>However, if it works as the present heads do now, I am well satisfied.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found that they seems to actually shave better than the HQ9.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>They are doing exactly what they are suppose to do.</li>
            <li>Amazon is almost always my first stop for household goods.  </li>
            <li>Received as ordered &amp; will probably order more in the future!</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t believe some ppl were trying to sell double packages for more than I could purchase 2 singles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As I use it, it took me 4-5 more passes to achieve the same quality of shave than the one that came with the shaver.</li>
            <li>Excelent product, fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Exact replacement blades.</li>
            <li>Exact match for my 7310XL model.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and works.</li>
            <li>So how do you &amp;#34;make sure&amp;#34; exactly?</li>
            <li>Works very well!</li>
            <li>Norelco offered a window of time to not only adjust to the product but also offer a refund if not fully satisfied.  </li>
            <li>my first time there was some irritation still on my neck area.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m hoping it will become much easier (in time!)  </li>
            <li>We should not need them more than once a year, but we can just pass on the first regular shipment in 6 mos.</li>
            <li>and saw that I should have been cleaning these heads once a month by removing, disassembling and running under hot water.</li>
            <li>First time I ever replaced shaving heads.</li>
            <li>The first time I purchased this product from Amazon</li>
            <li>These heads last about a year or more as advertised.</li>
            <li>Yeah, it would be nice if you could sharpen the existing blades, but that&#x27;s probably not very practical.</li>
            <li>That is just because he replaced the heads early before the light came on.</li>
            <li>My husband and father have the same shaver and use to love it.</li>
            <li>and I know they will not last more than 6 months - hence the 3 stars.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first electric, and I&#x27;ve had it a couple years.</li>
            <li>Machine works as it did the first day.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I ordered them from amazon.</li>
            <li>and I will be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li>These were exactly what we were looking for.</li>
            <li>Thanks!  </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m quite satisfied with the razor and the replacement blades.  </li>
            <li>I think we might need more of them in the future too as he loves his shaver.</li>
            <li>Was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed and delivered on time.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I needed to replace the heads.  </li>
            <li>and I noticed the pattern on top of each of the heads is different.  </li>
            <li>For many years, i lived in darkness, everyone knows you need to change your razor blades regularly, but does EVERYONE know that electric shavers need replacement blades as well?</li>
            <li>Many of the current Lithium battery shavers seem to be dying within 2 years.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It may not do as well as a razor, but none of the current crop do any better.  </li>
            <li>Well that&#x27;s exactly what I did and the razors work just like the day I received them.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately not so.</li>
            <li>to install and my first shave was as close as I&#x27;ve had since I first bought the razor.</li>
            <li>Purchased replacement blades many times and the result is always the same.  </li>
            <li>However, they clip in easily enough and the one I bought this for is pleased with them.</li>
            <li>This item was exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>That is exactly what these norelco blades and razors do for me.  </li>
            <li>Just thought you would be interested that I shaved with a blade razor</li>
            <li>It was my first time changing the heads (in 2 or 3 yrs of use)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, my husband doesn&#x27;t think it shaves close enough.</li>
            <li>My first Norelco I had for 22 years and it had self sharpening blades.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what is is.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>It seems fake replica with very cheap packing !!!</li>
            <li>Arrived exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the product, which I purchased as a replacement for my younger brother.</li>
            <li>Why are there so many different varieties of replacement heads?  </li>
            <li>Norelco can do a better job of servicing their present customers.  </li>
            <li>This is the exact replacement blade set for my razor.</li>
            <li>Shaves better than prior replacement.</li>
            <li>At this time I am not a 100% sure I set the heads up properly.</li>
            <li>Replacement was not difficult, providing you can see and understand the micro sized instruction drawings on the package.  </li>
            <li>I found out that these heads work better on my beard and do not snag like the ones with the inner blades and holes.</li>
            <li>We thought it would fit the old razor, but it did not.&lt;br</li>
            <li>FIRST</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and no excuses for stubble now!</li>
            <li>First electrical razor that my husband could use.</li>
            <li>This was simple to install and it works much better.  </li>
            <li>I searched with Google to find exact how-to directions.  </li>
            <li>The company says to replace them yearly and this is the first time he has done so.</li>
            <li>These replacement heads are definitely of higher quality than the cheaper alternatives you find on ebay.</li>
            <li>The blades were exactly what I neded for my husbands stocking this Christmas.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>as to recomend product ,one must first owne one .</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m only using 2 heads out of my series 8000 and get a better shave that I do with all 3 heads with this.</li>
            <li>My razor was a pretty old one, but the replacement heads were still available</li>
            <li>These heads seem to work pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Replacing the heads was pretty painless and I&#x27;ll probably get another pair when the ones I have wear out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely going to start replacing them more often now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels smoother and it trims the facial hair much better.</li>
            <li>Would buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>Might be better to but 2 or three sets next time.</li>
            <li>But fresh blades in this jobber really makes a difference.  </li>
            <li>This was my first replacement for my Philips Norelco .  </li>
            <li>Exact factory replacement at the exact factory replacement costs.  </li>
            <li>I put the originals back after a month and found myself getting a better shave.  </li>
            <li>I have had my electric shaver for more than ten years and these heads were exeactly what I needed to continue achieving a close shave.  </li>
            <li>works as it should, thanks!</li>
            <li>Did not realize there were so many different blade types for the Norelco electric shavers</li>
            <li>product arrived promptly, and was exactly as advertized.</li>
            <li>just be sure that you know the model number of replacement heads that you need--a mistake I made with my initial order.</li>
            <li>Fortunately Amazon now offers a program to send the item each time interval, up to 6 months, that you specify.  </li>
            <li>Even though the HQ9 had more rings, the blades were tiny and I always finished shaving faster when I used</li>
            <li>THEY WERE EXACTLY WHAT WE NEEDED.  </li>
            <li>Never failed me.  </li>
            <li>These heads are a exact drip-in replacement as advertised for</li>
            <li>these are only the inner circle inserts not the whole outer plastic piece... works great</li>
            <li>Works very well!</li>
            <li>first I could not find these on Amazon  </li>
            <li>This is my first time getting them online</li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth I think Norelco really messed up when they went to this style of head with the holes and slots instead of just the slots.</li>
            <li>I have been an extremely satisfied customer annually purchasing this specific model of Norelco replacement heads here on Amazon since 2011.</li>
            <li>product was exactly what was described.</li>
            <li>i use this unit to shave my whole head!  </li>
            <li>Fit my old razor.  </li>
            <li>I have a pretty &amp;#34;tough&amp;#34; beard growth, so I change the blades every 6 - 8 months.</li>
            <li>These heads are genuine Norelco heads and are a direct replacement.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more when needed.</li>
            <li>My razor heads were about a year old and not working as well, so I found these cheaply and gave &#x27;em a try.  </li>
            <li>That is exactly what these norelco blades and razors do for me.</li>
            <li>Buyer be aware.</li>
            <li>Annual replacement is what is needed for him, and I suspect for most men who shave daily.</li>
            <li>Worked and fit my old shaver</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I replaced the blades on my shaver.</li>
            <li>Exact replacement.  </li>
            <li>exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>I WOULD MOST LIKELY PURCHASE THEM AGAIN WHEN NEEDED.</li>
            <li>Better price than local stores for me.  </li>
            <li>I know better next time.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Should of looked here first...</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t fit my old Philips Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li>I am SO glad I finally did!</li>
            <li>Replace your shaving heads regularly, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>It is the exact head that PT730 uses.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased several sets over the years and all have been top quality.  </li>
            <li>I dropped the three heads in the sink, when I first took apart the shaver head,   </li>
            <li>but this better last longer then 2 years.</li>
            <li>last more than the one year</li>
            <li>Maybe the electric razor will die first.  </li>
            <li>I have trouble finding the type I need at stores, and good luck calling ahead to see if they have them.  </li>
            <li>While alright for everyday use it still is not as good as a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; razor shave.  </li>
            <li>The new razor performed better than the old one.</li>
            <li>They also seem to work a bit differint too, I am guess they are simply the new updated kind.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t give an accurate account of how they compare to the new razor heads but, for now they are a reasonable improvement that didn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li>If your blades are more than a year old or you notice that your shave is not as close as it once was, getting a set of these new blades may make the difference.  </li>
            <li>The new blades didn&#x27;t cut any better than the old ones.  </li>
            <li>Each year when I replace the used heads I am surprised by the difference new heads can make: smooth, close shaves!</li>
            <li>If you own a Norelco shaver, buy the replacement blades, they are simple to install and cheaper than buying a new shaver.</li>
            <li>My old stock heads which had been used for 2 years work much better than those new ones.</li>
            <li>Replaced my old blade head, new one doesn&#x27;t cut much better.</li>
            <li>my old blades shaved better than the new ones</li>
            <li>I then taught high shool for 13 years and was able to keep clean shaven every day as long as I replaced the heads every 6-9 months.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used an electric razor for nearly 5 yrs!!!!</li>
            <li>I got a clean shave for the first four or five months, then the shaver started to leave stubble and individual whiskers more frequently as the days went by.</li>
            <li>The replacement heads worked fine but worked noticeably better at first than after a few shaves.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money after your original heads get dull, especially if you want a good clean shave.  </li>
            <li>Clean and close shave and no irritation as I have pretty sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>But, is it just me or is Norelco outsourcing stuff and it all and all, seems a little more cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Appears to make razor operate more smoothly with little effort.</li>
            <li>Nice to have a sharp razor</li>
            <li>nice and sharp</li>
            <li>Nice to have a sharp razor again.</li>
            <li>old heads were original ones.</li>
            <li>This product did a fair job of shaving, but have to consistently go over, often several times, curing areas around upper chin to get all the stubble.  </li>
            <li>Nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>I used my original blades for a couple of years, and thought a brand new set would be much sharper.</li>
            <li>It feel so good to get new sharp blades, makes quite a bit of difference.</li>
            <li>they actually look alike), because they are run-in to fit their own sockets, (don&#x27;t mix them up later when spring-cleaning), I removed the blades carefully to examine them, and after applying a very light coat of 4-In-1 sewing machine oil to each blade-unit, I reinserted the 3 blades and ran the razor.</li>
            <li>Either my beard is getting tougher or the blades get dull earlier, but these are the best i have found.</li>
            <li>Mine was dull and this was the best price I could find for the same thing.</li>
            <li>Should have replaced these sooner, smooth clean shave with new blades, although a little overpriced for what you get, but a good purchase overall</li>
            <li>The new heads were easy to install and it now works like new.</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly and the product was new as advertised.</li>
            <li>Even when new, the replacement heads don&#x27;t seem to cut as quickly nor as closely as the heads that came with the shaver when I purchased it.</li>
            <li>The improvement in shaving performance was tremendous - almost beyond the performance of the brand new shaver.</li>
            <li>the new head doesn&#x27;t work much better than my old one that really didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li>Good quality heads made my old razor just like new at only a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>Service was great, The new blades were easy to install and were so quite and smooth on my face that I thought it wasn&#x27;t running or cutting.</li>
            <li>arrived in a few days...quite timely and it took me about a minute to switch them out with the old ones...very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>This replacement head for my electric razor is a good one, although I have to go over the same area on my face several times to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li>I had been simply opening the top and cleaning that cavity with a brush once a week or so and didn&#x27;t consider taking the whole thing apart.</li>
            <li>Good deal overall and definitely needed once or twice a year with Norelcos.</li>
            <li>These replacement heads are much cheaper than buying a year&#x27;s worth of replacement blades, and perform very well.</li>
            <li>Rather difficult to install but once accomplished works great!</li>
            <li>The picture shows the whole top of the shaver but the package only contains the shaving heads.</li>
            <li>is good but not awesome to my shave because with 3 days is pain to do it and require to many passages that irritate my skin</li>
            <li>The last set gave a lot of good service but seemed to have finally lost their sharpness.  </li>
            <li>The blades and combs were very easy to change out and brought my razor back to new condition.</li>
            <li>Thanks very much.  </li>
            <li>Maybe not needed every year, but worth it even at the {high} price.</li>
            <li>The best part is they offer your money back, if not satisfied!  </li>
            <li>Looking closely, I realized that many of the new product photos illustrated labels indicating HQ9, HQ8 or some other blade number which, I assume, fit.</li>
            <li>both my Netherlands model and china model blades wear out pretty quickly and completely.</li>
            <li>Not only is the Norelco Spectra awesome, everytime we replace the blades (he has very coarse facial hair, so he must replace them after 9 months), it&#x27;s like having a brand new shaver.</li>
            <li>I think the razor may be slowing down some making it a less than perfect shave.</li>
            <li>New blades did the trick of leaving a smooth clean shave that makes shave time very brief.  </li>
            <li>more difficult to install than I expected, but once I got that job done the performance has been excellent.</li>
            <li>Price was much lower than offered in retail stores and it was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>He checked they look real, they have the stickers and printing like the real deal!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happie,r&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s shaving so much better and faster, don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to order&lt;br /&gt;the heads.  </li>
            <li>When I first saw this I got the impression it was the whole head.</li>
            <li>they are just exactly what fits with the norelco I have and they are much cheaper through amazon.  </li>
            <li>she loves it thus mission accomplished ;)</li>
            <li>/&gt;just tried them once with the AT810 Philips shaver - and was pretty much disappointed&lt;</li>
            <li>Really enjoy being able to wash the head with warm water when they are dirty</li>
            <li>Arrived fast and is the exact replacement for the shaver</li>
            <li>They are exactly what I wanted and they came fast.</li>
            <li>BUT the first item on my HOME list-shave with an electric razor (to avoid nicks with a straight razor)  </li>
            <li>Does a noticeably better, quicker job than my original blades from a few years ago.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good enough for everyday, but for important occasions I&#x27;ll be using a blade again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Quality of the heads no more than just good (material, sharpness).&lt;br /</li>
            <li>these new, shaver feels like new again with smooth cuts.  </li>
            <li>It was so easy to  replace the old heads of my husband&#x27;s Norelco shaver with new heads.  </li>
            <li>Easy to install new blades, after removing old ones.  </li>
            <li>work great with my razor... had to do a bit of research due to the large amount of options for different models</li>
            <li>Fits perfectly / cut like new if not better /  simple to change</li>
            <li>I did not have good luck with the first set, it seem to be dull.</li>
            <li>This can not be the original replacement head; since it barely works!</li>
            <li>Got my shaqver back to full throttle!</li>
            <li>Like I got a brand new razor, definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>It will take a couple of shaves for the new blades to get set in place, but well worth it.</li>
            <li>Fresh blades keep it working like new.</li>
            <li>Easy to order and received in a short amount  of time.</li>
            <li>The replacement heads are easy enough to install.</li>
            <li>Hair comes off MUCH easier and the surface is much smoother (for much longer!)</li>
            <li>Iv&#x27;e been using them for a more than 5  years with the 8883XL Norelco dry shaver , they work well .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Installation was easy, and I was back up and shaving in no time.</li>
            <li>But I really like this razor (the Philips Norelco 7310), because you can rinse it out, and the cost of these replacement heads was pretty reasonable (about $22 US), so I bought them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They shave nicely, but it shows the quality of the previous ones.</li>
            <li>Easy enough to change out the shaver heads.</li>
            <li>to fit into the housing, and as sharp as the original blades.</li>
            <li>But hey, I can get a dry shave done in about 30 seconds in the morning, so if you&#x27;re more concerned with speed, frugality, and convenience than you are with the quality of your shave, then by all means, buy these replacement blades.  </li>
            <li>Simple and easy to replace.</li>
            <li>Time will tell if they last and continue with good shaves as long as the originals did.</li>
            <li>They last a good long time for me too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had problems with them and frankly the main reason for not using the same razor for the whole time is that I have wanted the \\&quot;upgrades\\&quot; available in newer razors after a few years either more battery life or newer shaving head, such as the Spectra which is superior to the older styles.  </li>
            <li>My shavers is ten years old and with the new heads it shaves as good as new.  </li>
            <li>I certainly recommend this from now on</li>
            <li>However, considering my razor was $35 by itself, it is certainly pricey for replacement heads to be 1/3 of that price.</li>
            <li>Just like having a new razor!!</li>
            <li>It may as well be new again!!</li>
            <li>I suppose lots of folks just replace the whole unit, but I&#x27;m just cheap enough to try head replacement first.</li>
            <li>was very small and compact, which was nice!</li>
            <li>they are great, work like a charm to make your &#x27;old&#x27; heads last 3-4x longer as long as you take care of them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE:  At this point about 15 months later, heads are still ok, but do occasionally PULL on the hairs if it starts getting full, probably will replace these soon.</li>
            <li>Even if they were not transferable, I would still have had a razor with new blades, albeit a more basic model.</li>
            <li>this is just 3 new blades and 3 heads, not the entire top unit like the picture suggests.</li>
            <li>I was very happy to find these replacement heads in bulk because the heads are almost as expensive as buying a new razor.</li>
            <li>After i replaced this new head, it totally worked better.  </li>
            <li>These are the recommended replacement heads for the $35 shaver I&#x27;m currently using, and they do a substantially better job than the heads that came with this shaver when it was new.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t cost as much as buying a new electric razor; so it was worth the replacement fee.</li>
            <li>These replacement shaver heads are a better value than buying an entire new razor.</li>
            <li>The advertised picture shows a total new razor top containing the blades, but what you receive are three blades with their head covers sealed in a plastic box.</li>
            <li>I have found that the shaving blades that come with a new shaver always seem to work better, and last longer than the blades you buy to replace them.</li>
            <li>Seems a waste to have to throw away perfectly good new screens.  </li>
            <li>and they are super sharp, better than when the razor was new.</li>
            <li>Great for both wet and dry shaves.</li>
            <li>Got this for my pouting husband when we realized we couldn&#x27;t afford a new shaver right now.  </li>
            <li>as long as your legs are smooth and soft who cares if it is a pink shaver or a good shaver like this one is.</li>
            <li>This is not Replacement Heads ( what is suggest picture on it ) , but only some parts of the head and in my opinion better to buy new whole razor.</li>
            <li>I have used Norelco shavers for many years and for the first two weeks it was extremely close.</li>
            <li>These work fine, but overpriced and short life span.</li>
            <li>However, once seated properly, the replacement heads worked fine.</li>
            <li>The replacement heads are exactly the same as the original.</li>
            <li>I actually have it for another Philips shaver that is not on the list, and it works fine.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re working fine and assume they will continue to for the next year.</li>
            <li>Amazon has a pretty decent price on the heads.  </li>
            <li>Norelco replacement blade are pretty decent.</li>
            <li>Makes the older razor work like a dream!</li>
            <li>Mine were much older than that!</li>
            <li>The price is the main reason I bought it!</li>
            <li>HERE AGAIN, ONE REPLACEMENT PART IS VERY HIGH, BUT THIS IS WHERE THEY MAKE THEIR MONEY.  </li>
            <li>Easy to order and shipping was right on time, just what I expected.</li>
            <li>I double checked to make sure I ordered the right ones and the new ones seem duller than the old ones I replaced.</li>
            <li>They cost a little more but are worth it for durability and longevity IMVHO.</li>
            <li>time I have to be more careful on ordering such a fine item...</li>
            <li>Best price available, and they seem to last a long time, especially with the Norelco spray lubricant (See my other reviews).</li>
            <li>I used the original parts from my old razor and inserted  the new blades.  </li>
            <li>Works great, did not know how dull my old blades were.</li>
            <li>Blades work better than it was, installed these after 3 years, works good, but not as sharp as when razor was new, must be using different materials maybe Chinese ?</li>
            <li>Excellent-very easy to Install---my Norelco was 5 years old and with these new Heads it cuts like it did when it was brand new</li>
            <li>my old header broke a few weeks ago, I had a older model, this new header has greatly improved my shaving experience.</li>
            <li>An additional service that I really like is that Norelco will send me my next replacement heads at precisely the time that these heads should be wearing out.  </li>
            <li>Be careful to buying this item, and make sure it is what you are really looking for.</li>
            <li>The price was was a real saver compared to retail.</li>
            <li>, Thanks  and  </li>
            <li>I thought i would get a much closer shave.</li>
            <li>AS Said Thanks</li>
            <li>These heads work really well</li>
            <li>They were very understanding, when I requested to return the item, and agreed for me to return of the item.</li>
            <li>Fast</li>
            <li>I have my Norelco shaver for about ten years and replacing the head from time to time keeps giving you a smooth close shave.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Reasonable price</li>
            <li>however I can tell that his face isn&#x27;t getting as much razor burn.</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very noticable with my razor shaves faster.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>very good......sharp blades,and affordable</li>
            <li>so much for respect these days.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The replacement heads were really needed.  </li>
            <li>They came fast and were what was described.</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t notice much of a performance</li>
            <li>It performs in my razor very well.</li>
            <li>but you can really feel a difference.</li>
            <li>and perhaps that&#x27;s why the shave is that much closer.  </li>
            <li>price was reasonable and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>as described fast shipping</li>
            <li>You are spending a lot replacing the whole razor.</li>
            <li>Thanks Norelco.</li>
            <li>my husband really likes it.</li>
            <li>this razor was capable of performing.</li>
            <li>and they arrived fast.  </li>
            <li>Really like my Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li>I never realized how much longer it has been taking me to get a close shave.</li>
            <li>you have to really press them into your skin to get a close shave.</li>
            <li>Fast arrival.</li>
            <li>really wish they would write this in the description that these are just the blades and not the header.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I ordered the heads, I thought I was ordering the whole head assembly that contains the heads.  </li>
            <li>and he gets a really close cut.</li>
            <li>Now I won&#x27;t want to pitch a shaver just because the blades cost so much.</li>
            <li>Still use the blade when I want a really close shave.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Not as smooth as a regular razor, but no electric is.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>The heads fit and the shaver does work properly</li>
            <li>as these are the only ones that fit my shaver.  </li>
            <li>and they really did the trick.    </li>
            <li>Very Usefull.</li>
            <li>so I do not have to use a straight shaver.</li>
            <li>it very cheap,in China</li>
            <li>Fast shipping with Prime.....</li>
            <li>and it arrived in a very timely manner.  </li>
            <li>An electric is very convenient but still doesn&#x27;t give me a shave as close as I would like.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They were reasonably priced and made my razor shave very close</li>
            <li>i could get such a comfortable close shave.</li>
            <li>A much closer shave.</li>
            <li>The blades are very durable I shave as much as three times a week</li>
            <li>I was ready to throw it</li>
            <li>Hold up better than expected and we don&#x27;t have to replace them too often.</li>
            <li>and I guess the change in the shave quality was so gradual that I didn&#x27;t really notice</li>
            <li>Often I am on the go and the AT810 electric shaver with the HQ8505 heads work very well away from home.</li>
            <li>I really trust in Philips Norelco replacements heads.</li>
            <li>but otherwise I really like it as a quality product</li>
            <li>if it is not broken don&#x27;t try to fix it.&lt;br /&gt;one</li>
            <li>Item as described fast shipping</li>
            <li>They have worked very well and it was somethink I needed to do sooner.</li>
            <li>Blades work very well.</li>
            <li>Bought these replacement blades in the hopes that it would not take quite as much time and effort to shave my neck and face.  </li>
            <li>The price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Work very well.  </li>
            <li>He said that it gives a very close shave and he loves it.</li>
            <li>Nothing much else needs to be said.</li>
            <li>Smooth shave in only a couple passes.</li>
            <li>Proper fit and working well.  </li>
            <li>I really cannot say that I could tell the difference though.  </li>
            <li>My face says thanks every day.</li>
            <li>This product work very well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much to say on this product, as it is OEM and a must buy for whom using a razor.</li>
            <li>Frankly all of the business models of razor is the same as a printer: machine is cheap but profit from parts.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>Replacement heads don&#x27;t seem to  work very well.</li>
            <li>I have bought these before and they work very well in my cordless razor.</li>
            <li>That worked very well.  </li>
            <li>Changed the shaver blades in my Norelco Shaver but didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in the shave.  </li>
            <li>Much  faster and closer shave.</li>
            <li>The Phillips shaver he has is very convenient.  </li>
            <li>In any case, these are the real deal and work very well.</li>
            <li>online, and whoa--it worked really well.</li>
            <li>These shaving heads work very well</li>
            <li>much improved performance.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re razor head replacements, there isn&#x27;t much to tell.</li>
            <li>They only fit one way</li>
            <li>They really should replace the faulty one.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the bvest.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>I ready to order another set of heads just for spare.</li>
            <li>The users manual is very well written and very helpful.</li>
            <li>star for making the packaging look like it&#x27;s really from Norelco.  </li>
            <li>This set of heads shave much closer than the ones that came with the shaver, I try to buy from another source and these were much cheaper from Amazon</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like shaving with an electric razor but it is much handier so</li>
            <li>My husband really likes it.</li>
            <li>And, there are dozens of different heads available, so you need to know what your shopping for.</li>
            <li>like straight from&lt;br /&gt;the factory/</li>
            <li>I am really a cheapskate</li>
            <li>Close, fast shave, no skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was very unsatisfactory and now I have Three sets.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>a whole unit..</li>
            <li>so much for your help</li>
            <li>u were fast.</li>
            <li>thanks y&#x27;all.</li>
            <li>Just similar blades that fit.</li>
            <li>Reasonable in price also.</li>
            <li>There work really well.</li>
            <li>The wet shave seems to work better for me and my beard.  </li>
            <li>Not recommended for anyone seeking a non-electric manual blade shaving experience, but it does give a fast acceptable shave at home or for travel.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>These shaving heads give a very closer shave than the ones that came with my razor when I bought it.  </li>
            <li>This product is available in the local stores.  </li>
            <li>I got fast service and did not have to fight the Christmas crowds to get what the manufacturer recommends.  </li>
            <li>Put the heads on and shaved very well.</li>
            <li>Whole lot cheaper than blades.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping--</li>
            <li>I really like the product and the replacement of the blades</li>
            <li>Very satisfactory product.</li>
            <li>When I do find them, they are very pricy.</li>
            <li>I thought at the price that these heads might not be the real thing.  </li>
            <li>served me very well.</li>
            <li>Very helpful to find them without running all over town.</li>
            <li>They are much cheaper here than in any stores I have seen them in.</li>
            <li>They cut real close.  </li>
            <li>and he really likes them.  </li>
            <li>As requested, thanks.</li>
            <li>THANKS  </li>
            <li>Comfort is important when you use something like this on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>Even though the add said these heads are for my specific Norelco, they don&#x27;t quite fit the way they are supposed to.  </li>
            <li>Not designed very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Nothing really to say or to compare.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not shave your hair very</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>But installation took &amp;#60;2 minutes and was very intuitive.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping to Australia.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too</li>
            <li>Really Like</li>
            <li>It takes me much longer time to shave with these.</li>
            <li>Thanks Norelco.</li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>saves me so much time shaving ..</li>
            <li>Using a safety razor is much faster.</li>
            <li>Held up very well</li>
            <li>Shipped very fast!&lt;br /&gt;Thes</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>A label HQ8 means nothing if they are not the real thing.</li>
            <li>These shaving heads really work well.  </li>
            <li>thanks to amazon</li>
            <li>fast delivery</li>
            <li>/&gt;they arrived fast and they perform very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using these for 3 months and they are not giving me a very close shave.</li>
            <li>Very prompt delivery.</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>Work very well.</li>
            <li>Vhard to find, very competivee pricing</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t judge you too much...</li>
            <li>If they didn&#x27;t cost so darn much</li>
            <li>I have even tried to resharpen them but it hasn&#x27;t worked out very well.</li>
            <li>They provide a much closer shave with no irritation.  </li>
            <li>They are working very well.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I received the fit my shaver correctly and they are cheaper than at a local store</li>
            <li>As a society we throw away too much stuff already.  </li>
            <li>fast shipping...</li>
            <li>I will try one more set, but if they don&#x27;t last more than a few months I will be looking for another brand of razor.</li>
            <li>the real deal.</li>
            <li>They fit, they work, the price was about the same as the store.</li>
            <li>Thanks you.</li>
            <li>They work really well</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than what I found on line at Walmart and Walgreens.</li>
            <li>They were simple to install and WOW this thing works so much better.</li>
            <li>If I went against the grain, naturally it would last longer, but would promote more irritation.  </li>
            <li>I use this razor everyday without irritation of any kind.  </li>
            <li>These definitely work better than my 5 year old razors I had.</li>
            <li>These blades cut only slightly better than 2 year old originals -- which are ripping my face they are so worn out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having to run the shaver over the same area two to three times more often and longer than with the old worn out blades I had.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll buy another set in the near future.</li>
            <li>This high price would be worth it if they were equivalent to new blades --- but they are not even close.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They had pretty well worn down to nubs and pulled out more hair than they cut off.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t aware of how much a difference new blades made, until I got these.  </li>
            <li>I just helped to clear a &amp;#34;Land-fill&amp;#34;!!!</li>
            <li>I thought I needed a new razor, but these brought my present one back to as good as new.  </li>
            <li>My other blades were dull and causing a rash, these are a GREAT improvement!</li>
            <li>The new blades were an exact replacement for the one that came with the shaver at a fraction of the price</li>
            <li>Why buy a new shaver when this simple replacement makes the shaver work better than new.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed to make my shaver perform as new.</li>
            <li>Exactly what my husband needed instead of buying a new razor.</li>
            <li>Quite a difference in closeness is evident with new blades.  </li>
            <li>This was the first replacement since purchasing the razor new (30 months</li>
            <li>These replacement blades do exactly what they are supposed to: restore your razor to like new condition.</li>
            <li>so far I am nearly 3,000 shaves and 8 years with the original batteries).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I had saved my old blades, so I put them back in and got good long lasting shaves once again.</li>
            <li>He said they not only do a good job but his other ones&lt;br /&gt;lasted</li>
            <li>The unlock was easy, the old disks lifted right out, and the new ones could only be installed one way.</li>
            <li>The shaver heads work fine, however I had my concerns as when it arrived the outer box was pretty much crushed up.</li>
            <li>super smooth shaves that you will have to do less of.</li>
            <li>Since these replacement heads came from the same folks that made my electric razor they fit exactly as the old ones did.  </li>
            <li>Like so many other things, found it on Amazon and delivery was made in time.  </li>
            <li>Product replacement works well, not the same blades that originally came with my razor</li>
            <li>Norelco charged a premium price for a replacement head, more, in fact, than the cost of some of its other razors.</li>
            <li>Now it is back to original performance.  </li>
            <li>Because of the age of my shaver, I had to use the original casings to allow the heads to work properly.  </li>
            <li>The original heads are just now starting to go (9 months each set).  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I found this through all the other reviews.</li>
            <li>Always stick with original heads that work properly.</li>
            <li>They are same as original - not used as yet</li>
            <li>Repalcement Head arrived two days earlier than originally scheduled.</li>
            <li>Philips Noreclo reccomends changing annually, i&#x27;m more towards the 6 month plan to keep them sharp.</li>
            <li>The after market product doesn&#x27;t provide the same quality shave as the original equipment.</li>
            <li>now for these shavers are different from the original one which was a&amp;#34; lift and cut&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;one.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I have no independent knowledge of the efficacy of this product, although these are the Norelco brand replacement, my husband says they don&#x27;t give as close a shave as the original contained in the razor when purchased.</li>
            <li>Extreme difference for the better in my razor.</li>
            <li>Heads a different design than the original.  </li>
            <li>The original cutters on the shaver had 15 blades and the replacement cutter only has 9 blades.  </li>
            <li>Only a replacement part, made to do what it was originally designed for, just sharpener from what I perviously had.</li>
            <li>My razor is back to it&#x27;s original quality shave.</li>
            <li>Sharp and cuts better and faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The design of the overall razor is not user friendly as to head replacement.</li>
            <li>They worked fine at first but got dull a lot quicker than the original blades that came with</li>
            <li>At arrival I only found one set of 3 blades inside original carton.</li>
            <li>He says his shave is smoother than with the original blades, and his razor actually seems to have increased battery life.</li>
            <li>Are the replacement heads the same as the original heads?</li>
            <li>The product description is accurate enough and It is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>i think the right price/choice to just  get new heads instead of a  new razor.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s certainly much cheaper than buying a new one!</li>
            <li>well, guess what, these are much cheaper than getting a new razor!  </li>
            <li>Reasonable price and shipping cost - delivery was on time as well!&lt;br /&gt;Thankful to find you selling them since my husband refuses to buy a new razor!</li>
            <li>Great cutting and smooth finish after getting these new blades.</li>
            <li>They restored the cutting action to good as new and the razor once again shaves clean and smooth as it should.</li>
            <li>Be aware that there is a kind of a pointy nib (at least on the ones I purchased here for my husband&#x27;s razor).</li>
            <li>Now, back to a clean shave again.</li>
            <li>but you only change them out once a year if you keep them clean.</li>
            <li>btw... take the time to properly &amp; thoroughly disassemble and clean the heads, etc and all areas of the razor</li>
            <li>A clean shave is now possible again.  </li>
            <li>Work fine as long as I use the grocery store cleaner and lubricant</li>
            <li>I discovered that if I simply use a very light touch and not press hard then it got those hairs much better and with no redness.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They appear to be of high quality and give a really close shave.</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t as advanced as some new shavers because it only has 1 outer ring of holes.</li>
            <li>After being in the hospital for 5 days due to a blood clot in my right lung I was excited to go home.  </li>
            <li>I sure didn&#x27;t know previously how much money could be saved by purchasing items on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>You can certainly tell when you need new heads, shaves are slower and not4 close at all...</li>
            <li>at a certain point, it pays to just buy a new razor.</li>
            <li>They were a bit hard to put in, but in the end fit fine.  </li>
            <li>I bought these to fit Norelco razors which I have had for a long time.</li>
            <li>When I took out the old ones I noticed they were pretty gunked up</li>
            <li>I bought the set of two and the first set so far</li>
            <li>Year old head was still shaving pretty well.</li>
            <li>It used to die after every shave, even after a full charge, and now it stays charged for multiple shaves.</li>
            <li>If it is a question of a new razor or a new head this makes sense but either option is pretty pricey.</li>
            <li>Purchased this to replace 1 year old blades that were leaving my face with fine short stubs.  </li>
            <li>It works out fine and definitely is an improvement over my old heads.</li>
            <li>ago, I am sure they are keeping the cost down because when started shaving they were 15.00 dollars, which says alot...........</li>
            <li>Loved that they got my father&#x27;s old razor working again (sentimental value), but could&#x27;ve almost bought a new Norelco for the price.</li>
            <li>Full-featured (many superfluous or gimmicky) electric shavers with fancy housings costing $200.00 to $300.00 rarely provide a better shave and certainly not one that is sufficiently better to warrant the significantly higher expense of upgrading your entire electric shaver every few years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The replacement blades are sharp but I have found the replacement screens that come with the blades less effective than the original screens.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had them for a few months and still going strong!</li>
            <li>Shaver is like new now !</li>
            <li>And the razor works like new again!  </li>
            <li>I always make sure the device is compatible with these sharpeners before purchase, so I can always have sharp blades and never need to buy a new head.    </li>
            <li>This price also alleviated the &amp;#34;why not buy a new one&amp;#34; as the blades were cheaper than other alternatives.  </li>
            <li>It was like having a new razor!  </li>
            <li>Made my 5-year-old razor perform like new!</li>
            <li>and when I put the new ones in I was stunned!  </li>
            <li>to do - just like new!</li>
            <li>Changed out the heads in lieu of buying a new razor and WOWSAH!</li>
            <li>No need to buy a new razor!</li>
            <li>Made my shaver into a new one again!</li>
            <li>Who thought that changing the blades could make the razor function like brand new!</li>
            <li>Brand New Razor again!</li>
            <li>What a difference new blades work!  </li>
            <li>I feel like I just bought a new razor!  </li>
            <li>Works like new now!</li>
            <li>Just like a new razer!</li>
            <li>If they are not, like Amazon, I guess I&#x27;ll have to buy a new shaver!</li>
            <li>They made my husbands razor new again!</li>
            <li>Like a New Shaver again!</li>
            <li>I now question my second purchase of the original Norelco shaver that I bought as a gift for my new grandson-in-law.</li>
            <li>Same as the original ones in the razor, but new.</li>
            <li>Just what I needed to make my razor new!</li>
            <li>Makes my razor head like new!</li>
            <li>Like many people I wait too long to replace them, thinking I&#x27;ll get a few more shaves from the old heads.</li>
            <li>I received the item and the parts wouldn,t fit my razer either the information is not plain enough from one model to another</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference with the new ones.  </li>
            <li>I was ready to buy a new razor for about the price of the blades, but Amazon had them cheaper than Walmart...</li>
            <li>much cheaper than buying a new razor as the heads are all that ever wears out.</li>
            <li>My husband hasn&#x27;t noticed too much of a difference with the new one</li>
            <li>So I replaced the heads...not really too difficult...and my shaver was working like new again.</li>
            <li>Replacement heads were a very affordable alternative to give my shaver new life.</li>
            <li>Way cheaper than a whole new shaver.</li>
            <li>The new heads work very well.</li>
            <li>Razor performance is much improved with new blades.  </li>
            <li>Shaving is sooooo much easier with new heads installed.  </li>
            <li>The new head gives a much close shave with fewer passes.</li>
            <li>It was much cheaper than buying a new shaver.</li>
            <li>Work very well, make shaver almost like new again.</li>
            <li>Cheaper than buying a whole new shaver.</li>
            <li>Really fast delivery and razor is like new.</li>
            <li>Never realized how much of a difference new blades would make.  </li>
            <li>The new ones run much quieter and ct quite well.</li>
            <li>The new heads really did improve the comfort level of shaving.  </li>
            <li>The new heads work really great!&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li>new in box , fast delivery</li>
            <li>I considered buying a whole new razor.</li>
            <li>The new blades cut close and fast as advertised.  </li>
            <li>It gives a very close shave just like the new product.</li>
            <li>Made it so that my dad didn&#x27;t have to buy a whole new electric razor.</li>
            <li>I find it is much easier and cheaper to buy these blades than to buy a new razer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The new blades make it run so much quieter now</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always woindered why it costs almost as much to replace the shaving head as it does for a new razor, but I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>The new head works very well.  </li>
            <li>After I received my order, I simply placed the new blades in my old razor head and realized I may have been able to buy an inexpensive Norelco and placed its blades in my old razor.</li>
            <li>so will be interesting to see how long these heads last or if shaver or battery die out first and make me get a new shaver.</li>
            <li>more nothing less</li>
            <li>Half the price and 100% more convenient than the store.</li>
            <li>They finally offered me a courtesy $10 credit on my next order, but prompt fulfillment of order would have been much better.</li>
            <li>1 day after I ordered the the replacement heads for my older razor.</li>
            <li>However, as my razor is the older model.</li>
            <li>I used this to replace my older heads, so you would think the shave would have been smoother.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Fortunately I hadn&#x27;t disposed of an older model Norelco Shaver and when I checked and&lt;br</li>
            <li>It only takes about 5 minutes and most of that time is getting the package open.</li>
            <li>Decent price.</li>
            <li>Can use it again, especially for a quick &amp;#34;touch</li>
            <li>My razor is getting older</li>
            <li>I purchased the main item before.</li>
            <li>A shame that it couldn&#x27;t self sharpen for the price of the main trimmer.</li>
            <li>If you have an older Norelco that you just can&#x27;t part with like</li>
            <li>They make a world of difference to the shave and come at a decent price.</li>
            <li>good enough to get a close shave everyday for well for a year</li>
            <li>One tip - you can often get a lot more life out of your heads by carefully and completely cleaning your razor.</li>
            <li>I found online that the rash was really avoidable if I exfoliated my skin a couple of times a week to get rid of dead skin and bacteria, and exfoliating also gives you a much better shave.</li>
            <li>mostly tired of every thing made in china because they use cheap help and materials to put more americans out of work</li>
            <li>Fit my shaver as expected and price seems reasonable.</li>
            <li>I really love this shaver, and thought I was going to have to buy a &amp;#34;newer and better&amp;#34; and more expensive one.</li>
            <li>I keep an extra set on hand for quick replacement.</li>
            <li>I have two older Norelco shavers.  </li>
            <li>I suspect Philips Norelco cheapened the HQ8 percicely because they didn&#x27;t want their cheaper shavers working better than their more expensive products.</li>
            <li>I bought these as a replacement for some older blades I was using.</li>
            <li>Turns out, it&#x27;s pretty simple to replace the shaver heads if you look at the diagram first.  </li>
            <li>My husband has an older model</li>
            <li>I think there is a minimal sharpness loss, but my 2 year old blades still do the trick :)</li>
            <li>I clean the trimmings each night with hot water, but these blades still seem to dull rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>The blades work better than the old worn out blades, but certainly no close shave</li>
            <li>original blades lasted over two years, but I&#x27;ll probably not wait that long to replace these.</li>
            <li>Thanks for proving that your systems and the people who develop and operate them are so professional!</li>
            <li>I waited to replace them for years because I could buy a whole new razor for the normal shelf price.  </li>
            <li>Like all the ones, I have used, great for a few shaves then seem to dull quickly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend name-brand replacement heads from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended item.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend and won&#x27;t change from this razor set.</li>
            <li>Shipping on the item a bit high for what was provided.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend buying these blades..</li>
            <li>It seems like a bit if a high price for what you&#x27;re getting, but they work well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these replacement heads.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>

            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend and won&#x27;t change from this razor set.</li>
            <li>I have used Norelco products for years in all types of environments, highly recommend the razors and the replacement heads.</li>
            <li>a new shaver.the old one has alot of life left in it and shaves quite comfortably now.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that they send the whole top half of the shaver head, not just the blades inside.  </li>
            <li>My razor is only two years old but the original blades just weren&#x27;t doing the job.  </li>
            <li>These are for an old model now and I could not find it in any other price with a better price.</li>
            <li>I love the shave of the Norelco razor but hate the fact that the flip top too easily becomes detached from the razor body when cleaning.</li>
            <li>Works fine, absolutely no problems</li>
            <li>these were easy to change out adn not a ridiculous price like other replacement blades.</li>
            <li>Blades fit and work perfect restoring previous cutting of razor</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than purchasing a new razor and when heads are replaced works like a new razor once again.</li>
            <li>I used to just buy a new razor because Norelco charges almost as much for replacement heads as they do for a new razor when their on sale.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not noticed any irritation after installing new heads, just a better shave with less effort.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not noticed any irritation after installing new heads, just a better shave with less effort.</li>
            <li>Sure they get rid of the stubble and ok, it may take a little longer with the passing months, but gee didn&#x27;t I just get new blades less than a year ago?  </li>
            <li>the product which is by the way original and not generic, is exactly what is described and the delivery in my case to australia was quicker than some of the local companies deliver locally.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(if they sucked even a little bit I&#x27;d sure tell you)</li>
            <li>However I am still able to shave but it is my perception that it takes me a little longer to do it.</li>
            <li>Finally, after 5 years (!), I replaced the original heads of my Norelco 7810 shaver!</li>
            <li>I found this particular one to last a while and rarely did the blades start pulling hair.  </li>
            <li>They do the job at very near the cost of a whole new razor.</li>
            <li>I forgot how easy it is to shave with sharp blades.  </li>
            <li>My razor is like new again and works like a charm, as if  it were brand new out of the box!</li>
            <li>There was no break-in time like I usually have with new replacement heads; from the very first shave these were extremely comfortable to use.   </li>
            <li>However, he is now in a position in life where he cannot use a blade razor so he is very pleased with just replacing the old dull heads.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m obviously very pleased to have extended the life of my old razor by taking a cheaper/smarter solution to the dull razor dilemma.</li>
            <li>New shaver head made the razor feel like new and was much cheaper AND EASIER than purchasing a new one</li>
            <li>If you are thinking of getting a new razor consider new blades instead, the price I paid for these blades were much much cheaper than a new razor.</li>
            <li>replacement heads (blades and combs) make my older Norelco razor work like new.</li>
            <li>My older shaver works like new again.</li>
            <li>These seem to wear out much faster than the old Norelco blades</li>
            <li>These heads fit my razor just like I expected them to.  </li>
            <li>Really helped to perk up my old electric razor.  </li>
            <li>Being a bit cheap, I was running my razor too long with the old razor heads.</li>
            <li>Comes complete with the whole head.</li>
            <li>i can really tell that my old blades needed to be replaced.</li>
            <li>I have an old beater Norelco that has the old style heads and it shaves twice as fast if not faster and gives a much closer shave.</li>
            <li>Fit as expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered several of these over the years and they are worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Like many products today, one must nearly destroy the product to get it out of the tamper proof packaging.</li>
            <li>From now on I&#x27;ll just replace the heads when needed and keep the old razor as long its motor keeps running smoothly.  </li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s almost not worth buying replacements heads unless it&#x27;s actually cost effective.</li>
            <li>Takes a few shaves to break in but OK after that.</li>
            <li>And once I actually looked at the razor head, replacement was pretty much intuitive.  </li>
            <li>The heads should be a normal replacement every 12 months.</li>
            <li>This will be the first and last time you receive an order for one your products from this very ticked off customer.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s normally</li>
            <li>A separate, larger instruction sheet would have been useful.  </li>
            <li>I would normally ask for a refund on the N.  heads</li>
            <li>This is much easier if you remove the entire head assembly from the body of the shaver first.</li>
            <li>But, if you have a heavy beard or shave more than once a day, as I do, then you should replace the blades every 8 months or so.</li>
            <li>i laugh when someone brings their norelco in to local dealer to be rehabbed...</li>
            <li>They were no more effective than the old ones I replaced.</li>
            <li>These HQ8 replacement heads worked good for about 2 months and then started making noise and performing poorly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend new heads for any razor over one year old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RDC</li>
            <li>Too new for me to judge as just started using the razor but see no reason not to rate it high</li>
            <li>They fit perfectly and restore the \\&quot;brand new\\&quot; shaving experience that you may be missing due to old, dull blades.    </li>
            <li>A little challenging to replace the blades in the razor but other than that the purchase went smoothly.</li>
            <li>The old heads were exactly a year old and I can tell the difference with new heads.</li>
            <li>the new blades enables my older razors to shave like new.  </li>
            <li>these replacement heads gave it a new go , shaves like new again for a decent price</li>
            <li>Why buy bootleg replacements when you get the real deal right here at a fantastic price!</li>
            <li>At the time, lesser models came with NiCad batteries and held less charge and the higher model had lithium batteries and held more charge.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got these on sale, but next time I&#x27;m going for the slightly more expensive replacements with the extra blade rings (which is what came with my razor originally.)</li>
            <li>I cannot tell much difference in the new and the old ones in the way it shaves.</li>
            <li>IT works very well, just like the old one 4 years ago when it was new.</li>
            <li>I was ready to toss my  10 year old Norelco and buy a new one.</li>
            <li>Far better shave with less pull and bite.  </li>
            <li>Have been using them daily for the last 6 months and they&#x27;re still going strong.</li>
            <li>I sent it back because it wasn&#x27;t the right.</li>
            <li>Ordered right there in the CVS store that evening and got the product the next day!</li>
            <li>This guy didn&#x27;t, that being said, i&#x27;ve ordered these several times right now.</li>
            <li>So I finally checked out&lt;br /&gt;the replacement blades and got the right one, so</li>
            <li>I am not sure what Norelco has done, other than changing the foil design, but these are great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was one of the wet dry model shavers, I found out that the newer model price was more than double what I originally payed.....</li>
            <li>it fit and its ok don tthink ill by again since a nerelco razor is just a few dollars more</li>
            <li>Check the Norelco Website if you are unsure if these fit your model but other than that there is nothing to worry about.  </li>
            <li>Not sure what&#x27;s going on here, but after MANY years of using Norelco shavers and getting almost a year out of the heads; this one was not cutting well after only two weeks !  </li>
            <li>The same great Norelco heads I&#x27;ve been using for the past ten years!</li>
            <li>Made my razor work like new.</li>
            <li>Fits my razor well &amp; has saved me from having to purchase a new razor.  </li>

            <li>I was led to believe that instead of changing your blades get a new razor.</li>

            <li>Installing this new set proved that</li>

            <li>It shaves like new again.</li>

            <li>And every year I buy new blades.</li>
            <li>Forgot how well my electric razor does the job until these new heads were installed.</li>
            <li>It is sharp, new, and easily installed in my old razor....</li>
            <li>but they cost too much (about half the price I originally paid for the razor).</li>
            <li>THEY ARE VERY SHARP AND EASY TO INSTALL.</li>
            <li>the old norelco works like brand new!</li>
            <li>Just what i needed to make an old shaver new again!</li>
            <li>I used to just chuck the whole razor, because replacement heads were often times almost the same price as a whole new razor -</li>
            <li>nice razor however the heads do not seem to last very long, this is the third set of replacement heads for this razor and</li>
            <li>They are all short in at least one of these areas that my shaver does fairly well</li>
            <li>Shaving / cutting blades do need to be replaced, and Phillips has developed a relatively easy and effective replacement routine.</li>
            <li>There is really nothing else to say, it simply works very well.</li>
            <li>Cuts great but changing out the old ones is a tedious task.</li>
            <li>I picked this up the replace my old heads on my older Norelco which featured the &amp;#34;lift and cut&amp;#34; system..</li>
            <li>There is a tiny incomprehensible drawing, and reference to the manufacturer&#x27;s web site, which provides only a sort of offensive video about how important it is to replace the headsm</li>
            <li>They last at least a year which I guess is good</li>
            <li>Wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive, but amazon has them for  good price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It is the same product that is available at stores locally, but by getting from Amazon I saved some money.</li>
            <li>If your razor is over 2 years old, I highly recommend replacing the blades to make it work like new again.</li>
            <li>Would I recommend, well if you are looking at these blades, then you really have no other choice.</li>
            <li>I thought we whould have to purchase a new electric razor because it was getting old, but this replacment head was easly to install and he loves it!</li>
            <li>My chief concern was the replacement process, but the instructions on the package were very clear.</li>
            <li>Very professional as always.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these replacement heads to anyone wanting to keep their old shaver but, experience a like-new shave.</li>
            <li>fast however it seems like I got a little closer shave with the original blades ,</li>
            <li>My first reaction when trying out the new blades was &amp;#34;meh, that doesnt seem all that different from before&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Apparently it takes a while for your skin to get used to the new blades, but the rash was really bothering me</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be careful to get the right replacement cutters!  </li>
            <li>a little difficult and tricky to install, but once in, it returns the shaver to a giving a great and smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I would suggest getting both a set of new heads and a sharpener set so that you can 1) sharpen your old heads to like new condition and then 2) have the backup of the new set for when you need them.  </li>
            <li>Perfect, much less expensive that buying a new razor!</li>
            <li>They are a bit pricey I think, however they are half or less than a new shavor and they give a good shave.</li>
            <li>this is not the first time I got the short end of the stick from them, I have alwasys said fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me, well shame on me</li>
            <li>This product is an original by the manufacturer and not a second by an independent.</li>
            <li>not sure, but one thing is fore sure.  </li>
            <li>These are the only replacement heads that I&#x27;m aware of for the Norelco Electric Shaver.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m not sure it is that much better than anything else.  </li>
            <li>fully satisfied &amp; ok.&lt;br /&gt;the lazy programmer makes his users jump like fish...</li>
            <li>Compared to other brands in the past, it is easy to clean and maintain as well as parts are reasonable.</li>
            <li>Just not worth it to by a cheap knock off for a shaver you use every day.  </li>
            <li>Wow what a difference!</li>
            <li>I only picked it up again (the Panasonic, that is) after retiring it when the Norelco floating heads first came to me.</li>
            <li>Some are triple action now!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I simply couldn&#x27;t feel too much of a difference!</li>
            <li>Received earlier than first posted.</li>
            <li>Keep your old razor and replace the heads!</li>
            <li>the life of the razor is a direct reflection of it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had the shaver for several years and other replacements have been OK not this one however!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall I like the razor which is the 7310, not flashy by all means but, gets it done.  </li>
            <li>The old razor can normal use.</li>
            <li>does what it should, pretty close shave for an electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-not getting red irritation marks on my neck anymore&lt;</li>
            <li>This was the first time I replaced the heads and hoped they would last about a year which is in line with Norelco recommended annual replacement.&lt;br /&gt;Shaver</li>
            <li>wow!  </li>
            <li>As the old heads became ineffective and shaving time increased, I just accepted that this was the normal ageing of the Razor.</li>
            <li>I had the original heads on my Norelco for a couple years and finally had enough and bought these, they advise to replace yearly</li>
            <li>Not as sharp as the original blades.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Revived my old razor!</li>
            <li>Keep your old razor and replace the heads!</li>
            <li>Surprised!</li>
            <li>I just got my delivered today, so i haven&#x27;t tested them, but they appear to be the exact same as what came on my shaver (Philips Norelco</li>
            <li>They are okay, but not outstanding</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving them a second chance my first lasted 2 years</li>
            <li>This HQ8 worked well at the first second.</li>
            <li>Seems like the original stay sharp longer.</li>
            <li>He took the old blades out, washed the unit and put the new ones in and it feels like having a brand new razor.</li>
            <li>Switching the old cutters to a set of new ones made my shaver work like a new one.  </li>
            <li>The new blades made my 10 year old Norelco like new.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t seperate the pieces as it&#x27;s hard to put back together, but it should just pop right into the razor.</li>
            <li>My Norelco model has an internal system to let you know when to clean it, recharge it, or replace the heads based on actual usage.  </li>
            <li>I shave regularly about once a week because I like to have a growth before going into trim the &#x27;stache and chin portion, but I shave clean the sides almost daily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing to me that the blades cost so much that you only pay a few extra dollars for the razor.</li>
            <li>I went back to my old cutter heads and even though they were old they at least gave me a good</li>
            <li>THESE HEADS MAKE AN OLD SHAVER LIKE A NEW ONE</li>
            <li>Saved a lot of money by not having to buy a complete new razor unit.</li>
            <li>Boy, was I surprised at the difference new heads made.  </li>
            <li>Managed to install the new heads myself, replacing ones almost two years old.</li>
            <li>I can feel the difference between the old and new quite noticeably.</li>
            <li>What a difference, going from 3 year old cutter blades to brand new ones.</li>
            <li>you are not getting a whole new head ,which the price would indicate because of the overall price of a new razor 59.00 vs</li>
            <li>Compared the new heads to my old ones</li>
            <li>Made a new shaver with comfort out of an old one.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;old \\&quot;razor\\&quot; now works like a new razor.  </li>
            <li>These shaver heads make my 20 year old shaver work like new.  </li>
            <li>I still have an old  Norelco razor and these replacement heads make it work just like a new razor</li>
            <li>the old heads were worn out, so the new ones are just what i needed.</li>
            <li>My old shaver now feels like new.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised and am a fan of the new razor.</li>
            <li>my old  razor was like brand new again</li>
            <li>these parts gave my old razor new life.  </li>
            <li>Gave it new live and a much better shav to say the least,</li>
            <li>I was about to go back to a blade, but these new Norelco HQ8 returned my electric to 100% new at a reasonable cost</li>
            <li>as close as the old design, I checked at Walmart and saw their new shavers</li>
            <li>Replacement give new life to my old razor.</li>
            <li>Nothing new wrt my old shaving head.</li>
            <li>Rather than run all over town ordered new replacement heads for my 7 year old Norelco.</li>
            <li>Makes my old razor cut like it did when new.  </li>
            <li>Wow, what a difference a new set of blades make.</li>
            <li>My husband says he doesn&#x27;t see any difference from the old heads to the new.</li>
            <li>so I surprised him with new blades.</li>
            <li>I just installed a new set of these Norelco HQ8 Replacement Blades on my OLD Norelco shaver.  </li>
            <li>My old razor felt new again after installing the blades.  </li>
            <li>These blades gave an old razor new life.</li>
            <li>Old reliable razor gets new life.  </li>
            <li>It seems to me that the old blades cut a lot cleaner and closer than the new ones.</li>
            <li>When they came, I (for once) followed the instructions that came with them and popped out the old blades and put the new ones in.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;M GOING TO REPLACE THESE HEADS WITH THE OLD ONES UNTIL I GET A NEW SHAVER.</li>
            <li>I purchased New Blades that were duller than the 18 month old originals that I replaced.  </li>
            <li>so I used the new blades with the old covers.</li>
            <li>Found video which showed how to remove old heads and install new ones.</li>
            <li>I had to take the blades out of the new head and put them in the old holder...  </li>
            <li>There is no difference from old to new.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no difference in shaving with the new blades compared to a year old blade.  </li>
            <li>When I replaced my old blades with these, my shaver was like new again.</li>
            <li>It was just what the old razor needed to be new again.  </li>
            <li>New Norelco cutters fit my 10 year old Norelco shaver just as well as the previous set.  </li>
            <li>OEM blades, fit well, work well, last long.</li>
            <li>I get a really smooth shave in half the time.</li>
            <li>THIS ITEM IS NOT A CHEAP ITEM, BUT EASILY FOUND ON THE INTERNED.  </li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and does the job I expected.</li>
            <li>Item was as expected and shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not difficult to do but takes a little more finger dexterity than I expected.</li>
            <li>The heads will &amp;#34;float&amp;#34; down too far and become recessed every time I used it, even with a light touch.</li>
            <li>I am a big online shopper, and have been let down many times.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These heads can only fit in one direction and my old ones could be put in 3 different possible directions since they didn&#x27;t have a distinct slot to force them in one direction only.  </li>
            <li>But, the new head seems to do a good job of both cutting and covering a large part of my face.</li>
            <li>They were exactly what he needed and will last him at least a year or more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before buying yet another set of replacement heads, I took a look at all the current shavers, reading all the reviews, figuring that after 8 years, perhaps it was not worth it to spend any more money on my old shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They may have little motivation to assist their current customers if they earn more profit from sales of new shavers than they earn from sales of replacement heads.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that I received just the blades, it appeared to me that I was buying a complete new head.  </li>
            <li>Since it really feels like a new shaver again, it is like buying your current shaver for just 21 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve priced similar replacement blades in the brick &amp; mortar stores and they wanted as much for the blades as a new Shaver would have cost.</li>
            <li>After toying with the idea of simply buying a whole new electric razor, I decided to look into replacement heads.</li>
            <li>Next time, I&#x27;ll just bit the bullet and buy a whole new shaver.</li>
            <li>only ditched it because wife messed up blades and replacements run as much as this new norelco.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The blades came with very detailed instructions as to installing the blades and it only took a few moments to remove the old blades and replace with the new blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I unfortunately bent one of my previous heads on my razor, and so this was the perfect replacement.</li>
            <li>They are easily installed, but you must be careful to line up the stationary part wings with the slots in the shaver head designed for them or the cutters will not allow you to close the head properly.</li>
            <li>As others reported they did not last as long as the original blades.</li>
            <li>It is obvious that Norelco is overcharging for this product when you can buy a complete new shaver for just a few dollars more than the replacement blades.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We will certainly use this website in the future...</li>
            <li>The new blades certainly made a difference and reminded me of how much faster a shave is with sharp blades.</li>
            <li>These are fine, but as some reviewers have noted, there does seem to be more spacing between the cutting blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be sure the little \\&quot;ears\\&quot; on the cup-shaped  combs in which the cutters sit are properly oriented (rotationally)</li>
            <li>These heads are only a little better than the ones I replaced.</li>
            <li>The original blades lasted about a year and a half.</li>
            <li>Has less blades on each head than the original head.</li>
            <li>1st quality, manufacturer original, and half the price of walgreens.</li>
            <li>Now if I could only get my retired husband to shave a little more often.  </li>
            <li>they came as individual blades that you had to drop back into plac--but they still worked fine once back in.</li>
            <li>Less pulling than the original.</li>
            <li>These have made a tremendous improvement in the operation of my razors, I was not aware of the need to change them.</li>
            <li>Rather than buying a new razon just to get fresh and sharp blades</li>
            <li>These were just a little tricky to install, so be sure you study your current razor head before taking the old blades out.  </li>
            <li>Easy cleaning keeps the shaving heads sharp for the next shave.</li>
            <li>Near the end of May the blades began to feel dull and leave much more hair stuble on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>is model 7340XL, which works fine with new heads, but if I need to replace heads 3 times a year then this is not a worthwhile product.</li>
            <li>Does a great job cutting your beard.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s now clean shaven in much less time because they do the job.</li>
            <li>Why do you insist on comments when it clearly is a routinaire product ????</li>
            <li>I use the electric regularly because I don&#x27;t always need a really close shave and it results in zero nicks compared to the old fashioned shaver.  </li>
            <li>,however I don&#x27;t think it was clear to me  as to which razor they were for.</li>
            <li>The item arrived very quickly, much faster than expected, that was much appreciated, as these are replacement blades for my Norelco shaver,</li>
            <li>Simply took them out of the package, put into my old shaver and was ready to go.</li>
            <li>My old blades - which I replced 1 - 2 times per year were old, old technology.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>about 8 years old</li>
            <li>I am 76 years old and never Jane deviated from being a Norelco user.</li>
            <li>so I used the old screen.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it works well now with the old screen.</li>
            <li>The old ones are still working, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt to replace now.</li>
            <li>was nearly destroyed</li>
            <li>Direct replacement blades.  </li>
            <li>I have a really old Norelco, but it just keeps working and holds a two hour charge.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s over 5 years old now.</li>
            <li>The picture on the package shows a complete head set, heads and frame.    </li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, I&#x27;m doing everything correctly.</li>
            <li>Now that I am using it I can tell the difference from the old ones in my shaver.  </li>
            <li>These were shipped directly to a caregiver there,</li>
            <li>He has sensitive skin</li>
            <li>wow.  </li>
            <li>and they did what my old worn out heads could not do: give me a close shave.  </li>
            <li>The package did arrive completely smushed</li>
            <li>I bought these razor blades to replace the old ones that had been in the razor for over 1 year.</li>
            <li>Replaced old worn out razor heads,</li>
            <li>These are direct factory replacements</li>
            <li>I am hoping with the Phillips lube spray I will get at least 5 more years out of these heads.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I ordered this since, the spring near the head of my shaver broke.</li>
            <li>Are currently working very well.  </li>
            <li>I felt that the product I was purchasing was the complete head for the shaver and not just the blades and screens.</li>
            <li>These blades are direct NORELCO brand replacement blades for the Spectra razor.  </li>
            <li>My old head was over 5 years old</li>
            <li>My razor is a year old, so it was time to replace the heads.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is completely reliable.  </li>
            <li>This was never a problem with the old battery technology (tho I have always COMPLETELY drained my batteries before re-charging..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not 100% sold on the whole Philips Norelco thing these days, but this gets enough of the job done.  </li>
            <li>I have a 12 year old norelco shaver that keeps on working.</li>
            <li>I have a 15 year old XL razor.</li>
            <li>Philips Norelco HQ8 Spectra Tripleheader Head  Will not shave as close as my old  HQ8 Tripleheader</li>
            <li>old.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Included are 3 round blades and the 3 &amp;#34;combs&amp;#34; that the blades fit into.</li>
            <li>I noticed that I was not getting as close a shave as with my old HQ8 blades.  </li>
            <li>old blades that were in the shaver.  </li>
            <li>I just ordered the factory Norelco replacement heads for my old (80&#x27;s or early 90&#x27;s)shaver.  </li>
            <li>What a complete piece of junk, and no the shaving heads didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t compete with a straight edge though that&#x27;s why only 4 stars</li>
            <li>The shipment was prompt and professionally done.  </li>
            <li>the day after using the old fashioned razor because the stubble is shorter to begin with</li>
            <li>Could be that the originals, though old, were just not worn.</li>
            <li>Not a perfectly round shape.</li>
            <li>2 packs from the 3 were squashed and looks like old packs.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 19 year old grandson for Christmas.</li>
            <li>My old set would shave faster, but maybe not as close?  </li>
            <li>My Norelco is over a year old</li>
            <li>My old heads were about 2 years old.</li>
            <li>that is about one year old and yes it was time to make a change.</li>
            <li>Old heads were worn out.</li>
            <li>Completely met expectations</li>
            <li>Does not give me irritation in sensitive neck skin.</li>
            <li>This Replacement has made old razor young again</li>
            <li>In order to keep the matched heads, I marked each set with dots, 1,2,or 3.</li>
            <li>Not shaving any closer than old one.</li>
            <li>I forgot I needed to replace heads every year, mine were over 6 years old.</li>
            <li>The shaver itself is nearly a throw-away.</li>
            <li>Cheaper than buying direct.</li>
            <li>The shave quality was markedly improved.</li>
            <li>ANYBODY NEEDS WHEN THE HEADS BECOME OLD</li>
            <li>I was surprised.  </li>
            <li>Head work&#x27;s just as the old one did.</li>
            <li>The old one was about 5 yrs old.</li>
            <li>Then you can dump out the heads and old cutters.  </li>
            <li>my old blades didn&#x27;t cut it anymore and just span  around making noise but not shaving anything.</li>
            <li>The old blades were two years old.</li>
            <li>will allow you to shave the hairs of your chiny-chin-chin for at least one more year.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My old ones were almost two years old.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Have not heard of any problems with them so far.</li>
            <li>IT IS ON MY OLD SHAVER</li>
            <li>Thought maybe the problem was an old shaver.</li>
            <li>Nope, just old blades.</li>
            <li>SHipped early</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been 2 years since I replaced blades on my 6-year old shavers.</li>
            <li>Arrived early.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s probably because his razor is getting old.</li>
            <li>Replacing my worn out hit-and-miss heads made SUCH A DIFFERENCE that I think I will replace them more frequently.</li>
            <li>I recently replaced the heads on my Norelco razor and they give a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>direct replacement.</li>
            <li>Wow, now I know why my son was not getting a close shave.</li>
            <li>No problems so far.  </li>
            <li>Fits perfectly on my old Philips Norelco triple head shaver 7310XL</li>
            <li>I m having a cleaner shave comparing to the old header.</li>
            <li>I had my old ones for about 1.5 years and figured was time to replace them</li>
            <li>dubious about the replacement heads since they&#x27;re not inexpensive, as one would expect--  but pleasantly surprised with these--</li>
            <li>after replacing the old blades, the shaving is cleaner and it is a bit quicker to get the job done</li>
            <li>The razor is two years old, should have bought them a year ago.</li>
            <li>So far they are performing well even though they do not give as close of a shave as I would like.  </li>
            <li>Just what was needed by the old shaver.  </li>
            <li>I wish I&#x27;d replaced my old heads sooner.  </li>
            <li>REPLACED OLD HEADS</li>
            <li>I started to notice that my 13 month old Norelco was not shaving my face as close as it used to.</li>
            <li>Thought I got a cheap knock-off or something and not genuine parts.  </li>
            <li>I dug out the old electric razor (7-8 yrs old)</li>
            <li>They cost as much as the entire printer/shaver/toothbrush itself!</li>
            <li>I change the heads after using the old ones for years.</li>
            <li>It is a complete replacement item and a child could do it.</li>
            <li>You get used to taking forever to shave with blades that are four years old.</li>
            <li>The Five Stars speak loud and clear.</li>
            <li>no problem putting on old razor.</li>
            <li>my old heads.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that it did make a noticeable improvement in the performance of my shaver.</li>
            <li>Old head was like shaving with a snow shovel.</li>
            <li>All products worked well as advertised that I have used so far,</li>
            <li>A direct replacement part.</li>
            <li>My beard is fairly soft</li>
            <li>It replaced a 2.5 year old shaver head.  </li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t provide a shave that is any closer than the old head.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After all, where the blades meet your skin is where the action is.</li>
            <li>Makes them last a whole lot longer.</li>
            <li>so i looked online with amazon and was pleasantly surprised to find these at a fraction of the price</li>
            <li>Given the price of razor blades these days I thought I would try my old electric again.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I should have keep the old one.</li>
            <li>I should&#x27;ve kept the old blades.</li>
            <li>I got the shaver replacement inserts not the complete replacement head.</li>
            <li>I bought them to replace the old blades.</li>
            <li>Shipping is in a retail box, complete with installation instructions and all.</li>
            <li>THEY DID NOT FIT AND COULD NOT BE MADE TO FIT.  </li>
            <li>The old ones wore through but was used for about 8-10 years.</li>
            <li>but so far no re reply&lt;</li>
            <li>Then I have to come up with at least 7 more words.</li>
            <li>Fixed my problem.</li>
            <li>I bought this one as a replacement for old heads.</li>
            <li>This replaced the old cutters in the Norelco cordless shaver, so you get a closer shave...</li>
            <li>bough them early to have when it came up on my yearly replacement time.</li>
            <li>So far these replacement heads are giving me a close shave.</li>
            <li>AS FAR AS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>These heads were a direct replacement for my Norelco AT810 shaver.  </li>
            <li>I used the old heads for about 2 two years when I noticed that I was not getting as close of a shave as I used to.  </li>
            <li>price on Amazon was much cheaper than local stores.</li>
            <li>Noticed difference as soon as I replaced the old blades.</li>
            <li>Received items (replacement razor heads) as promised thanks, would gladly do future business!</li>
            <li>Old ones had worn out.  </li>
            <li>I thought I was purchasing the  the complete head  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The cutters will allow old whiskers to stick to them.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d think no one was surprised here.  </li>
            <li>The old ones i had for over 2 years..</li>
            <li>Not the level of quality I expected but still useful to a degree.</li>
            <li>Sure the old style did pull on the longer ones but at least it cut them off.</li>
            <li>does a good job, but is too expensive</li>
            <li>I recommend them to all masochist, needless to say they are good replacements.</li>
            <li>The blades are good but it&#x27;s difficult to insert</li>
            <li>I found a 5 year old expensive Norelco razor in my cabinet that I loved but had quit using years ago because it quit shaving well.</li>
            <li>slightly difficult to take out old heads &amp; replace with these, but once they went in they worked just as good as the originals.</li>
            <li>One of those things that you have to live with and if your face is full of little holes from a worn out head it does work to fix the problems.</li>
            <li>In the past I have actuallypurchased a new shaver at the same price as the replacement heads, but the price here was appropriate.</li>
            <li>, I feel the blades (or metal/tempering), are not exactly the same quality or edge sharpening grind, as my original &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; blades from Norelco when new.</li>
            <li>My past experiences with brand new blade were it would take more than multiple uses to get into shape.</li>
            <li>As with the oringinal heads, they work great when new, but dull quickly and are too expensive to have to keep replacing.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered as the old one became a problem to my face just after replacing the new one my shaver returne back it effecency like new</li>
            <li>Old blades were starting to cut skin not just hair, got these and the razor is like new again and saved me from having to buy a new razor.</li>
            <li>I would  recommend buying a new razor rather than getting a replacement because the new one feels the same as my old razor heads.</li>
            <li>I do wish I would have bought the pink curtain buttons to go with it right away though.</li>
            <li>As usual, this purchase thru amazon.com was easy, convenient and affordable.</li>
            <li>It was much cheaper on amazon than any other store, and shipped fast.  </li>
            <li>left out every other blade, why, like everybody else the all mighty</li>
            <li>and I KNOW AMAZON would grant it, but for the first time ever I think I will allow convenience to override economics (mainly because I have a disability and it would be a hardship at this point, although  minor, to send them back).</li>
            <li>Installation of the new heads was a breeze even without the instructions and now I&#x27;m back to new again.</li>
            <li>After having my shaver for several years, I was considering getting a new one since it didn&#x27;t seem to be working as well as when it was new.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, after the swap my razor was back working like new - and I even made a note to myself when I put in the new blades</li>
            <li>The new blades need to be inserted into the assembly; new locking screws installed; and then the assembly placed back into the razor.  </li>
            <li>Once properly installed, the old razor cut like a brand new unit!</li>
            <li>Oh my gosh, our several year old razor cuts like brand new now!</li>
            <li>when all that you really need to do in most cases is replace the shaving heads/blades to notice a dramatic difference?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only been half a year since I&#x27;ve switched them now, but they&#x27;re still going just as strong as the day I got them.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend changing your blades more often than 4 years in between, and just in general it helps to exfoliate your face a few times a week for</li>
            <li>After a most uncomfortable shave my face was still full of moderate stubble.</li>
            <li>THE RAZORS ARE SHARP AS EVER AND ARE WORTH THEIR MONEY.</li>
            <li>original heads lasted over a year, and I shave everyday</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the service, but these blades were NOT made for extra tough beards.  </li>
            <li>Replacing the head was simple and shaver is once again like new!</li>
            <li>My husband was finally convinced to change out blades instead of buying a completely new razor...and what a difference!  </li>
            <li>Simple pleasures, like new blades!  </li>
            <li>These have two small tabs that will let you put the heads in only in a certain way, so look for that, as the original heads did not have the tabs, even though the razor is set up to accommodate them.</li>
            <li>The old heads that are several years old give a smoother shave than these new heads.  </li>
            <li>I tried sharpening the old blades, and it helped for a few months, but new blades are SOOOO worth it.</li>
            <li>and I will not give them the chance for a third time mainly for the fact that I have told them of both incidents and I have not gotten even the slightest appolagy.   </li>
            <li>I decided to go with the brand-name replacements, mainly because I trust the name - and I couldn&#x27;t find any cheaper, generic versions anywhere.</li>
            <li>I intend to do that the next time my blades no longer provide a decent shave.</li>
            <li>I noticed that the heads are a different color and wonder if these are a generic replacement and not an exact replacement.</li>
            <li>They last - I usually throw them away after using two blades because I want the latest model.</li>
            <li>I am not especially mechanical and wondered at first why I could not buy the entire head assembly and just pop it on.  </li>
            <li>This is the second set of Norelco HQ8 Replacement Heads I have purchased from Amazon for mu older Norelco Spectra 8890XL shaver.</li>
            <li>I owned an older norelco model for over 10 years and only chnaged blades once.</li>
            <li>You need this if your Norelco is older than several years..</li>
            <li>Since I have a older Norelco, I had some questions which I sent to Philips and they returned answers the next day.</li>
            <li>The shave is not as close and clean as expected, (same as the throw-away razors/blades, also from major old-time brand companies...</li>
            <li>Still, the price for such a replacement has come way down, and the old-fashioned way of shaving is, cost-wise and ecologically speaking, no competition at all for a Norelco.</li>
            <li>But I also have a little plastic sharpening kit I bought online for $5 that works great, so I will sharpen a set every time I notice my shave getting a little rough.  </li>
            <li>These blades stay sharp right up to the end.  </li>
            <li>Stars is as high as I rate such objects.  </li>
            <li>Be careful evidently all &amp;#34;HQ8&amp;#34; are not the same, my razor is an older model that takes an HQ8 head</li>
            <li>I was infact planning to throw my year old shaver and get new one, but changed my mind last minute and decided to get replacement head.</li>
            <li>Simply pull the old one off and snap the new one on.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at how simple it was to install the new head.  </li>
            <li>My original blade lasted me years, but I feel like these new ones are dulling after only a few months...</li>
            <li>if im going out on a date or something i usually use a mach3 to get it real smooth but other than that this is preobobly the easiest way to go.</li>
            <li>I found it cost (in the long run) quite a bit and the smooth surface didn&#x27;t last long at all.  </li>
            <li>Has it really been that long?</li>
            <li>Really smooth shave, no more burning.</li>
            <li>great to not have to replace the shole machine, but very EXPENSIVE by comparison...</li>
            <li>It was long overdue and the razor is now working very well.</li>
            <li>After going to multiple stores in our city and finding no one carries them locally any more, I found them on Amazon without any trouble.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>The product was exactly what I expected, at a lower price than the manufacturer&#x27;s web site.</li>
            <li>Only thing to be careful of is to use a VERY gentle touch when getting used to a new pair of blades.  </li>
            <li>I more or less, have a new razor for much less than the actual price of a new one.</li>
            <li>After about a year, my original shaving heads seemed rather dull and I bought and installed a new set.  </li>
            <li>I have to make several passes to get clean shave with NO success.   </li>
            <li>I discovered that if I simply use a light touch and not press so hard then it got those hairs much better and with NO MORE RAZOR BURN &amp;lt;3.&lt;br /&gt;happy shaving.</li>
            <li>Shave a little better, not much.</li>
            <li>This are pretty expensive compared to the price of the complete unit, but the Norelcos I have have been going strong for about three years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always tough describing a very subjective issue but, in this case, these Replacement Heads just don&#x27;t seem to shave as close or as smoothly as I would have</li>
            <li>but I suspect you can get that with many other brands for less $$.</li>
            <li>After several years I thought purchasing new replacement heads would renew my electric razor.</li>
            <li>After going over 4 years without buying new blades, it was definitely time to so.  </li>
            <li>The new heads made a big difference in the performance of my razor.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend getting new heads every couple of years.</li>
            <li>Replaced yearly, new cutters will keep your shave extra close and shorten shaving time.</li>
            <li>A brand new Philip shave only costs 30 bucks</li>
            <li>The new heads shave close enough that I could skip a day if I wanted to.</li>
            <li>Next time I will just buy a new razor.</li>
            <li>About a year after I got my new Philips electric razor as a present I noticed it wasn&#x27;t shaving as close as it used to.</li>
            <li>Just check the current prices for new razors before buying replacement heads.</li>
            <li>The second the new blades touched my face, it felt as if shards of glass were slashing me.</li>
            <li>Second time that I have replaced the heads instead of purchasing a new electric.  </li>
            <li>Hubby needed new blades for his razor and could not find locally.  </li>
            <li>Razor is now back shaving just as well as when the razor was brand new.</li>
            <li>The new HQ8 heads give me such a close shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using the same blades for probably 5 years, decided it was time to buy new ones.  </li>
            <li>The only comlaint would be the price almost price of new shaver if ordered from Phillps.</li>
            <li>I ordered the replacement heads expecting a similar shave as the new shaver.....</li>
            <li>The new blades were simple to install.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same as buying a new razor, but a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li>you can get a new shaver with same heads.</li>
            <li>While I wonder if purchasing the heads was actually cheaper than finding a new shaver on sale.</li>
            <li>Brought it back to like new again.</li>
            <li>Installed new heads - shaver shaves the same.  </li>
            <li>thing you must do is use the new blades for several days until they settle in and adjust to your skin.</li>
            <li>what is essentially a brand new electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is almost in like new condition and provides a proper shave.</li>
            <li>I finally bought new blades for my Norelco 8825</li>
            <li>As soon as I used the new heads, I could tell what a different there was.</li>
            <li>Brings your clipper back to like new operation.</li>
            <li>so i purchased this at the same time that i purchased is new shaver.  </li>
            <li>it was the right part and works fine for the money you can not go wrong will buy again when needed</li>
            <li>The first heads lasted around 6 - 8 months, we&#x27;ll see how long these last.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a bit tricky to install but no real trouble.</li>
            <li>I replaced the old heads with these and my old razor is back on task.</li>
            <li>Now my old shaver is back in action</li>
            <li>They perform very well, but for some reason, they added a radiused ear to the bottom which makes installation much more difficult.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of facial hair and very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised by the low price.</li>
            <li>The replacement heads were a little different than the original ones and were a bit tricky to get inserted correctly.  </li>
            <li>Making the purchase of the razor replacement heads on line at Amazon was a major convenience.  </li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t had any major problems with product misrepresentation on Amazon before</li>
            <li>The blades over time became dull although the shaver worked fine.</li>
            <li>Blades are not sharp at all.  </li>
            <li>There is no other words required.</li>
            <li>No other guidance is provided.  </li>
            <li>also if you look closely, these have small &amp;#34;pinholes&amp;#34; where as my original head had fins all the way around..</li>
            <li>And if you are not going to shell our the big bucks for a fancy razor, don&#x27;t bother buying another &lt;$50 razor because these replacements essentially do the same exact thing.</li>
            <li>I should have replaced the heads long ago but kept using the old ones and complaining that \\&quot;I need to get a new razor.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t seem to stay sharp as long as the originals, but it&#x27;s my fourth set of replacements and the electric razor keeps working fine.</li>
            <li>My husband replaced the old blades with the new last night and said it was simple.  </li>
            <li>It felt a little funny at first to use such a thick cream on my face, but it really helped make my shave so much smoother</li>
            <li>so I usually just clean up the edges.</li>
            <li>Its original battery, however, holds a charge for only a few days.</li>
            <li>Made my old razor new again, don&#x27;t  know why I waited as long as I did!</li>
            <li>Mine beard would laugh when I attempted to use my old ones and it would take three times the time to shave and my face was like raw meat afterwards.</li>
            <li>After several years with the same blades, I saw in the mirror that I wasn&#x27;t getting a decent shave.  </li>
            <li>They fit right and are still cutting my whiskers, cheaper than a new razor, so I bought two sets.</li>
            <li>They were a little tricky to install because my fingers are pretty old and worn out.  </li>
            <li>It was slightly different than my existing blades, because this one features a little &#x27;tooth&#x27; to lock the blades in place - very smart!</li>
            <li>Each goes in only one way, so take note of where the flat spot on the side of each head is oriented as you remove each old head and match it as you put in the new.  </li>
            <li>it felt less substancial from the very first second.</li>
            <li>I am not sure what is going on, but this is the third time I have bought replacement blades and  this time they don&#x27;t quite fit my razor.  </li>
            <li>While the image clearly shows blades and the plastic head holder, the shipped products includes only the blades - no holder.  </li>
            <li>Replacing the shavre&#x27;s cutting heads is not difficult and restores the top notch performance that I know my Norelco shaver delivers  .</li>
            <li>So far the second set seems to be holding a sharper edge.</li>
            <li>Mine is 8 years old and used daily - still works well with just replacement heads once a year.</li>
            <li>The head of my razor fell off and I could never get the old blades back in.</li>
            <li>Replaced a 2 year old set of 3rd party blades with these, and it was like night and day.  </li>
            <li>Looking closer at the blades, the surfaces had differently shaped hair slots, and my old blades had the words \\&quot;\\&quot;Lift and Cut\\&quot; engraved twice on each head surface.  </li>
            <li>No complaints and no regrets.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend replacing yours if it is over a year old.</li>
            <li>I will straighten it out in the near future.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t get nearly as close because they are a different style.</li>
            <li>I ordered these replacement blades for my 4 year old Norelco and they came in a ridiculously short amount of time.</li>
            <li>All Natural Acne Spot Treatment - Blemishes Gone or Your Money Back!</li>
            <li>obviously too old  - ca 25 years</li>
            <li>The product was received promptly and was what I expected at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>Our last set of blades lasted nearly seven months, and we have every reason to believe that we will get equivalent service from this purchase.</li>
            <li>this is a ten year old razor</li>
            <li>May have to put old blades back in.</li>
            <li>After shaving exclusively with my Norelco for nearly eight months I started to notice occasional whisker plucks (ouch!)</li>
            <li>Barely seems to make a difference in my razor.  </li>
            <li>thanks but no thanks.</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for:  it barely outlasted it&#x27;s warranty.</li>
            <li>I bought this replacement because last one was getting old and it was giving me skin</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, well packaged, as expected.</li>
            <li>My beard is not heavy and I only need to shave once a day</li>
            <li>I thought my razor was cutting good</li>
            <li>It would be nice if parts didn&#x27;t wear out, but, unfortunately, they do.  </li>
            <li>They work everytime and retain a good cutting capability.</li>
            <li>they work extremely well - like a new razor without the new razor cost.</li>
            <li>It can be a little of a challenge to get them in just right though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how the performance of a product can go down slowly over time</li>
            <li>However, it does mean I don&#x27;t have to throw the whole razor away creating even more waste.</li>
            <li>Usually I just throw my old razor away and buy a new one because the replacement blades cost so much.</li>
            <li>you really do notice the difference in the closeness of the shave when first replacing approximately one-year-old heads with these new razor-sharp beauties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i finally replaced my blades after 12 months and its back to like new condition</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually easier simply to buy a new shaver.</li>
            <li>Cheaper than a new Razor, simple enough for anyone to do.  </li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;ll buy locally or just get a new razor.</li>
            <li>The razor will work with only two, but I wanted it back to new.</li>
            <li>It only fits the new shaver, even though the part numbers are the same</li>
            <li>But what really surprised me was how much faster (less time per shave) as well.</li>
            <li>my Norelco shaver was taking a long time to shave, ordered new heads and got them in record time.</li>
            <li>Replaced the heads (probably waited too long), and it&#x27;s just like a new shaver.</li>
            <li>I have two Norelco razors that I received as gifts over the last few years I would clean them regularly</li>
            <li>The original heads always seem to last longer - not sure why.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t realized how dull my original blades had become after a year</li>
            <li>Hard to get excited about razor heads...</li>
            <li>Original shaving heads lasted 10 months, and were probably noticeably dull after 9.</li>
            <li>After a year, my original blades had become dull.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to explain how crappy these are compared to the original parts.</li>
            <li>Long story short, it took just as long and with just as much effort to shave as it did with my 5 year old blades.  </li>
            <li>The replacement heads work great, but I don&#x27;t feel the cutting quality lasts very long!  </li>
            <li>I finally changed the heads and it shaver is as good as new though the one old weren&#x27;t that bad even after using it for last 2 years.</li>
            <li>A little difficult to postion but works great once you get it installed</li>
            <li>/&gt;They should stick with the original design the customer bought at least for longer than&lt;br /&gt;4 years.</li>
            <li>I really need to get another set for my other one.</li>
            <li>Then, again, to be fair, he does have an extra tough beard and there simply may not be ANY blade that can last him long enough.</li>
            <li>I buy a new razor every other year, and new blades on alternate years.</li>
            <li>Shaver 7310 original blades were starting to leave stubs behind and with these replacement heads, shaver is as new!  </li>
            <li>I debated about this, since they&#x27;re about half the price of a new shaver, but since I had already found and soldered in a new battery, I figured what the heck.  </li>
            <li>unpacked, the heads were more difficult to replace correctly than I had imagined or hoped for, but I finally got the job done and the new heads shave quite well.</li>
            <li>I was able to salvage things by re-using the old screens and put in the new cutting blades/wheels.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not getting the close shave you used to, order new blades, not a new razor.</li>
            <li>Glad we don&#x27;t have to go out and purchase a new shaver when the only thing wrong was the blades were dulling.  </li>
            <li>Works great, much less expensive than taking it to a local shop for service.</li>
            <li>Old folks should be let out only occasionally!</li>
            <li>The whole thing was a few years old</li>
            <li>Same (identical) package that I ordered from Amazon, but different heads that looked like my old ones and did mesh.  </li>
            <li>The package is difficult to open without a pair of scissors handy.</li>
            <li>your shave will be closer and cleaner but comparing the new babies to my 3+ year old heads, the change is not very significant.</li>
            <li>He tells me he will not wait so long next time before ordering a new head for his shaver.</li>
            <li>The replacement blades lasted only about two weeks before they were as dull as the original blades.</li>
            <li>Be aware paying attention to the small print as it&#x27;s hard to determine which ones will fit your razor.</li>
            <li>Disn&#x27;t realize how my old blades had worn down until I installed the new replacement.</li>
            <li>These heads simply made my razor like new for less than purchasing a new one.  </li>
            <li>Not a good fit for my model even though it said it was</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find out that it lasted so long on a charge.</li>
            <li>Strange that I had old Norelos from Japan that cut for decades</li>
            <li>no excuse not to change heads.</li>
            <li>The old heads lasted a long time.</li>
            <li>I am not sure this is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>The replacements, although they look original, have done a worse job than the 4 year old blades they replaced.</li>
            <li>Made my year old razor just like new at half the price the retailer wanted.</li>
            <li>other down side is don&#x27;t purchase these at their full retail price.  </li>
            <li>As other reviewers have noted, what a difference new heads make!</li>
            <li>Did not quite fit my older model resulting in a noisy uncomfortable feel.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this was just a fluke or if the quality has really gone down.  </li>
            <li>You will definitely get your monies worth from this little bugger!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually been years since I last replaced the blades in my razor so as you might guess it made a major difference when I replaced them.  </li>
            <li>Now you have to replace the blades every year because they get dull so quickly.</li>
            <li>I have a light beard so they have always worked well, though the cheaper models don&#x27;t shave as closely or don&#x27;t have the adjustments that the more expensive (and much too expensive) shavers have.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to install as a replacement for my husbands Norelco that was past due in having blades replaced</li>
            <li>Using a shaver daily and the incremental degradation of the cutters is so imperceptible, but these replacements made me realize how important sharp cutters are.  </li>
            <li>This head works as expected like the one that came on shaver when it was new.  </li>
            <li>item brand new and working just as expected.</li>
            <li>less than ten minutes had my saver fixed and working like new.........</li>
            <li>I will find out the next time I change whether or not my shaver has to be abandoned, as this time I used the new blades Amazon sent me in one of 2 boxes with my old heads that I had luckily not thrown away.</li>
            <li>Purchased a Remington, hated it, went back to a Norelco, LOVE IT...,  Works great, delivered fast, cannot go wrong with Norelco in my opinion</li>
            <li>I get a much faster and smoother shave with less noise once replaced.</li>
            <li>I will replace them much sooner than I had previously.</li>
            <li>The blades cost half the price of the whole razor, I expect them to work.</li>
            <li>I get a much closer shave in a lot less time.</li>
            <li>People in Mexico, you can get the same product in palacio de hierro for barely the same price.</li>
            <li>I am disappointed since I was expecting a considerable change for the good.</li>
            <li>The old ones only had slots along the cutting surface but these are designed like the heads on the more expensive razors, with slots and holes, and do seem to work better than the old ones did even when they were new.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great product  and I have ordered replacement blades in  the past  with the same  although I was sent the wrong model.</li>
            <li>set took a few days before they started to shave better (and possibly a little faster, unless I&#x27;m imagining that since my facial hair isn&#x27;t as long now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>needed new ones because i was cutting my face every time I shave some needed and order more.  </li>
            <li>you must remove the round covers and blades from the old head and replace it with the new blades.  </li>
            <li>These HQ8 blades turned my old shaver into a new shaver in just a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still puzzled why replacments have to cost so much, but getting them through Amazon typically beats all the local competition</li>
            <li>These heads seem to work just as good as the originals and are much less expensive than those in the retail stores.</li>
            <li>Purchased the new cutting blades for my old Norelco , fit and worked well.</li>
            <li>I tried for nearly an hour to twist and turn these new head covers to fit into the three holes from the cutting blades.</li>
            <li>I usually just buy a new razor vs investing in new blade.  </li>
            <li>All parts are loose so you have to be very careful with removing the old heads and placing the new ones.</li>
            <li>could be a little cheaper, really guys, make it cheaper online.</li>
            <li>Little tabs on the sides of the heads have to fit in little spaces to seat properly.  </li>
            <li>Was about 5 minute from trashing and  buying  a new other brand electric razor.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have a degree in engineering or have someone who is extremely handy--really just buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>They are not as sharp as the blades that came with my razor when it was new.</li>
            <li>These do not seem to be as sharp as the ones that come with the new razors.</li>
            <li>The new design of the Phillips Norelco heads cut extremely well.</li>
            <li>Phillips said that Amazon replacement heads are not original factory equipment and they sent me a box of HQ8 replacement heads for free for the wasted time and frustration I&#x27;d encountered with the Amazon heads sent to me.</li>
            <li>I waited too long to change my blades, and when I finally did, I could tell a major difference.</li>
            <li>I end up buying a new razor every other time for about the same cost.  </li>
            <li>The shave is now much shorter as the old ones were dull.  </li>
            <li>My old razor was getting dull and this was a much needed reaplacement.  </li>

            <li> Great, considering I haven&#x27;t changed the heads in my razor for some time (about 5 years), it&#x27;s amazing what new heads will do for a shave.  </li>
            <li> Everything fit perfect and within minutes I was shaving with brand new blades.  </li>
            <li> The new blades are excellent, and I am getting a close, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit just like new.</li>
            <li> A perfect fit, made my Norelco shaver feel like new.</li>
            <li> The razor heads fit perfect and made my electric razor new again.</li>
            <li> Right price works great easy to put together in your razor</li>
            <li> These are very good equivalent replacement heads for my Norelco Quadra Action razor that is supposed to use HQ6 type heads.&lt;br /&gt;Those</li>
            <li> A very easy installation and the best shave I have had in a long time.  </li>
            <li> Worked great, my husband was very happy to no longer have dull blades, and I was happy to find these and not have to replace a whole razor.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll know because the shave takes more passes.  </li>
            <li> They are just slightly better than my 20 year olds.</li>
            <li> Just love this product.  </li>
            <li> Shavinf is so much  better when you chane the blades as recommended.</li>
            <li> am glad I did.</li>
            <li> We are satisfied with the replacement heads for our shaver.  </li>
            <li> Went online on Amazon and was able to find with ease.</li>
            <li> and the shave is way much better.</li>
            <li> but I guess that&#x27;s the part of the electric razor that has the most value.  </li>
            <li> I sincerely don&#x27;t believe that it is my doing after all these sixty plus shaving years with Norelco shavers.</li>
            <li> Buying the best next time and spending the $$</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco for many years.</li>
            <li> one or two years at the most.</li>
            <li> Been satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> They cut and shave OK, but they bind on the razer as I cut.  </li>
            <li> , the better it would get those stray hairs.</li>
            <li> Love a close shave with quality replacement heads on my Norelco electric razor.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed at the ease with which I was able to purchase the Norelco blades.  </li>
            <li> Such a great price!</li>
            <li> As I said, a disaster, most of it our fault.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY SATISFIED WITH THESE BLADES AND WILL CONTINUE TO USE THEM.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Cranked it up, and at this point it&#x27;s somewhat better than before.</li>
            <li> My son in law love it</li>
            <li> i was pleased with the speed in which it arrived</li>
            <li> Could do a much better job.</li>
            <li> they where workd perfect till now but second time purchased replacement heads was to bed</li>
            <li> Work OK.  </li>
            <li> They take my whiskers off better than a weed eater.</li>
            <li> Product was OK.    </li>
            <li> Tripleheaders Replacement Heads arrived in the proper time frame and was in excellent condition.  </li>
            <li> I had the shaver for one year,after one year norelco says to renew the heads for better performance.</li>
            <li> They cut better</li>
            <li> I will continue to use amazon.com for most of my online purchases.</li>
            <li> Glad they did.</li>
            <li> Amazon had them and at a better price.</li>
            <li> What more can I say?</li>
            <li> The price is substantially better than what&#x27;s offered on the Norelco website.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get better than that.</li>
            <li> These things have lasted me more than a year, although I have a beard</li>
            <li> :)   </li>
            <li> I switched one year ago from a regular razor (Schick Quattro) to the Norelco electric razor, and I am very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize there were so many Norelco razors.  </li>
            <li> what more can I say..</li>
            <li> Quality product, with a great shave at a reasonable price without gouging your pocket.  </li>
            <li> and it sure shaves closer than the Norelco ever did.</li>
            <li> every time, I love these blades.</li>
            <li> Product met all my expectations and more.  </li>
            <li> It was better for me to replace this item than to have it sharpen.</li>
            <li> This electric razor works so much better</li>
            <li> maybe even better then</li>
            <li> I have used a Norelco razor for many years.  </li>
            <li> After about 5 years I was getting a lot more shaver burn.</li>
            <li> I have no burn and get an even better shave than ever.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> really love the way amazon service handled it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Also when he reaches the mind-set to no longer do it at all, I will be able to do it for him since the heads are floaters.  </li>
            <li> It will be interesting to see if the noise is from some sort of dragging that reduces the life of a charge on the shaver.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco shavers for many years and still believe them to be the best of the electric shavers, but recently the heads just do not seem to hold there sharpness.</li>
            <li> Better than the heads that they replaced.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;so can count on delivery as I need more.</li>
            <li> Amazon, I love your website.</li>
            <li> , it had been a bit more than a year after all..</li>
            <li> but some times the men things are just better and who will know?</li>
            <li> * , ok?</li>
            <li> The product is OK.  </li>
            <li> There again, I have used Norelco Products for many years.</li>
            <li> I will order more.  </li>
            <li> There has to be a better way for my husband to shave.</li>
            <li> What more can I say.</li>
            <li> It is get that we are able to get replacements for my husband&#x27;s razor.  </li>
            <li> I would pay more for a product that lasted longer.</li>
            <li> Love electric shavers.</li>
            <li> Since most buyers seemed satisfied, I decided to order them.</li>
            <li> I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> OK OK OK OK&lt;</li>
            <li> These worked OK.  </li>
            <li> Most people probably don&#x27;t keep their product booklets, so it would help to include the \\&quot;how-to\\&quot; with the replacements.</li>
            <li> Satisfied.</li>
            <li> The HQ8 replacement blades are top quality</li>
            <li> Excellent Replacement parts when the current one wear out.</li>
            <li> There must be dozens of Norelco models that have similar parts however this product matched my model perfectly.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers for many years.  </li>
            <li> Need I say more?</li>
            <li> Bought them through Amazon and I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> they are blades, they cut, what more do you need to know?</li>
            <li> They fit nicely on the shaver.</li>
            <li> I love the product.  </li>
            <li> I thought I was getting more than one because it headline says &amp;#34;Heads&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to get my shaver in tip top shape.</li>
            <li> I love the Philip Norelco electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Bought a $15.00 travel Braun and it shaves better than a $100 Norelco, which won&#x27;t stay together.</li>
            <li> So much better now that I&#x27;ve replaced my heads.</li>
            <li> Every year I change the heads for better results.</li>
            <li> everything is outstanding.</li>
            <li> ok don&#x27;t change nothing</li>
            <li> The electric works better (for me)</li>
            <li> and I do not have to go over my face as many times compared to</li>
            <li> I might be OK with it</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are better than the originals.</li>
            <li> Grandpa is now able to cut off all those pesky gray stubbles and look handsome again.  </li>
            <li> I appreciate a smooth cheek to kiss.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> Just make sure that you get the ones designed for your model.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I replaced them, would I still be satisfied with the shave?  </li>
            <li> These blades are actually better then the ones that came with my series 7130.  </li>
            <li> Changing the shaver heads gets you a better shave.</li>
            <li> Newer is not always better.  </li>
            <li> They will be used I am sure</li>
            <li> Heads are great replacement and cheaper than replacing the whole shaver.  </li>
            <li> Glad I bought them.</li>
            <li> After getting them from Amazon the razor cuts much better.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> Shaving goes much better with these in place</li>
            <li> I am glad I purchased my replacement heads for my shaver</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my razor for years and have bought many replacements</li>
            <li> Be sure to replace blades yearly like the instructions say.</li>
            <li> I love my razor, now I can keep it and not replace it with something else</li>
            <li> I will not purchase any more.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There should be a better explanation of the sizing.</li>
            <li> I have used this product, or its predecessor for many years.  </li>
            <li> These are authentic Norelco heads</li>
            <li> The package arrived in time for my dad&#x27;s birthday present, which made us both very happy!</li>
            <li> i love them</li>
            <li> Works ok...</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> It arrived ok in spite of the post office&#x27;s attempt to smash it.....</li>
            <li> I love Norelco.</li>
            <li> He has the Norelco and has had it for many years.  </li>
            <li> so he thought maybe he had better do that.</li>
            <li> I am using the shaver and seems to be ok.</li>
            <li> Shaving takes longer than I&#x27;d like with this head, but I find that&#x27;s par for the course with most electric razors.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco razors for 25+ years &amp; am satisfied with the product &amp; replacement parts.</li>
            <li> Could use better installation instructions.</li>
            <li> By ordering this item I saved money and didn&#x27;t have to purchase more</li>
            <li> :) I recommend cleaning off the razor head with isopropyl alcohol after each use to keep it semi-sterile.</li>
            <li> Love these OEM replacement Heads for my Norelco razor.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this part, It works better than the ones</li>
            <li> Your shaving unit has the three circles on top which are the blades.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> and I suspect for most users of a Norelco shavers.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li> Plus Rhassoul, Bentonite Clay Mask with Witch Hazel &amp; Aloe Vera - Refreshing Lemon Scent (1 Jar) (4 Oz)]]</li>
            <li> Glad to find these replacement shaver heads for the Philips Norelco.</li>
            <li> Extends the life of the shaver making the electric shaver more affordable.</li>
            <li> Amazon has always provided me with great merchandise with fast delivery.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad that I saw the replacement blades instead.</li>
            <li> Thankful to be able to replace the blades and not have to trash&lt;br /&gt;the unit, which seems to be the trend</li>
            <li> Norelco makes what I think is the best razor available, with the addition of these replacement blades, it turned my 3 year old razor back to its superb shaves again.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Customer service is outstanding.</li>
            <li> Make sure you get these too....</li>
            <li> pleased with replacements</li>
            <li> Norelco is my personal choice for best electric razor.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!  </li>
            <li> Wonderful deal with the instant clip coupon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I replaced the heads, it worked out well for me.</li>
            <li> could have asked for a better replacement for my razor.</li>
            <li> It pays to change the blades every so ofter for a better shave.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery, as advertised; completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Item satisfied my needs.</li>
            <li> we all love.  </li>
            <li> and I am enjoying</li>
            <li> more words required.....good buy, but now Michigan is calling for sales tax to be TAKEN from us.......</li>
            <li> I guess that is why they sell more electric shavers than anyone else.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This was even after trying them for a couple of weeks to make sure my face got used to them.  </li>
            <li> great replacement, you can really tell the difference.</li>
            <li> fast shipping,works great.</li>
            <li> more could we ask for</li>
            <li> It replaces the razor heads and gets a much better and closer shaves.  </li>
            <li> Usually it&#x27;s more like 2 years as in my case.  </li>
            <li> I am totally satisfied with the product, but I wouldn&#x27;t say I &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; it.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with these replacement heads, made in The Netherlands.</li>
            <li> and there are many, MANY people who should and do need to svave</li>
            <li> second time buying the replacement heads from here - best price found, came as shown and working well since replaced</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably invest in a better shaver soon instead.</li>
            <li> but I do get a better shave after the change.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a better closer shave.</li>
            <li> It might take a couple of minutes now to reach that stage where no trace of facial hair can be felt, which is longer time than it used to, but still awesome.</li>
            <li> It works for the most part, but if I put pressure on the heads when I shave it starts rattling and skipping.  </li>
            <li> Having blades set up for automatic periodic shipping is great to remind you that you need to change them on some regular basis to continue to get good results from your shaver.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li> Able to get more use from it, rather than disposable.</li>
            <li> love this razor head -</li>
            <li> This did the trick:)</li>
            <li> Just make sure you get the correct Product number on the Blades.  </li>
            <li> On the plus side, I&#x27;m glad to have sharper blades in my electric razor again.  </li>
            <li> better shave than non-Norelco products.</li>
            <li> are the fastest and closest and, of course, the most costly.  </li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> I am sure he must be taking the routine cleaning care as well.</li>
            <li> I am sure these will to.  </li>
            <li> OK  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; article.</li>
            <li> Glad I found this one on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Glad to have them, pleased with the brand and the quality. :)</li>
            <li> why do I have do write so many words</li>
            <li> Could have been better with clearer instructions.</li>
            <li> I am glad I tried this,</li>
            <li> What more can I say?  </li>
            <li> so I purchased the replacement heads and am pleased with them/</li>
            <li> I replace them as required, but I&#x27;m beginning to think it&#x27;s all a hype to sell more heads.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed at how much better they worked then</li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> , the better it would get those stray hairs.</li>
            <li> The difference was stunning.  </li>
            <li> These are excellent quality and simple to install once you get them off the plastic shipping card.  </li>
            <li> good fit,  nice to get fresh blades for  a close shave</li>
            <li> Its okay.</li>
            <li> You sure don&#x27;t get what you see in the picture.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product Philips.</li>
            <li> Outstanding price on these heads.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> I will add that I appreciate being able to order parts from home and not spend gas money going to stores that may or may not have what I need.</li>
            <li> Just make sure the cutters and heads stay together as they are matched pairs.</li>
            <li> It was OK but the one replacement blades</li>
            <li> I expect better from a Phillips Norelco product.</li>
            <li> Nobody does it better.</li>
            <li> These are my husbands favorite shaver heads, I buy for him all the time.</li>
            <li> It works better than stated by the Phillips people.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (replace the blades) more often?</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great experience.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t expect anything more :)</li>
            <li> To get the best shave it is essential to change blades every year (or sooner).  </li>
            <li> so I tried replacing them and was well pleased.</li>
            <li> That was before they started manufacturing many of the models in China.</li>
            <li> I read the item description many, many times, trying to make sure it was the correct blade replacement for my shaver model.</li>
            <li> The blades are ok, but using the shaver can be a pain in the butt.  </li>
            <li> , what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> Way closer shave, feel more manly, can shave after a shower, and it is cheaper.</li>
            <li> He says they are better than the ones that came with his razor when it was purchased.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I was able to find these on amazon .</li>
            <li> These are placement heads which do what they should do - cut better than the worn heads that were replaced.</li>
            <li> She told me no because she did just that two years ago, and it was still working OK.  </li>
            <li> I will buy them again in another year or so. :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> As with most of the replacement heads, you begin to see a decrease in quality after about six weeks to two months.  </li>
            <li> For the price you pay for replacement heads, I feel the quality should be better.</li>
            <li> Well pleased.</li>
            <li> Work better than the ones that came installed on it.</li>
            <li> I am glad I used them.</li>
            <li> Better price that CVS.</li>
            <li> pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> My husband is satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Probably cost more than they should.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The razor works better now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> hopefully my dad would love it.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.  </li>
            <li> I was satisfied with the replacement.  </li>
            <li> Like several others, I was enticed by the excellent price.</li>
            <li> albeit this is a supposed reputable company in the Netherlands.  </li>
            <li> Better than stock blades.</li>
            <li> But these worked ok.</li>
            <li> So glad I found them and did not need to get the item for the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> It was ok.</li>
            <li> Great blades fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> Made my razor work better</li>
            <li> Great price and fast delivery - just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This replacement was the perfect upgrade to my shaver to get it back to tip top</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s actualy more than $25.</li>
            <li> I top reviewer claims these are fakes, perhaps his were, not the ones I received</li>
            <li> you cant ask any more than that.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> Have thru the years, made this replacement about every year, and have always been satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love the cost savings.</li>
            <li> bought online to get better price than through a box store.  </li>
            <li> Just Okay.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with the replacement head for my shaver because it works great and was offered at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> and some might do so more often.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with Norelco razor Heads</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had to replace the heads in my shaver more than once a year.</li>
            <li> and how it shaves much better</li>
            <li> Price is okay.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They said that they need 7 more words, so now I have them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried most department stores (target, walmart, etc.)</li>
            <li> Works ok.</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was astonished at how much better the razor worked with the hew heads.  </li>
            <li> My lesson is that the heads should probably be changed more often -- perhaps every six months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Better than the heads that came with shaver, they made an improvement .</li>
            <li> Shaving is quicker, and my skin feels better afterwards.  </li>
            <li> and you shave it more often</li>
            <li> I worked with them on a shipping issue and they sincerely wanted me to be a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I made sure that these would work for my model and purchased them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know for sure, but I suspect that that is the reason they did not work well -</li>
            <li> so I got a replacement, and was more careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING NORELCO PRODUCTS FOR MANY YEARS</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m now getting a better deeper shave.</li>
            <li> These are replacement blades… What more can I say?</li>
            <li> I did many years ago: fill my wallet with rubber condoms.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product</li>
            <li> that they are OK.</li>
            <li> Worthwhile replacement.  </li>
            <li> Quality seems to be ok.</li>
            <li> OK, I don&#x27;t buy the 12 month guideline for replacing heads unless you&#x27;re Grizzly Adams and grow brillo pad for hair.  </li>
            <li> We are fully satisfied with the Phillips Norelco replacement blades.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> Glad to find this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I got the product on time, it was the product i was expecting , nice, original, very cheap...</li>
            <li> Very happy with these - arrived quickly and inexpensively and fit my model exactly.</li>
            <li> Great price, and fit right in.</li>
            <li> Fit just right and work great</li>
            <li> but if you have reasonably good eyes and are patient you can see when it is right</li>
            <li> Amazing how much better these work than even the original heads did.</li>
            <li> These replacements are very easy to install and do a fine job of restoring a close shave.  </li>
            <li> Great cut, lasted very well and were easily able to clean!</li>
            <li> Good clean smooth shave, and I&#x27;m african-american.</li>
            <li> nice to be able to replace the heads instead of purchasing a whole new razor, shipping is all ways awesome</li>
            <li> shaving heads cut great and were an exact fit</li>
            <li> He said he is once again getting a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li> Worked great in my older razor .</li>
            <li> I now have a nice clean cut after shaving.</li>
            <li> I had an older Phillips Norelco model (discontinues about three years ago) that worked great for years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product at a decent price.</li>
            <li> Nice clean shave every time.  </li>
            <li> The heads do a great job and the battery still holds a long charge so it did turn out to be a good decision.</li>
            <li> Very easy to replace and made a huge difference in shaver performance.  </li>
            <li> The great bulk of reviews were on the high side</li>
            <li> Great value compared with ridiculously high price in Japan.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> works great when new,  but I can&#x27;t get more than 6 months out of them.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and easy to replace.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty excited after reading all of those great reviews.</li>
            <li> (Christmas orders from Amazon received excellent service, so I can&#x27;t understand the long delay here.)  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be as good as when bought the shaver in the first place.</li>
            <li> These are pretty good blades</li>
            <li> Pretty good price point compared to say Wal- Mart.</li>
            <li> All in All a pretty good set of replacement set of heads ..</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have had good replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Replacement fit the razor fine, but don&#x27;t seem as good as the original heads in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> Restored original performance of my razor!  </li>
            <li> The new blades work great on my triple header.  </li>
            <li> New shaving blades are great</li>

            <li> (60ml)]]to clean my razor, apparently it works better than anything else in preventing dullness of the razor, and its good for keeping your razor in good shape.</li>
            <li> great product well worth the wait delivery right on</li>

            <li> I was becoming acustomed to.  </li>
            <li> so we weren&#x27;t sure if these would fit</li>
            <li> I am using the first one as a replacement and I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> Looks OK, but since these are replacement heads that I do not yet need to replace on my electric shaver, I will not know if they actually fit until it comes time to replace.</li>
            <li> They do fit &amp; they&#x27;re actualy better than the stock heads on my 7310.</li>

            <li> Might be my imagination, but I think the original heads gave me a better shave.</li>
            <li> Forget it save your money,the original worked better.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m impressed that these blades last a whole year.  </li>
            <li> However it did require my old shaver to still have a good motor and battery.</li>
            <li> A good product to replace old units.</li>
            <li> The replacement razor heads are good and I used them in an old razor that I had.  </li>
            <li> So far working good.</li>

            <li> Good so far.</li>
            <li> Since there is no other alternative, I will continue using these replacement heads until I need to replace my shaver with a new one (probably not another Norelco, as they no longer get best reviews by Consumer Reports).</li>
            <li> The right product at the right price and with tiumely delivery what could be better!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re original heads and fit my AT814 razor just fine.</li>
            <li> The new blades installed and at first things were great.</li>
            <li> work like the original which is only good for about six month&#x27;s or more</li>

            <li> I followed the directions on the website to make sure I was getting the correct replacement razor heads, but something didn&#x27;t look right with the recommended heads.  </li>

            <li> Sure enough-she found and ordered the right one.  </li>
            <li> The heads seem to be made as well as the original ones were, so overall I&#x27;m quite happy with them.</li>
            <li> Far superior to original blades, made I china?</li>
            <li> ; if you want a really good shave you have to pay more to get better heads.&amp;#34; The product descriptions seem to suggest that every item is exactly like every otehr item ecept for some extra features (which I don&#x27;t need).</li>

            <li> but they don&#x27;t seem to cut as smoothly as the original.</li>

            <li> Quick and easy blade exchange</li>

            <li> He commented that the shave was more comfortable than when he first got his razor,</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and was easily installed.</li>
            <li> Nice purchase, decent price.</li>
            <li> Much improved after very easy change.</li>
            <li> They are very excllent and very easy to replace and use.</li>
            <li> you purchase these HQ8 dual precision replacement heads through the Amazon Subscribe and Save program and get 15% off when ordering 5 or more subscription items at one time like I do, you will spend just about $20.00 for one set of these replacement heads - a very reasonable price indeed for a</li>
            <li> The new replacement is great and provides a really close shave.</li>
            <li> But...three days after order i saw that you can buy a totally new Norelco razor for 3$ more which would be better.</li>
            <li> This Norelco HQ8 replacement head is awesome and did the trick, Now my razor shaves like new again, and now it takes two days for the beard to start showing back up again.</li>

            <li> Fast easy transaction..makes me a satisfied customer</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think they are original manufacturer blades.</li>
            <li> I had the original heads from 6 years ago.  </li>
            <li> so I kept the original ones rather than throwing them out</li>
            <li> Oh the difference fresh blades make!  </li>
            <li> the original shave head lasted 3 years, the replacement has worn out in 3 months</li>
            <li> No matter what stay with the original NORELCO brand.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> well worth it!</li>
            <li> Original part.</li>
            <li> the only problem was my own when i didn&#x27;t even know the model of shaver i owned!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to cut as close as the original blade.</li>
            <li> The original ones were stamped with &amp;#34;8-SERIES&amp;#34; and these are stamped with &amp;#34;Double-Precision&amp;#34;.]</li>
            <li> Paying $30 for replacement heads when the razor originally cost $40 is a bit steep.</li>
            <li> the original&#x27;s were sharper.</li>
            <li> I was pretty sure they should have worked with my Philips touchsensor device...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for two weeks, and hope it lasts one year as the original blades.</li>
            <li> While a bit pricey, they were easy to replace and after a short break in period, provide a good clean shave.</li>
            <li> Never disappointed.</li>
            <li> Seems like they changed them from the original.</li>
            <li> It is an original Norelco product.</li>
            <li> needs better instructions for first time user</li>
            <li> But his original blades did not have this nib.  </li>
            <li> The original razor lasted about a year.  </li>
            <li> These blades do not cut as well as the original.</li>
            <li> As usual Norelco provides the best electric shaver experience.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and working just fine.</li>
            <li> This is original manufacturer Philips product.</li>

            <li> It was just what we ordered, not to exciting of item, but was just what he needed for his razor!</li>
            <li> Been using original blades since receiving the razor 2yrs ago.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s from Norelco, then it ought to work as well as the original heads.  </li>
            <li> These are original Philips Norelco brand blades.</li>
            <li> I have a shaved head and this works perfect for me , no more cuts and scrapes , should have done this years ago</li>
            <li> These are replacement heads, assume they will work as well as the original.  </li>
            <li> However; they don&#x27;t sell the original heads.  </li>
            <li> Great Philips quality and long life.</li>
            <li> The shaver was originally purchased in 2003.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we needed and price is better than what I can get in store.</li>
            <li> Works  like original</li>
            <li> Restored shaver to original condition.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the cost!</li>
            <li> If there is any difference in these heads from the original</li>
            <li> My shaver now works like it did when I originally bought it.  </li>
            <li> I replaced my original stock razor heads after a year of use.</li>
            <li> The quality has dropped significantly or I keep getting lemons.</li>
            <li> then the original...</li>
            <li> I had been using the original blades in my razor for over three years.  </li>
            <li> looks like original</li>
            <li> Exact fit!  </li>
            <li> Just like the original</li>
            <li> replacement heads dropped right in and cut as good as new.</li>
            <li> Easy replacement and more cost effective than buying a whole new razor.</li>
            <li> very careful not to separate the movable cutters from their stationary housing, as they are carefully ground together for a perfect fit - and a good clean cut.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I replaced the original saving heads and blades on my aquatech electric razor after the recommended 12 months and it gives a much closer more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Fits on my Norelco razor perfectly, restores a nice sharp cut to the razor, and saves me some money over buying at the local department store!  </li>
            <li> The producto is good altough it was not the same as the original, but fit well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing what NEW blades will do.</li>

            <li> forgot what a good shave you get with new heads&lt;br /&gt;gonna have to buy a new set more often&lt;</li>
            <li> It is nice to have a close shave again although I don&#x27;t understand why replacement blades cost 50% of what a new shaver would cost.</li>
            <li> Great to purchase new heads for such a great price - postponing complete razor purchase for yet another year.</li>
            <li> Good prices - doubly so with free ground-saver shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only a good deal if you don&#x27;t have to pay for shipping because shavers are so cheap these days</li>
            <li> These heads do not give as clean cut a shave as the orginal heads.</li>
            <li> They keep me clean shaven.</li>
            <li> I replaced the heads and viola, clean shaven again.</li>
            <li> but before doing so I decided to clean the heads.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly and brought my old razor back to life.  </li>
            <li> course I am glad Amazon offers a choice of both cheaper and more convenient than a trip to Warmart.</li>
            <li> got them quickly but the don&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li> I use the Norelco Spray Lubricant and kept them clean.</li>
            <li> Clean shave every time.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t give a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> Ther just blades they were sihipped quickly and fit my razor of course.</li>
            <li> i am now clean shaven.</li>
            <li> It takes longer the shave but is easier to clean</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m clean shaven again.</li>

            <li> I hope your experience is a more positive one.</li>
            <li> They certainly work a lot better than the original heads, which were probably worn out.</li>
            <li> Really good replacement kit, it is not expensive and your machine is new again.</li>
            <li> I have purchased shaver heads from Amazon in the past and have always been impressed by the quick service.</li>
            <li> Rather than buying a new razor we got new blades, it was an awesome purchase because it made the razor like new again!</li>
            <li> Exactly like the original!  </li>
            <li> Surprisingly, the new ones were not so much better than the old ones.</li>
            <li> Gives a very close shave, better than the original did.</li>
            <li> Their replacement heads are very easy to change and the new heads make a significant difference in closeness.  </li>
            <li> The replacement screens have a different pattern of holes that do not seem to be effective at catching hairs that lay at certain angles, something I did not notice with the original screens.</li>
            <li> The new heads made my shaver almost like new works great</li>
            <li> THE CUSTOMERS, SPECIALLY MEN, CAN GET IN,</li>
            <li> the item arrived in 2 days after my order with no expediting or special options.  </li>
            <li> Nothing too special.  </li>
            <li> I was worried they wouldn&#x27;t work for my Norelco 7825XL, since it wasn&#x27;t specially listed.</li>
            <li> Description was to follow to make sure I was receiving the right blades for the right razor.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re right, replace your heads every year!  </li>
            <li> The replacement blades for my Norelco razor are excellent, fit properly and provide an outstanding smooth shave in less time than those that were replaced after a year&#x27;s service.</li>
            <li> Once a year if your lucky, or replace original blades every eight months.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> These items arrived quickly and have lived up to the original equipment.  </li>
            <li> These blades were easy to install and were an exact replacement for my original blades.  </li>
            <li> Good clean shaves just like a whole brand new razor.</li>
            <li> great product value arrived promptly as expected</li>
            <li> These fit exactly and give a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Overall good product but a bit on the pricey side.</li>
            <li> Better price and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Function is good enough.  </li>
            <li> (Much cheaper and better for the environment than throwing out the razor again.)     </li>
            <li> These are cool and work well</li>
            <li> and i thought i would be able to snap the whole head out</li>
            <li> These blades last a good year or two.</li>
            <li> These are true Norelco brand and it shows.</li>
            <li> It seems I&#x27;m almost wearing the whiskers off, I go over them so many times and even then it&#x27;s nat a real close shave.</li>
            <li> Now I get my good razor back with all the bells.</li>
            <li> It is early yet, but blades are providing a nice shave&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> a real razor is better</li>
            <li> It beats replacing the whole razor for sure.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why you have to buy the whole head set when you used to be able to buy just the blades for a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li> Okay product but a bit too much &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; for my liking.</li>
            <li> Today, I shaved a full beard off in about 5 minutes with my Norelco razor.  </li>
            <li> I actually have not used these as I have boxed up the razor and put it on the shelf and returned to the good ole disposable razors.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sure thanks for a quickshipment</li>
            <li> These blades are a must for quick clean shaves with an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> My father love it, and the price is very competitive.</li>
            <li> When you want something good for a low price, do not click on the 1st picture that pops up.</li>
            <li> Wish that I had been able to fid the replacement blades much sooner</li>
            <li> But overall, this was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, the price with shipping was cheaper than I would have to pay at local stores.</li>
            <li> back to shaving with good blades.</li>
            <li> so I could use the full seat</li>
            <li> Good quality for a terrific price.</li>
            <li> We have used this razor for years, and I was thankful to find such a good price on  these blades.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much louder and more mechanical sounding than the stock heads that came on my shaver.</li>
            <li> (full head assemblies are $35 to $50)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i am very well satisfied with speedy service &amp; quality of replacement heads</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m getting quick, clean shaves again.</li>
            <li> makes a big difference and a good price</li>
            <li> Not bad stuff been using this brand for a while</li>
            <li> The new heads are very easy to install.</li>
            <li> I still like my old Norelco shaver, and it&#x27;s great to have options for new blades.</li>
            <li> replace the heads give a new life to your machine, slogan for Norelco for free 8-)</li>
            <li> I signed up for this to be sure that I will get new heads every 6 months for a price below the listed price and with shipping free.</li>
            <li> Good deal to replace the shaver heads instead of buying a whole new razor.  </li>
            <li> easy to swap in and out and seems to cut better than my 5 year old razor set.</li>
            <li> I only replaced my original heads because I damaged them during a cleaning, otherwise I think they would have had many more years of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fit was just right.  </li>
            <li> Pretty easy to replace.</li>
            <li> appears to be appropriatly priced, but more important they are available for replacement for the cheap enough price.</li>
            <li> One of the heads wore out quickly, perhaps because the fit wasn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li> They fit just fine and his razor is working very well.</li>
            <li> They were the exact replacement blades he needed; quickly sent to where he lives and my brother easily popped them in for Dad.</li>
            <li> Arrived very fast and worked fine.</li>
            <li> Fit great, packaging a little troublesome but well protected.</li>
            <li> They work great, never realized how wore out my other ones were till I put the news ones in.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I am happy and still using the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already noticed a great difference in the past couple days and hope it will be a great experience for my entire face!  </li>
            <li> and I can barely imagine a better product!</li>
            <li> great price, shipping time minimal!</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure I got a better shave from the old one than I have this one.</li>
            <li> Great to have sharp blades again.</li>
            <li> Great sharp razor heads.</li>
            <li> These are sharp and great.</li>
            <li> They seem to be better than the original ones when they were new.</li>
            <li> When replacing the blades, I realized that, although they look identical from the top, the new heads have about 50% fewer blades than the original heads did.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected, deliver was very prompt and price was very good, too.</li>
            <li> Purchase was very easy, product came in a short period of time and the price was right!!  </li>
            <li> to replace the blades on my husbands favorite razor than to buy a new one!</li>
            <li> I am always amazed at how much better I do with new heads!  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I forget to purchase the replacements in a timely manner, and I sure notice a difference in the shave once I do get the new ones!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad a did because after just popping out the old blades and putting in the new ones, I had a like new razor that shaves great.</li>
            <li> heads shave much closer and smoother than the original heads that came with my shaver!</li>
            <li> Great price, an exact match of original head and with little effort, was easy to install on head.</li>
            <li> The product was the solution I needed to make my shaver as good as new and a better price then I could find locally.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find these at a reasonable price instead of having to purchase a whole new razor.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with my \\&quot;Norelco Razor\\&quot; and would recommend its use by anyone interested in a comfortable clean shave.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price is the best around but even here the price of replacement heads is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Work fine, razor works as well as when I first bought it.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described and works just fine on my razor.</li>
            <li> The ones that came with the razor wore out somewhat quickly.  </li>
            <li> the razor heads arrived quickly and in excellent/new condition, just as advertised.  </li>
            <li> QUICK SHIPPING</li>
            <li> Excellent price considering the ones in the stores are about 50% more expensive.</li>
            <li> It got to me quickly and they work well.</li>
            <li> They got here so quickly too.</li>
            <li> Works adequately.</li>

            <li> and it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> The HQ8 shaver heads met all expectations and were shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and work well.</li>

            <li> Shipped quick.</li>
            <li> Oem heads arrived quickly and as described.</li>
            <li> I am lucky and do not have to replace my heads often</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied, but I will be buying myself a better razor eventually.</li>
            <li> and of course they were delivered quickly as the warehouse is in PA and so are we.  </li>
            <li> The problem with Norelco razors is that the blades wear out quickly.  </li>
            <li> and most do not carry products for older model shavers.  </li>
            <li> It came quickly.</li>
            <li> ... shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Years ago the heads lasted a couple years, now I&#x27;m lucky to get 4 months out of them.</li>
            <li> Received it quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like he has a NEW RAZOR!!!!  </li>
            <li> Nice and sharp, giving a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I have used Phillips shavers for years and have been highly been highly satisfied.</li>
            <li> And, perhaps more importantly, why is there no sincere effort made to effectively describe and differentiate between the available options?  </li>
            <li> Super sharp and gives me a very nice close shave</li>
            <li> My old shaver&#x27;s about two years old, but the motor runs fine and the batteries still hold a good charge.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to change the old heads to these and they leave my boyfriend&#x27;s skin as smooth as when he first got the razor.</li>
            <li> was not getting a very comfortable shave and was thinking of getting a new shaver.decided to try the refill blades and no longer need</li>
            <li> But if you clean the right way, you can chnage once a year.</li>
            <li> Replacing the originals as recommended after almost exactly one year, these made a huge improvement in the quality and feel of my shave.</li>
            <li> It is like they don&#x27;t fit my razor exactly.   </li>
            <li> but these gave a close, comfortable shave on first use.  </li>
            <li> ; I could not purchase this product locally and was very pleased to find it on the website.  </li>
            <li> Exact fit, which is what you want in a replacement.</li>
            <li> These were pretty cheap...</li>
            <li> Worked fine easily replaced the old blades on my wife&#x27;s razor!</li>
            <li> Shipped very fast!</li>
            <li> Shipped very fast!</li>
            <li> so this fit the bill exactly.  </li>
            <li> These replacement heads are an exact fit for the shaver.  </li>
            <li> I love my Norelco And will normally order a replacement head every year.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the replacement heads, I only wished I would have replaced them sooner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Apparently, vendor doesn&#x27;t have exact fit for my 7617x model.</li>
            <li> As long as I take my time and stretch my skin as instructed, I get a good shave.</li>
            <li> As long as it is made by Philips Norelco I didn&#x27;t worry about it not being good.</li>
            <li> As long as your razor and any rechargeable batteries are in good condition.</li>
            <li> He mentioned it took a long time to shave and it wasn&#x27;t doing a good job.</li>
            <li> I was about to give up on my Norelco, with these new blades it is as good as new.</li>
            <li> They are always in stock, always reasonably priced and super easy to install.</li>
            <li> Better than buying new razor.</li>
            <li> I think my shaver works better than it did when it was new with the replacement blades.</li>
            <li> you read the direction that come in the pack of three new blades you will understand better what i am saying .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The new heads work OK.  </li>
            <li> He says it shaves closer and works better than it did when it was new.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve had your shaver more than a year, you need these new blades.</li>
            <li> New blades make all the difference in the world and the price for these was outstanding.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pleased that I can extend the use of my Norelco, without purchasing a new one.</li>
            <li> So when the time comes I&#x27;ll buy another new one for sure.</li>
            <li> Much better shave with new cutters.</li>
            <li> Got them in a timely matter and for the price gotta love it need new replacement heads got them in a day</li>
            <li> Better than  buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> My husband enjoyed his shaves with the new blades.</li>
            <li> better than buying a new shaver</li>
            <li> It feels much better now with new blades.</li>
            <li> Still more convenient than a manual blade, the new heads have renewed  </li>
            <li> It sure makes a difference to put in new heads.  </li>
            <li> But if you replace every 6 or even every 9 months then the replacement head cost more than buying a new shaver.</li>
            <li> The new ones still hurt my face and leave some stubble, despite many passes.  </li>
            <li> Shaver works as new now :-)</li>
            <li> What a difference the new heads made in my favorite razor.  </li>
            <li> Love my new blades.</li>
            <li> Based on the performance of the replacement heads, it would be better to put the dollars towards a new razor.</li>
            <li> I have needed to buy new heads for my razor for more than six months, just kept forgetting to look around.</li>
            <li> So that no need to pay more for a new one.</li>
            <li> They do the job, but for about $15 more I think I&#x27;d rather just get a brand new razor.</li>
            <li> been using them for years with no complaints use to buy a new razor for a couple of bucks more than i paid for replacement blades.</li>
            <li> I am sure my husband will appreciate having new heads for his razor.  </li>
            <li> Beats buying Gillete Blades 4 pack @ $17.00, or more depends where you live.</li>
            <li> /&gt;All-in-all, I am pleased with the shave I get -- now that I have these new heads.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s better to buy these than a brand new razor every year.</li>
            <li> Blades cut so much better with new rotary blades..</li>
            <li> assume the housings are better [thinner] in the new ones too.</li>
            <li> good blades, fitted fine, very sharp.  </li>
            <li> His new heads were fine, but he did not understand what makes the &#x27;replace heads&#x27; light come on.</li>
            <li> If I could easily get a full refund, I&#x27;d do it right away, but I suspect it is too much busywork to get one.  </li>
            <li> Does not do that great on my neck area, but I just dry shave that with a razor to get the last hairs; it is still better than doing a full shave with a razor.</li>
            <li> This was a great buy , less money than discount department stores.</li>
            <li> Shaving time was back to normal , closeness was greatly improved,  </li>
            <li> Works great and cut my shaving time in half.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used them yet, however I&#x27;m sure they will be just as good as the originals as they always have in the past.</li>
            <li> This dealer is very prompt in shipping making this an easy online transaction.   </li>
            <li> Ordwering was easy and shipment was very prompt.</li>
            <li> The product fits the shaver very well and was easy to install.  </li>
            <li> they came fast, easy to install, they work like they are supposed to.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads were easy to replace and saved me so much time and money.</li>
            <li> and i would recommend them to others wanting a good dry shave</li>
            <li> It shipped fast, was affordable, and was easy to install.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping on this and worth it.</li>
            <li> The replacement parts are easy to put in but the product is just the razor circles, not the whole head.</li>
            <li> Size chart very functional and easy to you.</li>
            <li> Long lasting and do a wonderful job.</li>
            <li> If these last as long I will be very happy.</li>
            <li> but this one is better than brand new when I first got it!</li>
            <li> Gave my favorite old razor life!</li>
            <li> It is exactly like the original that came with the razor.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s now back to that close shave that is out of style but still his favorite!</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li> They are exact replacements for the original cutter heads.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as well as the original.</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s one way for the manufacturer to guarantee a higher profit!</li>
            <li> The price at Amazon was much better than I could find at a local store and as usual the service was superb.  </li>
            <li> The blades are great, I think, but with the new blades I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of razor rash especially in the area under my chin.</li>
            <li> Cost more than a new Philips razor and is worth it.</li>
            <li> So nice to have new blades for a much closer shave.</li>
            <li> but sure they will work fine...look easy to replace - same delivery as shown</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to forget how much faster shaving is when you have fresh heads in your razor after 6 months or a year, so in case you have forgotten...</li>
            <li> Easy drop-in fit to my 5 year old Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li> Fit &amp; installed easy as should a direct factory item</li>
            <li> was in stock, shipped quickly, fits my razor,&amp; the price was right.  </li>
            <li> The replacement HQ8 heads were new and original and  work fine.  </li>
            <li> I am only one week into my new shaving experience and so far I am greatly impressed.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the fine response to my request.</li>
            <li> Replacement was easy but the shaving result isn&#x27;t a whole lot better than the old heads.</li>
            <li> Although a real pain in the posterior to get aligned and installed correctly, the heads work just fine.</li>
            <li> These new heads cut better than the old worn heads, but not to such a great degree.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended and the shipping was quick with free super saver shipping from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great Replacement Heads - a little pricey but</li>
            <li> These added life to my Norelco -- good product -- highly recommended -- easy to remove the old heads and snap in the new heads (although directions could have been easier to read).</li>
            <li> I would change more often but the price is pretty high.</li>
            <li> Said they were super easy to install and was amazed how closely the new heads cut.</li>
            <li> THEY GIVE ME A SMOOTH SHAVE; OFF COURSE IT HELPS WHEN YOU DON&#x27;T HAVE MUCH BEARD;</li>
            <li> Work and fit really well</li>
            <li> Really close and smooth.</li>
            <li> My razor suggests replacements every year, to save your face I think about every six months for a fast comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Fast, cheap, and just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It would be helpful if there was a more accurate photograph of the parts that will actually be received.  </li>
            <li> Checked packaging very closely and appears to be genuine product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These fit and work very well.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price, free shipping.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s well worth spending for a replacement blade.</li>
            <li> Price was good and it was as expected</li>
            <li> Excellent product, but poor service from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li> This product is OK but even with blade replacement the razor does not work as well as my old Norelco Speed XL.</li>
            <li> I had a old 10yr triple header that did a much better and closer shave!!!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> If your razor is not cutting as it should its time you replace the blades.</li>
            <li> The pricing was worth it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> probably should have replaced them more frequently</li>
            <li> replacement blades worked great on a 7 year old shaver.... needed to add extra words for amazon to publish this</li>
            <li> I was surprised the shave was not even as good as with the old blades.  </li>
            <li> my great surprise, that was indeed the solution -- in one fell swoop, my shaves are back to what I was used to with my old Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They work as expected and shipped on time for a good price.</li>
            <li> They work a lot better than the year old (worn) ones.</li>
            <li> They work great and Much easier to install than I expected.</li>
            <li> This time I received the heads on a blank cardboard in a shrink wrap, no imprint of any kind.</li>
            <li> but they work far better then</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Back to getting a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> It is bearly better than the old worn out blades.  </li>
            <li> As good as expected.</li>
            <li> I figured it was worth a try, so I ordered this[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I definitely notice a closer, more comfortable shave after replacing the shaver heads.</li>
            <li> This item is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> My 1.5 yr old blades worked better.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, it works as expected.</li>
            <li> Worth the $20+.  </li>
            <li> Fit razor perfectly, and had trouble finding locally</li>
            <li> Had to re-install them before the blades did better than the old  ones.  </li>
            <li> Package offers trivia of how many trips to the moon your blades make yearly - as a reason to replace them.  </li>
            <li> Worth the investment.</li>
            <li> My razor was not cutting the way it should</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> gives a better shave than the old blades....</li>
            <li> /&gt;The old Norelco blades were much better</li>
            <li> Actually, my sister ordered these on our computor, but I did ask her, and she really liked them .</li>
            <li> have used Norelco shavers most of my adult life (I&#x27;m 62).</li>
            <li> Worth for price paid.</li>
            <li> value and worth while.</li>
            <li> Finally I can have a nice experience of shaving.</li>
            <li> For some reason, I keep expecting a cheap Philips razor to be able to shave my face, but I&#x27;ve had a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at 2PM every day for the last three years.  </li>
            <li> have always liked my Norelco and guys who see and hear it run, say it is so quiet</li>
            <li> Ahhhh, 2 years on the old blades and I&#x27;m in love.  </li>
            <li> Worth the price to extend life of razor.</li>
            <li> Replace your blades occasionally and you&#x27;ll still have a nice razor.</li>
            <li> Work much better than the old ones.</li>
            <li> As always, new shaver heads cut much better and are more comfortable by a long shot.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery and very reasonable price</li>
            <li> I have tried many other brands and heads, even older versions of the HQ8, but these new ones are by far the best.</li>
            <li> Great blades, easy to change out and last a long time.</li>
            <li> The shave is not as close as the original heads when they were new, however the shave was improved over the shave of the original heads when they were used for over a year.</li>
            <li> i have bought a norelco electric shaver and i was finally happy after trying a couple more, is just excellent, i felt lately that shaving was taking a little more than the usual, so i decided to get replacements</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the extra money for a clean shave; I was spending more on Gillette Mach3 cartridges every six months.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads for a relatively inexpensive Norelco razor do the job and are appropriate replacements for the original heads.</li>
            <li> I think my original electric razor cost $15 more than the regular price of these replacements.</li>
            <li> Came on time, actually a bit earlier, and package was really good!</li>
            <li> The first set dulled rather quickly (</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and was the exact replacement head for my shaver.</li>
            <li> Quick arrival of goods and exactly what was ordered.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve replaced the blades in my razor - I should get in the habit of doing that more often, as it definitely shaves much quicker and more evenly than before.</li>
            <li> My razor feels like new again with these, that simple, very smooth and maybe even better than new.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They were just barely noticeably sharper, but they do work and fit fine.</li>
            <li> Does a pretty clean shave for the first 6/7 months then the blade needs to be changed.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy replacement of old heads.  </li>
            <li> these work fine, but a bit high cost for me</li>
            <li> This site was easy to follow; I found the right model number easily and the price was low.</li>
            <li> The heads are very easy to replace and result in a much improved shave over the one-year old heads I was using.  </li>
            <li> Tha price is good compared to Wal-Mart and other retailers</li>
            <li> I had the original heads for a couple of years and they really needed changing.</li>
            <li> The heads is sharp and does a good job.</li>
            <li> I got it  fast  and is original Norelco.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not expecting \\&quot;blade close\\&quot;, but it isn&#x27;t even as good as some of my other electric razors over the years.  </li>
            <li> Do it with good lighting and not first thing in the morning when your eyes haven&#x27;t adjusted to the world.</li>
            <li> Good &amp; sharp.</li>
            <li> great fit and good cutting cheaper than a new razor.</li>
            <li> Dropped right in and works well.</li>
            <li> It arrived timely, was priced right, and I would buy again when needed.</li>

            <li> they work, they are decent price, they fit the razor .</li>

            <li> Very easy to install and made a big difference in the quality of shave.</li>
            <li> Return was easy, refund was prompt, but more attention to detail in the original listing would have saved everyone a little money and hassle.</li>
            <li> The new heads were much quieter and cut much better.</li>
            <li> Best advise get new blades at least once a year.</li>
            <li> It was so nice not to have to buy a complete new razor.</li>
            <li> The shaver could be a little more powerful to be more efficient.</li>

            <li> Good price, was exactly what was expected and shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not the high end of Norelco, and they&#x27;re not as good as a proper safety razor, but for your average electric razor they&#x27;re pretty good.</li>
            <li> back to a nice clean shave after the new heads were installed.</li>

            <li> It is rare to find a product that works exactly as it is meant to and exceeds your expectations for performance and longevity.</li>
            <li> AS USUAL, FAST DELIVERY, GOOD VALUE FOR PRICE!</li>
            <li> Replacement heads are not as good as the once came with the original, not sure why.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and give a good close shave just like when I first bought the razor.     </li>
            <li> Price was better than local stores and product is good quality, as expected.</li>
            <li> I ordered these new shaver heard for my Norelco shaver,they shipped fast and came earlier than expected they fit in the razor perfectly</li>
            <li> It fit fine but the shaving surface was different and took some getting used to.</li>
            <li> We were able to get the exact blades he needed and it&#x27;s like having a whole new razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These heads were the exact kind for my razor, just toss out the old ones, drop in the new ones and you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> Instructions to replace the blades are a little misleading but in overall you get an excellent product for the price!</li>
            <li> I acknowledge that is not the intended use case for these but after getting a decent amount of time out of the original blades</li>
            <li> These new ones are sharp and great.</li>
            <li> It was great to have new sharp blades.</li>
            <li> , I figured that until someone decides to make a shaver that is clearly better than the one I have now, why not just keep getting these replacement heads every other year until the motor dies, which could easily be 50 years from now.</li>

            <li> Like shaving with a brand new razor, I had forgotten what a close comfortable shave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just buy a new cheap razor each year instead.</li>
            <li> The new blades have enabled me to get a smooth shave in a fraction of the time it used to take for a so-so result.</li>
            <li> Heads fit both my razors and work like new.</li>
            <li> Exactly the right replacement heads for my husband&#x27;s Norelco shaver.  </li>

            <li> The razor which I use now is one which is about four years old and still going strong.</li>
            <li> Like most users, after using an electric razor month after month, you just forget how old the blades really are.</li>
            <li> There 2 tiny angles that fit precisely into the housing.  </li>

            <li> Very easy to remove old ones and install new ones.</li>
            <li> These are very easy to replace and make your old machine new again.</li>

            <li> Works fine, same as the original that came with the shaver.</li>

            <li> oh well I&#x27;ll know next time to keep a better watch on time of use.</li>
            <li> First shave today with the replacement blades from Amazon.</li>
            <li> They are marked as Phillips Norelco and their appearance would indicate that they are genuine.</li>
            <li> thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Exactly what my husband was looking for</li>
            <li> If you need HQ8 size replacement heads for your Norelco shaver, this is exactly what you want.</li>
            <li> However, if it works as the present heads do now, I am well satisfied.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found that they seems to actually shave better than the HQ9.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> They are doing exactly what they are suppose to do.</li>
            <li> Amazon is almost always my first stop for household goods.  </li>
            <li> Received as ordered &amp; will probably order more in the future!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t believe some ppl were trying to sell double packages for more than I could purchase 2 singles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As I use it, it took me 4-5 more passes to achieve the same quality of shave than the one that came with the shaver.</li>
            <li> Excelent product, fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Exact replacement blades.</li>
            <li> Exact match for my 7310XL model.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and works.</li>
            <li> So how do you &amp;#34;make sure&amp;#34; exactly?</li>
            <li> Works very well!</li>
            <li> Norelco offered a window of time to not only adjust to the product but also offer a refund if not fully satisfied.  </li>
            <li> my first time there was some irritation still on my neck area.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m hoping it will become much easier (in time!)  </li>
            <li> We should not need them more than once a year, but we can just pass on the first regular shipment in 6 mos.</li>
            <li> and saw that I should have been cleaning these heads once a month by removing, disassembling and running under hot water.</li>
            <li> First time I ever replaced shaving heads.</li>
            <li> The first time I purchased this product from Amazon</li>
            <li> These heads last about a year or more as advertised.</li>
            <li> Yeah, it would be nice if you could sharpen the existing blades, but that&#x27;s probably not very practical.</li>
            <li> That is just because he replaced the heads early before the light came on.</li>
            <li> My husband and father have the same shaver and use to love it.</li>
            <li> and I know they will not last more than 6 months - hence the 3 stars.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first electric, and I&#x27;ve had it a couple years.</li>
            <li> Machine works as it did the first day.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I ordered them from amazon.</li>
            <li> and I will be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> These were exactly what we were looking for.</li>
            <li> Thanks!  </li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m quite satisfied with the razor and the replacement blades.  </li>
            <li> I think we might need more of them in the future too as he loves his shaver.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I needed to replace the heads.  </li>
            <li> and I noticed the pattern on top of each of the heads is different.  </li>
            <li> For many years, i lived in darkness, everyone knows you need to change your razor blades regularly, but does EVERYONE know that electric shavers need replacement blades as well?</li>
            <li> Many of the current Lithium battery shavers seem to be dying within 2 years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It may not do as well as a razor, but none of the current crop do any better.  </li>
            <li> Well that&#x27;s exactly what I did and the razors work just like the day I received them.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately not so.</li>
            <li> to install and my first shave was as close as I&#x27;ve had since I first bought the razor.</li>
            <li> Purchased replacement blades many times and the result is always the same.  </li>
            <li> However, they clip in easily enough and the one I bought this for is pleased with them.</li>
            <li> This item was exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> That is exactly what these norelco blades and razors do for me.  </li>
            <li> Just thought you would be interested that I shaved with a blade razor</li>
            <li> It was my first time changing the heads (in 2 or 3 yrs of use)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, my husband doesn&#x27;t think it shaves close enough.</li>
            <li> My first Norelco I had for 22 years and it had self sharpening blades.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what is is.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> It seems fake replica with very cheap packing !!!</li>
            <li> Arrived exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the product, which I purchased as a replacement for my younger brother.</li>
            <li> Why are there so many different varieties of replacement heads?  </li>
            <li> Norelco can do a better job of servicing their present customers.  </li>
            <li> This is the exact replacement blade set for my razor.</li>
            <li> Shaves better than prior replacement.</li>
            <li> At this time I am not a 100% sure I set the heads up properly.</li>
            <li> Replacement was not difficult, providing you can see and understand the micro sized instruction drawings on the package.  </li>
            <li> I found out that these heads work better on my beard and do not snag like the ones with the inner blades and holes.</li>
            <li> We thought it would fit the old razor, but it did not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> FIRST</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and no excuses for stubble now!</li>
            <li> First electrical razor that my husband could use.</li>
            <li> This was simple to install and it works much better.  </li>
            <li> I searched with Google to find exact how-to directions.  </li>
            <li> The company says to replace them yearly and this is the first time he has done so.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are definitely of higher quality than the cheaper alternatives you find on ebay.</li>
            <li> The blades were exactly what I neded for my husbands stocking this Christmas.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> as to recomend product ,one must first owne one .</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m only using 2 heads out of my series 8000 and get a better shave that I do with all 3 heads with this.</li>
            <li> My razor was a pretty old one, but the replacement heads were still available</li>
            <li> These heads seem to work pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Replacing the heads was pretty painless and I&#x27;ll probably get another pair when the ones I have wear out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely going to start replacing them more often now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels smoother and it trims the facial hair much better.</li>
            <li> Would buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> Might be better to but 2 or three sets next time.</li>
            <li> But fresh blades in this jobber really makes a difference.  </li>
            <li> This was my first replacement for my Philips Norelco .  </li>
            <li> Exact factory replacement at the exact factory replacement costs.  </li>
            <li> I put the originals back after a month and found myself getting a better shave.  </li>
            <li> I have had my electric shaver for more than ten years and these heads were exeactly what I needed to continue achieving a close shave.  </li>
            <li> works as it should, thanks!</li>
            <li> Did not realize there were so many different blade types for the Norelco electric shavers</li>
            <li> product arrived promptly, and was exactly as advertized.</li>
            <li> just be sure that you know the model number of replacement heads that you need--a mistake I made with my initial order.</li>
            <li> Fortunately Amazon now offers a program to send the item each time interval, up to 6 months, that you specify.  </li>
            <li> Even though the HQ9 had more rings, the blades were tiny and I always finished shaving faster when I used</li>
            <li> THEY WERE EXACTLY WHAT WE NEEDED.  </li>
            <li> Never failed me.  </li>
            <li> These heads are a exact drip-in replacement as advertised for</li>
            <li> these are only the inner circle inserts not the whole outer plastic piece... works great</li>
            <li> Works very well!</li>
            <li> first I could not find these on Amazon  </li>
            <li> This is my first time getting them online</li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth I think Norelco really messed up when they went to this style of head with the holes and slots instead of just the slots.</li>
            <li> I have been an extremely satisfied customer annually purchasing this specific model of Norelco replacement heads here on Amazon since 2011.</li>
            <li> product was exactly what was described.</li>
            <li> i use this unit to shave my whole head!  </li>
            <li> Fit my old razor.  </li>
            <li> I have a pretty &amp;#34;tough&amp;#34; beard growth, so I change the blades every 6 - 8 months.</li>
            <li> These heads are genuine Norelco heads and are a direct replacement.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more when needed.</li>
            <li> My razor heads were about a year old and not working as well, so I found these cheaply and gave &#x27;em a try.  </li>
            <li> That is exactly what these norelco blades and razors do for me.</li>
            <li> Buyer be aware.</li>
            <li> Annual replacement is what is needed for him, and I suspect for most men who shave daily.</li>
            <li> Worked and fit my old shaver</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I replaced the blades on my shaver.</li>
            <li> Exact replacement.  </li>
            <li> exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> I WOULD MOST LIKELY PURCHASE THEM AGAIN WHEN NEEDED.</li>
            <li> Better price than local stores for me.  </li>
            <li> I know better next time.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Should of looked here first...</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t fit my old Philips Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li> I am SO glad I finally did!</li>
            <li> Replace your shaving heads regularly, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> It is the exact head that PT730 uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several sets over the years and all have been top quality.  </li>
            <li> I dropped the three heads in the sink, when I first took apart the shaver head,   </li>
            <li> but this better last longer then 2 years.</li>
            <li> last more than the one year</li>
            <li> Maybe the electric razor will die first.  </li>
            <li> I have trouble finding the type I need at stores, and good luck calling ahead to see if they have them.  </li>
            <li> While alright for everyday use it still is not as good as a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; razor shave.  </li>
            <li> The new razor performed better than the old one.</li>
            <li> They also seem to work a bit differint too, I am guess they are simply the new updated kind.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give an accurate account of how they compare to the new razor heads but, for now they are a reasonable improvement that didn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li> If your blades are more than a year old or you notice that your shave is not as close as it once was, getting a set of these new blades may make the difference.  </li>
            <li> The new blades didn&#x27;t cut any better than the old ones.  </li>
            <li> Each year when I replace the used heads I am surprised by the difference new heads can make: smooth, close shaves!</li>
            <li> If you own a Norelco shaver, buy the replacement blades, they are simple to install and cheaper than buying a new shaver.</li>
            <li> My old stock heads which had been used for 2 years work much better than those new ones.</li>
            <li> Replaced my old blade head, new one doesn&#x27;t cut much better.</li>
            <li> my old blades shaved better than the new ones</li>
            <li> I then taught high shool for 13 years and was able to keep clean shaven every day as long as I replaced the heads every 6-9 months.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric razor for nearly 5 yrs!!!!</li>
            <li> I got a clean shave for the first four or five months, then the shaver started to leave stubble and individual whiskers more frequently as the days went by.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads worked fine but worked noticeably better at first than after a few shaves.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money after your original heads get dull, especially if you want a good clean shave.  </li>
            <li> Clean and close shave and no irritation as I have pretty sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> But, is it just me or is Norelco outsourcing stuff and it all and all, seems a little more cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Appears to make razor operate more smoothly with little effort.</li>
            <li> Nice to have a sharp razor</li>
            <li> nice and sharp</li>
            <li> Nice to have a sharp razor again.</li>
            <li> old heads were original ones.</li>
            <li> This product did a fair job of shaving, but have to consistently go over, often several times, curing areas around upper chin to get all the stubble.  </li>
            <li> Nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> I used my original blades for a couple of years, and thought a brand new set would be much sharper.</li>
            <li> It feel so good to get new sharp blades, makes quite a bit of difference.</li>
            <li> they actually look alike), because they are run-in to fit their own sockets, (don&#x27;t mix them up later when spring-cleaning), I removed the blades carefully to examine them, and after applying a very light coat of 4-In-1 sewing machine oil to each blade-unit, I reinserted the 3 blades and ran the razor.</li>
            <li> Either my beard is getting tougher or the blades get dull earlier, but these are the best i have found.</li>
            <li> Mine was dull and this was the best price I could find for the same thing.</li>
            <li> Should have replaced these sooner, smooth clean shave with new blades, although a little overpriced for what you get, but a good purchase overall</li>
            <li> The new heads were easy to install and it now works like new.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly and the product was new as advertised.</li>
            <li> Even when new, the replacement heads don&#x27;t seem to cut as quickly nor as closely as the heads that came with the shaver when I purchased it.</li>
            <li> The improvement in shaving performance was tremendous - almost beyond the performance of the brand new shaver.</li>
            <li> the new head doesn&#x27;t work much better than my old one that really didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> Good quality heads made my old razor just like new at only a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Service was great, The new blades were easy to install and were so quite and smooth on my face that I thought it wasn&#x27;t running or cutting.</li>
            <li> arrived in a few days...quite timely and it took me about a minute to switch them out with the old ones...very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> This replacement head for my electric razor is a good one, although I have to go over the same area on my face several times to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li> I had been simply opening the top and cleaning that cavity with a brush once a week or so and didn&#x27;t consider taking the whole thing apart.</li>
            <li> Good deal overall and definitely needed once or twice a year with Norelcos.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are much cheaper than buying a year&#x27;s worth of replacement blades, and perform very well.</li>
            <li> Rather difficult to install but once accomplished works great!</li>
            <li> The picture shows the whole top of the shaver but the package only contains the shaving heads.</li>
            <li> is good but not awesome to my shave because with 3 days is pain to do it and require to many passages that irritate my skin</li>
            <li> The last set gave a lot of good service but seemed to have finally lost their sharpness.  </li>
            <li> The blades and combs were very easy to change out and brought my razor back to new condition.</li>
            <li> Thanks very much.  </li>
            <li> Maybe not needed every year, but worth it even at the {high} price.</li>
            <li> The best part is they offer your money back, if not satisfied!  </li>
            <li> Looking closely, I realized that many of the new product photos illustrated labels indicating HQ9, HQ8 or some other blade number which, I assume, fit.</li>
            <li> both my Netherlands model and china model blades wear out pretty quickly and completely.</li>
            <li> Not only is the Norelco Spectra awesome, everytime we replace the blades (he has very coarse facial hair, so he must replace them after 9 months), it&#x27;s like having a brand new shaver.</li>
            <li> I think the razor may be slowing down some making it a less than perfect shave.</li>
            <li> New blades did the trick of leaving a smooth clean shave that makes shave time very brief.  </li>
            <li> more difficult to install than I expected, but once I got that job done the performance has been excellent.</li>
            <li> Price was much lower than offered in retail stores and it was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> He checked they look real, they have the stickers and printing like the real deal!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happie,r&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s shaving so much better and faster, don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to order&lt;br /&gt;the heads.  </li>
            <li> When I first saw this I got the impression it was the whole head.</li>
            <li> they are just exactly what fits with the norelco I have and they are much cheaper through amazon.  </li>
            <li> she loves it thus mission accomplished ;)</li>
            <li> /&gt;just tried them once with the AT810 Philips shaver - and was pretty much disappointed&lt;</li>
            <li> Really enjoy being able to wash the head with warm water when they are dirty</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and is the exact replacement for the shaver</li>
            <li> They are exactly what I wanted and they came fast.</li>
            <li> BUT the first item on my HOME list-shave with an electric razor (to avoid nicks with a straight razor)  </li>
            <li> Does a noticeably better, quicker job than my original blades from a few years ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good enough for everyday, but for important occasions I&#x27;ll be using a blade again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quality of the heads no more than just good (material, sharpness).&lt;br /</li>
            <li> these new, shaver feels like new again with smooth cuts.  </li>
            <li> It was so easy to  replace the old heads of my husband&#x27;s Norelco shaver with new heads.  </li>
            <li> Easy to install new blades, after removing old ones.  </li>
            <li> work great with my razor... had to do a bit of research due to the large amount of options for different models</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly / cut like new if not better /  simple to change</li>
            <li> I did not have good luck with the first set, it seem to be dull.</li>
            <li> This can not be the original replacement head; since it barely works!</li>
            <li> Got my shaqver back to full throttle!</li>
            <li> Like I got a brand new razor, definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> It will take a couple of shaves for the new blades to get set in place, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Fresh blades keep it working like new.</li>
            <li> Easy to order and received in a short amount  of time.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads are easy enough to install.</li>
            <li> Hair comes off MUCH easier and the surface is much smoother (for much longer!)</li>
            <li> Iv&#x27;e been using them for a more than 5  years with the 8883XL Norelco dry shaver , they work well .&lt;br</li>
            <li> Installation was easy, and I was back up and shaving in no time.</li>
            <li> But I really like this razor (the Philips Norelco 7310), because you can rinse it out, and the cost of these replacement heads was pretty reasonable (about $22 US), so I bought them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They shave nicely, but it shows the quality of the previous ones.</li>
            <li> Easy enough to change out the shaver heads.</li>
            <li> to fit into the housing, and as sharp as the original blades.</li>
            <li> But hey, I can get a dry shave done in about 30 seconds in the morning, so if you&#x27;re more concerned with speed, frugality, and convenience than you are with the quality of your shave, then by all means, buy these replacement blades.  </li>
            <li> Simple and easy to replace.</li>
            <li> Time will tell if they last and continue with good shaves as long as the originals did.</li>
            <li> They last a good long time for me too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had problems with them and frankly the main reason for not using the same razor for the whole time is that I have wanted the \\&quot;upgrades\\&quot; available in newer razors after a few years either more battery life or newer shaving head, such as the Spectra which is superior to the older styles.  </li>
            <li> My shavers is ten years old and with the new heads it shaves as good as new.  </li>
            <li> I certainly recommend this from now on</li>
            <li> However, considering my razor was $35 by itself, it is certainly pricey for replacement heads to be 1/3 of that price.</li>
            <li> Just like having a new razor!!</li>
            <li> It may as well be new again!!</li>
            <li> I suppose lots of folks just replace the whole unit, but I&#x27;m just cheap enough to try head replacement first.</li>
            <li> was very small and compact, which was nice!</li>
            <li> they are great, work like a charm to make your &#x27;old&#x27; heads last 3-4x longer as long as you take care of them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:  At this point about 15 months later, heads are still ok, but do occasionally PULL on the hairs if it starts getting full, probably will replace these soon.</li>
            <li> Even if they were not transferable, I would still have had a razor with new blades, albeit a more basic model.</li>
            <li> this is just 3 new blades and 3 heads, not the entire top unit like the picture suggests.</li>
            <li> I was very happy to find these replacement heads in bulk because the heads are almost as expensive as buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> After i replaced this new head, it totally worked better.  </li>
            <li> These are the recommended replacement heads for the $35 shaver I&#x27;m currently using, and they do a substantially better job than the heads that came with this shaver when it was new.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cost as much as buying a new electric razor; so it was worth the replacement fee.</li>
            <li> These replacement shaver heads are a better value than buying an entire new razor.</li>
            <li> The advertised picture shows a total new razor top containing the blades, but what you receive are three blades with their head covers sealed in a plastic box.</li>
            <li> I have found that the shaving blades that come with a new shaver always seem to work better, and last longer than the blades you buy to replace them.</li>
            <li> Seems a waste to have to throw away perfectly good new screens.  </li>
            <li> and they are super sharp, better than when the razor was new.</li>
            <li> Great for both wet and dry shaves.</li>
            <li> Got this for my pouting husband when we realized we couldn&#x27;t afford a new shaver right now.  </li>
            <li> as long as your legs are smooth and soft who cares if it is a pink shaver or a good shaver like this one is.</li>
            <li> This is not Replacement Heads ( what is suggest picture on it ) , but only some parts of the head and in my opinion better to buy new whole razor.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers for many years and for the first two weeks it was extremely close.</li>
            <li> These work fine, but overpriced and short life span.</li>
            <li> However, once seated properly, the replacement heads worked fine.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads are exactly the same as the original.</li>
            <li> I actually have it for another Philips shaver that is not on the list, and it works fine.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re working fine and assume they will continue to for the next year.</li>
            <li> Amazon has a pretty decent price on the heads.  </li>
            <li> Norelco replacement blade are pretty decent.</li>
            <li> Makes the older razor work like a dream!</li>
            <li> Mine were much older than that!</li>
            <li> The price is the main reason I bought it!</li>
            <li> HERE AGAIN, ONE REPLACEMENT PART IS VERY HIGH, BUT THIS IS WHERE THEY MAKE THEIR MONEY.  </li>
            <li> Easy to order and shipping was right on time, just what I expected.</li>
            <li> I double checked to make sure I ordered the right ones and the new ones seem duller than the old ones I replaced.</li>
            <li> They cost a little more but are worth it for durability and longevity IMVHO.</li>
            <li> time I have to be more careful on ordering such a fine item...</li>
            <li> Best price available, and they seem to last a long time, especially with the Norelco spray lubricant (See my other reviews).</li>
            <li> I used the original parts from my old razor and inserted  the new blades.  </li>
            <li> Works great, did not know how dull my old blades were.</li>
            <li> Blades work better than it was, installed these after 3 years, works good, but not as sharp as when razor was new, must be using different materials maybe Chinese ?</li>
            <li> Excellent-very easy to Install---my Norelco was 5 years old and with these new Heads it cuts like it did when it was brand new</li>
            <li> my old header broke a few weeks ago, I had a older model, this new header has greatly improved my shaving experience.</li>
            <li> An additional service that I really like is that Norelco will send me my next replacement heads at precisely the time that these heads should be wearing out.  </li>
            <li> Be careful to buying this item, and make sure it is what you are really looking for.</li>
            <li> The price was was a real saver compared to retail.</li>
            <li> , Thanks  and  </li>
            <li> I thought i would get a much closer shave.</li>
            <li> AS Said Thanks</li>
            <li> These heads work really well</li>
            <li> They were very understanding, when I requested to return the item, and agreed for me to return of the item.</li>
            <li> Fast</li>
            <li> I have my Norelco shaver for about ten years and replacing the head from time to time keeps giving you a smooth close shave.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Reasonable price</li>
            <li> however I can tell that his face isn&#x27;t getting as much razor burn.</li>
            <li> fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very noticable with my razor shaves faster.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> very good......sharp blades,and affordable</li>
            <li> so much for respect these days.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The replacement heads were really needed.  </li>
            <li> They came fast and were what was described.</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t notice much of a performance</li>
            <li> It performs in my razor very well.</li>
            <li> but you can really feel a difference.</li>
            <li> and perhaps that&#x27;s why the shave is that much closer.  </li>
            <li> price was reasonable and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> as described fast shipping</li>
            <li> You are spending a lot replacing the whole razor.</li>
            <li> Thanks Norelco.</li>
            <li> my husband really likes it.</li>
            <li> this razor was capable of performing.</li>
            <li> and they arrived fast.  </li>
            <li> Really like my Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li> I never realized how much longer it has been taking me to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> you have to really press them into your skin to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> Fast arrival.</li>
            <li> really wish they would write this in the description that these are just the blades and not the header.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I ordered the heads, I thought I was ordering the whole head assembly that contains the heads.  </li>
            <li> and he gets a really close cut.</li>
            <li> Now I won&#x27;t want to pitch a shaver just because the blades cost so much.</li>
            <li> Still use the blade when I want a really close shave.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Not as smooth as a regular razor, but no electric is.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> The heads fit and the shaver does work properly</li>
            <li> as these are the only ones that fit my shaver.  </li>
            <li> and they really did the trick.    </li>
            <li> Very Usefull.</li>
            <li> so I do not have to use a straight shaver.</li>
            <li> it very cheap,in China</li>
            <li> Fast shipping with Prime.....</li>
            <li> and it arrived in a very timely manner.  </li>
            <li> An electric is very convenient but still doesn&#x27;t give me a shave as close as I would like.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They were reasonably priced and made my razor shave very close</li>
            <li> i could get such a comfortable close shave.</li>
            <li> A much closer shave.</li>
            <li> The blades are very durable I shave as much as three times a week</li>
            <li> I was ready to throw it</li>
            <li> Hold up better than expected and we don&#x27;t have to replace them too often.</li>
            <li> and I guess the change in the shave quality was so gradual that I didn&#x27;t really notice</li>
            <li> Often I am on the go and the AT810 electric shaver with the HQ8505 heads work very well away from home.</li>
            <li> I really trust in Philips Norelco replacements heads.</li>
            <li> but otherwise I really like it as a quality product</li>
            <li> if it is not broken don&#x27;t try to fix it.&lt;br /&gt;one</li>
            <li> Item as described fast shipping</li>
            <li> They have worked very well and it was somethink I needed to do sooner.</li>
            <li> Blades work very well.</li>
            <li> Bought these replacement blades in the hopes that it would not take quite as much time and effort to shave my neck and face.  </li>
            <li> The price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li> Work very well.  </li>
            <li> He said that it gives a very close shave and he loves it.</li>
            <li> Nothing much else needs to be said.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave in only a couple passes.</li>
            <li> Proper fit and working well.  </li>
            <li> I really cannot say that I could tell the difference though.  </li>
            <li> My face says thanks every day.</li>
            <li> This product work very well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much to say on this product, as it is OEM and a must buy for whom using a razor.</li>
            <li> Frankly all of the business models of razor is the same as a printer: machine is cheap but profit from parts.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> Replacement heads don&#x27;t seem to  work very well.</li>
            <li> I have bought these before and they work very well in my cordless razor.</li>
            <li> That worked very well.  </li>
            <li> Changed the shaver blades in my Norelco Shaver but didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in the shave.  </li>
            <li> Much  faster and closer shave.</li>
            <li> The Phillips shaver he has is very convenient.  </li>
            <li> In any case, these are the real deal and work very well.</li>
            <li> online, and whoa--it worked really well.</li>
            <li> These shaving heads work very well</li>
            <li> much improved performance.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re razor head replacements, there isn&#x27;t much to tell.</li>
            <li> They only fit one way</li>
            <li> They really should replace the faulty one.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the bvest.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> I ready to order another set of heads just for spare.</li>
            <li> The users manual is very well written and very helpful.</li>
            <li> star for making the packaging look like it&#x27;s really from Norelco.  </li>
            <li> This set of heads shave much closer than the ones that came with the shaver, I try to buy from another source and these were much cheaper from Amazon</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like shaving with an electric razor but it is much handier so</li>
            <li> My husband really likes it.</li>
            <li> And, there are dozens of different heads available, so you need to know what your shopping for.</li>
            <li> like straight from&lt;br /&gt;the factory/</li>
            <li> I am really a cheapskate</li>
            <li> Close, fast shave, no skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was very unsatisfactory and now I have Three sets.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> a whole unit..</li>
            <li> so much for your help</li>
            <li> u were fast.</li>
            <li> thanks y&#x27;all.</li>
            <li> Just similar blades that fit.</li>
            <li> Reasonable in price also.</li>
            <li> There work really well.</li>
            <li> The wet shave seems to work better for me and my beard.  </li>
            <li> Not recommended for anyone seeking a non-electric manual blade shaving experience, but it does give a fast acceptable shave at home or for travel.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> These shaving heads give a very closer shave than the ones that came with my razor when I bought it.  </li>
            <li> This product is available in the local stores.  </li>
            <li> I got fast service and did not have to fight the Christmas crowds to get what the manufacturer recommends.  </li>
            <li> Put the heads on and shaved very well.</li>
            <li> Whole lot cheaper than blades.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping--</li>
            <li> I really like the product and the replacement of the blades</li>
            <li> Very satisfactory product.</li>
            <li> When I do find them, they are very pricy.</li>
            <li> I thought at the price that these heads might not be the real thing.  </li>
            <li> served me very well.</li>
            <li> Very helpful to find them without running all over town.</li>
            <li> They are much cheaper here than in any stores I have seen them in.</li>
            <li> They cut real close.  </li>
            <li> and he really likes them.  </li>
            <li> As requested, thanks.</li>
            <li> THANKS  </li>
            <li> Comfort is important when you use something like this on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Even though the add said these heads are for my specific Norelco, they don&#x27;t quite fit the way they are supposed to.  </li>
            <li> Not designed very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Nothing really to say or to compare.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not shave your hair very</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> But installation took &amp;#60;2 minutes and was very intuitive.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping to Australia.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too</li>
            <li> Really Like</li>
            <li> It takes me much longer time to shave with these.</li>
            <li> Thanks Norelco.</li>
            <li> Fast service.</li>
            <li> saves me so much time shaving ..</li>
            <li> Using a safety razor is much faster.</li>
            <li> Held up very well</li>
            <li> Shipped very fast!&lt;br /&gt;Thes</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> A label HQ8 means nothing if they are not the real thing.</li>
            <li> These shaving heads really work well.  </li>
            <li> thanks to amazon</li>
            <li> fast delivery</li>
            <li> /&gt;they arrived fast and they perform very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using these for 3 months and they are not giving me a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Very prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> Work very well.</li>
            <li> Vhard to find, very competivee pricing</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t judge you too much...</li>
            <li> If they didn&#x27;t cost so darn much</li>
            <li> I have even tried to resharpen them but it hasn&#x27;t worked out very well.</li>
            <li> They provide a much closer shave with no irritation.  </li>
            <li> They are working very well.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I received the fit my shaver correctly and they are cheaper than at a local store</li>
            <li> As a society we throw away too much stuff already.  </li>
            <li> fast shipping...</li>
            <li> I will try one more set, but if they don&#x27;t last more than a few months I will be looking for another brand of razor.</li>
            <li> the real deal.</li>
            <li> They fit, they work, the price was about the same as the store.</li>
            <li> Thanks you.</li>
            <li> They work really well</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than what I found on line at Walmart and Walgreens.</li>
            <li> They were simple to install and WOW this thing works so much better.</li>
            <li> If I went against the grain, naturally it would last longer, but would promote more irritation.  </li>
            <li> I use this razor everyday without irritation of any kind.  </li>
            <li> These definitely work better than my 5 year old razors I had.</li>
            <li> These blades cut only slightly better than 2 year old originals -- which are ripping my face they are so worn out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having to run the shaver over the same area two to three times more often and longer than with the old worn out blades I had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll buy another set in the near future.</li>
            <li> This high price would be worth it if they were equivalent to new blades --- but they are not even close.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They had pretty well worn down to nubs and pulled out more hair than they cut off.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware of how much a difference new blades made, until I got these.  </li>
            <li> I just helped to clear a &amp;#34;Land-fill&amp;#34;!!!</li>
            <li> I thought I needed a new razor, but these brought my present one back to as good as new.  </li>
            <li> My other blades were dull and causing a rash, these are a GREAT improvement!</li>
            <li> The new blades were an exact replacement for the one that came with the shaver at a fraction of the price</li>
            <li> Why buy a new shaver when this simple replacement makes the shaver work better than new.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed to make my shaver perform as new.</li>
            <li> Exactly what my husband needed instead of buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> Quite a difference in closeness is evident with new blades.  </li>
            <li> This was the first replacement since purchasing the razor new (30 months</li>
            <li> These replacement blades do exactly what they are supposed to: restore your razor to like new condition.</li>
            <li> so far I am nearly 3,000 shaves and 8 years with the original batteries).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I had saved my old blades, so I put them back in and got good long lasting shaves once again.</li>
            <li> He said they not only do a good job but his other ones&lt;br /&gt;lasted</li>
            <li> The unlock was easy, the old disks lifted right out, and the new ones could only be installed one way.</li>
            <li> The shaver heads work fine, however I had my concerns as when it arrived the outer box was pretty much crushed up.</li>
            <li> super smooth shaves that you will have to do less of.</li>
            <li> Since these replacement heads came from the same folks that made my electric razor they fit exactly as the old ones did.  </li>
            <li> Like so many other things, found it on Amazon and delivery was made in time.  </li>
            <li> Product replacement works well, not the same blades that originally came with my razor</li>
            <li> Norelco charged a premium price for a replacement head, more, in fact, than the cost of some of its other razors.</li>
            <li> Now it is back to original performance.  </li>
            <li> Because of the age of my shaver, I had to use the original casings to allow the heads to work properly.  </li>
            <li> The original heads are just now starting to go (9 months each set).  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I found this through all the other reviews.</li>
            <li> Always stick with original heads that work properly.</li>
            <li> They are same as original - not used as yet</li>
            <li> Repalcement Head arrived two days earlier than originally scheduled.</li>
            <li> Philips Noreclo reccomends changing annually, i&#x27;m more towards the 6 month plan to keep them sharp.</li>
            <li> The after market product doesn&#x27;t provide the same quality shave as the original equipment.</li>
            <li> now for these shavers are different from the original one which was a&amp;#34; lift and cut&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;one.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I have no independent knowledge of the efficacy of this product, although these are the Norelco brand replacement, my husband says they don&#x27;t give as close a shave as the original contained in the razor when purchased.</li>
            <li> Extreme difference for the better in my razor.</li>
            <li> Heads a different design than the original.  </li>
            <li> The original cutters on the shaver had 15 blades and the replacement cutter only has 9 blades.  </li>
            <li> Only a replacement part, made to do what it was originally designed for, just sharpener from what I perviously had.</li>
            <li> My razor is back to it&#x27;s original quality shave.</li>
            <li> Sharp and cuts better and faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The design of the overall razor is not user friendly as to head replacement.</li>
            <li> They worked fine at first but got dull a lot quicker than the original blades that came with</li>
            <li> At arrival I only found one set of 3 blades inside original carton.</li>
            <li> He says his shave is smoother than with the original blades, and his razor actually seems to have increased battery life.</li>
            <li> Are the replacement heads the same as the original heads?</li>
            <li> The product description is accurate enough and It is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> i think the right price/choice to just  get new heads instead of a  new razor.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s certainly much cheaper than buying a new one!</li>
            <li> well, guess what, these are much cheaper than getting a new razor!  </li>
            <li> Reasonable price and shipping cost - delivery was on time as well!&lt;br /&gt;Thankful to find you selling them since my husband refuses to buy a new razor!</li>
            <li> Great cutting and smooth finish after getting these new blades.</li>
            <li> They restored the cutting action to good as new and the razor once again shaves clean and smooth as it should.</li>
            <li> Be aware that there is a kind of a pointy nib (at least on the ones I purchased here for my husband&#x27;s razor).</li>
            <li> Now, back to a clean shave again.</li>
            <li> but you only change them out once a year if you keep them clean.</li>
            <li> btw... take the time to properly &amp; thoroughly disassemble and clean the heads, etc and all areas of the razor</li>
            <li> A clean shave is now possible again.  </li>
            <li> Work fine as long as I use the grocery store cleaner and lubricant</li>
            <li> I discovered that if I simply use a very light touch and not press hard then it got those hairs much better and with no redness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They appear to be of high quality and give a really close shave.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t as advanced as some new shavers because it only has 1 outer ring of holes.</li>
            <li> After being in the hospital for 5 days due to a blood clot in my right lung I was excited to go home.  </li>
            <li> I sure didn&#x27;t know previously how much money could be saved by purchasing items on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> You can certainly tell when you need new heads, shaves are slower and not4 close at all...</li>
            <li> at a certain point, it pays to just buy a new razor.</li>
            <li> They were a bit hard to put in, but in the end fit fine.  </li>
            <li> I bought these to fit Norelco razors which I have had for a long time.</li>
            <li> When I took out the old ones I noticed they were pretty gunked up</li>
            <li> I bought the set of two and the first set so far</li>
            <li> Year old head was still shaving pretty well.</li>
            <li> It used to die after every shave, even after a full charge, and now it stays charged for multiple shaves.</li>
            <li> If it is a question of a new razor or a new head this makes sense but either option is pretty pricey.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to replace 1 year old blades that were leaving my face with fine short stubs.  </li>
            <li> It works out fine and definitely is an improvement over my old heads.</li>
            <li> ago, I am sure they are keeping the cost down because when started shaving they were 15.00 dollars, which says alot...........</li>
            <li> Loved that they got my father&#x27;s old razor working again (sentimental value), but could&#x27;ve almost bought a new Norelco for the price.</li>
            <li> Full-featured (many superfluous or gimmicky) electric shavers with fancy housings costing $200.00 to $300.00 rarely provide a better shave and certainly not one that is sufficiently better to warrant the significantly higher expense of upgrading your entire electric shaver every few years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The replacement blades are sharp but I have found the replacement screens that come with the blades less effective than the original screens.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had them for a few months and still going strong!</li>
            <li> Shaver is like new now !</li>
            <li> And the razor works like new again!  </li>
            <li> I always make sure the device is compatible with these sharpeners before purchase, so I can always have sharp blades and never need to buy a new head.    </li>
            <li> This price also alleviated the &amp;#34;why not buy a new one&amp;#34; as the blades were cheaper than other alternatives.  </li>
            <li> It was like having a new razor!  </li>
            <li> Made my 5-year-old razor perform like new!</li>
            <li> and when I put the new ones in I was stunned!  </li>
            <li> to do - just like new!</li>
            <li> Changed out the heads in lieu of buying a new razor and WOWSAH!</li>
            <li> No need to buy a new razor!</li>
            <li> Made my shaver into a new one again!</li>
            <li> Who thought that changing the blades could make the razor function like brand new!</li>
            <li> Brand New Razor again!</li>
            <li> What a difference new blades work!  </li>
            <li> I feel like I just bought a new razor!  </li>
            <li> Works like new now!</li>
            <li> Just like a new razer!</li>
            <li> If they are not, like Amazon, I guess I&#x27;ll have to buy a new shaver!</li>
            <li> They made my husbands razor new again!</li>
            <li> Like a New Shaver again!</li>
            <li> I now question my second purchase of the original Norelco shaver that I bought as a gift for my new grandson-in-law.</li>
            <li> Same as the original ones in the razor, but new.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to make my razor new!</li>
            <li> Makes my razor head like new!</li>
            <li> Like many people I wait too long to replace them, thinking I&#x27;ll get a few more shaves from the old heads.</li>
            <li> I received the item and the parts wouldn,t fit my razer either the information is not plain enough from one model to another</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference with the new ones.  </li>
            <li> I was ready to buy a new razor for about the price of the blades, but Amazon had them cheaper than Walmart...</li>
            <li> much cheaper than buying a new razor as the heads are all that ever wears out.</li>
            <li> My husband hasn&#x27;t noticed too much of a difference with the new one</li>
            <li> So I replaced the heads...not really too difficult...and my shaver was working like new again.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads were a very affordable alternative to give my shaver new life.</li>
            <li> Way cheaper than a whole new shaver.</li>
            <li> The new heads work very well.</li>
            <li> Razor performance is much improved with new blades.  </li>
            <li> Shaving is sooooo much easier with new heads installed.  </li>
            <li> The new head gives a much close shave with fewer passes.</li>
            <li> It was much cheaper than buying a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Work very well, make shaver almost like new again.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than buying a whole new shaver.</li>
            <li> Really fast delivery and razor is like new.</li>
            <li> Never realized how much of a difference new blades would make.  </li>
            <li> The new ones run much quieter and ct quite well.</li>
            <li> The new heads really did improve the comfort level of shaving.  </li>
            <li> The new heads work really great!&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> new in box , fast delivery</li>
            <li> I considered buying a whole new razor.</li>
            <li> The new blades cut close and fast as advertised.  </li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave just like the new product.</li>
            <li> Made it so that my dad didn&#x27;t have to buy a whole new electric razor.</li>
            <li> I find it is much easier and cheaper to buy these blades than to buy a new razer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The new blades make it run so much quieter now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always woindered why it costs almost as much to replace the shaving head as it does for a new razor, but I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> The new head works very well.  </li>
            <li> After I received my order, I simply placed the new blades in my old razor head and realized I may have been able to buy an inexpensive Norelco and placed its blades in my old razor.</li>
            <li> so will be interesting to see how long these heads last or if shaver or battery die out first and make me get a new shaver.</li>
            <li> more nothing less</li>
            <li> Half the price and 100% more convenient than the store.</li>
            <li> They finally offered me a courtesy $10 credit on my next order, but prompt fulfillment of order would have been much better.</li>
            <li> 1 day after I ordered the the replacement heads for my older razor.</li>
            <li> However, as my razor is the older model.</li>
            <li> I used this to replace my older heads, so you would think the shave would have been smoother.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Fortunately I hadn&#x27;t disposed of an older model Norelco Shaver and when I checked and&lt;br</li>
            <li> It only takes about 5 minutes and most of that time is getting the package open.</li>
            <li> Decent price.</li>
            <li> Can use it again, especially for a quick &amp;#34;touch</li>
            <li> My razor is getting older</li>
            <li> I purchased the main item before.</li>
            <li> A shame that it couldn&#x27;t self sharpen for the price of the main trimmer.</li>
            <li> If you have an older Norelco that you just can&#x27;t part with like</li>
            <li> They make a world of difference to the shave and come at a decent price.</li>
            <li> good enough to get a close shave everyday for well for a year</li>
            <li> One tip - you can often get a lot more life out of your heads by carefully and completely cleaning your razor.</li>
            <li> I found online that the rash was really avoidable if I exfoliated my skin a couple of times a week to get rid of dead skin and bacteria, and exfoliating also gives you a much better shave.</li>
            <li> mostly tired of every thing made in china because they use cheap help and materials to put more americans out of work</li>
            <li> Fit my shaver as expected and price seems reasonable.</li>
            <li> I really love this shaver, and thought I was going to have to buy a &amp;#34;newer and better&amp;#34; and more expensive one.</li>
            <li> I keep an extra set on hand for quick replacement.</li>
            <li> I have two older Norelco shavers.  </li>
            <li> I suspect Philips Norelco cheapened the HQ8 percicely because they didn&#x27;t want their cheaper shavers working better than their more expensive products.</li>
            <li> I bought these as a replacement for some older blades I was using.</li>
            <li> Turns out, it&#x27;s pretty simple to replace the shaver heads if you look at the diagram first.  </li>
            <li> My husband has an older model</li>
            <li> I think there is a minimal sharpness loss, but my 2 year old blades still do the trick :)</li>
            <li> I clean the trimmings each night with hot water, but these blades still seem to dull rather quickly.  </li>
            <li> The blades work better than the old worn out blades, but certainly no close shave</li>
            <li> original blades lasted over two years, but I&#x27;ll probably not wait that long to replace these.</li>
            <li> Thanks for proving that your systems and the people who develop and operate them are so professional!</li>
            <li> I waited to replace them for years because I could buy a whole new razor for the normal shelf price.  </li>
            <li> Like all the ones, I have used, great for a few shaves then seem to dull quickly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend name-brand replacement heads from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended item.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend and won&#x27;t change from this razor set.</li>
            <li> Shipping on the item a bit high for what was provided.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend buying these blades..</li>
            <li> It seems like a bit if a high price for what you&#x27;re getting, but they work well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend them to others.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend and won&#x27;t change from this razor set.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco products for years in all types of environments, highly recommend the razors and the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> a new shaver.the old one has alot of life left in it and shaves quite comfortably now.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find that they send the whole top half of the shaver head, not just the blades inside.  </li>
            <li> My razor is only two years old but the original blades just weren&#x27;t doing the job.  </li>
            <li> These are for an old model now and I could not find it in any other price with a better price.</li>
            <li> I love the shave of the Norelco razor but hate the fact that the flip top too easily becomes detached from the razor body when cleaning.</li>
            <li> Works fine, absolutely no problems</li>
            <li> these were easy to change out adn not a ridiculous price like other replacement blades.</li>
            <li> Blades fit and work perfect restoring previous cutting of razor</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than purchasing a new razor and when heads are replaced works like a new razor once again.</li>
            <li> I used to just buy a new razor because Norelco charges almost as much for replacement heads as they do for a new razor when their on sale.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not noticed any irritation after installing new heads, just a better shave with less effort.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not noticed any irritation after installing new heads, just a better shave with less effort.</li>
            <li> Sure they get rid of the stubble and ok, it may take a little longer with the passing months, but gee didn&#x27;t I just get new blades less than a year ago?  </li>
            <li> the product which is by the way original and not generic, is exactly what is described and the delivery in my case to australia was quicker than some of the local companies deliver locally.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (if they sucked even a little bit I&#x27;d sure tell you)</li>
            <li> However I am still able to shave but it is my perception that it takes me a little longer to do it.</li>
            <li> Finally, after 5 years (!), I replaced the original heads of my Norelco 7810 shaver!</li>
            <li> I found this particular one to last a while and rarely did the blades start pulling hair.  </li>
            <li> They do the job at very near the cost of a whole new razor.</li>
            <li> I forgot how easy it is to shave with sharp blades.  </li>
            <li> My razor is like new again and works like a charm, as if  it were brand new out of the box!</li>
            <li> There was no break-in time like I usually have with new replacement heads; from the very first shave these were extremely comfortable to use.   </li>
            <li> However, he is now in a position in life where he cannot use a blade razor so he is very pleased with just replacing the old dull heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obviously very pleased to have extended the life of my old razor by taking a cheaper/smarter solution to the dull razor dilemma.</li>
            <li> New shaver head made the razor feel like new and was much cheaper AND EASIER than purchasing a new one</li>
            <li> If you are thinking of getting a new razor consider new blades instead, the price I paid for these blades were much much cheaper than a new razor.</li>
            <li> replacement heads (blades and combs) make my older Norelco razor work like new.</li>
            <li> My older shaver works like new again.</li>
            <li> These seem to wear out much faster than the old Norelco blades</li>
            <li> These heads fit my razor just like I expected them to.  </li>
            <li> Really helped to perk up my old electric razor.  </li>
            <li> Being a bit cheap, I was running my razor too long with the old razor heads.</li>
            <li> Comes complete with the whole head.</li>
            <li> i can really tell that my old blades needed to be replaced.</li>
            <li> I have an old beater Norelco that has the old style heads and it shaves twice as fast if not faster and gives a much closer shave.</li>
            <li> Fit as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered several of these over the years and they are worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> Like many products today, one must nearly destroy the product to get it out of the tamper proof packaging.</li>
            <li> From now on I&#x27;ll just replace the heads when needed and keep the old razor as long its motor keeps running smoothly.  </li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s almost not worth buying replacements heads unless it&#x27;s actually cost effective.</li>
            <li> Takes a few shaves to break in but OK after that.</li>
            <li> And once I actually looked at the razor head, replacement was pretty much intuitive.  </li>
            <li> The heads should be a normal replacement every 12 months.</li>
            <li> This will be the first and last time you receive an order for one your products from this very ticked off customer.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s normally</li>
            <li> A separate, larger instruction sheet would have been useful.  </li>
            <li> I would normally ask for a refund on the N.  heads</li>
            <li> This is much easier if you remove the entire head assembly from the body of the shaver first.</li>
            <li> But, if you have a heavy beard or shave more than once a day, as I do, then you should replace the blades every 8 months or so.</li>
            <li> i laugh when someone brings their norelco in to local dealer to be rehabbed...</li>
            <li> They were no more effective than the old ones I replaced.</li>
            <li> These HQ8 replacement heads worked good for about 2 months and then started making noise and performing poorly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend new heads for any razor over one year old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RDC</li>
            <li> Too new for me to judge as just started using the razor but see no reason not to rate it high</li>
            <li> They fit perfectly and restore the \\&quot;brand new\\&quot; shaving experience that you may be missing due to old, dull blades.    </li>
            <li> A little challenging to replace the blades in the razor but other than that the purchase went smoothly.</li>
            <li> The old heads were exactly a year old and I can tell the difference with new heads.</li>
            <li> the new blades enables my older razors to shave like new.  </li>
            <li> these replacement heads gave it a new go , shaves like new again for a decent price</li>
            <li> Why buy bootleg replacements when you get the real deal right here at a fantastic price!</li>
            <li> At the time, lesser models came with NiCad batteries and held less charge and the higher model had lithium batteries and held more charge.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got these on sale, but next time I&#x27;m going for the slightly more expensive replacements with the extra blade rings (which is what came with my razor originally.)</li>
            <li> I cannot tell much difference in the new and the old ones in the way it shaves.</li>
            <li> IT works very well, just like the old one 4 years ago when it was new.</li>
            <li> I was ready to toss my  10 year old Norelco and buy a new one.</li>
            <li> Far better shave with less pull and bite.  </li>
            <li> Have been using them daily for the last 6 months and they&#x27;re still going strong.</li>
            <li> I sent it back because it wasn&#x27;t the right.</li>
            <li> Ordered right there in the CVS store that evening and got the product the next day!</li>
            <li> This guy didn&#x27;t, that being said, i&#x27;ve ordered these several times right now.</li>
            <li> So I finally checked out&lt;br /&gt;the replacement blades and got the right one, so</li>
            <li> I am not sure what Norelco has done, other than changing the foil design, but these are great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was one of the wet dry model shavers, I found out that the newer model price was more than double what I originally payed.....</li>
            <li> it fit and its ok don tthink ill by again since a nerelco razor is just a few dollars more</li>
            <li> Check the Norelco Website if you are unsure if these fit your model but other than that there is nothing to worry about.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what&#x27;s going on here, but after MANY years of using Norelco shavers and getting almost a year out of the heads; this one was not cutting well after only two weeks !  </li>
            <li> The same great Norelco heads I&#x27;ve been using for the past ten years!</li>
            <li> Made my razor work like new.</li>
            <li> Fits my razor well &amp; has saved me from having to purchase a new razor.  </li>
            <li> Comparable replacements in a store would have cost as much as a new razor</li>
            <li> it is like a new razor, would recemend to anyone.</li>

            <li> Save your money and put it towards a new razor instead.</li>
            <li> it took a lot longer than it did when new.</li>
            <li> A lot cheaper than a new razor.</li>
            <li> Well I throughly cleaned my razor, put in the new heads</li>
            <li> and it now works like a new one.</li>
            <li> Like a brand new razor now.</li>
            <li> Razor now shaves like new again.</li>
            <li> Makes dear hubby&#x27;s razor work like new again.</li>
            <li> Immediately, after replacing the blades, my razor perfomed like new again.  </li>
            <li> My Norelco shaver is fairly new.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads for the Norelco Spectra make it once again like new.  </li>
            <li> It is still a pleasure to use the shaver with these new heads.</li>
            <li> The replacement was straighforward and the razors are like new again.</li>
            <li> My unit cuts like new</li>
            <li> I would live advise on what to do about maybe replacing it and getting a new one?</li>
            <li> I bought the new heads in July 2014</li>
            <li> It was like getting a brand new shaver and the difference was noticable.  </li>
            <li> It was cheaper than a new Norelco</li>

            <li> I should have bought a new razor instead of replacement blades.</li>
            <li> These heads make my shaver seem like a new shave.</li>
            <li> Should have done this months ago instead of looking for a new shaver.  </li>
            <li> like a new razor.</li>
            <li> New heads took about 30 seconds to install.</li>
            <li> I recommend cleaning all parts of the shaver thoroughly before installing the new heads.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like having a brand new razor.</li>
            <li> Purchased this replacement head along with a new Shaver 4500 as a gift in December of 2013.  </li>

            <li> The electric shaver worked like new again.</li>
            <li> I can purchase a new razor for the price Norelco charges for the holder and blades.</li>
            <li> What a difference new heads make.  </li>
            <li> Razor cuts like new.</li>
            <li> I was going to by a new one</li>
            <li> but my dad&#x27;s was like brand new</li>
            <li> Saved the price of a new razor.</li>
            <li> Makes the razor shave like it was brand new...</li>
            <li> New blades make all the difference.  </li>
            <li> Shaver working like new .</li>
            <li> I was led to believe that instead of changing your blades get a new razor.</li>
            <li> Need to get a new one.</li>
            <li> Installing this new set proved that</li>
            <li> I would have bought a new  razor.</li>
            <li> It shaves like new again.</li>
            <li> My shaver is like new again.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the difference these new heads make in shave quality.</li>
            <li> They made the razor preform like new.</li>
            <li> I received the shipment on time, new and functions as advertised on the site.</li>
            <li> now my electric razor works like new and w/o having to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads make a Norelco shaver like new again.  </li>
            <li> But, considering that I need a new one every six months, it is overpriced.</li>
            <li> Made my shaver like it was new.</li>
            <li> My Norelco shaves like new again.</li>
            <li> And every year I buy new blades.</li>
            <li> Forgot how well my electric razor does the job until these new heads were installed.</li>
            <li> It is sharp, new, and easily installed in my old razor....</li>
            <li> but they cost too much (about half the price I originally paid for the razor).</li>
            <li> THEY ARE VERY SHARP AND EASY TO INSTALL.</li>
            <li> the old norelco works like brand new!</li>
            <li> Just what i needed to make an old shaver new again!</li>
            <li> I used to just chuck the whole razor, because replacement heads were often times almost the same price as a whole new razor -</li>
            <li> nice razor however the heads do not seem to last very long, this is the third set of replacement heads for this razor and</li>
            <li> They are all short in at least one of these areas that my shaver does fairly well</li>
            <li> Shaving / cutting blades do need to be replaced, and Phillips has developed a relatively easy and effective replacement routine.</li>
            <li> There is really nothing else to say, it simply works very well.</li>
            <li> Cuts great but changing out the old ones is a tedious task.</li>
            <li> I picked this up the replace my old heads on my older Norelco which featured the &amp;#34;lift and cut&amp;#34; system..</li>
            <li> There is a tiny incomprehensible drawing, and reference to the manufacturer&#x27;s web site, which provides only a sort of offensive video about how important it is to replace the headsm</li>
            <li> They last at least a year which I guess is good</li>
            <li> Wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive, but amazon has them for  good price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It is the same product that is available at stores locally, but by getting from Amazon I saved some money.</li>
            <li> If your razor is over 2 years old, I highly recommend replacing the blades to make it work like new again.</li>
            <li> Would I recommend, well if you are looking at these blades, then you really have no other choice.</li>
            <li> I thought we whould have to purchase a new electric razor because it was getting old, but this replacment head was easly to install and he loves it!</li>
            <li> My chief concern was the replacement process, but the instructions on the package were very clear.</li>
            <li> Very professional as always.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these replacement heads to anyone wanting to keep their old shaver but, experience a like-new shave.</li>
            <li> fast however it seems like I got a little closer shave with the original blades ,</li>
            <li> My first reaction when trying out the new blades was &amp;#34;meh, that doesnt seem all that different from before&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Apparently it takes a while for your skin to get used to the new blades, but the rash was really bothering me</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be careful to get the right replacement cutters!  </li>
            <li> a little difficult and tricky to install, but once in, it returns the shaver to a giving a great and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I would suggest getting both a set of new heads and a sharpener set so that you can 1) sharpen your old heads to like new condition and then 2) have the backup of the new set for when you need them.  </li>
            <li> Perfect, much less expensive that buying a new razor!</li>
            <li> They are a bit pricey I think, however they are half or less than a new shavor and they give a good shave.</li>
            <li> this is not the first time I got the short end of the stick from them, I have alwasys said fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me, well shame on me</li>
            <li> This product is an original by the manufacturer and not a second by an independent.</li>
            <li> not sure, but one thing is fore sure.  </li>
            <li> These are the only replacement heads that I&#x27;m aware of for the Norelco Electric Shaver.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not sure it is that much better than anything else.  </li>
            <li> fully satisfied &amp; ok.&lt;br /&gt;the lazy programmer makes his users jump like fish...</li>
            <li> Compared to other brands in the past, it is easy to clean and maintain as well as parts are reasonable.</li>
            <li> Just not worth it to by a cheap knock off for a shaver you use every day.  </li>
            <li> Wow what a difference!</li>
            <li> I only picked it up again (the Panasonic, that is) after retiring it when the Norelco floating heads first came to me.</li>
            <li> Some are triple action now!</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I simply couldn&#x27;t feel too much of a difference!</li>
            <li> Received earlier than first posted.</li>
            <li> Keep your old razor and replace the heads!</li>
            <li> the life of the razor is a direct reflection of it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the shaver for several years and other replacements have been OK not this one however!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall I like the razor which is the 7310, not flashy by all means but, gets it done.  </li>
            <li> The old razor can normal use.</li>
            <li> does what it should, pretty close shave for an electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-not getting red irritation marks on my neck anymore&lt;</li>
            <li> This was the first time I replaced the heads and hoped they would last about a year which is in line with Norelco recommended annual replacement.&lt;br /&gt;Shaver</li>
            <li> wow!  </li>
            <li> As the old heads became ineffective and shaving time increased, I just accepted that this was the normal ageing of the Razor.</li>
            <li> I had the original heads on my Norelco for a couple years and finally had enough and bought these, they advise to replace yearly</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as the original blades.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Revived my old razor!</li>
            <li> Keep your old razor and replace the heads!</li>
            <li> Surprised!</li>
            <li> I just got my delivered today, so i haven&#x27;t tested them, but they appear to be the exact same as what came on my shaver (Philips Norelco</li>
            <li> They are okay, but not outstanding</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving them a second chance my first lasted 2 years</li>
            <li> This HQ8 worked well at the first second.</li>
            <li> Seems like the original stay sharp longer.</li>
            <li> He took the old blades out, washed the unit and put the new ones in and it feels like having a brand new razor.</li>
            <li> Switching the old cutters to a set of new ones made my shaver work like a new one.  </li>
            <li> The new blades made my 10 year old Norelco like new.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you don&#x27;t seperate the pieces as it&#x27;s hard to put back together, but it should just pop right into the razor.</li>
            <li> My Norelco model has an internal system to let you know when to clean it, recharge it, or replace the heads based on actual usage.  </li>
            <li> I shave regularly about once a week because I like to have a growth before going into trim the &#x27;stache and chin portion, but I shave clean the sides almost daily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing to me that the blades cost so much that you only pay a few extra dollars for the razor.</li>
            <li> I went back to my old cutter heads and even though they were old they at least gave me a good</li>
            <li> THESE HEADS MAKE AN OLD SHAVER LIKE A NEW ONE</li>
            <li> Saved a lot of money by not having to buy a complete new razor unit.</li>
            <li> Boy, was I surprised at the difference new heads made.  </li>
            <li> Managed to install the new heads myself, replacing ones almost two years old.</li>
            <li> I can feel the difference between the old and new quite noticeably.</li>
            <li> What a difference, going from 3 year old cutter blades to brand new ones.</li>
            <li> you are not getting a whole new head ,which the price would indicate because of the overall price of a new razor 59.00 vs</li>
            <li> Compared the new heads to my old ones</li>
            <li> Made a new shaver with comfort out of an old one.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;old \\&quot;razor\\&quot; now works like a new razor.  </li>
            <li> These shaver heads make my 20 year old shaver work like new.  </li>
            <li> I still have an old  Norelco razor and these replacement heads make it work just like a new razor</li>
            <li> the old heads were worn out, so the new ones are just what i needed.</li>
            <li> My old shaver now feels like new.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised and am a fan of the new razor.</li>
            <li> my old  razor was like brand new again</li>
            <li> these parts gave my old razor new life.  </li>
            <li> Gave it new live and a much better shav to say the least,</li>
            <li> I was about to go back to a blade, but these new Norelco HQ8 returned my electric to 100% new at a reasonable cost</li>
            <li> as close as the old design, I checked at Walmart and saw their new shavers</li>
            <li> Replacement give new life to my old razor.</li>
            <li> Nothing new wrt my old shaving head.</li>
            <li> Rather than run all over town ordered new replacement heads for my 7 year old Norelco.</li>
            <li> Makes my old razor cut like it did when new.  </li>
            <li> Wow, what a difference a new set of blades make.</li>
            <li> My husband says he doesn&#x27;t see any difference from the old heads to the new.</li>
            <li> so I surprised him with new blades.</li>
            <li> I just installed a new set of these Norelco HQ8 Replacement Blades on my OLD Norelco shaver.  </li>
            <li> My old razor felt new again after installing the blades.  </li>
            <li> These blades gave an old razor new life.</li>
            <li> Old reliable razor gets new life.  </li>
            <li> It seems to me that the old blades cut a lot cleaner and closer than the new ones.</li>
            <li> When they came, I (for once) followed the instructions that came with them and popped out the old blades and put the new ones in.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;M GOING TO REPLACE THESE HEADS WITH THE OLD ONES UNTIL I GET A NEW SHAVER.</li>
            <li> I purchased New Blades that were duller than the 18 month old originals that I replaced.  </li>
            <li> so I used the new blades with the old covers.</li>
            <li> Found video which showed how to remove old heads and install new ones.</li>
            <li> I had to take the blades out of the new head and put them in the old holder...  </li>
            <li> There is no difference from old to new.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no difference in shaving with the new blades compared to a year old blade.  </li>
            <li> When I replaced my old blades with these, my shaver was like new again.</li>
            <li> It was just what the old razor needed to be new again.  </li>
            <li> New Norelco cutters fit my 10 year old Norelco shaver just as well as the previous set.  </li>
            <li> OEM blades, fit well, work well, last long.</li>
            <li> I get a really smooth shave in half the time.</li>
            <li> THIS ITEM IS NOT A CHEAP ITEM, BUT EASILY FOUND ON THE INTERNED.  </li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and does the job I expected.</li>
            <li> Item was as expected and shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not difficult to do but takes a little more finger dexterity than I expected.</li>
            <li> The heads will &amp;#34;float&amp;#34; down too far and become recessed every time I used it, even with a light touch.</li>
            <li> I am a big online shopper, and have been let down many times.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These heads can only fit in one direction and my old ones could be put in 3 different possible directions since they didn&#x27;t have a distinct slot to force them in one direction only.  </li>
            <li> But, the new head seems to do a good job of both cutting and covering a large part of my face.</li>
            <li> They were exactly what he needed and will last him at least a year or more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before buying yet another set of replacement heads, I took a look at all the current shavers, reading all the reviews, figuring that after 8 years, perhaps it was not worth it to spend any more money on my old shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They may have little motivation to assist their current customers if they earn more profit from sales of new shavers than they earn from sales of replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that I received just the blades, it appeared to me that I was buying a complete new head.  </li>
            <li> Since it really feels like a new shaver again, it is like buying your current shaver for just 21 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve priced similar replacement blades in the brick &amp; mortar stores and they wanted as much for the blades as a new Shaver would have cost.</li>
            <li> After toying with the idea of simply buying a whole new electric razor, I decided to look into replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Next time, I&#x27;ll just bit the bullet and buy a whole new shaver.</li>
            <li> only ditched it because wife messed up blades and replacements run as much as this new norelco.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The blades came with very detailed instructions as to installing the blades and it only took a few moments to remove the old blades and replace with the new blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I unfortunately bent one of my previous heads on my razor, and so this was the perfect replacement.</li>
            <li> They are easily installed, but you must be careful to line up the stationary part wings with the slots in the shaver head designed for them or the cutters will not allow you to close the head properly.</li>
            <li> As others reported they did not last as long as the original blades.</li>
            <li> It is obvious that Norelco is overcharging for this product when you can buy a complete new shaver for just a few dollars more than the replacement blades.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We will certainly use this website in the future...</li>
            <li> The new blades certainly made a difference and reminded me of how much faster a shave is with sharp blades.</li>
            <li> These are fine, but as some reviewers have noted, there does seem to be more spacing between the cutting blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be sure the little \\&quot;ears\\&quot; on the cup-shaped  combs in which the cutters sit are properly oriented (rotationally)</li>
            <li> These heads are only a little better than the ones I replaced.</li>
            <li> The original blades lasted about a year and a half.</li>
            <li> Has less blades on each head than the original head.</li>
            <li> 1st quality, manufacturer original, and half the price of walgreens.</li>
            <li> Now if I could only get my retired husband to shave a little more often.  </li>
            <li> they came as individual blades that you had to drop back into plac--but they still worked fine once back in.</li>
            <li> Less pulling than the original.</li>
            <li> These have made a tremendous improvement in the operation of my razors, I was not aware of the need to change them.</li>
            <li> Rather than buying a new razon just to get fresh and sharp blades</li>
            <li> These were just a little tricky to install, so be sure you study your current razor head before taking the old blades out.  </li>
            <li> Easy cleaning keeps the shaving heads sharp for the next shave.</li>
            <li> Near the end of May the blades began to feel dull and leave much more hair stuble on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> is model 7340XL, which works fine with new heads, but if I need to replace heads 3 times a year then this is not a worthwhile product.</li>
            <li> Does a great job cutting your beard.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s now clean shaven in much less time because they do the job.</li>
            <li> Why do you insist on comments when it clearly is a routinaire product ????</li>
            <li> I use the electric regularly because I don&#x27;t always need a really close shave and it results in zero nicks compared to the old fashioned shaver.  </li>
            <li> ,however I don&#x27;t think it was clear to me  as to which razor they were for.</li>
            <li> The item arrived very quickly, much faster than expected, that was much appreciated, as these are replacement blades for my Norelco shaver,</li>
            <li> Simply took them out of the package, put into my old shaver and was ready to go.</li>
            <li> My old blades - which I replced 1 - 2 times per year were old, old technology.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> about 8 years old</li>
            <li> I am 76 years old and never Jane deviated from being a Norelco user.</li>
            <li> so I used the old screen.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it works well now with the old screen.</li>
            <li> The old ones are still working, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt to replace now.</li>
            <li> was nearly destroyed</li>
            <li> Direct replacement blades.  </li>
            <li> I have a really old Norelco, but it just keeps working and holds a two hour charge.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s over 5 years old now.</li>
            <li> The picture on the package shows a complete head set, heads and frame.    </li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, I&#x27;m doing everything correctly.</li>
            <li> Now that I am using it I can tell the difference from the old ones in my shaver.  </li>
            <li> These were shipped directly to a caregiver there,</li>
            <li> He has sensitive skin</li>
            <li> wow.  </li>
            <li> and they did what my old worn out heads could not do: give me a close shave.  </li>
            <li> The package did arrive completely smushed</li>
            <li> I bought these razor blades to replace the old ones that had been in the razor for over 1 year.</li>
            <li> Replaced old worn out razor heads,</li>
            <li> These are direct factory replacements</li>
            <li> I am hoping with the Phillips lube spray I will get at least 5 more years out of these heads.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I ordered this since, the spring near the head of my shaver broke.</li>
            <li> Are currently working very well.  </li>
            <li> I felt that the product I was purchasing was the complete head for the shaver and not just the blades and screens.</li>
            <li> These blades are direct NORELCO brand replacement blades for the Spectra razor.  </li>
            <li> My old head was over 5 years old</li>
            <li> My razor is a year old, so it was time to replace the heads.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is completely reliable.  </li>
            <li> This was never a problem with the old battery technology (tho I have always COMPLETELY drained my batteries before re-charging..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not 100% sold on the whole Philips Norelco thing these days, but this gets enough of the job done.  </li>
            <li> I have a 12 year old norelco shaver that keeps on working.</li>
            <li> I have a 15 year old XL razor.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco HQ8 Spectra Tripleheader Head  Will not shave as close as my old  HQ8 Tripleheader</li>
            <li> old.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Included are 3 round blades and the 3 &amp;#34;combs&amp;#34; that the blades fit into.</li>
            <li> I noticed that I was not getting as close a shave as with my old HQ8 blades.  </li>
            <li> old blades that were in the shaver.  </li>
            <li> I just ordered the factory Norelco replacement heads for my old (80&#x27;s or early 90&#x27;s)shaver.  </li>
            <li> What a complete piece of junk, and no the shaving heads didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t compete with a straight edge though that&#x27;s why only 4 stars</li>
            <li> The shipment was prompt and professionally done.  </li>
            <li> the day after using the old fashioned razor because the stubble is shorter to begin with</li>
            <li> Could be that the originals, though old, were just not worn.</li>
            <li> Not a perfectly round shape.</li>
            <li> 2 packs from the 3 were squashed and looks like old packs.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 19 year old grandson for Christmas.</li>
            <li> My old set would shave faster, but maybe not as close?  </li>
            <li> My Norelco is over a year old</li>
            <li> My old heads were about 2 years old.</li>
            <li> that is about one year old and yes it was time to make a change.</li>
            <li> Old heads were worn out.</li>
            <li> Completely met expectations</li>
            <li> Does not give me irritation in sensitive neck skin.</li>
            <li> This Replacement has made old razor young again</li>
            <li> In order to keep the matched heads, I marked each set with dots, 1,2,or 3.</li>
            <li> Not shaving any closer than old one.</li>
            <li> I forgot I needed to replace heads every year, mine were over 6 years old.</li>
            <li> The shaver itself is nearly a throw-away.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than buying direct.</li>
            <li> The shave quality was markedly improved.</li>
            <li> ANYBODY NEEDS WHEN THE HEADS BECOME OLD</li>
            <li> I was surprised.  </li>
            <li> Head work&#x27;s just as the old one did.</li>
            <li> The old one was about 5 yrs old.</li>
            <li> Then you can dump out the heads and old cutters.  </li>
            <li> my old blades didn&#x27;t cut it anymore and just span  around making noise but not shaving anything.</li>
            <li> The old blades were two years old.</li>
            <li> will allow you to shave the hairs of your chiny-chin-chin for at least one more year.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My old ones were almost two years old.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> Have not heard of any problems with them so far.</li>
            <li> IT IS ON MY OLD SHAVER</li>
            <li> Thought maybe the problem was an old shaver.</li>
            <li> Nope, just old blades.</li>
            <li> SHipped early</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been 2 years since I replaced blades on my 6-year old shavers.</li>
            <li> Arrived early.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s probably because his razor is getting old.</li>
            <li> Replacing my worn out hit-and-miss heads made SUCH A DIFFERENCE that I think I will replace them more frequently.</li>
            <li> I recently replaced the heads on my Norelco razor and they give a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> direct replacement.</li>
            <li> Wow, now I know why my son was not getting a close shave.</li>
            <li> No problems so far.  </li>
            <li> Fits perfectly on my old Philips Norelco triple head shaver 7310XL</li>
            <li> I m having a cleaner shave comparing to the old header.</li>
            <li> I had my old ones for about 1.5 years and figured was time to replace them</li>
            <li> dubious about the replacement heads since they&#x27;re not inexpensive, as one would expect--  but pleasantly surprised with these--</li>
            <li> after replacing the old blades, the shaving is cleaner and it is a bit quicker to get the job done</li>
            <li> The razor is two years old, should have bought them a year ago.</li>
            <li> So far they are performing well even though they do not give as close of a shave as I would like.  </li>
            <li> Just what was needed by the old shaver.  </li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d replaced my old heads sooner.  </li>
            <li> REPLACED OLD HEADS</li>
            <li> I started to notice that my 13 month old Norelco was not shaving my face as close as it used to.</li>
            <li> Thought I got a cheap knock-off or something and not genuine parts.  </li>
            <li> I dug out the old electric razor (7-8 yrs old)</li>
            <li> They cost as much as the entire printer/shaver/toothbrush itself!</li>
            <li> I change the heads after using the old ones for years.</li>
            <li> It is a complete replacement item and a child could do it.</li>
            <li> You get used to taking forever to shave with blades that are four years old.</li>
            <li> The Five Stars speak loud and clear.</li>
            <li> no problem putting on old razor.</li>
            <li> my old heads.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it did make a noticeable improvement in the performance of my shaver.</li>
            <li> Old head was like shaving with a snow shovel.</li>
            <li> All products worked well as advertised that I have used so far,</li>
            <li> A direct replacement part.</li>
            <li> My beard is fairly soft</li>
            <li> It replaced a 2.5 year old shaver head.  </li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t provide a shave that is any closer than the old head.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After all, where the blades meet your skin is where the action is.</li>
            <li> Makes them last a whole lot longer.</li>
            <li> so i looked online with amazon and was pleasantly surprised to find these at a fraction of the price</li>
            <li> Given the price of razor blades these days I thought I would try my old electric again.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I should have keep the old one.</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve kept the old blades.</li>
            <li> I got the shaver replacement inserts not the complete replacement head.</li>
            <li> I bought them to replace the old blades.</li>
            <li> Shipping is in a retail box, complete with installation instructions and all.</li>
            <li> THEY DID NOT FIT AND COULD NOT BE MADE TO FIT.  </li>
            <li> The old ones wore through but was used for about 8-10 years.</li>
            <li> but so far no re reply&lt;</li>
            <li> Then I have to come up with at least 7 more words.</li>
            <li> Fixed my problem.</li>
            <li> I bought this one as a replacement for old heads.</li>
            <li> This replaced the old cutters in the Norelco cordless shaver, so you get a closer shave...</li>
            <li> bough them early to have when it came up on my yearly replacement time.</li>
            <li> So far these replacement heads are giving me a close shave.</li>
            <li> AS FAR AS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> These heads were a direct replacement for my Norelco AT810 shaver.  </li>
            <li> I used the old heads for about 2 two years when I noticed that I was not getting as close of a shave as I used to.  </li>
            <li> price on Amazon was much cheaper than local stores.</li>
            <li> Noticed difference as soon as I replaced the old blades.</li>
            <li> Received items (replacement razor heads) as promised thanks, would gladly do future business!</li>
            <li> Old ones had worn out.  </li>
            <li> I thought I was purchasing the  the complete head  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The cutters will allow old whiskers to stick to them.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d think no one was surprised here.  </li>
            <li> The old ones i had for over 2 years..</li>
            <li> Not the level of quality I expected but still useful to a degree.</li>
            <li> Sure the old style did pull on the longer ones but at least it cut them off.</li>
            <li> does a good job, but is too expensive</li>
            <li> I recommend them to all masochist, needless to say they are good replacements.</li>
            <li> The blades are good but it&#x27;s difficult to insert</li>
            <li> I found a 5 year old expensive Norelco razor in my cabinet that I loved but had quit using years ago because it quit shaving well.</li>
            <li> slightly difficult to take out old heads &amp; replace with these, but once they went in they worked just as good as the originals.</li>
            <li> One of those things that you have to live with and if your face is full of little holes from a worn out head it does work to fix the problems.</li>
            <li> In the past I have actuallypurchased a new shaver at the same price as the replacement heads, but the price here was appropriate.</li>
            <li> , I feel the blades (or metal/tempering), are not exactly the same quality or edge sharpening grind, as my original &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; blades from Norelco when new.</li>
            <li> My past experiences with brand new blade were it would take more than multiple uses to get into shape.</li>
            <li> As with the oringinal heads, they work great when new, but dull quickly and are too expensive to have to keep replacing.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered as the old one became a problem to my face just after replacing the new one my shaver returne back it effecency like new</li>
            <li> Old blades were starting to cut skin not just hair, got these and the razor is like new again and saved me from having to buy a new razor.</li>
            <li> I would  recommend buying a new razor rather than getting a replacement because the new one feels the same as my old razor heads.</li>
            <li> I do wish I would have bought the pink curtain buttons to go with it right away though.</li>
            <li> As usual, this purchase thru amazon.com was easy, convenient and affordable.</li>
            <li> It was much cheaper on amazon than any other store, and shipped fast.  </li>
            <li> left out every other blade, why, like everybody else the all mighty</li>
            <li> and I KNOW AMAZON would grant it, but for the first time ever I think I will allow convenience to override economics (mainly because I have a disability and it would be a hardship at this point, although  minor, to send them back).</li>
            <li> Installation of the new heads was a breeze even without the instructions and now I&#x27;m back to new again.</li>
            <li> After having my shaver for several years, I was considering getting a new one since it didn&#x27;t seem to be working as well as when it was new.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, after the swap my razor was back working like new - and I even made a note to myself when I put in the new blades</li>
            <li> The new blades need to be inserted into the assembly; new locking screws installed; and then the assembly placed back into the razor.  </li>
            <li> Once properly installed, the old razor cut like a brand new unit!</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh, our several year old razor cuts like brand new now!</li>
            <li> when all that you really need to do in most cases is replace the shaving heads/blades to notice a dramatic difference?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been half a year since I&#x27;ve switched them now, but they&#x27;re still going just as strong as the day I got them.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend changing your blades more often than 4 years in between, and just in general it helps to exfoliate your face a few times a week for</li>
            <li> After a most uncomfortable shave my face was still full of moderate stubble.</li>
            <li> THE RAZORS ARE SHARP AS EVER AND ARE WORTH THEIR MONEY.</li>
            <li> original heads lasted over a year, and I shave everyday</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the service, but these blades were NOT made for extra tough beards.  </li>
            <li> Replacing the head was simple and shaver is once again like new!</li>
            <li> My husband was finally convinced to change out blades instead of buying a completely new razor...and what a difference!  </li>
            <li> Simple pleasures, like new blades!  </li>
            <li> These have two small tabs that will let you put the heads in only in a certain way, so look for that, as the original heads did not have the tabs, even though the razor is set up to accommodate them.</li>
            <li> The old heads that are several years old give a smoother shave than these new heads.  </li>
            <li> I tried sharpening the old blades, and it helped for a few months, but new blades are SOOOO worth it.</li>
            <li> and I will not give them the chance for a third time mainly for the fact that I have told them of both incidents and I have not gotten even the slightest appolagy.   </li>
            <li> I decided to go with the brand-name replacements, mainly because I trust the name - and I couldn&#x27;t find any cheaper, generic versions anywhere.</li>
            <li> I intend to do that the next time my blades no longer provide a decent shave.</li>
            <li> I noticed that the heads are a different color and wonder if these are a generic replacement and not an exact replacement.</li>
            <li> They last - I usually throw them away after using two blades because I want the latest model.</li>
            <li> I am not especially mechanical and wondered at first why I could not buy the entire head assembly and just pop it on.  </li>
            <li> This is the second set of Norelco HQ8 Replacement Heads I have purchased from Amazon for mu older Norelco Spectra 8890XL shaver.</li>
            <li> I owned an older norelco model for over 10 years and only chnaged blades once.</li>
            <li> You need this if your Norelco is older than several years..</li>
            <li> Since I have a older Norelco, I had some questions which I sent to Philips and they returned answers the next day.</li>
            <li> The shave is not as close and clean as expected, (same as the throw-away razors/blades, also from major old-time brand companies...</li>
            <li> Still, the price for such a replacement has come way down, and the old-fashioned way of shaving is, cost-wise and ecologically speaking, no competition at all for a Norelco.</li>
            <li> But I also have a little plastic sharpening kit I bought online for $5 that works great, so I will sharpen a set every time I notice my shave getting a little rough.  </li>
            <li> These blades stay sharp right up to the end.  </li>
            <li> Stars is as high as I rate such objects.  </li>
            <li> Be careful evidently all &amp;#34;HQ8&amp;#34; are not the same, my razor is an older model that takes an HQ8 head</li>
            <li> I was infact planning to throw my year old shaver and get new one, but changed my mind last minute and decided to get replacement head.</li>
            <li> Simply pull the old one off and snap the new one on.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at how simple it was to install the new head.  </li>
            <li> My original blade lasted me years, but I feel like these new ones are dulling after only a few months...</li>
            <li> if im going out on a date or something i usually use a mach3 to get it real smooth but other than that this is preobobly the easiest way to go.</li>
            <li> I found it cost (in the long run) quite a bit and the smooth surface didn&#x27;t last long at all.  </li>
            <li> Has it really been that long?</li>
            <li> Really smooth shave, no more burning.</li>
            <li> great to not have to replace the shole machine, but very EXPENSIVE by comparison...</li>
            <li> It was long overdue and the razor is now working very well.</li>
            <li> After going to multiple stores in our city and finding no one carries them locally any more, I found them on Amazon without any trouble.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly what I expected, at a lower price than the manufacturer&#x27;s web site.</li>
            <li> Only thing to be careful of is to use a VERY gentle touch when getting used to a new pair of blades.  </li>
            <li> I more or less, have a new razor for much less than the actual price of a new one.</li>
            <li> After about a year, my original shaving heads seemed rather dull and I bought and installed a new set.  </li>
            <li> I have to make several passes to get clean shave with NO success.   </li>
            <li> I discovered that if I simply use a light touch and not press so hard then it got those hairs much better and with NO MORE RAZOR BURN &amp;lt;3.&lt;br /&gt;happy shaving.</li>
            <li> Shave a little better, not much.</li>
            <li> This are pretty expensive compared to the price of the complete unit, but the Norelcos I have have been going strong for about three years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always tough describing a very subjective issue but, in this case, these Replacement Heads just don&#x27;t seem to shave as close or as smoothly as I would have</li>
            <li> but I suspect you can get that with many other brands for less $$.</li>
            <li> After several years I thought purchasing new replacement heads would renew my electric razor.</li>
            <li> After going over 4 years without buying new blades, it was definitely time to so.  </li>
            <li> The new heads made a big difference in the performance of my razor.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend getting new heads every couple of years.</li>
            <li> Replaced yearly, new cutters will keep your shave extra close and shorten shaving time.</li>
            <li> A brand new Philip shave only costs 30 bucks</li>
            <li> The new heads shave close enough that I could skip a day if I wanted to.</li>
            <li> Next time I will just buy a new razor.</li>
            <li> About a year after I got my new Philips electric razor as a present I noticed it wasn&#x27;t shaving as close as it used to.</li>
            <li> Just check the current prices for new razors before buying replacement heads.</li>
            <li> The second the new blades touched my face, it felt as if shards of glass were slashing me.</li>
            <li> Second time that I have replaced the heads instead of purchasing a new electric.  </li>
            <li> Hubby needed new blades for his razor and could not find locally.  </li>
            <li> Razor is now back shaving just as well as when the razor was brand new.</li>
            <li> The new HQ8 heads give me such a close shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using the same blades for probably 5 years, decided it was time to buy new ones.  </li>
            <li> The only comlaint would be the price almost price of new shaver if ordered from Phillps.</li>
            <li> I ordered the replacement heads expecting a similar shave as the new shaver.....</li>
            <li> The new blades were simple to install.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same as buying a new razor, but a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> you can get a new shaver with same heads.</li>
            <li> While I wonder if purchasing the heads was actually cheaper than finding a new shaver on sale.</li>
            <li> Brought it back to like new again.</li>
            <li> Installed new heads - shaver shaves the same.  </li>
            <li> thing you must do is use the new blades for several days until they settle in and adjust to your skin.</li>
            <li> what is essentially a brand new electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is almost in like new condition and provides a proper shave.</li>
            <li> I finally bought new blades for my Norelco 8825</li>
            <li> As soon as I used the new heads, I could tell what a different there was.</li>
            <li> Brings your clipper back to like new operation.</li>
            <li> so i purchased this at the same time that i purchased is new shaver.  </li>
            <li> it was the right part and works fine for the money you can not go wrong will buy again when needed</li>
            <li> The first heads lasted around 6 - 8 months, we&#x27;ll see how long these last.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a bit tricky to install but no real trouble.</li>
            <li> I replaced the old heads with these and my old razor is back on task.</li>
            <li> Now my old shaver is back in action</li>
            <li> They perform very well, but for some reason, they added a radiused ear to the bottom which makes installation much more difficult.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of facial hair and very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I was very surprised by the low price.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads were a little different than the original ones and were a bit tricky to get inserted correctly.  </li>
            <li> Making the purchase of the razor replacement heads on line at Amazon was a major convenience.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had any major problems with product misrepresentation on Amazon before</li>
            <li> The blades over time became dull although the shaver worked fine.</li>
            <li> Blades are not sharp at all.  </li>
            <li> There is no other words required.</li>
            <li> No other guidance is provided.  </li>
            <li> also if you look closely, these have small &amp;#34;pinholes&amp;#34; where as my original head had fins all the way around..</li>
            <li> And if you are not going to shell our the big bucks for a fancy razor, don&#x27;t bother buying another &lt;$50 razor because these replacements essentially do the same exact thing.</li>
            <li> I should have replaced the heads long ago but kept using the old ones and complaining that \\&quot;I need to get a new razor.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t seem to stay sharp as long as the originals, but it&#x27;s my fourth set of replacements and the electric razor keeps working fine.</li>
            <li> My husband replaced the old blades with the new last night and said it was simple.  </li>
            <li> It felt a little funny at first to use such a thick cream on my face, but it really helped make my shave so much smoother</li>
            <li> so I usually just clean up the edges.</li>
            <li> Its original battery, however, holds a charge for only a few days.</li>
            <li> Made my old razor new again, don&#x27;t  know why I waited as long as I did!</li>
            <li> Mine beard would laugh when I attempted to use my old ones and it would take three times the time to shave and my face was like raw meat afterwards.</li>
            <li> After several years with the same blades, I saw in the mirror that I wasn&#x27;t getting a decent shave.  </li>
            <li> They fit right and are still cutting my whiskers, cheaper than a new razor, so I bought two sets.</li>
            <li> They were a little tricky to install because my fingers are pretty old and worn out.  </li>
            <li> It was slightly different than my existing blades, because this one features a little &#x27;tooth&#x27; to lock the blades in place - very smart!</li>
            <li> Each goes in only one way, so take note of where the flat spot on the side of each head is oriented as you remove each old head and match it as you put in the new.  </li>
            <li> it felt less substancial from the very first second.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what is going on, but this is the third time I have bought replacement blades and  this time they don&#x27;t quite fit my razor.  </li>
            <li> While the image clearly shows blades and the plastic head holder, the shipped products includes only the blades - no holder.  </li>
            <li> Replacing the shavre&#x27;s cutting heads is not difficult and restores the top notch performance that I know my Norelco shaver delivers  .</li>
            <li> So far the second set seems to be holding a sharper edge.</li>
            <li> Mine is 8 years old and used daily - still works well with just replacement heads once a year.</li>
            <li> The head of my razor fell off and I could never get the old blades back in.</li>
            <li> Replaced a 2 year old set of 3rd party blades with these, and it was like night and day.  </li>
            <li> Looking closer at the blades, the surfaces had differently shaped hair slots, and my old blades had the words \\&quot;\\&quot;Lift and Cut\\&quot; engraved twice on each head surface.  </li>
            <li> No complaints and no regrets.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend replacing yours if it is over a year old.</li>
            <li> I will straighten it out in the near future.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t get nearly as close because they are a different style.</li>
            <li> I ordered these replacement blades for my 4 year old Norelco and they came in a ridiculously short amount of time.</li>
            <li> All Natural Acne Spot Treatment - Blemishes Gone or Your Money Back!</li>
            <li> obviously too old  - ca 25 years</li>
            <li> The product was received promptly and was what I expected at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> Our last set of blades lasted nearly seven months, and we have every reason to believe that we will get equivalent service from this purchase.</li>
            <li> this is a ten year old razor</li>
            <li> May have to put old blades back in.</li>
            <li> After shaving exclusively with my Norelco for nearly eight months I started to notice occasional whisker plucks (ouch!)</li>
            <li> Barely seems to make a difference in my razor.  </li>
            <li> thanks but no thanks.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for:  it barely outlasted it&#x27;s warranty.</li>
            <li> I bought this replacement because last one was getting old and it was giving me skin</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, well packaged, as expected.</li>
            <li> My beard is not heavy and I only need to shave once a day</li>
            <li> I thought my razor was cutting good</li>
            <li> It would be nice if parts didn&#x27;t wear out, but, unfortunately, they do.  </li>
            <li> They work everytime and retain a good cutting capability.</li>
            <li> they work extremely well - like a new razor without the new razor cost.</li>
            <li> It can be a little of a challenge to get them in just right though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how the performance of a product can go down slowly over time</li>
            <li> However, it does mean I don&#x27;t have to throw the whole razor away creating even more waste.</li>
            <li> Usually I just throw my old razor away and buy a new one because the replacement blades cost so much.</li>
            <li> you really do notice the difference in the closeness of the shave when first replacing approximately one-year-old heads with these new razor-sharp beauties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i finally replaced my blades after 12 months and its back to like new condition</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually easier simply to buy a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than a new Razor, simple enough for anyone to do.  </li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;ll buy locally or just get a new razor.</li>
            <li> The razor will work with only two, but I wanted it back to new.</li>
            <li> It only fits the new shaver, even though the part numbers are the same</li>
            <li> But what really surprised me was how much faster (less time per shave) as well.</li>
            <li> my Norelco shaver was taking a long time to shave, ordered new heads and got them in record time.</li>
            <li> Replaced the heads (probably waited too long), and it&#x27;s just like a new shaver.</li>
            <li> I have two Norelco razors that I received as gifts over the last few years I would clean them regularly</li>
            <li> The original heads always seem to last longer - not sure why.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t realized how dull my original blades had become after a year</li>
            <li> Hard to get excited about razor heads...</li>
            <li> Original shaving heads lasted 10 months, and were probably noticeably dull after 9.</li>
            <li> After a year, my original blades had become dull.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to explain how crappy these are compared to the original parts.</li>
            <li> Long story short, it took just as long and with just as much effort to shave as it did with my 5 year old blades.  </li>
            <li> The replacement heads work great, but I don&#x27;t feel the cutting quality lasts very long!  </li>
            <li> I finally changed the heads and it shaver is as good as new though the one old weren&#x27;t that bad even after using it for last 2 years.</li>
            <li> A little difficult to postion but works great once you get it installed</li>
            <li> /&gt;They should stick with the original design the customer bought at least for longer than&lt;br /&gt;4 years.</li>
            <li> I really need to get another set for my other one.</li>
            <li> Then, again, to be fair, he does have an extra tough beard and there simply may not be ANY blade that can last him long enough.</li>
            <li> I buy a new razor every other year, and new blades on alternate years.</li>
            <li> Shaver 7310 original blades were starting to leave stubs behind and with these replacement heads, shaver is as new!  </li>
            <li> I debated about this, since they&#x27;re about half the price of a new shaver, but since I had already found and soldered in a new battery, I figured what the heck.  </li>
            <li> unpacked, the heads were more difficult to replace correctly than I had imagined or hoped for, but I finally got the job done and the new heads shave quite well.</li>
            <li> I was able to salvage things by re-using the old screens and put in the new cutting blades/wheels.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not getting the close shave you used to, order new blades, not a new razor.</li>
            <li> Glad we don&#x27;t have to go out and purchase a new shaver when the only thing wrong was the blades were dulling.  </li>
            <li> Works great, much less expensive than taking it to a local shop for service.</li>
            <li> Old folks should be let out only occasionally!</li>
            <li> The whole thing was a few years old</li>
            <li> Same (identical) package that I ordered from Amazon, but different heads that looked like my old ones and did mesh.  </li>
            <li> The package is difficult to open without a pair of scissors handy.</li>
            <li> your shave will be closer and cleaner but comparing the new babies to my 3+ year old heads, the change is not very significant.</li>
            <li> He tells me he will not wait so long next time before ordering a new head for his shaver.</li>
            <li> The replacement blades lasted only about two weeks before they were as dull as the original blades.</li>
            <li> Be aware paying attention to the small print as it&#x27;s hard to determine which ones will fit your razor.</li>
            <li> Disn&#x27;t realize how my old blades had worn down until I installed the new replacement.</li>
            <li> These heads simply made my razor like new for less than purchasing a new one.  </li>
            <li> Not a good fit for my model even though it said it was</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find out that it lasted so long on a charge.</li>
            <li> Strange that I had old Norelos from Japan that cut for decades</li>
            <li> no excuse not to change heads.</li>
            <li> The old heads lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> I am not sure this is worth the money.  </li>
            <li> The replacements, although they look original, have done a worse job than the 4 year old blades they replaced.</li>
            <li> Made my year old razor just like new at half the price the retailer wanted.</li>
            <li> other down side is don&#x27;t purchase these at their full retail price.  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted, what a difference new heads make!</li>
            <li> Did not quite fit my older model resulting in a noisy uncomfortable feel.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this was just a fluke or if the quality has really gone down.  </li>
            <li> You will definitely get your monies worth from this little bugger!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually been years since I last replaced the blades in my razor so as you might guess it made a major difference when I replaced them.  </li>
            <li> Now you have to replace the blades every year because they get dull so quickly.</li>
            <li> I have a light beard so they have always worked well, though the cheaper models don&#x27;t shave as closely or don&#x27;t have the adjustments that the more expensive (and much too expensive) shavers have.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to install as a replacement for my husbands Norelco that was past due in having blades replaced</li>
            <li> Using a shaver daily and the incremental degradation of the cutters is so imperceptible, but these replacements made me realize how important sharp cutters are.  </li>
            <li> This head works as expected like the one that came on shaver when it was new.  </li>
            <li> item brand new and working just as expected.</li>
            <li> less than ten minutes had my saver fixed and working like new.........</li>
            <li> I will find out the next time I change whether or not my shaver has to be abandoned, as this time I used the new blades Amazon sent me in one of 2 boxes with my old heads that I had luckily not thrown away.</li>
            <li> Purchased a Remington, hated it, went back to a Norelco, LOVE IT...,  Works great, delivered fast, cannot go wrong with Norelco in my opinion</li>
            <li> I get a much faster and smoother shave with less noise once replaced.</li>
            <li> I will replace them much sooner than I had previously.</li>
            <li> The blades cost half the price of the whole razor, I expect them to work.</li>
            <li> I get a much closer shave in a lot less time.</li>
            <li> People in Mexico, you can get the same product in palacio de hierro for barely the same price.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed since I was expecting a considerable change for the good.</li>
            <li> The old ones only had slots along the cutting surface but these are designed like the heads on the more expensive razors, with slots and holes, and do seem to work better than the old ones did even when they were new.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a great product  and I have ordered replacement blades in  the past  with the same  although I was sent the wrong model.</li>
            <li> set took a few days before they started to shave better (and possibly a little faster, unless I&#x27;m imagining that since my facial hair isn&#x27;t as long now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> needed new ones because i was cutting my face every time I shave some needed and order more.  </li>
            <li> you must remove the round covers and blades from the old head and replace it with the new blades.  </li>
            <li> These HQ8 blades turned my old shaver into a new shaver in just a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still puzzled why replacments have to cost so much, but getting them through Amazon typically beats all the local competition</li>
            <li> These heads seem to work just as good as the originals and are much less expensive than those in the retail stores.</li>
            <li> Purchased the new cutting blades for my old Norelco , fit and worked well.</li>
            <li> I tried for nearly an hour to twist and turn these new head covers to fit into the three holes from the cutting blades.</li>
            <li> I usually just buy a new razor vs investing in new blade.  </li>
            <li> All parts are loose so you have to be very careful with removing the old heads and placing the new ones.</li>
            <li> could be a little cheaper, really guys, make it cheaper online.</li>
            <li> Little tabs on the sides of the heads have to fit in little spaces to seat properly.  </li>
            <li> Was about 5 minute from trashing and  buying  a new other brand electric razor.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have a degree in engineering or have someone who is extremely handy--really just buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> They are not as sharp as the blades that came with my razor when it was new.</li>
            <li> These do not seem to be as sharp as the ones that come with the new razors.</li>
            <li> The new design of the Phillips Norelco heads cut extremely well.</li>
            <li> Phillips said that Amazon replacement heads are not original factory equipment and they sent me a box of HQ8 replacement heads for free for the wasted time and frustration I&#x27;d encountered with the Amazon heads sent to me.</li>
            <li> I waited too long to change my blades, and when I finally did, I could tell a major difference.</li>
            <li> I end up buying a new razor every other time for about the same cost.  </li>
            <li> The shave is now much shorter as the old ones were dull.  </li>
            <li> My old razor was getting dull and this was a much needed reaplacement.  </li>
            <li> With these new ones you pretty much rub the whiskers off instead of cutting them</li>
            <li> I discovered that my razor is about 18 mo old, so I figured it was past time for new heads</li>
            <li> The new blades I got are no better than the ones that are over a year old.  </li>
            <li> I have had Norelco razors my entire adult life, and the only way I&#x27;ve found to truly rejuvenate them, other than replacing the batteries, is to periodically replace the heads....</li>
            <li> Have always felt that replacement heads were not worth the cost and just bought a new razor.  </li>
            <li> Fitted well blades sharp, Woking so far need 6 maths to see how well they last</li>
            <li> The other thing that made my decision was that the 7310 offers the corded and cordless use, if it were one of the models that only allowed you to use as cordless</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s kind of a scary thought since we are putting these cutters on our faces but they do rub against the metal combs and I assumed that over a period of time they keep sharp and maybe even become sharper.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the razor and the shave I get with it, but I was very disappointed to find out, after I bought the new razor heads, I could have purchased a new razor, same model, for just about the same as the cost of teh new heads.</li>
            <li> I purchased these replacement heads along with the new razor just to have them on-hand when the originals wear down.</li>
            <li> I noticed that these replacement blades were half the price of an entire new shaver.</li>
            <li> I had the original blades in for about 14 months, but I could definitely tell the other ones were getting dull at around month 8.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little older</li>
            <li> The actual replacement went very efficiently but we were not able to put the shaver back together</li>
            <li> This item went for nearly twice the price on NORELCO site, and other sites.  </li>
            <li> Not so sharp like the old ones...</li>
            <li> This is only my fourth Norelco because they last so long.  </li>
            <li> It was like getting a new shaver for much less cost.  </li>
            <li> With the discounted price, the replacement heads cost less than a new replacement plastic guard that I need.</li>
            <li> New head makes the shave lots easier and takes less time.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads worked like a new razor for less cost.</li>
            <li> These are fine new cutting heads.  </li>
            <li> Makes shaver almost like new - a little pricey in my opinion, but a lot less than an actual new razor.</li>
            <li> (as in they shave a person), but they don&#x27;t seem to last as long as the blades of the same make and model which I buy at brick and mortar stores???</li>
            <li> and they last a long time too even with daily use.</li>
            <li> I use my 8894 XL once in 2 days and the head doesn&#x27;t last long enough.  </li>
            <li> Reduced in price as my shaver is a few years older.</li>
            <li> Installation takes a few minutes and requires careful practice the first time.</li>
            <li> The new blades are as dull as the old blades.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how dull the old ones were till I put these new ones in.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to describe the change from old to new.</li>
            <li> I had no idea how dull my old blades were until I put these new ones in.</li>
            <li> This item does not last too long particularly if you use it everyday.</li>
            <li> My electric razor was getting pretty dull.  </li>
            <li> You just do not know how bad your blades are until you get new ones :-)</li>
            <li> I have shaved about 8 times with these new heads and they are cutting smooth</li>
            <li> Have had Norelco shaver for a few years and this is 3rd or so new heads.</li>
            <li> I hated to replace a good working Phillips Norelco shaver and the replacement heads made it work like brand new.</li>
            <li> much b etter now did not rate at five because the price of Norelco heads are excessive anywhere you buy them</li>
            <li> These heads do not provide a reasonably close shave and are thus excessively priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Should last a long time.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> I will not wait so long next time to replace the heads.</li>
            <li> Take care of your shaver and it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> They last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll wait so long to replace them next time.</li>
            <li> the battery last a long time.</li>
            <li> I wanted to see how long they would last.  </li>
            <li> I will not wait so long to change them next time.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t wait that long next time!</li>
            <li> Sometimes when I shaved my neck too long trying to get hairs it would cause skin burns that turned my neck red and</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll last as long.</li>
            <li> Got these as backups for my razor not knowing how long the originals would last.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t wait as long to replace them the next time.</li>
            <li> They last long and work well.</li>
            <li> My only regret was that I waited a year too long to order them.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to need the replacements.</li>
            <li> Although disappointed, I still felt it was a fair price.</li>
            <li> Looks like I unfortunately got a set that is poor quality, unlike most of the people who have reviewed very positively.</li>
            <li> With a $5 discount in addition to the much lower starting price here, I paid less than half what I would have for these locally.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing as I needed to replace the whole top.</li>
            <li> Purchased these for hubby as he goes thru shaver heads quickly with his tough beard.  </li>
            <li> Or has Norelco gone this far down hill?</li>
            <li> /&gt;After several weeks of use, the new blades have given me razor burn and several small nicks and cuts that I never received before.  </li>
            <li> I was prepared to purchase a new high dollar razor when the clerk at a local store said that the only real thing that goes bad over time is the heads so why not spend less money and purchase new heads.</li>
            <li> They usually last a little less than the advertised one year, but blade life is probably a function of many variables, so I don&#x27;t see this as a negative.</li>
            <li> My husband has purchased other replacement heads in the past that were never as sharp as the original...</li>
            <li> but they do last that long!</li>
            <li> Next time I won&#x27;t wait as long!</li>
            <li> add few bucks and buy a new shaver</li>
            <li> Heads appear to be new, but am having trouble getting one to &#x27;set&#x27; in.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t know what you are missing till you put new heads on your razor.</li>
            <li> Ordered these replacement heads for my husband&#x27;s razor didn&#x27;t last very long so we will not be ordering anymore replacement heads for this razor</li>
            <li> They just do not make these things to last very long compared to the expense of the purchase.  </li>
            <li> Either take a closer look at the old heads to see how they are seated before removing them, or slowly and carefully rotate the new heads when installing them and they will eventually just drop into place when everything is properly aligned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, at least I have a set ready when these originals actually do need replacing.</li>
            <li> Someone had to put the wrong set in the box, probably fit a different model shaver.  </li>
            <li> More holes/perforations instead of slits, this keeps it from cutting my facial hair as efficiently.</li>
            <li> For some reason this particular set of heads is nearly impossible to fit evenly in my shaver; one head is always off kilter.</li>
            <li> My old blades were at least 18 months old.</li>
            <li> the same brand , proper part, went as expected .</li>
            <li> second set of replacements in the last 3 years; work as expected</li>
            <li> , while the manufacturer recommends annual replacement, the &amp;#34;subscribe and save&amp;#34; option has 1-6 months only, with 4 months as &amp;#34;most common&amp;#34;, which makes that seem like a generic option and not based on the expected use of the product itself.</li>
            <li> Part of an order placed last weekend and received today, All were received earlier than expected without any damage.</li>
            <li> but I went back to the old blades after a few days..</li>
            <li> the same reason, you should be careful when you open the packaging.  </li>
            <li> These cutters will last a long, long time.  </li>
            <li> I get a decent shave without the mess of a wet shave with razor</li>
            <li> They fit my shaver well and were a little rough after the initial install (felt scratchy), but have slowly wore in so they are feeling smoother by the day.</li>
            <li> The instructions for changing the blades were not very clear</li>
            <li> and I suppose the theory of having two different size holes for different hairs makes sense, but it slows down the overall shave time.  </li>
            <li> Blades are very sharp and will last a year with regular daily use.</li>
            <li> At least the new blades seem sharper than my one year old blades, however the packaging did get crushed enroute.</li>
            <li> I know this sounds crazy, but my replaceement doesn&#x27;t seem to cut nearly as well as the original did in the beginning.</li>
            <li> I have had this particular replacement head in the past</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, before the blades completely quit it would pull my hair a little.</li>
            <li> razor was a little over a year old</li>
            <li> Have not had long enough to say how sharp the blades last.</li>
            <li> You really do have to,changes them about once a year, because the blades get dull and start causing ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t really complain of dull blades yet</li>
            <li> I guess they got dull so gradually, I didn&#x27;t really notice it until one day I noticed my face being irritated after shaving.</li>
            <li> VERY HARD TO FIND RIGHT REPLACEMENT HEADS FOR MY SHAVER.</li>
            <li> About the only thing that needs a little bit of extra attention is ensuring that the protruding edge/notch on each of the three replacement heads fits properly into the head holder.</li>
            <li> I used the old blades during a tour of duty in Afghanistan, starting getting dull after two years of daily use.</li>
            <li> The box shows the correct number,  but  evidently the blades do not fit firmly enough like the original ones, making the razor impossible to use.</li>
            <li> The delivery and packaging was fantastic, but the item description is wrong.</li>
            <li> I have tried expensive Norelco and cheap Norelco razors....</li>
            <li> I have found the Norelco heads in general are not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I have found electric razors work well on one or two days of hair growth but after that you are more pulling out the hairs than cutting them</li>
            <li> More often than not I was ripping hairs out instead of cutting them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My old one was over 3 years old and, needless to say, took a considerable longer time to do the job.  </li>
            <li> I should have replaced them long before I did.  </li>
            <li> Old ones lasted a few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great razor.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe I waited so long to purchase this item.  </li>
            <li> waited to long to replace heads&lt;br /&gt;new</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t let it go that long again.</li>
            <li> It took 4 times as long to shave.</li>
            <li> , they hold an edge for a long time.</li>
            <li> like it the battery holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Why didn&#x27;t I go electric long ago?</li>
            <li> It had the long slots all the way around the head.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking this because my 5 o&#x27;clock shadow hair isn&#x27;t as long as it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t replaced the blades in my razor for a long time</li>
            <li> The actual process of changing the heads was easier than I expected.  </li>
            <li> It works well and is something we have needed for a long time.</li>
            <li> He had gone so long without replacing heads, that the razor was pulling hair out.</li>
            <li> Used them for&lt;br /&gt;Years cuts well as long as the growth</li>
            <li> not too long.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have replaced the blades a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> for a long time.</li>
            <li> I went WAY to long without changing the heads on my razor.</li>
            <li> The shave was still not smooth, and when I put the old heads on, the shave was closer and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a long time electric razor user and this product meets my needs.  </li>
            <li> They are made in the Netherlands, so I&#x27;m hoping I can get a long life out of them..</li>
            <li> This was not a direct replacement as advertised.</li>
            <li> and I agree with that as 2 years was too long.  </li>
            <li> It turned my junky near dead rotary razor into a beard whacking machine.</li>
            <li> As an added bonus, the closer shave did not involve even minor skin irritation.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to decide to purchase this replacement head.  </li>
            <li> had my shaver for a long time and the replacement heads worked well.</li>
            <li> It felt like a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Naturally is your beard is heavy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I wait so long to replace my shaver head cutters.</li>
            <li> Blades cut worse than the old ones they replaced and took me almost twice as long to shave as normal.  </li>
            <li> (For what it&#x27;s worth, I have found that it is unnecessary to replace the heads as often as recommended by Norelco.)</li>
            <li> Works very well on a thick, non-straight beard.</li>
            <li> now I have to follow up with a razor, and I hate using my once loved shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually buying another replacement pack because my blades have worn down again, but they seem to last about as long as you&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li> New ones are always sharp so my shaving time is shorter producing less face irritation.</li>
            <li> I was afraid I would mess up and delayed the changeover , but when I started the change it turned out to be very easy (following the directions given).</li>
            <li> For some reason they just don&#x27;t seem to last as long as the ones that came on the razor but still last about a year and a half.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always just purchased a new shaver when the old one started doing a poor job.</li>
            <li> I can only think that the workmanship on these varies and is less than standard across the product line.</li>
            <li> In fact, I stopped buying the expensive Braun electric razors since this does the job even better and cost less.  </li>
            <li> I had that issue several years ago with a previous model although this one is engineered similarly.  </li>
            <li> At this priced, you can usually find a new Norelco for the price of two sets of heads.</li>
            <li> I had been thinking of buying a new shaver, but no more, The delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li> I have looked for these blades and usually cheaper to buy a new razor.</li>
            <li> So, I feel it&#x27;s a relatively small price to pay to basically have a new shaver every year.</li>
            <li> Not sure the blades are new or refurbished but is improvement.</li>
            <li> This gave me a new shaver for a small price.</li>
            <li> not sure if I should have maybe bought new one</li>
            <li> Easy to replace, a lot less expensive than local retailers charge.</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d pay the crazy half a whole new razor price and restore my razor to new.</li>
            <li> These went right on my razor, and it&#x27;s running and cutting just like new.</li>
            <li> Blades don&#x27;t seem to be sharp as they should be, have to keep going over the face to finally get shaved.  </li>
            <li> One of the three heads doesn&#x27;t ride properly in the shell and its extremely noisy.  </li>
            <li> They work well and seem to last longer than other brands.</li>
            <li> The quality seems equal to any other Norelco replacement heads that I have ever&lt;</li>
            <li> He originally thought they were the wrong model blades/cutters when he got them.  </li>
            <li> I should have changed my heads a long time ago!</li>
            <li> Little tiny pieces for my big hands, but over all it is not that difficult.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I wish I had know about these refills a long time ago!  </li>
            <li> Also replaced the battery(that is a little more difficult)</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend,these replacement blades,as in time,they will dull.</li>
            <li> It took less then 5 minutes to remove, clean and replace the cutting head with the new replacements.  </li>
            <li> It is the only one available for this razor, too expensive - half the price of the razor itself.</li>
            <li> dry...</li>
            <li> My rating is based more on &amp;#34;room for improvement&amp;#34; in the listing than the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may have missed it, but for those that haven&#x27;t previously bought replacement &amp;#34;heads&amp;#34; for this type of razor, &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; means the package includes both &amp;#34;cutters&amp;#34; (the part that does the cutting, that isn&#x27;t externally visible) and &amp;#34;combs&amp;#34; (the part you see while looking at</li>
            <li> As with the Remington heads --- just wash and dry them</li>
            <li> Not sure how long Philips is going to make replacement parts like this for a 14 year old razor.  </li>
            <li> Only takes a few minutes to change them out, and you&#x27;re back in business just like on day one.</li>
            <li> Never New</li>
            <li> They were very easy to replace and mine needed them bad.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the high price replacement blades, this time of year with price match and coupons you can get a break even deal to at least keep the razor you are used to.  </li>
            <li> The replacement heads come as three unmounted cutter assemblies, rather than as a single assembled head as shown in the description.  </li>
            <li> he has limited use of one hand</li>
            <li> not sure if I&#x27;m not cleaning it right or something, not satisfied.</li>
            <li> I believe that person either was sent the wrong blades by mistake or did not realize that these blades fit in a little differently.</li>
            <li> Will have to see if they last as long as the ones for my previous razor.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really no reason for putting up with any discomfort due to old blades (like I did with the previous set).</li>
            <li> It was slick to use Discover card points to pay directly and not come up with $$ out of pocket.</li>
            <li> After three days of not shaving I usually go for the old razor and shave gel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: these replacement heads are not better than old heads.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, like yours truly, it will take a few sessions for it and your skin to get used to each other.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shave &amp;#34;every day without fail&amp;#34;, so these tend to last longer than average for me anyway.</li>
            <li> It took some playing around to get the three loose subassemblies in posiition, then replace the holder (spider), assuring the three points of engagement are made.  </li>
            <li> My experience is that the re-sharpened heads dull just a bit faster than new originals</li>
            <li> Hard to beat the triple header expecially with a new set of blades.</li>
            <li> But you dont realize how dull your razor has gotten until you put in the new ones.  </li>
            <li> I agree with another comment - he starts to break-out when they dull, but new blades correct the problem.</li>
            <li> I noticed that my razor wasn&#x27;t cutting cleanly; so I replaced my heads after ten months.</li>
            <li> After putting these in to my year old shaver I can shave in less than half the time and get a closer shave.</li>
            <li> Definitely would suggest replacing them when the shave quality goes down hill.</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift so as long as he likes it, we like it!!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in that they didn&#x27;t seem to shave any better than the old heads I had used for a year and a half.</li>
            <li> If it weren&#x27;t for that web site mentioned above, I&#x27;d have thrown this Norelco out and bought a Braun (which apparently does the same dumb thing</li>
            <li> The price I paid was much less than local suppliers.</li>
            <li> Finally getting a replacement set after a year and a half.</li>
            <li> and i the price was the same as the local store i usually buy it from.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should note that in my case, these heads were actually a slightly varied design on the tops of the heads, the slits/openings on these heads were different than the originals - I&#x27;m no engineer, but it seems they&#x27;ve improved the design, while maintaining backward compatibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the price is about half of what the big box stores have, if they even have them in stock at those stores.</li>
            <li> and they costed almost half of the total cost for the shaver.</li>
            <li> It was simple; took less than a minute.</li>
            <li> I have tried them both dry and wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> I looked here and found them at half the cost of a local purchase, so I bought two.</li>
            <li> The first batch I bought failed and had to send back for refund.</li>
            <li> can only  set on less then 1/2 of the seat</li>
            <li> However, I previously purchased the same heads which I have used.  </li>
            <li> If anything it just needed new blades because I was such a &amp;#34;rough, tough guy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> After a while dull blades give a bad shave, replace them and enjoy the close shave you had when you first bought your shaver</li>
            <li> One thing that should be noted: I expected to receive a single triangular frame containing the three heads as the illustration implies.</li>
            <li> too bad amazon only gives full returns up to 6 weeks!</li>
            <li> The razor is back to its original pristine sharp cutting.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worthless, which is unfortunate because the shaver itself was pretty good for a year.</li>
            <li> A little expensive to the point where I was questioning myself why I shouldn&#x27;t just go buy a whole new shaver</li>
            <li> I looked into buying just new heads and was surprised at how expensive they were.  </li>
            <li> As for the guy that said his shave was worse with the new heads, perhaps he didn&#x27;t seat them properly.  </li>
            <li> One of the cutting head already has several small blades that are not attached correctly and it not only makes a grinding sound when the razor is on, but it does not cut well.</li>
            <li> I found the instructions on the package to be less clear than they could have been, but it didn&#x27;t take long to figure out - an assembly that holds the blades needs to be removed from the razor; small locking screws that hold the blades in place need to be removed; then the blades themselves need to be removed from the assembly.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that the design of the heads are a little different from the stock heads  </li>
            <li> Where it&#x27;s been starting to give me a little razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> My only complaints are that they took a little effort to swap and the package was quite beat up when I received them.</li>
            <li> Each circular head has little tabs on its edge so that it can only be installed in one orientation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m posting this review just to emphasize that Norelco&#x27;s annual replacement recommendation of your shaving heads is just that... only a recommendation and is perhaps a little bit optimistic.  </li>
            <li> The installation is a little tricky for a person with big hands.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stay sharp for very long...</li>
            <li> Does not stay sharp very long.</li>
            <li> the interior clear hard plastic was intact and the blades themselves were not damaged at all-</li>
            <li> My old heads were geting dull and I didn use the razor for about a year because it wasn&#x27;t cuting.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how dull my old razor blades were until I used these.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize my old shaver heads were so dull.  </li>
            <li> Night and day vs. my old, dull blades.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize my old cutters were so dull.</li>
            <li> The old ones were quite icktified and dull.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how dull the old heads were until I put these in.  </li>
            <li> Close cutting and smooth.</li>
            <li> and I also was able to get rid of some of the painful razor bumps that I get every so often on my face.    </li>
            <li> I bought this replacement cutting head when it was available as a deal of the day from this website.  </li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s shaver was at least 10 years old and he did not use it often.  </li>
            <li> Else, not much to say about the blades.  </li>
            <li> In addition, the cutter heads do not fit properly.  </li>
            <li> Shipping only took a few days to get to me.</li>
            <li> I use to think the harder</li>
            <li> It just took a couple of days longer than expected to ship to my address.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after looking carefully at the Norelco website and the Amazon pictures.  </li>
            <li> Now I wonder if they will even post this review being that it is not a very positave review.   </li>
            <li> My wet /dry</li>
            <li> Worked as I expected.</li>
            <li> product was what I expected and delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li> When installing the cutters, lift them one at a time from the package and be careful to keep the 2 parts of each cutter together as they are matched.  </li>
            <li> Not much to review.  </li>
            <li> Product was as I expected.  </li>
            <li> Worked as expected but way overpriced in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It works but it is obviously not very well made.  </li>
            <li> know what to do, razor is not what I expected..</li>
            <li> Product as expected.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads improved the shaver performance beyond what I expected.  </li>
            <li> They worked as well as expected.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected.</li>
            <li> Not the improvement I expected.</li>
            <li> so they&#x27;re still a tad rough shaving.</li>
            <li> Had to be careful when removing them from the package not to mix up the parts.</li>
            <li> I have not had any trouble out of it, and it was cheaper than any of the local stores.</li>
            <li> I find these work exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Everything was what I expected</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  </li>
            <li> Work as expected.</li>
            <li> Not as expected.</li>
            <li> I suppose the reason for the slots is so the circles can be towards the center of the head.</li>
            <li> That was the product I expected.</li>
            <li> Not much to say, it is a replacement part.  </li>
            <li> Does what is expected.  </li>
            <li> just what was needed and was what expected.</li>
            <li> I cleaned out each part where the hair had gotten caught and created drag on the blades.</li>
            <li> Expected better.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> The product was exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> It lasted for one year as I expected.</li>
            <li> Takes only a few seconds to install</li>
            <li> product worked as expected.</li>
            <li> but not very well</li>
            <li> They work as expected.</li>
            <li> Received what I expected.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor on line for a low price because it was missing a head.</li>
            <li> The shaver heads worked as expected.  </li>
            <li> I do not have a heavy beard and only shave once a day.</li>
            <li> I have trouble properly seating the replacement heads -</li>
            <li> Just what was expected.</li>
            <li> O.E.M. just what I expected.</li>
            <li> This product arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> I use to think the harder</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a replacement part, so there&#x27;s not much to say.</li>
            <li> Yes, It does what I expected.</li>
            <li> Not much to say.</li>
            <li> Not much to say.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has convinced me to try wet shaving with a safety razor and I am hooked.</li>
            <li> It arrived as expected, on time and as described.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  </li>
            <li> They work as expected.</li>
            <li> A few days later</li>
            <li> I expected a part with the three heads mounted.  </li>
            <li> It was exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> just like I expected.</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected, box was not mis-shaped or tampered with in any way.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> All that was expected</li>
            <li> Not much to say about these.</li>
            <li> Just as expected.</li>
            <li> as hoped and as expected</li>
            <li> not much to say about a spare part.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just replacement heads for a razor, not much else can be said about them.</li>
            <li> After replacing the heads, both shavers are as slow as the old HQ9 shaver.  </li>
            <li> I hate shaving with a razor, which is why I own a Norelco.  </li>
            <li> The replacement heads are so expensive that I usually wait until father&#x27;s day to purchase a whole new razor.</li>
            <li> I am wondering if Norelco out-sourced the blades to someone else as the new blades do not fit my razor well as they did in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve subsequently found other reviewers with the same complaint.</li>
            <li> What can I say about cutters; either the cut or they don&#x27;t, plain &amp; simple.</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t be done wrong, but you have to watch what you&#x27;re doing to do it right.</li>
            <li> These replacement shaving heads were so bad, I will go back to the original product.</li>
            <li> takes half as long now to shave.  </li>
            <li> It takes me longer to &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34;, and I put that in quotation marks because I find myself just running the razor over my face twice as long as I did previously, then cleaning up afterward with a blade.  </li>
            <li> the old blades I had let go too long and were very dull.</li>
            <li> and I believe the timing is based upon a single use per day on an average beard.  </li>
            <li> Been using it with the replacement blades for about 2 weeks now and not only is it taking less time to shave, i&#x27;m actually not breaking out as much either (the old blades were probably filthy).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only sorry I waited so long to replace my old ones.</li>
            <li> He has an extremely tough beard and the heads become dull quickly.</li>
            <li> waste your money frequently purchasing an expensive, brand new electric shaver</li>
            <li> I bought these new blades because they&#x27;re a little less expensive than buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> We sent back the first head because it wasn&#x27;t cutting well</li>
            <li> (or have a fancy electric which can do wet shaving) and when your face is dry it is usually not clean.</li>
            <li> My husband is active duty military and has used his razor since he bought it</li>
            <li> WOW!!  UNBELIEVABLE!!  </li>
            <li> took a little long to receive it</li>
            <li> The user, who has a heavy beard and shaves daily, really loves the Norelco electric razor and never wants to be unable to use it.</li>
            <li> I have a facial condition that is difficult to shave with several hundred bumps, My old heads were missing a lot of the whiskers</li>
            <li> They looked shiny and new, and the old ones looked somewhat dingy and dirty, but all in all</li>
            <li> I followed the solution of others, removed the the cutting blades from their covers and used the old head cover with the new blades inserted into them.  </li>
            <li> I generally replace my blades at least once a year.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and work well.  </li>
            <li> I think it is not so sharp ...</li>
            <li> However, this product did not ship until three or four days after the date of my order, and I received no logical explanation from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised that it only had cutting edges on the outside circle.</li>
            <li> Not sure what else to say about this product outside of the header.</li>
            <li> However, it count each small individual blade as one header.  </li>
            <li> Be careful before buying!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased replacement heads before from other sources and they have always lasted 1+ years.</li>
            <li> If there are other dummies out there like me, try this before ordering the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I doubt that they were as sharp as they could have been.  </li>
            <li> The proof will be in the time they last (usually 2 years).</li>
            <li> I replace the heads on my shaver every year or so to keep them sharp.  </li>
            <li> The quality is the same as the ones I have bought in the past.</li>
            <li> If you saw my other review...</li>
            <li> /&gt;They &amp;#34;chatter&amp;#34; .... like a gear is slipping, or !????</li>
            <li> It works great...nice and sharp....</li>
            <li> and this is my 3rd replacement set of head that I have purchased from Amazon over the past 8 years.  </li>
            <li> Was so dissatifed t began searching and studying other rankes.  </li>
            <li> My shaver is sharp again.</li>
            <li> No real difference at all!</li>
            <li> Thanx, arrived expediently my beard enjoys the comfort of a sharp electric blade...</li>
            <li> (the other ones had been in use over a year).</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shave is extremely improved with the replacement blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I  have purchased these razor blade replacements in stores in the past and the product was the same.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was necessary.</li>
            <li> I am not sure I actually saw how those go together</li>
            <li> I did have trouble getting the blades in and the shaver is making strange sounds.</li>
            <li> The blades are not at all sharp.</li>
            <li> These blades stay sharp for longer than a year.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Using the same Norelco I&#x27;ve had for the past 4 years.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads are one set for the Norelco Powertouch, among other razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how sharp they are.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this shaver and now can ALWAYS have sharp blades.</li>
            <li> I used the pop up trimmer to cut the bulk off then shaved with the razor and it came out extremely close.</li>
            <li> In other words.</li>
            <li> I like the Norelco, but the heads are pretty darned expensive.</li>
            <li> It feels like one little blades digs out a little further than the others.  </li>
            <li> and they stay sharp for about 30 hours of shaving.</li>
            <li> I will do this every few years as long as it keeps running.  </li>
            <li> I should have paid attention to the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> One had the HQ8 heads and the other had the HQ9.  </li>
            <li> My Phillips stays sharp and there&#x27;s no plastic going into landfill every week.</li>
            <li> Norelco your just like the other money hungry companies, and you just lost this&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even since my shaver installed it, become sharp and efficient.</li>
            <li> It fits but does not have blades as sharp as the ones that came with the shaver.  </li>
            <li> THEY WERE NOT AS SHARP AS THE ONES WHEN WE BOUGHT THEM</li>
            <li> I wonder if these are either seconds or made by someone other than Norelco, unless Norelco is putting out an inferior product.</li>
            <li> No disassebly of the blade holder on the back side like had been required on past models I have owned.</li>
            <li> Just ordered these the other day</li>
            <li> (No more red irritated skin.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only problem is the price is excessive.  </li>
            <li> And plenty sharp.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried any other brand of Electric razor for over 30 years</li>
            <li> My husband lost one part of the razor down the sink and expected to wait 7-10 days to get the replacement parts.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to replace the cutting heads instead of buying a new razor as long as mine is functioning properly.</li>
            <li> The tripleheader replacement heads are very sharp and quick to shave, although it is a little expensive.</li>
            <li> Shown were the entire head, not just  the little round cutters.</li>
            <li> Only a few bucks but every little bit helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They improve shaver performance and well worth buying about once a year, even though they are a little expensive, even on Amazon.</li>
            <li> When I received them I was a bit concerned since the number of cutting blades per head was about half of the original heads.  </li>
            <li> Almost threw out my razor to get a new one because of poor shaves.</li>
            <li> New blades worse than the used blades I replaced.</li>
            <li> He tends to \\&quot;fix\\&quot; items rather than replacing the broken item with something new,  </li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for approximately 4 years, I change the blades 1x a year around christmas time or the New Year.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use my shaver that much, so maybe the old heads weren&#x27;t in bad shape.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s shaver is several years old but an expensive model.  </li>
            <li> From day 1, the replacements have been terrible and didn&#x27;t get much better after nearly two months break in.  </li>
            <li> They show entire snap in triple razor head in picture but all you get is three new single cutting heads.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is if the blades are a little old (&gt; 6 months) and you push too hard, the blades take a bite out of your face.</li>
            <li> The Norelco people are too dumb, or too socilal-media dim, to react.</li>
            <li> usually, I find the entire razor for less than the replacement blades.</li>
            <li> Thie bad is probably my fault for not reading the full product description but they are the 3 invividual replacement heads and not the single replacement cover with the blades as pictured.</li>
            <li> Not sure about durability and long term performance at this point, but having other Norelco shavers, I&#x27;d expect this product to perform well.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;ll finally shave at least every other day now.</li>
            <li> The new blades decreased my shaving time by half.  </li>
            <li> Price was $8 less than other stores.</li>
            <li> The price was significantly less than other sources reviewed for the product.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding replacement blades at local stores</li>
            <li> These are hard to find locally.</li>
            <li> They will only go in one way, so it&#x27;s hard to make a mistake.</li>
            <li> but when this things blades go dull it does nothing regardless of different techniques.</li>
            <li> These ones have round circles on part of the head so they take a little longer to shave long hair off.  </li>
            <li> If it had not been for the manufacturer encasing the cutters in hard plastic, they definitely would have been damaged.</li>
            <li> No more pulling and ripping the the little tiny hairs out my face as Cosby said.</li>
            <li> Hard to replace, no proper instruction given</li>
            <li> Hard to find these in the local store.</li>
            <li> Not sure if these are authentic Norelco parts or just a bad batch.</li>
            <li> Most of my razors in the past seem to wear out before the heads go bad.</li>
            <li> Not really worth one star.</li>
            <li> I take anticoagulants for a cardiac condition, and even small shaving cuts can be a problem to stop bleeding at times.</li>
            <li> Thanks, mochi3000, sorry for the misunderstanding.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that the photo shows the heads installed</li>
            <li> LEAST every 12 mos\\&quot;  I have used daily for 30 days, and have had no problems.  </li>
            <li> Lasts at least a year with daily use.</li>
            <li> After using these replacement blades for several days, getting them as a Christmas gift, I came here truly expecting a lot of negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I did ask for a back bar that would be at least 4 inches  longer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s average.  </li>
            <li> the product is average.  </li>
            <li> The one plus: I was forced to go back to a razor</li>
            <li> These work worse than the old ones with over a year of use.</li>
            <li> I ordered the replacement blades and they are actually worse than the old worn ones.  </li>
            <li> IT WAS WORSE THAN THE OLD ONE</li>
            <li> they performed as expected and did not give me any trouble.</li>
            <li> My husband just received his new blades a month ago and has just complained about how dull they already seem to be.  </li>
            <li> I stretched a little over 2 years out of them until a small metal piece broke out of the heads due to wear.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how bad my old blades were until I put in the new blades.  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t realized how bad my shaving action was until I put the new cutters in.</li>
            <li> but the shaver slowed down.</li>
            <li> I wait for a sale of course to keep the prices down</li>
            <li> To reset the \\&quot;replace advisor indicator\\&quot;, press and hold down the power button until the razor beeps.</li>
            <li> Thumbs down.</li>
            <li> the down side?  </li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t let me down yet.  </li>
            <li> Of course, over the years things change and quality goes down.</li>
            <li> The blades don&#x27;t stay sharp forever, dummy!</li>
            <li> Forgot how a sharp set feels!</li>
            <li> The blades stay sharp for over a year!  </li>
            <li> The blades stay sharp for over a year!</li>
            <li> sharp again!</li>
            <li> Try different ways diferent positions and they fall out directions very poor and can barely see them.</li>
            <li> The inside plastic container is a little hard to open, and when I did, the heads fell to the floor and scattered.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp ...</li>
            <li> Very sharp no need to apply any pressure when shaving.</li>
            <li> 7310XL razor, they will not fit into that razor due the extended &amp;#34;lips&amp;#34; on the&lt;br /&gt;blade covers.  </li>
            <li> The Norelco Hq8 Spectra Tripleheader Replacement Heads made a dramatic difference after replacing my 1-year old heads.</li>
            <li> Set up auto orders and one less thing to think about</li>
            <li> Also find there&#x27;s much less skin irritation now.  </li>
            <li> The replacement blade has less blade than the one came with the shaver.</li>
            <li> I give this less than one star since the product is of no use to me and will be returned.</li>
            <li> Price was substantially less than in retail stores or from the Philips/Norelco website.</li>
            <li> The razor is lighter than my previous one.  </li>
            <li> less than 1/2 of Canadian stores.</li>
            <li> so much less than in the stores.  </li>
            <li> I was finished in less than a minute and</li>
            <li> At $25/year I think this is less than I&#x27;d spend on blades.  </li>
            <li> I typically rotate the heads every 3-4 months before replacing at the end of the year.</li>
            <li> Way less expensive than the same product at the local Target.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Installation took me about 10 minutes, but it would have been significantly less had I chose to read the instructions.</li>
            <li> It was probably returned from a previous buyer and dumped on me.</li>
            <li> Prices vary slightly.  </li>
            <li> Got it at target for less than 50% off the manufacturer&#x27;s listed price.</li>
            <li> About $4 less than Walmart.</li>
            <li> did that -- buying it from Amazon, of course, and for much less than Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had previously thought that this didn&#x27;t arrive, but I was mistaken.</li>
            <li> I previously bought another brand (although, I didn&#x27;t know it at the time since the item said it was for Norelco).  </li>
            <li> In my previous orders I received the item in a factory blister package with the package imprinted at the manufacturer with the model number and the name.</li>
            <li> This is the slightly tricky part.  </li>
            <li> these are just not adequate.</li>
            <li> Does not give as close of a shave as my previous Norelco.  </li>
            <li> much less razor burn these days.</li>
            <li> Not sure what I did wrong the first time</li>
            <li> Less money than walmart.</li>
            <li> The subject razor heads arrived on schedule and are performing satisfactorily.</li>
            <li> I get less than 30 days out of them, I think they&#x27;ve cheapened the steel.</li>
            <li> I thought these would help and they did some, maybe it takes 5 seconds less time now.</li>
            <li> I received three heads for less than 2/3 rds the cost for one at Target.  </li>
            <li> Took me all of a half a minute.</li>
            <li> Replacement head costs half of the shaver cost.</li>
            <li> give a closer shave in much less time.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t expect anything less than a year out of the replacements as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these previously for my husband</li>
            <li> YOU CANNOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM FOR LESS AT THE STORE.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the new heads are a little expensive.    </li>
            <li> While the other heads always lasted at least 10 months, the last set I ordered lasted only a couple of months before they quit cutting properly.  </li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is it was very difficult to get into the package, installation was easy.</li>
            <li> Disappointment came with the first shave..</li>
            <li> This was the first time I replaced the cutting heads on an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice how my original cutting heads were slowly getting duller over the year, but I did notice my face burning after shaving, so I decided to replace the heads.</li>
            <li> On flat surfaces the cutters do spin but are slipping which produces a poor quality shave.</li>
            <li> The replacement shaver head is less expensive than purchasing a new razor.</li>
            <li> but if you watch, sometimes is it less expensive to just buy a new razor.</li>
            <li> Less expensive than a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry for saving the difference in price between a new razor and just replacing the heads.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, you either have to pay the price for these or get a new razor.  </li>
            <li> I have no idea if these are fake copies of Norelco product, or if a new factory did not follow specs.</li>
            <li> And, a few weeks after I purchased a set, my wife was shopping Amazon on Black Friday and picked up a another set for me at an even lower price ($16.88), with an on-line $5 off from Philips that Amazon automatically provided at checkout.  </li>
            <li> [One slight difference from sets i purchased a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> Expensive and don&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like them to.</li>
            <li> Less expensive as single rather than buying a double package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little costly, but work well.  </li>
            <li> Bought the razor a little over a year ago and although it still removed my beard</li>
            <li> so I was a little concerned about the condition of the replacement blades.  </li>
            <li> There are two little \\&quot;ears\\&quot; at on the perimeter of each head, but my razor does not have indentions for the two little ears.  </li>
            <li> and I save a little in the deal.  </li>
            <li> it was a gift from my son,the cut was getting a little slow&lt;br /&gt;so</li>
            <li> think you should change your ad just a little to let the customer know ,each blade as to be changed in the head of the razor</li>
            <li> A little pricey</li>
            <li> Just a little tricky getting them installed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my razor a little over a year now.</li>
            <li> You twist the clover leaf looking thing and lift the assembly that includes the three little rings that holds the heads on.  </li>
            <li> Just wish they lasted a little longer, they seem to wear out and need replacing too soon.</li>
            <li> There seems to be little point to review a replacement head or refill or some such.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if users have any other choice to replace heasds on Powertouch PT730.</li>
            <li> They slip a little bit when you shave, so it takes a little longer to shave, but the shave is just as close as with the recommended replacements that are no longer manufactured.</li>
            <li> these replacements, although a little pricey, work well.</li>
            <li> But I can tell my shaves are a little closer now.  </li>
            <li> I get this little &amp;#34;ping&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t cut me, but feels like a little needle poke from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Until then you may have a little irritation.</li>
            <li> a little spendy, but if you use this every day for 2 years, they pay for themselves with renewed comfort.</li>
            <li> Will buy again but little pricey.</li>
            <li> Just wish it was a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> They were a little tricky to install, alignment of the parts in the frame that hold the heads were the trickiest part.  </li>
            <li> The price was less by approximately 30% than the price in the local drugstore.</li>
            <li> I mean your face has to be rather dry for electric to work well</li>
            <li> Very dull, creates a bad shave and you have to for 10 minutes to get most hairs.</li>
            <li> Fits as expected!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe that they would be this sharp!!</li>
            <li> The box was crushed and the blades were DULL...  </li>
            <li> Buy Norelco or a generic for slightly less and as with other shavers the replacement heads are too expensive.</li>
            <li> I was about to toss my ten year old Norelco but was feeling bad about doing that.  </li>
            <li> The image on the package displays three cutting heads for the Norelco razor, in the housing, leading the viewer to believe that the whole assembly is what is being purchased.  </li>
            <li> of the reviews I read mentioned that these blades did not fit in their 7310XL.</li>
            <li> Quality product for everyday use</li>
            <li> PUNCH A FEW KEYSTROKES,&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Blade casing did not fit..</li>
            <li> My beard is heavy; so, I will be replacing the heads every six to eight months.</li>
            <li> Norelco suggests it might take a few days for the blades and heads to \\&quot;set,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The heads do not fit my razer.</li>
            <li> The screens on the ones that arrived did not fit my razor.  </li>
            <li> Contrary to label HQ8 does NOT fit all 88__ Norelco.</li>
            <li> Cuts my Heavy beard like a razor.</li>
            <li> I guess it is perhaps because it takes a few shaves for the blades to run in.</li>
            <li> They are shaverheads, not precise tools.  </li>
            <li> Hi quality OEM heads, not cheap knock off.</li>
            <li> I have used my electric shaver for years and replaced the heads few times</li>
            <li> I can only conclude the Heads were defective or of poor quality.</li>
            <li> Wasted my time and now I have to return the item because it states it fits Spectra 7800XL series.  </li>
            <li> BUT WOULD NOT FIT MY NORELCO RAZOR.</li>
            <li> After a few shaves</li>
            <li> Why does an item that weighs just a few ounces warrant an inflated shipping cost like that?</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Electric shavers do not free you from buying blades.</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> They did not fit my shaver.  </li>
            <li> The replacement heads &amp;#34;chatter&amp;#34; when pressed firmly against your cheek.  </li>
            <li> but after I replaced the heads I remembered what I was missing.</li>
            <li> and I do not have a heavy beard.</li>
            <li> I have a 7310 and they do not fit this unit.</li>
            <li> I think this product is over-priced and that&#x27;s why I took the trouble to find it cheaper online.</li>
            <li> new!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In use a few time now</li>
            <li> I think I got the razor itself for the price a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> Did not fit my razor as advertised.  </li>
            <li> and, I find, saves a few dollars along the way.</li>
            <li> but they did not fit the the razor I was buying for im</li>
            <li> While the box might say HQ8 the head covers did not fit into my Norelco razor that was also bought (twice) from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> razor called for hq8 replacement but the screens would not fit</li>
            <li> This bunch has cuaght my whisers a few times and yanked them out.</li>
            <li> but this one would not fit..  </li>
            <li> The replacement did not fit my shaver, although it states to match my shaver model.</li>
            <li> One should keep a few boxes on hand, one for each razor.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be harsh on the skin.  </li>
            <li> The blades won&#x27;t cut my hair at all either, my other old razors in the drawer with dull blades will at least do a poor job of it still</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how dull my other blades were until I replaced them.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;self-sharpening&amp;#34; blades were now pretty dull and made shaving slow and uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> After exhausting all efforts of finding them in local stores ...&amp;#34;a little light-bulb came on&amp;#34; and I knew I could find them here in a snap!</li>
            <li> are razor sharp (duh)</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price with free shipping is impossible to beat!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about making the jump to electric razing, having used traditional razors my entire life.  </li>
            <li> Fixing the blades in the shaver was not easy.</li>
            <li> It seems expensive for what you get but since the product is expected to last a whole year, the price isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> just needed to replace the heads, little bit expensive, for every day shave and does not give you shave irritation and extra money waste on razors.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the directions the first time I bought replacement heads for my husband&#x27;s shaver and got frustrated when the blades fell out of the triangle.  </li>
            <li> it takes a few days for your face to get used to them (or maybe it is the blades breaking in, I am not sure).  </li>
            <li> However, I have in the past used a Vollco sharpener, which I just found in the drawer from my previous Norelco!  </li>
            <li> Seriously it is a treat to shave with sharp blades.  </li>
            <li> They are new cutting heads for my electric razor and do what they are designed to do.</li>
            <li> and I was just in a hurry until I put in these new cutting heads.</li>
            <li> I could almost buy a new razor for what they charge for the replacement cutting heads.</li>
            <li> I will likely replace the blades sooner next time, though even after 12 months I wasn&#x27;t getting a bad shave by any means.</li>
            <li> Those who are not familiar with using the head might push too hard and cut skin.</li>
            <li> It was a little hard for me to put the replacement heads in</li>
            <li> A little hard to put in or would have given 5 stars....</li>
            <li> I am not so rough tough but the instruction manual on the razor told me to change blades each year, and the memory chip in it flashed &amp;</li>
            <li> While I hate to quibble, the plastic that the heads are entombed in is ridiculously tough to cut if you don&#x27;t have super sharp scissors or a machete.  </li>
            <li> HQ9 become dull in a few months.  </li>
            <li> Too bad they cost so much.</li>
            <li> was no more than the gas to drive around looking again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why</li>
            <li> I was using Philips (7290) shaving set from past 4 years.</li>
            <li> no more hair pulling or irritated skin after shaving.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Understandably I was not pleased.</li>
            <li> Usually if I see them in stores they are around $30 to $35 for a set.  </li>
            <li> For the past year</li>
            <li> small 3 pictures</li>
            <li> My husband usually has to replace these every year.  </li>
            <li> but...sad to say I was wrong ..came to know only after opening the pack...</li>
            <li> Usually cheaper than in store.</li>
            <li> Currently chose these because living in Brazil and to expensive to replace my husband&#x27;s razor.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I would buy these again.</li>
            <li> I will be changing them every year if not more often.  </li>
            <li> not sure about the quality of the product itself, if this pack is like this.&lt;br /&gt;im</li>
            <li> not sure i will continue to buy it here in the future.&lt;br /&gt;thanks&lt;br /&gt;Meir</li>
            <li> My opinion is something has changed with this product and it no longer provides as close of a shave as in the past.</li>
            <li> Not sure what to think about these.</li>
            <li> Not sure what else to say.</li>
            <li> The cover to the machine unfortunately does not stay on an the heads rub against things and that could short change the customer.</li>
            <li> Use care to select the correct cutting head model and you can return the old razer to a like-new function.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s had  Norelco shavers in the past too and never replaced the heads</li>
            <li> no more pull when I shave.  </li>
            <li> usual for Philips Norelco</li>
            <li> As usual, Norelco is superb!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> usually go just 1 year between replacements.  </li>
            <li> No more pulling when he shaves.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not magically getting a closer shave, but the act of shaving is smoother.</li>
            <li> They seem to be no better than the HQ6.  </li>
            <li> I was not sure I needed to replace the heads after 1year,  </li>
            <li> reading the small print \\&quot;should be replaced AT</li>
            <li> Shaving is quicker than it had been for the past couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not much more to say...</li>
            <li> Not much more to say about it than that.</li>
            <li> I usually order these annually</li>
            <li> Well I just put them in the shaver two days ago and am pretty disappointed in the shave I&#x27;m getting.</li>
            <li> We ordered these replacement heads and they have worked out well for the past three years.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, had to buy the entire razor head at a substantial price.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this because there&#x27;s nothing wrong with my current Norelco electric, just needed replacement heads so it would perform like it did when it was new.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was difficult and it is not working properly.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, the cost was excessive for what I got.</li>
            <li> Nothing out of the ordinary, but works well with the electric razor.  </li>
            <li> Not sure whether to thank the correct blades for that, or if it&#x27;s just a coincidence.</li>
            <li> Not much more to be said about this product.</li>
            <li> Was not able to use HQ8.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used my Norelco razor for the past 15 years.</li>
            <li> am not sure yo guys why you need 19 word in this review to require review....</li>
            <li> I returned them with a note to the model I needed and within a day a THIRD set of wrong heads came which I returned.</li>
            <li> I think they are expensive but still are less expensive than a new razor.</li>
            <li> Incidentally, there are less expensive places to buy them other than Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure why, but if I miss a day of shaving the next shave can be very irritating, and my face burns, almost as if shaving with a dull razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering replacement heads every year and this was by far the worst set so far.</li>
            <li> The product is not very good quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> just so so, it looks not very good.</li>
            <li> Philips replacement heads continue the shaves of the past before the blades get dull.</li>
            <li> I was a little bit disappointed in the price seeing as my razor is 3 years old.</li>
            <li> aside from ill see how long this...huh.. Replacement lasts!?</li>
            <li> I may buy a new razor because they are so bad.</li>
            <li> ONCE A YEAR I NEED TO CHANGE MY HEADS ON MY RAZOR IN ORDER TO AVOID DULL HEADS.  </li>
            <li> For some reason had a hard time finding this type of head for my electric razor in stores.</li>
            <li> Afterwards the blades must have become dull and the shave was not as close.</li>
            <li> When the razor got so dull</li>
            <li> Then they become dull and don&#x27;t shave as close.</li>
            <li> blades dull.</li>
            <li> But I had used the razor for about a year and had been shaving my head with it for maybe 6 months before the blades were simply to dull to use.</li>
            <li> They do to dull</li>
            <li> I have been replacing the blades on my Norwood for a couple of years, the ha8&#x27;s seem to go dull every 6 month or so.</li>
            <li> I will replace these when they dull up instead of waiting as I did this tme.</li>
            <li> After a bit over a year of using the shaver it was getting dull</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the razor, it was dull blades.</li>
            <li> It is hard to stay focused on.</li>
            <li> so they are hard to find.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how dull my electric razor heads where until I bought and used these replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> Hard to beat the value.</li>
            <li> Hard to find blades in stores but found them here.</li>
            <li> but once I figured it out, it was not that hard.  </li>
            <li> After all, it does not know when the blades get dull.</li>
            <li> I guess over time you don&#x27;t realize how dull the blades get.</li>
            <li> And blades were hard to change, flimsy.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was my razor, but it seems like these blades were dull out of the package.</li>
            <li> These dang things are hard to find in my area ..</li>
            <li> You never realize that the heads are dull, you just shave longer.</li>
            <li> we sometimes have a hard time finding the replacement heads when they are needed</li>
            <li> just how bad I&#x27;d let those old blades get.</li>
            <li> My 94 year old Dad badly needed a replacement.</li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t realize how bad his old blades were.</li>
            <li> I have had it over two years and finally the cutters stopped cutting.</li>
            <li> If you use your electric razor every day you must replace the heads at least one a year.</li>
            <li> It is a different hole pattern on the cutting head, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to matter.</li>
            <li> The description is confusing.</li>
            <li> Do it4 at least once a year.  </li>
            <li> should replace heads at least once per year</li>
            <li> Then, DUH, realized I hadn&#x27;t replaced the blades in years.  </li>
            <li> I got this set of replacement shaving / cutting heads recently, for my Phillips</li>
            <li> A big disappointment.</li>
            <li> The packaging with my razor said to change the blades at least every 12 months.  </li>
            <li> Nothing negative to report</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to change my blades at least once a year from now on.</li>
            <li> My husband has a Norelco electric razor and replaces the blades at least yearly.</li>
            <li> I need a RQ12 replacement head but the negative reviews bothered me.</li>
            <li> The closest shave I have had in at least week................</li>
            <li> But you only get the 3 cutting heads.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Replace your blades at least once a year and your face with thank you.</li>
            <li> They cut at least as well as the heads supplied with the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but my complaint must have got loss.</li>
            <li> Not a total disappointment</li>
            <li> How naive of me to think that they would do that.</li>
            <li> It is only the 3 cutting heads.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE SEEN SOME NEGATIVE REVIEWS ABOUT THE SHARPNESS, BUT I THINK THAT SOMEONE MAY NOT HAVE INSTALLED THEM CORRECTLY.  </li>
            <li> They have not been late once.  </li>
            <li> There was negative thing, that&#x27;s the noise.</li>
            <li> Have been installed for at least 30 days.</li>
            <li> No spectacular change in performance, but I&#x27;m a newbie and thus made the change when mama said I should, not after two weeks of shag.</li>
            <li> The heads should be replaced at least yearly</li>
            <li> Get them twice a year at least.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would come as a generic brand</li>
            <li> Then again I don&#x27;t have a thick beard at all.</li>
            <li> The replacement blades are doing much worse job of cutting hairs, leaving random short and long ones all over my face.  </li>
            <li> No more nicks!</li>
            <li> Smoother, closer shave and no more ripping hairs!</li>
            <li> Not sure I would buy another Norelco?!</li>
            <li> No better buy!  </li>
            <li> My razor seemed to be shaving less well after about that time, so I shopped for the least expensive set</li>
            <li> FIVE &amp; HALF YEARS AGO!!!</li>
            <li> A little expensive but at least it works.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I bought a couple of sets - they become hard to find or damned expensive in a few years.  </li>
            <li> Came in a timely fashion in one of those impossible to open plastic packages but does what it was purchased to do.</li>
            <li> This flaw in replacements parts will seriously impact my purchase of another Norelco product</li>
            <li> The razor is just convenient for me opposed to disposeable blades which would be less expensive.  </li>
            <li> I find this ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> And they were a little bit on the expensive side.  </li>
            <li> Also, it was a little difficult to install the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Little did I know replacement heads are expensive.</li>
            <li> The instant the head goes over a curved portion of the face the cutter gear skips badly making a racket.</li>
            <li> Not good blades and overpriced.  </li>
            <li> It was difficult getting the screen in as it did not fit</li>
            <li> Changed em out, and the face, as ugly as it is, is back to being manageable.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d still be frustrated and had to go back to razors, never figuring out what the heck went</li>
            <li> These blades are not nearly  as good as the ones that came with my razor.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> not good for 7310 series.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit like another silly unnecessary thing</li>
            <li> Makes Amazon look bad, even though it&#x27;s not their fault the seller has real well done FAKE products!</li>
            <li> my bad for waiting so long to replace the blades.</li>
            <li> Duh!</li>
            <li> Disappointed when only one arrived.</li>
            <li> But what is supposed to is kinda weak.</li>
            <li> The blades in my Norelco razor were getting very dull.</li>
            <li> I had a very hard time finding these until I found them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s very hard to use.  </li>
            <li> VERY HARD TO INSTALL .</li>
            <li> VERY DULL.</li>
            <li> My previous blades had three concentric circles on each of the three cutting heads.</li>
            <li> Very poor no better than the ones in there</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with a tough beard like mine.</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard and replace them every 2 - 3 months.</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy with the purchase and haven&#x27;t used that razor in a month - I have went back to the Schick Quatro.</li>
            <li> I always used Gillette razors, but they became so expensive and dull within a week.</li>
            <li> What arrives is three individual cutting heads with the cutting blades inside.  </li>
            <li> Some will say it is an unnecessary expense but for me it&#x27;s a must.</li>
            <li> I am saving up to buy a different razor, because I have no intention of paying another $30 for worthless blades.</li>
            <li> about $50,the package was broken a little,but don&#x27;t effect to use in life</li>
            <li> Look like OEM to me - haven&#x27;t broken them in yet after one shave</li>
            <li> I suspect that I paid for a poor quality knock-off set.  </li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s not happy with the results.</li>
            <li> These are poor quality.  </li>
            <li> I still have an unusable razor with a broken housing.</li>
            <li> (Maybe not a great shaver</li>
            <li> However, the results are not great.  </li>
            <li> Not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I AM NOT HAPPY</li>
            <li> I GET A WORSE SHAVE NOW THAN EVER BEFORE.  </li>
            <li> , I actually bought a clone set on eBay, absolutely worthless.</li>
            <li> Norelco stand behind there products</li>
            <li> It now takes forever to shave and leaves behind lots of hairs.</li>
            <li> I fail to understand the negative reviews that have been posted, I have not experienced any of those issues.</li>
            <li> but usually you wait until you notice the razor isn&#x27;t cutting like it used to.</li>
            <li> Made shaving a lot less painful.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed that the head came in three parts not as a complete replaceable head</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how dull my cutting head had become.  </li>
            <li> But now, I am afraid the Norelco has gone dull again</li>
            <li> a fake (poorly made) .Next</li>
            <li> Escellent blkades - purchased Chinese off brand and was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was getting a bad shave for years before realizing that my Norelco blades were too dull.  </li>
            <li> They built this wrong.</li>
            <li> After installing the cutter heads I got a lousy shave.  </li>
            <li> One can dread replacing things like this, as they&#x27;re sometimes made deliberately difficult.</li>
            <li> , you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> The heads were difficult to install,&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> (they become useless after 2 days)</li>
            <li> Required review comments are useless</li>
            <li> the way I was raised that if I were to do some one wrong or not serve them correctly</li>
            <li> I think there is a problem with the links on the website that result in getting the wrong replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Sad.</li>
            <li> Considering these are some of the cheaper replacement heads you can find, you cannot go wrong giving these a try.</li>
            <li> They haven&#x27;t failed in any way.</li>
            <li> and why are these so expensive?</li>
            <li> hopes this helps some women out there that think this is wrong</li>
            <li> could not be happier, order them today you won&#x27;t be sorry</li>
            <li> They are expensive.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It can be used plugged in when the battery finally fails or stops before I am done</li>
            <li> I was skeptical until I used the razor after installing these.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I canceled and received a credit for the order.  </li>
            <li> Oh my goodness these are difficult to get into place.</li>
            <li> but 1 month (even shaving my head and beard) is useless.</li>
            <li> there are no instructions with the merchandise, the replacement  heads are useless, without instructions or as received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wallace Berrie</li>
            <li> I have bought another set but by accident ordered the wrong ones (HQ9).</li>
            <li> I purchased the wrong replacements heads.  </li>
            <li> Expensive IMO</li>
            <li> Not too difficult to install.</li>
            <li> (it will go together wrong).  </li>
            <li> Just wish they weren&#x27;t soooo expensive.</li>
            <li> These things are expensive.  </li>
            <li> WRONG.  </li>
            <li> I dreaded having to change my shaver&#x27;s head because it used to be so complicated that when I could not figure it out I just bought another razor.</li>
            <li> Expensive for a refill</li>
            <li> So way too expensive for just the heads.</li>
            <li> Yes they&#x27;re expensive, but cheaper than the drugstore..</li>
            <li> my one star rating has nothing to do with the product.i ordered the wrong head for my razor and therefor didn&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li> as they can be difficult to get with the razor....</li>
            <li> Blades were difficult to align.  </li>
            <li> A bit expensive</li>
            <li> worked well after a somewhat difficult instillation.</li>
            <li> politicians are corrupt</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it didm´t</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace the blades on my husband&#x27;s shaver and I think the shaver is flawed or these replacements.  </li>
            <li> disappointed not better in getting a shave</li>
            <li> The razor itself makes replacement a bit difficult -</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with the replacement blades.  </li>
            <li> These replacement blades are so expensive.  </li>
            <li> I am not impressed with the technology of electric shavers, and the fact you now have to replace the blades every year.</li>
            <li> I wish the blade wasn&#x27;t so expensive</li>
            <li> All shaver replacement heads seem a bit expensive to me.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with norelco products.</li>
            <li> They are the wrong size.</li>
            <li> I do wish the replacements weren&#x27;t quite so expensive.</li>
            <li> Useless buying.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> Wrong size heads....</li>
            <li> and I hated it due to the irritation.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed and frustrated they do not fit.</li>
            <li> Guess I was wrong, these cutting heads are all the difference.</li>
            <li> Just dont buy the 2 pack thats crazy expensive like triple the cost .  </li>
            <li> It is too bad these are so expensive.</li>
            <li> it felt like they were pulling my whiskers out instead of cutting them off.</li>
            <li> I purchased the shaver two years ago and it just wasn&#x27;t cutting well anymore.</li>
            <li> Finding replacement cutting heads is sometimes a challenge.  </li>
            <li> Replacement also involves cutting leads and soldering the batteries in place; it does require a bit of soldering knowledge.</li>
            <li> When the blades stop cutting.</li>
            <li> You have to dissemble cutting heads and re-install into your existing cover.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it wasn&#x27;t running or cutting.</li>
            <li> It helps to replace the cutting assemblies once a year.</li>
            <li> My razor was cutting my face instead of shaving it.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and is cutting whiskers instead of pushing them into the skin.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll never regret it, though you have to replace the cutting head about once a year to insure that your shave matches blade quality.</li>
            <li> This was a disappointment, after a quarter century of using Norelco shavers.</li>
            <li> and I had the replacement cutting head.  </li>
            <li> a bit awkward to install as pieces fall out.</li>
            <li> I like that you get all the parts that touch your face when you shave not just the cutting blades, including the slots that hold them as well and the part that aligns the heads in the shaver.</li>
            <li> My Norellco razor was just not \\&quot;cutting it\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> They may have been quality blades in the past, but they are not!!!!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> how expensive the heads were until i went looking at a nearby brick and mortar store which carried my razor but no replacement heads!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> Something is wrong!  </li>
            <li> So if somehow you receive fake cutters and combs you will be greatly disappointed.</li>
            <li> There is something very wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> Norelco encourages its customers to replaces parts often and they are very expensive.</li>
            <li> And I can&#x27;t wrap my brain around the idea that Norelco would be so idiotic as to sell product lines deliberately crippled.</li>
            <li> When cleaning , the heads sometime fall into the sink and would be impossible to match without my markings.</li>
            <li> Almost impossible to get to.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t feel too bad replacing it, but I decided to give these a shot.</li>
            <li> Stopped using my Norelco because the razor burn on my neck was so bad.  </li>
            <li> Just what the doctor ordered.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Norelco razors for years and expect to change blades every year, never had a bad set.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> shaves were so bad I could not believe Norelco would sell a piece of junk like this.</li>
            <li> I came across a site called PaulpersDime.com, which reviews all the shavers including al lthe Norelco models, and one piece of advice changed everything: The cheaper models, like the one I bought, are saddled with badly designed heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it was just as bad as before.</li>
            <li> bad they stoped selling the 8883XL shaver</li>
            <li> but maybe I just got a set of bad ones.</li>
            <li> Yet, all three wouldn&#x27;t be bad would they?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Merry Christmas!t, all three wouldn&#x27;t be bad</li>
            <li> Price isn&#x27;t bad.  </li>
            <li> and it was badly needed.</li>
            <li> frustrated by the experience.</li>
            <li> husband not happy, horrible shave.</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed by Amazon on anything I&#x27;ve bought from them - going on three years and over a dozen products.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in sharpness.  </li>
            <li> I am truly disappointed with AMAZON.</li>
            <li> What i recieved  was  3 seperate blades that was difficult to install:(!!  </li>
            <li> I was somewhat disappointed in these replacement blades.  </li>
            <li> Gives a close shave without cutting your face!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the shave I was getting from the shaver.  </li>
            <li> but what a disappointment!</li>
            <li> I am disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Was somewhat disappointed in the length of time it takes to shave.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed with the lack of sharpness to the blades.</li>
            <li> And use this seller, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing...</li>
            <li> Very disappointing, and I will not be replacing my razor with a philips Norelco, which is a shame, since I have been using their products for 15 years.</li>
            <li> i will re-buy them but hate leaving a comment on a razor replacement</li>
            <li> In order to stop annoying e-mails, this is my review on this product.</li>
            <li> This replacement head is annoying to put on.</li>
            <li> but I really hate having to buy them.  </li>
            <li> The quality of the trim is so bad that I had to throw this away and switch to a Braun shaver.&lt;br /&gt;The customer service is also horrible.</li>
            <li> I KEPT THE BAD BLADES!</li>
            <li> He HATED shaving.</li>
            <li> Needed very badly.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in these.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> how to entice the customer to spend money, yet the truth is that as time goes by it gets extreemely complicated to SHOP!!!</li>
            <li> It shave worst than what it did before changing the heads...</li>
            <li> ppl are outrageous to do so!</li>
            <li> Have had a terrible time replacing the heads.</li>
            <li> The worst part of the experience has always been shaving my neck:</li>
            <li> Convenient to have item shipped to my house since I hate shopping!</li>
            <li> and these are the worst ones yet.</li>
            <li> Been needing these for some time but couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere but for an outrageous price.</li>
            <li> This purchase was the worst I have made on amazon.  </li>
            <li> Terrible design.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> As described. Gives a good, clean shave</li>
            <li> It works fine.  Does the job it&#x27; supposed to do.</li>
            <li> The packaging was excellent and delivery was prompt.  The replacement HQ8 heads were new and original and  work fine.  The price was was a real saver compared to retail.</li>
            <li> Working great in my shaver!</li>
            <li> Dropped right in and works well.</li>
            <li> They work... at about the level that my year-old blades did. Looks like I unfortunately got a set that is poor quality, unlike most of the people who have reviewed very positively. I can only think that the workmanship on these varies and is less than standard across the product line. I will soon have to bite the bullet and spend double for the actual Norelco factory blades.</li>
            <li> Easy to replace and works well I replace my heads yearly no complaints</li>
            <li> very good  excellent&lt;br /&gt;, Thanks  and  very  fast  delivery</li>
            <li> AS USUAL, FAST DELIVERY, GOOD VALUE FOR PRICE!</li>
            <li> Norelco suggest a year between changes, I get about 3 months. Maybe it&#x27;s my beard????</li>
            <li> A little costly, but work well.  These were purchased for my Dad who is 82 and doesn&#x27;t want to use a blade any longer and we all feel safer with the electric razor, but thought he blades would last longer.  The ones that came with the razor wore out somewhat quickly.  I guess this is the equivalent of changing individual blade cartridges.</li>
            <li> Best deal is to buy this with subscribe and save so you can get it a lot cheaper than anywhere else.  Else, not much to say about the blades.  They simply work.  Replace as you need them.  I held out for about 1.5 years but probably should have changed at 1 year.  You&#x27;ll know because the shave takes more passes.  Time is money so it&#x27;s well worth spending for a replacement blade.</li>
            <li> This is a repeat buy for my son. Overall good product but a bit on the pricey side.</li>
            <li> Bought this before, multiple times. They last about a year for me so are an excellent buy.</li>
            <li> Same as always.  Just replacement heads</li>
            <li> Made my razor work like new.</li>
            <li> The new Norelco heads returned the razor to its original capabilities.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I need A+++</li>
            <li> great fit and good cutting cheaper than a new razor.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in a timely manner and as described.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say that there is any difference</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my husband and he loves it and the price was great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver and these heads for years with no problems.</li>
            <li> They are just slightly better than my 20 year olds.</li>
            <li> THESE HEADS MAKE AN OLD SHAVER LIKE A NEW ONE</li>
            <li> Not good blades and overpriced.  Don&#x27;t think they are original manufacturer blades.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how dull my cutting head had become.  The new replacement is great and provides a really close shave.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement unit . Easy to replace. Shaver is like new now !</li>
            <li> I had the original heads from 6 years ago.  Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference with the new ones.  I thought i would get a much closer shave.</li>
            <li> Just love this product.  I hate shaving with a razor, which is why I own a Norelco.  Amazon is a great web site because I can get really good deals.</li>
            <li> cheaper than a replacement razor and works great..i would recommen this..great for a gift or just as a replacement head..</li>
            <li> They built this wrong. The heads will &amp;#34;float&amp;#34; down too far and become recessed every time I used it, even with a light touch.</li>
            <li> Perfect and a good price!</li>
            <li> Fits my razor well &amp; has saved me from having to purchase a new razor.  Comparable replacements in a store would have cost as much as a new razor</li>
            <li> Easy replacement and more cost effective than buying a whole new razor.</li>
            <li> the experience on this order was wonderful. the product is excellent arrived in perfect condition , price was great and I would deferenty recomend to anyone/</li>
            <li> it was the right part and works fine for the money you can not go wrong will buy again when needed</li>
            <li> Brand name replacement part. Works well. Fairly simple installation</li>
            <li> The blades that came with my razor finally gave out...it felt like they were pulling my whiskers out instead of cutting them off. When I put these replacements in, I was amazed at just how bad I&#x27;d let those old blades get. My razor again gives me a close, smooth shave without any discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original blades lasted over two years, but I&#x27;ll probably not wait that long to replace these. There&#x27;s really no reason for putting up with any discomfort due to old blades (like I did with the previous set).</li>
            <li> These replacement heads work well in my Norelco shaver. I only dropped one of them getting them installed. They immediately improved my shaving experience.</li>
            <li> These heads were noiser than the ones that came with the razor so I kept the original ones rather than throwing them out</li>
            <li> Standard replacement razors. Work fine for me</li>
            <li> This was supposed to be the exact replacement for the cutter heads for my Phillips electric shaver.  It appears the Phillips has changed the design to reduce the number of blades on each cutter.  In addition, the cutter heads do not fit properly.  After installing the cutter heads I got a lousy shave.  I went back to my old cutter heads and even though they were old they at least gave me a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend Phillip products to anyone.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and easy to replace.  Does not do that great on my neck area, but I just dry shave that with a razor to get the last hairs; it is still better than doing a full shave with a razor.</li>
            <li> my Norelco shaver was taking a long time to shave, ordered new heads and got them in record time. it is like a new razor, would recemend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I sent it back because it wasn&#x27;t the right.</li>
            <li> Saved time by buying online and price was good.</li>
            <li> Great product at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Shavinf is so much  better when you chane the blades as recommended.</li>
            <li> After about a year, my original shaving heads seemed rather dull and I bought and installed a new set.  They are just as good as the original and I&#x27;m shaving again with no discomfort.</li>
            <li> Does great in my razor.  Better than buying new razor. Should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Price was good and it was as expected</li>
            <li> My husband has purchased other replacement heads in the past that were never as sharp as the original...These blades are just as good as the original ones.  He&#x27;s now clean shaven in much less time because they do the job.</li>
            <li> ONCE A YEAR I NEED TO CHANGE MY HEADS ON MY RAZOR IN ORDER TO AVOID DULL HEADS.  THIS ITEM IS NOT A CHEAP ITEM, BUT EASILY FOUND ON THE INTERNED.  THIS, HOWEVER, WAS AT A GOOD PRICE.</li>
            <li> One can dread replacing things like this, as they&#x27;re sometimes made deliberately difficult. This one is a snap, and it really does make the shave excellent and quiet!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered several of these over the years and they are worth every penny.  I recommend replacing these heads whenever you get the warning in order to have a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> The replacement shaver head is less expensive than purchasing a new razor.</li>
            <li> I have a Philips Norelco 7310XL electric shaver. I have had it over two years and finally the cutters stopped cutting. I noticed that these replacement blades were half the price of an entire new shaver. However, my shaver is still running well on battery so I figured I would buy these replacements and save myself some money.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I did. The shaver runs great with these replacement blades and cuts much better. As a matter of fact, before the blades completely quit it would pull my hair a little. Now it cuts without pulling any hairs. I also don&#x27;t have to make as many passes to get the same results, saving me time.&lt;br /&gt;Some of the reviews I read mentioned that these blades did not fit in their 7310XL. I believe that person either was sent the wrong blades by mistake or did not realize that these blades fit in a little differently. They are shaped slightly different so you can only put them in one way and not just drop them in any direction. In my opinion this is an improvement to the design because now the blade covers will not have any chance of spinning with the blades.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re doing a great job!  Keep up the good work!</li>
            <li> These are the best blades going. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Bought the replacement heads for my husbands shaver.  They perform as always in an excellent manner.  Good buy and reasonable</li>
            <li> My old heads were geting dull and I didn use the razor for about a year because it wasn&#x27;t cuting. These new ones are sharp and great. I&#x27;m a happy guy.</li>
            <li> I waited for 15 months before changing heads on my Norelco: mistake. They recommend 1 year replacement, and that&#x27;s the route to go. The new replacement heads work like a charm.</li>
            <li> Very poor no better than the ones in there about 8 years old I will never buy a Norelco Product again</li>
            <li> Ordered these replacement heads for my husband&#x27;s razor didn&#x27;t last very long so we will not be ordering anymore replacement heads for this razor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them for years.  They always work.</li>
            <li> still pefer abetter shave with a blade</li>
            <li> This head works as expected like the one that came on shaver when it was new.  It arrived timely, was priced right, and I would buy again when needed.</li>
            <li> Restored razor to like new again.  Clean comfortable shave. Easy to replace, a lot less expensive than local retailers charge.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding replacement blades at local stores so I use Amazon.  Better price and fast shipping, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> After several years I thought purchasing new replacement heads would renew my electric razor. I didn&#x27;t see/feel any difference what so ever. Save your money and put it towards a new razor instead. Now my battery is starting to go.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads are so expensive that I usually wait until father&#x27;s day to purchase a whole new razor. That&#x27;s no longer the case now that I can buy the replacement heads so cheaply at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Hey, these are factory replacement blades, what else can you say. They work like the originals.</li>
            <li> They fit as described.</li>
            <li> We are satisfied with the replacement heads for our shaver.  It was easy to replace the old heads.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> These heads arrived on time and now my electric razor works fine.</li>
            <li> Oh the difference fresh blades make!  They work great and make shaving so much easier now!</li>
            <li> I purchased the package of Norelco HQ8 replacement blades and cannot believe the difference in my razor. Great service from Amazon.com as always.</li>
            <li> Not much needs to be said about this product, they are perfect in every way!</li>
            <li> the razor heads arrived quickly and in excellent/new condition, just as advertised.  they work extremely well - like a new razor without the new razor cost.</li>
            <li> Quality product for everyday use</li>
            <li> the original shave head lasted 3 years, the replacement has worn out in 3 months</li>
            <li> No matter what stay with the original NORELCO brand.&lt;br /&gt;I took heed and again went with the brand name and exact replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Bought the razor a little over a year ago and although it still removed my beard it took a lot longer than it did when new. Installation of the new heads was a breeze even without the instructions and now I&#x27;m back to new again. A lot cheaper than a new razor.</li>
            <li> Replaced the heads (probably waited too long), and it&#x27;s just like a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Works great! Kind if a pain to change but luckly you only change them about every 12 months</li>
            <li> Everything AS Said Thanks ++++++++</li>
            <li> works great   didnt know it would make such a difference  takes half as long now to shave.  should have done this  a lot earlier.</li>
            <li> The blades are standard replacement and come in a package of 3. The package is difficult to open without a pair of scissors handy.</li>
            <li> I discovered that my razor is about 18 mo old, so I figured it was past time for new heads and I was right. Well I throughly cleaned my razor, put in the new heads and it now works like a new one. Now I get a better/more comfortable shave, but I just wished I&#x27;d done it sooner, oh well I&#x27;ll know next time to keep a better watch on time of use.</li>
            <li> For some reason had a hard time finding this type of head for my electric razor in stores. Went online on Amazon and was able to find with ease. I was a little bit disappointed in the price seeing as my razor is 3 years old. But I guess you get what you pay for and this work great and the shave is way much better.</li>
            <li> I have purchased shaver heads from Amazon in the past and have always been impressed by the quick service. The product from the manufacturer is an OEM part and makes my shaver perform exceptionally well. 5 stars all around.</li>
            <li> Like a brand new razor now.</li>
            <li> Have been using them daily for the last 6 months and they&#x27;re still going strong. Great item that won&#x27;t break or clog with hair.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000068PBT Philips Norelco HQ8  Spectra Tripleheader Replacement Heads]]I checked online and in stores, and found this product to be the best price at Amazon.com.  It&#x27;s also a great product, producing a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads arrived in good order, and they were relatively easy to install onto the shaver. Might be my imagination, but I think the original heads gave me a better shave.</li>
            <li> THAN BUY ONE AS I PAID $27.75 FOR THE SECOND ONE..THE REPLACEMENT HEAD IS $24 TO $27  ONLY...IF YOU CAN GET THE 2 SHAVER&#x27;S UNDER $28.00</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the service, but these blades were NOT made for extra tough beards.  My husband just received his new blades a month ago and has just complained about how dull they already seem to be.  Then, again, to be fair, he does have an extra tough beard and there simply may not be ANY blade that can last him long enough.</li>
            <li> The heads were very easy to replace.  They are sharp and work well.  I wish they weren&#x27;t so pricey but I guess that&#x27;s the part of the electric razor that has the most value.  The first heads lasted around 6 - 8 months, we&#x27;ll see how long these last.  I will buy again when these wear out.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit. Razor now shaves like new again.</li>
            <li> This can not be the original replacement head; since it barely works!</li>
            <li> First shave today with the replacement blades from Amazon. They are marked as Phillips Norelco and their appearance would indicate that they are genuine. I am 76 years old and never Jane deviated from being a Norelco user. After a most uncomfortable shave my face was still full of moderate stubble. There is something very wrong with this product. I sincerely don&#x27;t believe that it is my doing after all these sixty plus shaving years with Norelco shavers.</li>
            <li> Makes dear hubby&#x27;s razor work like new again.</li>
            <li> These seem to wear out much faster than the old Norelco blades I remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not that great. Buying the best next time and spending the $$</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of ordering these online.  I have trouble finding the type I need at stores, and good luck calling ahead to see if they have them.  Set up auto orders and one less thing to think about</li>
            <li> OEM Product that works great.</li>
            <li> shipped quickly, great price!</li>
            <li> It was difficult getting the screen in as it did not fit so I used the old screen. Otherwise it works well now with the old screen.</li>
            <li> They work great, never realized how wore out my other ones were till I put the news ones in.</li>
            <li> Cutters were not include not did they say that they were.</li>
            <li> After going over 4 years without buying new blades, it was definitely time to so.  Immediately, after replacing the blades, my razor perfomed like new again.  I probably will not go 4 years again!</li>
            <li> My electric razor was getting pretty dull.  Did some searching on the internet and price comparison.  Amazon was the best price and, with Prime deliver, I saved there too.  My shaver is great now...thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have new blades. I hope they last 6 months.</li>
            <li> I purchased the shaver two years ago and it just wasn&#x27;t cutting well anymore. Yes, I should have changed the heads sooner. The new heads were easy to install and it now works like new.</li>
            <li> Like many products today, one must nearly destroy the product to get it out of the tamper proof packaging. &lt;br /&gt;Once unpacked, the heads were more difficult to replace correctly than I had imagined or hoped for, but I finally got the job done and the new heads shave quite well.</li>
            <li> Good transaction, replacement heads working fine.</li>
            <li> very good razor shaved very closed</li>
            <li> Exactly what my husband was looking for</li>
            <li> I received this product about a month ago.  I can&#x27;t believe the difference in the shave I now get!  The price I paid was much less than local suppliers. I wish I had done it months sooner. &lt;br /&gt;As always, my total experience with Amazon.com has been great. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;BR</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco for many years. They have always been good.</li>
            <li> This replacement head for my electric razor is a good one, although I have to go over the same area on my face several times to get a close shave.  Those who are not familiar with using the head might push too hard and cut skin.</li>
            <li> With hundreds of models, parts styles, colors and gender pre determined shaving machines one would think&lt;br /&gt;that a powerful search ENGINE out there would help in finding replacement heads or cutters would be a snap !!!&lt;br /&gt;NOT !! there are so many styles, part numbers, combinations, registered Marks, Trade marks, colors, shapes, functions, names and the like that its an ocean of useless information thet the consumer gets thrown into. SIMPLIFY AND ORGANIZE YOUR DATABASES SOI THE CUSTOMERS, SPECIALLY MEN, CAN GET IN, PUNCH A FEW KEYSTROKES,&lt;br /&gt;SPEND MONEY AND GET HE TELL OUT.&lt;br /&gt;BUT NOOOO !!! My Norelco shaver is fairly new. one or two years at the most. yet it was a nightmare to find replacement heads for it. everyone else&#x27;s models and codes are listed exept MINE !!! what the hell? You people want to sell and spend lotsa time and money \\&quot;thinking\\&quot; ( paradox) how to entice the customer to spend money, yet the truth is that as time goes by it gets extreemely complicated to SHOP!!!</li>
            <li> If you need HQ8 size replacement heads for your Norelco shaver, this is exactly what you want.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads for the Norelco Spectra make it once again like new.  It is still a pleasure to use the shaver with these new heads.</li>
            <li> 5 star!Every part of the process went as it should have.</li>
            <li> In all fairness, I cannot yet rate this item.  I purchased it as a replacement for future need.  However, if it works as the present heads do now, I am well satisfied.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for my razor, quality product, and very easy to install.</li>
            <li> I replaced the heads on both of my Norelco Spectra razors.  The replacement was straighforward and the razors are like new again. (For what it&#x27;s worth, I have found that it is unnecessary to replace the heads as often as recommended by Norelco.) I could have purchased them at local discount store but all the stores in my area were out of stock.  This was simple and easy---delivered to the house and shipping was no more than the gas to drive around looking again.</li>
            <li> Great product at a good price. Saved a lot of money by not having to buy a complete new razor unit.</li>
            <li> The heads are very easy to replace and result in a much improved shave over the one-year old heads I was using.  My only complaint is that the new heads are a little expensive.    I would participate in the Amazon automatic re-purchase option if Amazon offered a order annually option rather than the current maximum 6-months option.</li>
            <li> Finally getting a replacement set after a year and a half. The old ones are still working, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt to replace now. These heads work really well and I&#x27;ve found that they seems to actually shave better than the HQ9. Been satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all good. The shaver blades are excellent and reasonably priced. Shipping only took a few days to get to me.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what is going on, but this is the third time I have bought replacement blades and  this time they don&#x27;t quite fit my razor.  They cut and shave OK, but they bind on the razer as I cut.  It is like they don&#x27;t fit my razor exactly.   When I shave the razors stop as they bind with the inner workings of the shaver. I am wondering if Norelco out-sourced the blades to someone else as the new blades do not fit my razor well as they did in the past.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet but I know they will be fine as I have ordered here before.</li>
            <li> The new heads made a big difference in the performance of my razor.  I would definitely recommend getting new heads every couple of years.</li>
            <li> I was delighted to be able to rejuvinate my razor. Perfect product for a very good price.</li>
            <li> Thought I needed another shaver until I got these.  My unit cuts like new, I&#x27;ll try this again.</li>
            <li> The Blade casing did not fit..But the blades were the same as those they replaced ! I am Satisfied !</li>
            <li> I use to think the harder I press the razor, the better it would get those stray hairs. I discovered that if I simply use a light touch and not press so hard then it got those hairs much better and with NO MORE RAZOR BURN &amp;lt;3.&lt;br /&gt;happy shaving.</li>
            <li> Arrived in time for Christmas as needed.  Package it came in was nearly destroyed so I was a little concerned about the condition of the replacement blades.  They were fine.</li>
            <li> This is the second set of replacement blades that I have bought through Amazon. The first set dulled rather quickly (4- 6 Wks.) So far the second set seems to be holding a sharper edge.</li>
            <li> Direct replacement blades.  Very easy to replace and made a huge difference in shaver performance.  Also find there&#x27;s much less skin irritation now.  Good prices - doubly so with free ground-saver shipping.</li>
            <li> Factory Norelco replacement blades purchased at a good price with free shipping.  Love a close shave with quality replacement heads on my Norelco electric razor.  Should last another 16 months.</li>
            <li> I think it is not so sharp ...</li>
            <li> I was amazed at the ease with which I was able to purchase the Norelco blades.  I sure didn&#x27;t know previously how much money could be saved by purchasing items on Amazon.  I certainly recommend this from now on and I will pass this information on to my family and friends.     MrG</li>
            <li> These work great and have lasted for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, but poor service from Amazon.  I requested free shipping, and I understand shipping times from date of mailing until date of receipt.  However, this product did not ship until three or four days after the date of my order, and I received no logical explanation from Amazon.  (Christmas orders from Amazon received excellent service, so I can&#x27;t understand the long delay here.)  They finally offered me a courtesy $10 credit on my next order, but prompt fulfillment of order would have been much better.</li>
            <li> Such a great price! I&#x27;ve looked in store and they sell them for around $25-$35 in Walmart.</li>
            <li> Great replacement blades. Made shaving a lot less painful.</li>
            <li> It was a disaster.  We sent back the first head because it wasn&#x27;t cutting well and when we sent it back for a replacement, my husband included parts that he shouldn&#x27;t have.  The actual replacement went very efficiently but we were not able to put the shaver back together so it is now out of the picture entirely.  As I said, a disaster, most of it our fault.  Old folks should be let out only occasionally!</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered and needed. It also was the correct one. work like the original which is only good for about six month&#x27;s or more</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY SATISFIED WITH THESE BLADES AND WILL CONTINUE TO USE THEM.</li>
            <li> If you use your electric razor every day you must replace the heads at least one a year. I noticed that my razor wasn&#x27;t cutting cleanly; so I replaced my heads after ten months. What a difference, rather than taking three or four passes, it takes one or two with no pulling. My beard is heavy; so, I will be replacing the heads every six to eight months. It&#x27;s worth the extra money for a clean shave; I was spending more on Gillette Mach3 cartridges every six months. I apply \\&quot;William&#x27;s Lectric Shave\\&quot; before and \\&quot;Nivea Post Shave Balm\\&quot; after shaving; the alcohol based after shave I was using caused redness and burning around my neck. Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with my \\&quot;Norelco Razor\\&quot; and would recommend its use by anyone interested in a comfortable clean shave.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be used on my shaver, description on website doesn&#x27;t show enough info.</li>
            <li> excellent fit and cut</li>
            <li> I searched all around trying to find the razor heads and get a good price and until I checked  here with Amazon.com I couldn&#x27;t find what I wanted.  Easy to order and received in a short amount  of time. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Fits as expected!!! Nothing to complain about</li>
            <li> Works great, will keep on using these replacement heads until razor dies. Much cheaper than purchasing a new razor and when heads are replaced works like a new razor once again.</li>
            <li> Package it came in was very small and compact, which was nice! Easy to install and still get a great cut every time I use my razor. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Just like having a new razor!!</li>
            <li> They are doing exactly what they are suppose to do.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it only had cutting edges on the outside circle. My previous blades had three concentric circles on each of the three cutting heads. But, the new head seems to do a good job of both cutting and covering a large part of my face.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads were the perfect match for the Philip&#x27;s electric razor I currently own. The blades last for almost an entire year, before they need to get replaced! I am very impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> These blades seem to work as good as the originals. Very easy to remove old ones and install new ones.</li>
            <li> One of the cutting head already has several small blades that are not attached correctly and it not only makes a grinding sound when the razor is on, but it does not cut well. I would live advise on what to do about maybe replacing it and getting a new one?</li>
            <li> Good replacement blades</li>
            <li> I bought the new heads in July 2014 and I already need to replace them again in Nov. 2014.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to received these new replacement heads for my Norelco razor.  Have installed them and they have made all the difference in the world as to the quality of my shave.  Delivery of the replacement heads was prompt and they arrive in excellent condition.  Thanks very much.  I will continue to use Amazon for future purchases.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Been using for years.  I have a lot of facial hair and very sensitive skin.  This works great for me.</li>
            <li> Auto ship is the way to go!! Amazon is almost always my first stop for household goods.  These blades are an awesome value!!!</li>
            <li> Received as ordered &amp; will probably order more in the future!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this company, even though I returned the item, because I bought a newer shaver 1 day after I ordered the the replacement heads for my older razor. The new razor performed better than the old one. They were very understanding, when I requested to return the item, and agreed for me to return of the item.</li>
            <li> The customer friendly website made it easy to locate the replacement heads for my husband&#x27;s Norelco Shaver.&lt;br /&gt;The added \\&quot;plus,\\&quot; was the \\&quot;no shipping and handling,\\&quot; charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will certainly use this website in the future...</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used them yet, however I&#x27;m sure they will be just as good as the originals as they always have in the past. Always buy Norelco replacement and not an off brand. They don&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> The new blades were an exact replacement for the one that came with the shaver at a fraction of the price</li>
            <li> These replacement heads were a perfect fit. They appear to be of high quality and give a really close shave. They seem to be better than the original ones when they were new. A good buy.</li>
            <li> Close cutting and smooth. Good design</li>
            <li> After going to multiple stores in our city and finding no one carries them locally any more, I found them on Amazon without any trouble.  Next time I won&#x27;t waste my time and will go straight to Amazon.  We received the replacement heads on the date expected and in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> Great Replacement Heads - a little pricey but well worth it! I will change the blades every year.</li>
            <li> It is Norelco, so besides the price, can you complain?</li>
            <li> does a good job, but is too expensive</li>
            <li> The most economical place to buy them....I was ready to buy a new razor for about the price of the blades, but Amazon had them cheaper than Walmart...</li>
            <li> Initially had some concern because the heads were slightly different from the originals, but made a call to customer service and they assured me that they would work and they did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why but the shaver slowed down. It shave worst than what it did before changing the heads...</li>
            <li> Since these replacement heads came from the same folks that made my electric razor they fit exactly as the old ones did.  It can be a little of a challenge to get them in just right though.</li>
            <li> Less expensive as single rather than buying a double package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hubby likes it, and THAT is the important thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe some ppl were trying to sell double packages for more than I could purchase 2 singles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some ppl are outrageous to do so! And some ppl would FALL for the 2 pack deal, thinking it would be cheaper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOW!</li>
            <li> Not sure what else to say about this product outside of the header. The replacement heads are easy enough to install. No complaints after a month of use.</li>
            <li> Works great and super awesome price</li>
            <li> These are fine new cutting heads.  However, I have in the past used a Vollco sharpener, which I just found in the drawer from my previous Norelco!  Amazon also carries these (search Vollco Sharpening Heads For Select Norelco Models)and they are great, work like a charm to make your &#x27;old&#x27; heads last 3-4x longer as long as you take care of them.  I would suggest getting both a set of new heads and a sharpener set so that you can 1) sharpen your old heads to like new condition and then 2) have the backup of the new set for when you need them.  My experience is that the re-sharpened heads dull just a bit faster than new originals and you really can only get a few sharpenings from them before they need replacing.</li>
            <li> I bought this replace blade for Philips 7310XL. The replacement blade has less blade than the one came with the shaver. As I use it, it took me 4-5 more passes to achieve the same quality of shave than the one that came with the shaver. Do not buy this! add few bucks and buy a new shaver</li>
            <li> Very disappointed that the head came in three parts not as a complete replaceable head</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Norelco battery powered shaver for 5 years, and this is the second set of replacement shaver heads I&#x27;ve purchased. They cut as if I just purchased the unit. Fantastic!</li>
            <li> As described, great product.</li>
            <li> Works fine. Been using them for decades. Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. Fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to shave while watching TV.</li>
            <li> was not getting a very comfortable shave and was thinking of getting a new shaver.decided to try the refill blades and no longer need a new shaver.the old one has alot of life left in it and shaves quite comfortably now.</li>
            <li> The product I have no problem. It just took a couple of days longer than expected to ship to my address. Other than that, I am happy and still using the product.</li>
            <li> The new blades work great on my triple header.  I should have replaced them long before I did.  Definitely would suggest replacing them when the shave quality goes down hill.</li>
            <li> I like my Philips Norelco and have had the electric razor for a number of years.  I had noticed that my shave was not as good as it once seemed and was debating on whether I should buy a new razor.  I looked into buying just new heads and was surprised at how expensive they were.  But, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try and see what would happen if I just replaced the heads on the shaver.  Boy, was I surprised at the difference new heads made.  It was like getting a brand new shaver and the difference was noticable.  From now on I&#x27;ll just replace the heads when needed and keep the old razor as long its motor keeps running smoothly.  Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry for saving the difference in price between a new razor and just replacing the heads.</li>
            <li> Fit is just fine.  Function is good enough.  It is a different hole pattern on the cutting head, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to matter.</li>
            <li> These were replacements for my husband&#x27;s shaver. It&#x27;s only a good deal if you don&#x27;t have to pay for shipping because shavers are so cheap these days that it&#x27;s almost not worth buying replacements heads unless it&#x27;s actually cost effective.</li>
            <li> Day to day use of the shaver heads provides smooth and close shaves every time.  Easy cleaning keeps the shaving heads sharp for the next shave.</li>
            <li> Excellent replacement blades!!! Great cut, lasted very well and were easily able to clean! I recommend getting these for all Norelco users!</li>
            <li> I bought these new blades because they&#x27;re a little less expensive than buying a new razor. I buy a new razor every other year, and new blades on alternate years. It&#x27;s amazing to me that the blades cost so much that you only pay a few extra dollars for the razor. I guess it&#x27;s the Gillette principle.</li>
            <li> the new head doesn&#x27;t work much better than my old one that really didn&#x27;t do anything. not sure if I&#x27;m not cleaning it right or something, not satisfied.</li>
            <li> It works.  Was easy to replace the heads and cuts nice.  No problem.  It was cheaper than a new Norelco and I&#x27;ve never had problems with it before.</li>
            <li> I have used my Norelco Spectra shaver for several years.  Finding replacement cutting heads is sometimes a challenge.  The replacement pack from Amazon is manufactured by Norelco and is priced lower than competitors&#x27; products.  Norelco suggests it might take a few days for the blades and heads to \\&quot;set,\\&quot; but these gave a close, comfortable shave on first use.  I highly recommend name-brand replacement heads from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was using Philips (7290) shaving set from past 4 years. Battery backup and set was all working fine, just its time to change head. I brought HQ8 as a replacement, this never works like the one before. I have to make several passes to get clean shave with NO success.   I might need to buy a new set !!!</li>
            <li> Managed to install the new heads myself, replacing ones almost two years old. Cranked it up, and at this point it&#x27;s somewhat better than before. Will charge up the shaver battery and see if that somehow further enhances performance.</li>
            <li> My husbands loves his electric razor and will not use anything else.</li>
            <li> I think my shaver works better than it did when it was new with the replacement blades. Smooth, clean shave.</li>
            <li> Razor is shaving like it did when it was new.</li>
            <li> the new blades enables my older razors to shave like new.  In fact I have two Norelco&#x27;s that use the same blades</li>
            <li> Difficult to find in most retail (big box) stores.  Takes a few shaves to break in but OK after that.</li>
            <li> I needed a replacement head for my electric shaver. Product arrived quickly and was the exact replacement head for my shaver.</li>
            <li> promised HQ177, this is what shipped, not  a close shave at all, not the same FOIL OPENINGS AS THE Hq177</li>
            <li> Product as advertised, but it took two weeks beyond the stated date for it to arrive...</li>
            <li> I have a really old Norelco, but it just keeps working and holds a two hour charge.  It takes,the HQ8 blades, and I think they cut just fine.  You really do have to,changes them about once a year, because the blades get dull and start causing ingrown hairs.  The new blades make you think you have a brand-new razor.  Amazon.com come has the cheapest price for Norelco replacement blades.  I have checked around.</li>
            <li> My son in law love it</li>
            <li> This is the second pair of replacement heads I have bought. They are a bit pricey I think, however they are half or less than a new shavor and they give a good shave. My shaver is now over 6 years old and still going strong.</li>
            <li> I have my Norelco shaver for about ten years and replacing the head from time to time keeps giving you a smooth close shave.</li>
            <li> Excelent product, fast delivery! It fullfills everything that one should expect when buyng from Amazon. No further comments, No need to write anything else</li>
            <li> i was pleased with the speed in which it arrived and i the price was the same as the local store i usually buy it from. i only ordered these because the store never had them when i needed them.</li>
            <li> The heads were very easy to replace, just a pop out and pop in. Now the razor is like new. I will not wait so long next time to replace the heads.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and good price. Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I received 3 sets of replacement heads for what 1 set costs at Target!  Renewed life for my Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li> These heads do not give as clean cut a shave as the orginal heads. Could do a much better job.</li>
            <li> The Phillips Norelco box (pictured) arrived, with series 7 replacement blades in the box. I can not use this item for my 7140 razor. It appears someone used the correct packaging, but inserted the incorrect product. I give this less than one star since the product is of no use to me and will be returned.</li>
            <li> Just replacements, guess they are good</li>
            <li> I was expecting the entire assembly, but I got three replacement rings and the blades. That&#x27;s a lot of money for just the rings and the blades.</li>
            <li> The heads were difficult to install,&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> After having my shaver for several years, I was considering getting a new one since it didn&#x27;t seem to be working as well as when it was new.  I didn&#x27;t realize they sold replacement heads for it but came across this while looking at new models.  Replacing the head was simple and shaver is once again like new!</li>
            <li> i like my norelco and i finally replaced my blades after 12 months and its back to like new condition</li>
            <li> The cutter blades were designed for the Norelco triple head electric razor and fit perfectly after a bit o tussel getting them alligned.</li>
            <li> Meets all expectations</li>
            <li> shaved like a new shaver</li>
            <li> more difficult to install than I expected, but once I got that job done the performance has been excellent.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and very reasonable price; I could not purchase this product locally and was very pleased to find it on the website.  I will definitely buy from this vendor for future purchases.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Wonderful for traveling or just to keep in the car.  Get two, one for your carry on bag and one for your car.</li>
            <li> This product is just fine..it works well and fits my razor and shaves my beard nicely! Tha price is good compared to Wal-Mart and other retailers I will do it again when needed!&lt;br /&gt;lja/JMJ</li>
            <li> The Norelco Hq8 Spectra Tripleheader Replacement Heads made a dramatic difference after replacing my 1-year old heads. Take care of your shaver and it will last a long time. Mine is 8 years old and used daily - still works well with just replacement heads once a year.</li>
            <li> replacement heads install easily and the razor works like new. much cheaper than buying a new razor as the heads are all that ever wears out.</li>
            <li> This is a quality manufacturer replacement part. Reduced in price as my shaver is a few years older. Definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I purchased one years ago that That Philips Norelco HQ8 Spectra Tripleheader Replacement Heads they where workd perfect till now but second time purchased replacement heads was to bed I do not know reason (they become useless after 2 days)</li>
            <li> Replaced yearly, new cutters will keep your shave extra close and shorten shaving time.</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised.  Great price.</li>
            <li> They last a long time.  I have reordered them</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, good price</li>
            <li> The head of my razor fell off and I could never get the old blades back in. The whole thing was a few years old so I didn&#x27;t feel too bad replacing it, but I decided to give these a shot. They were simple to install and WOW this thing works so much better. I forgot what it was like to have new blades. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll wait so long to replace them next time.</li>
            <li> They work.  They shave yo face.</li>
            <li> These heads, while they work, are not of the same design as the ones for my razor.  The connections are not the same, and , therefore do not operate as well as they should.  However, as my razor is the older model. I will have to make do with these new ones.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads I ordered online through Amazon saved me a great deal of time and money.  They are original factory parts, so I knew they would fit my shaver.  I was especially pleased by the savings I achieved by not having to go to the shaver&#x27;s online store.  Thank you, Amazon!</li>
            <li> The description is confusing. It says 3 headers so i thought that&#x27;s for 3 replacements. However, it count each small individual blade as one header.  A brand new Philip shave only costs 30 bucks, why do i pay 27 bucks just for a header replacement?</li>
            <li> Nice to have new blades. It fit mine and I&#x27;m grateful for all the reviews. I have a 7310XL. It&#x27;s over 5 years old now.</li>
            <li> Good price. These are hard to find locally.</li>
            <li> Clean and close shave and no irritation as I have pretty sensitive skin.  I was using a Remington R-5130 and the Norelco seems to shave closer.</li>
            <li> Husband needed new replacement head for razor and this works perfectly. Looked around locally and could not find what was needed. Amazon seems to always have what one needs. Perfect fit.</li>
            <li> Nice to have a new razor.  Old ones lasted a few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great razor.</li>
            <li> I have had my razor for almost two years and then had to get replacements.  I saw them here on Amazon and had to get them.</li>
            <li> good electric razor that gets the job done without any nicks!&lt;br /&gt;that&#x27;s a good feeling! rock on phillips norelco razor!</li>
            <li> This dealer is very prompt in shipping making this an easy online transaction.   Thanks for the great service!</li>
            <li> I have ordered as the old one became a problem to my face just after replacing the new one my shaver returne back it effecency like new</li>
            <li> These are a perfect replacement for my worn out blades. Be sure that you know what replacements will fit your razor BEFORE purchasing. I can feel the difference between the old and new quite noticeably. It had been almost 2 years since I started using the ones I replaced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of the Tripleheader type blades.  I found this particular one to last a while and rarely did the blades start pulling hair.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Norelco has always been my shaver. Great shaver and these heads give good closeness. Need to change heads yearly to maintain quality shave.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased that I found this product on Amazon. Price was much lower than offered in retail stores and it was exactly what I needed. Fits the AT814 model that I own perfectly.</li>
            <li> Exact replacement blades. Shaver shaves like new</li>
            <li> Work OK.  Reasonable price</li>
            <li> blades could be sharper</li>
            <li> Came in a timely fashion in one of those impossible to open plastic packages but does what it was purchased to do.</li>
            <li> My razor feels like new again with these, that simple, very smooth and maybe even better than new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should note that in my case, these heads were actually a slightly varied design on the tops of the heads, the slits/openings on these heads were different than the originals - I&#x27;m no engineer, but it seems they&#x27;ve improved the design, while maintaining backward compatibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get &#x27;em.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  At this point about 15 months later, heads are still ok, but do occasionally PULL on the hairs if it starts getting full, probably will replace these soon.</li>
            <li> Exact match for my 7310XL model.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his Norelco Shaver again since he replaced the shaver heads.  He had been using the same heads for over a year and it was time for that close shave again.  Thank you Norelco!</li>
            <li> THE BLADE REPLACEMENTS FOR MY PHILLIPS NORELCO RAZOR ARE EXCELLENT. ALL THE PRODUCTS I HAVE EVER PURCHASED FROM PHILLIPS NORELCO HAVE EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS.</li>
            <li> At least the new blades seem sharper than my one year old blades, however the packaging did get crushed enroute.</li>
            <li> I clean the trimmings each night with hot water, but these blades still seem to dull rather quickly.  I clean the razors with a toothbrush every 30 days or so, then I buy new blades once a year.  Still, I can&#x27;t get over the price for what seems like a simple set of circular razors...</li>
            <li> I purchased this after looking carefully at the Norelco website and the Amazon pictures.  1.  My razor says to order the \\&quot;HQ8\\&quot;.  2.  The picture on the package shows a complete head set, heads and frame.    The package arrived (with picure of heads and frame), but the package only shows the heads.  The heads do not fit my razer. There are two little \\&quot;ears\\&quot; at on the perimeter of each head, but my razor does not have indentions for the two little ears.  If I could easily get a full refund, I&#x27;d do it right away, but I suspect it is too much busywork to get one.  Be careful before buying!</li>
            <li> What can I say?  Exactly as described and works.</li>
            <li> Good product and cheaper than buying a brand new razor. My husband hasn&#x27;t noticed too much of a difference with the new one however I can tell that his face isn&#x27;t getting as much razor burn.</li>
            <li> Instructions to replace the blades are a little misleading but in overall you get an excellent product for the price! could be a little cheaper, really guys, make it cheaper online.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT, GREAT PRICE. QUICK SHIPPING</li>
            <li> Excellent product &amp; fast delivery. A genuine Norelco replacement part. Had searched the internet for this item, and some of the prices were double that of Amazon.com. Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> no directions for how to align it to replace. Gave both of us fits before we finally got it in place.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t realized how dull my original blades had become after a year (I shave my head as well as my face), until I ordered replacements through Amazon. Razor works like new with these blades. Price was substantially less than in retail stores or from the Philips/Norelco website. Received my order in just 2 days. I have not been disappointed by Amazon on anything I&#x27;ve bought from them - going on three years and over a dozen products.</li>
            <li> Advisable to have replacement heads at hand.</li>
            <li> Good quality replacement for my Norelco razor, just clean them weekly and they last . Nice shave week after week month after month.</li>
            <li> Good price, was exactly what was expected and shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  For those who are looking for the HQ177, these are the replacement heads for that head number which was discontinued.  Unfortunately it is not made clear many times.  However, on the back of the box it states they are used for the 77.. series, along with the 71, 73, 72, 78, 88.. and the pt/at 7-- and 8-- series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heads function just as they were made to.  The price at amazon is excellent.</li>
            <li> The product worked perfectly.  Very easy to install.  Although I did drop the entire thing and parts went everywhere!  But had I not done that, it would have been a snap.  Once installed, it made a huge difference.  Very sharp ... just like a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Went to CVS to get a replacement blades for my Norelco 7310 series shaver. They were charging $45. Used the Amazon BarCode scanner app on my smartphone and saw that the MFSR was $35. Additionally, it listed several places online for $25 dollar range. I selected this business because it was affiliated to my Prime account for free faster shipping. Ordered right there in the CVS store that evening and got the product the next day! It was slightly different than my existing blades, because this one features a little &#x27;tooth&#x27; to lock the blades in place - very smart! I have two Norelco shavers (one for a second home) and so I bought a 2nd one today from this same seller. 5 stars - Product and Seller!!</li>
            <li> How can I not like these?  They take my whiskers off better than a weed eater.</li>
            <li> Purchased a Remington, hated it, went back to a Norelco, LOVE IT...,  Works great, delivered fast, cannot go wrong with Norelco in my opinion</li>
            <li> I replace heads about every 12-18 months.  They don&#x27;t seem to stay sharp as long as the originals, but it&#x27;s my fourth set of replacements and the electric razor keeps working fine.</li>
            <li> great price for the replacement Heads</li>
            <li> Very good and affordable price</li>
            <li> The shaver heads work fine, however I had my concerns as when it arrived the outer box was pretty much crushed up. Kudo&#x27;s to whoever designed the inner sealed plastic container - as it was still holding the shaver heads in their spots.</li>
            <li> New shaving blades are great</li>
            <li> delivered what was advertised.  fast shipping.</li>
            <li> work great with my razor... had to do a bit of research due to the large amount of options for different models</li>
            <li> So glad to find this on Amazon!!!  I was looking to purchase a new razor for my husband, and he asked me, &amp;#34;I wonder if you can just replace the blades?&amp;#34;  Boy, did this save us a lot of money!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And...it is just excellent.  It&#x27;s like he has a NEW RAZOR!!!!  Thank you, Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> Good item, quick delivery.. Thanks</li>
            <li> Congrats to everyone who managed to get their replacement heads to fit, but I&#x27;ve been trying for over an hour now. No instructions come with the heads, so I had to come back here. As far as I can tell, I&#x27;m doing everything correctly. This is the step I seem to be stuck on: &amp;#34;Make sure that the projections of the shaving heads fit exactly into the recesses.&amp;#34; Nice. So how do you &amp;#34;make sure&amp;#34; exactly? More specifics would be nice. They will not stay in, period. Very disappointed in these. It&#x27;s actually easier simply to buy a new shaver. Maybe that&#x27;s what they want. Btw, yes, I did buy the correct heads for my shaver.</li>
            <li> Replacement blades: Took 3 days for my razor to acknowledge that I installed the blades. It&#x27;s very noticable with my razor shaves faster. &lt;br /&gt;Enjoy</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the new blades.  Easy to install and it&#x27;s like having a new razor again.</li>
            <li> what can one say there replacement blade for the shaver  yearly replacement</li>
            <li> The razor is lighter than my previous one.  I was surprised to find out that it lasted so long on a charge.</li>
            <li> Required review comments are useless</li>
            <li> The merchandise arrived very quickly.  I have used Norelco shavers for many years and for the first two weeks it was extremely close. Afterwards the blades must have become dull and the shave was not as close.</li>
            <li> Good price and shave well.</li>
            <li> I have found these easy to change, it just takes a couple of minutes. &lt;br /&gt;These replacement heads are just as effective as the originals and they last about the same amount of time in my case that is about 12 months. &lt;br /&gt;I am now using my second set, since purchasing my shaver and would have no problem recommending these to someone else. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Now that I am using it I can tell the difference from the old ones in my shaver.  I was going to buy a new shaver until I saw them in Amazon and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I have used the heads before and agin they wired fine.</li>
            <li> Product was OK.    People in Mexico, you can get the same product in palacio de hierro for barely the same price.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Works very well!</li>
            <li> Purchase was very easy, product came in a short period of time and the price was right!!  Very pleased with Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Very easy to replace.</li>
            <li> I buy these every 10 or so months and have not had any issues with them.  In fact, I stopped buying the expensive Braun electric razors since this does the job even better and cost less.  I wait for a sale of course to keep the prices down and Amazon is the place to purchase from.  Clean shaves and a good price from time to time.  Thanks</li>
            <li> great product and price</li>
            <li> Every store in town was sold out of the HQ8 razor heads before Christmas. Like so many other things, found it on Amazon and delivery was made in time.  Good razor, good service from Amazon merchants.</li>
            <li> Have had a terrible time replacing the heads. Going to stop in and ask my husbands  barber to do it for me one day!</li>
            <li> Hassle-free installation.  Great price.  Enough said.</li>
            <li> The reliability and/or consistency of service is impeccable.  Thanks for proving that your systems and the people who develop and operate them are so professional!</li>
            <li> It took care of my need and is working fine.</li>
            <li> Makes shaver new again.</li>
            <li> Disn&#x27;t realize how my old blades had worn down until I installed the new replacement. Shaves smooth with no pulling or irritation. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve replaced the blades in my razor - I should get in the habit of doing that more often, as it definitely shaves much quicker and more evenly than before.</li>
            <li> is a great razor blade and value</li>
            <li> Perfect fit. Made my Norelco shave like new again.</li>
            <li> These HQ8 replacement heads worked good for about 2 months and then started making noise and performing poorly. At best I will get 6 months out of them. I&#x27;ve purchased replacement heads before from other sources and they have always lasted 1+ years. Not sure if these are authentic Norelco parts or just a bad batch.</li>
            <li> Tripleheaders Replacement Heads arrived in the proper time frame and was in excellent condition.  Was very satisfied with the service and was able to use the razor in no time.  Would use this service again with no problem.</li>
            <li> very good......sharp blades,and affordable</li>
            <li> I had the shaver for one year,after one year norelco says to renew the heads for better performance.Forget it save your money,the original worked better.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the performance of my razor after installing these new blades, in fact, I don&#x27;t remember the razor working that well when it was new.  The reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 is the price.  It is obvious that Norelco is overcharging for this product when you can buy a complete new shaver for just a few dollars more than the replacement blades.</li>
            <li> I am only one week into my new shaving experience and so far I am greatly impressed.  I was very skeptical about making the jump to electric razing, having used traditional razors my entire life.  The worst part of the experience has always been shaving my neck: Occasionally I get ingrown hairs or various degrees of skin irritation.  I tried every brand of razor and had the same experiences, overall.  I found it cost (in the long run) quite a bit and the smooth surface didn&#x27;t last long at all.  If I went against the grain, naturally it would last longer, but would promote more irritation.  Amazon offered a coupon for this item and I figured I had nothing to lose.  The great bulk of reviews were on the high side and I figured why not?&lt;br /&gt;  How was my experience?  I kept an open mind and read the directions thoroughly.  Norelco offered a window of time to not only adjust to the product but also offer a refund if not fully satisfied.  Immediately I noticed a brilliant difference that rivaled the experience of the razor experience.  Hair comes off MUCH easier and the surface is much smoother (for much longer!) Plus, the best part is much less irritation.  I will not lie, however, my first time there was some irritation still on my neck area.  Hair on my cheeks and upper lip come off with such great ease.  Having read feedback and instructions, I am still working on my neck.  I know there is an adjustment period and I&#x27;m hoping it will become much easier (in time!)  I&#x27;ve already noticed a great difference in the past couple days and hope it will be a great experience for my entire face!  I will update this feedback, after a couple of months to see if there is truly a difference.&lt;br /&gt;  My advice? Give this razor a shot, you have nothing to lose!  It&#x27;s cheap and comes form a trustworthy brand.  The best part is they offer your money back, if not satisfied!  Hope this feedback helps!</li>
            <li> As advertised. Working a 4-star well level...</li>
            <li> These heads fit my razor just like I expected them to.  Purchasing them was easy......just make sure you get the right heads for your specific razor. I would recommend these heads to any Norelco shaver owner.</li>
            <li> We have a father in a nursing home in another state and have had to purchase a new electric razor almost every year.  We tried shopping around for, wrapping and shipping to replace heads and after all the hassle, it never seemed to work. Then we got this Norelco razor and he loved it, the caregivers loved it, and we decided to try replacing the heads again (Much cheaper and better for the environment than throwing out the razor again.)     These were shipped directly to a caregiver there, got there in just a couple of days with the free super saver shipping, and were extremely easy to replace.  And the razor works like new again!  I put these on the subscribe and save plan so they will always be shipped free and I save a little in the deal.  We should not need them more than once a year, but we can just pass on the first regular shipment in 6 mos. and get the next one (or order in between if needed).    Great deal. Gotta love this Amazon thing!</li>
            <li> Replacement type is written in fine print on the razor..  Old blades were starting to cut skin not just hair, got these and the razor is like new again and saved me from having to buy a new razor.</li>
            <li> Was a gift. Works great!</li>
            <li> THESE ARE GREAT REPLACEMENT BLADES AT A VERY REASONABLE PRICE. THEY ARE VERY SHARP AND EASY TO INSTALL. GREAT VALUE FOR THE MONEY.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.  It meets the needs that it is designed for.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item for my Dad. Changing the blades from his Norelco razor was a breeze, he is very pleased with it. I also received the item very fast.</li>
            <li> These work fine, but overpriced and short life span. At this priced, you can usually find a new Norelco for the price of two sets of heads.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads were a little different than the original ones and were a bit tricky to get inserted correctly.  However, once seated properly, the replacement heads worked fine.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t replaced my heads in a while. They cut better and I don&#x27;t break out like I did before the replacements. Replace every 6 months.</li>
            <li> I can not give you a review on this product yet being I have not recieved it as of yet.    I ordered it to be sent to an APO wich is where I am, but it was sent to my home address wich I am not at, unfortunately not only do I sacrafice a year of my life to spend it in Afghanistan but I also sacrafice my money, I have to pay for the shipping of my products then pay again to have them shipped to me here where I need them. I have now sworn off Amazon.com being this is not the first time I got the short end of the stick from them, I have alwasys said fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me, well shame on me and I will not give them the chance for a third time mainly for the fact that I have told them of both incidents and I have not gotten even the slightest appolagy.   It might be me but the way I was raised that if I were to do some one wrong or not serve them correctly I was to some how find a way to make it right with that person. so much for respect these days.  Now I wonder if they will even post this review being that it is not a very positave review.   John Smith</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how dull my old razor blades were until I used these.  The razor no longer pulls on my beard... it just cuts it.   Sweet!  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The replacement heads were really needed.  I also purchased a 2nd replacement head for my step son who also uses a Philips Norelco razor.  The new heads shave close enough that I could skip a day if I wanted to.</li>
            <li> Since these are made by Philips they work perfectly. What a difference, going from 3 year old cutter blades to brand new ones. Close shave every time.</li>
            <li> They are standard blades.  I will not use them till my current ones need to be replaced in the spring.</li>
            <li> Part of the perfect shaving tool for my husband. He has sensitive skin and this is the only product that he can use without discomfort.</li>
            <li> Every time we went to Walmart these were sold out.  They came fast and were what was described. We would buy them again.</li>
            <li> easy to replace HOWEVER you do NOT get the 3 blade  head as pictured from .  you must remove the round covers and blades from the old head and replace it with the new blades.  Not a big deal at all but just thought you should know</li>
            <li> Work well, easy to install.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed that these blades last a whole year.  They&#x27;re a bit tricky to install but no real trouble.</li>
            <li> Phillips replacment electric razor heads arrived in 3 days to Canada via regular mail.  Price less than 1/2 of Canadian stores.</li>
            <li> As usual, this purchase thru amazon.com was easy, convenient and affordable. I recieved the product within a reasonable amount of time, and in excellent condition. I will continue to use amazon.com for most of my online purchases.</li>
            <li> My husband asked me to find a replacement head for his razor. I knew Amazon would probably have it. Glad they did. Just what he wanted.</li>
            <li> This product is OK but even with blade replacement the razor does not work as well as my old Norelco Speed XL.</li>
            <li> This replacement heads are still excellent quality. And unlike Norelco shavers which now are made in China, these heads are manufactured in the Netherlands</li>
            <li> I am not sure why, but if I miss a day of shaving the next shave can be very irritating, and my face burns, almost as if shaving with a dull razor. I used this to replace my older heads, so you would think the shave would have been smoother.  And they were a little bit on the expensive side.  Next time I will just buy a new razor.</li>
            <li> These gave new life to my shaver. Without them I would have bought a new razor. Speedy shipping and just what I needed</li>
            <li> I was very surprised by the low price.</li>
            <li> These are cool and work well</li>
            <li> Good and cheap for replacing old blades, not the closest shave though, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I have a Norelco James Bond series shaver for almost 8 years now and works great. I replaced the head with HQ9 model but found that the HQ8 actually shave closer and cleaner.</li>
            <li> Replaced my shaver heads, from reading all these reviews I was expecting a &amp;#34;brand new&amp;#34; shaver experience. My first reaction when trying out the new blades was &amp;#34;meh, that doesnt seem all that different from before&amp;#34;. They looked shiny and new, and the old ones looked somewhat dingy and dirty, but all in all, I didn&#x27;t notice much of a performance improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the cardboard box mine came in was all banged up and squashed... the interior clear hard plastic was intact and the blades themselves were not damaged at all- but the cardboard box looked like it had been through a rock tumbler. Don&#x27;t expect a &amp;#34;new razor&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This product replaced the heads in my Norelco Spectra shaver.  I found a great improvement in shaving by being  able to shave closer and quicker.  It was like getting a new shaver for much less cost.  However it did require my old shaver to still have a good motor and battery.</li>
            <li> Delivery was great on time ,i have not shaved in two days waiting for by new blades.&lt;br /&gt;I recevied them by 630 pm ahead of time,opened the package and i thought i would be able to snap the whole head out&lt;br /&gt;and snap the new one in.&lt;br /&gt;  My wet /dry Norelco has been running great for 8 years it was a gift from my son,the cut was getting a little slow&lt;br /&gt;so when i saw the new blades in the ad, it say head ,so again i thought 123 pop out popin but no each blade in the head has to come out and changed ,not 123,and i am 64 my eyes are not as good as they use to be.&lt;br /&gt;if you read the direction that come in the pack of three new blades you will understand better what i am saying .&lt;br /&gt;I think you should change your ad just a little to let the customer know ,each blade as to be changed in the head of the razor&lt;br /&gt;and you are not getting a whole new head ,which the price would indicate because of the overall price of a new razor 59.00 vs&lt;br /&gt;regular price i believe was 27/29 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;thank you for reading and listening.</li>
            <li> This product is an original by the manufacturer and not a second by an independent. The heads were a perfect fit. The shaver felt just like a new shaver. I would have no problem purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> So I replaced the heads...not really too difficult...and my shaver was working like new again. When I took out the old ones I noticed they were pretty gunked up so I wondered how they would do cleaned up. Took them apart, cleaned with a brush, and reinstalled and they also worked ALMOST AS WELL as the replacement ones. Downloaded and read the manual (what, did you think I actually kept...or read the one that came with it?) and saw that I should have been cleaning these heads once a month by removing, disassembling and running under hot water. I had been simply opening the top and cleaning that cavity with a brush once a week or so and didn&#x27;t consider taking the whole thing apart. Well, at least I have a set ready when these originals actually do need replacing. If there are other dummies out there like me, try this before ordering the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Local store was always out of the replacement I needed.  Amazon had them and at a better price. Ordwering was easy and shipment was very prompt.</li>
            <li> A little challenging to replace the blades in the razor but other than that the purchase went smoothly. Good deal overall and definitely needed once or twice a year with Norelcos.</li>
            <li> My husband keeps saying how great the new heads work on his razor.</li>
            <li> The razor replacement heads came very quickly.  They were just as shown.  I am very happy with this product.  It performs in my razor very well.</li>
            <li> Worked as I expected.</li>
            <li> Easy to follow instructions.  Quick and easy replacement of old heads.  Cheaper than a new Razor, simple enough for anyone to do.  No technical skills needed.</li>
            <li> Have used Norelco shavers for years</li>
            <li> I am blad with these item.</li>
            <li> I cannot complain it meet my requirement and I am happy.</li>
            <li> a good replacement item. Nice to have a sharp razor</li>
            <li> Replacement heads are not as good as the once came with the original, not sure why.</li>
            <li> Not the level of quality I expected but still useful to a degree.</li>
            <li> This was the third set of replacement heads purchased for this razor.  The new heads always return the shaver to like new condition.  I replace the heads once per year.  The order arrived in a timely fashion without problems.</li>
            <li> Came as described. Thank You.</li>
            <li> Just what my husband ordered and he is very happy.</li>
            <li> After a year you forget what a close shave is supposed to be.  After putting these in to my year old shaver I can shave in less than half the time and get a closer shave. A little pricey but you can really feel a difference.</li>
            <li> OEM heads and screens were a great price and arrived as promised</li>
            <li> I own the [[ASIN:B000FEGUIW Philips Norelco 7140 Cord/Cordless Rechargeable Shaver]] and it is a great product. These replacement heads go in with no problems what so ever. They are sharp and give a good close shave just like when I first bought the razor.     I will be buying these again the next time I need to replace the heads on my razor.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe I waited so long to purchase this item.  I just used it today after taking 5 min to install and wow.  I noticed that the design of the heads are a little different from the stock heads  and perhaps that&#x27;s why the shave is that much closer.  not sure, but one thing is fore sure.  no more hair pulling or irritated skin after shaving.  Highly recommended item.</li>
            <li> Description states it is compatible wit the 7300 Series Norelco Razor. It is not. The heads and the Razors are different, see the attached photographs. The delivery and packaging was fantastic, but the item description is wrong.</li>
            <li> Making the purchase of the razor replacement heads on line at Amazon was a major convenience.  The heads were extremely easy to install and the razor is working like new again.</li>
            <li> A perfect fit for my razor, it smooth shaving from here on out!!</li>
            <li> required each year. Original part.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed in store 30 or 40 dollars works like it should</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price...so much less than in the stores.  The item works great and will order again.</li>
            <li> You can certainly tell when you need new heads, shaves are slower and not4 close at all...but once you install a new set of head, it runs like a new shaver.  What more can I say? Do it4 at least once a year.  I used to think that electricss were forever, but that is not the case. I get 14 days of daily shaves out of a charge and I shave both my head and face. But when I want the closest shave possible that will last 1/12 days, I must confess I use a blade and gel.</li>
            <li> These seem to work better than the original that came in the unit.</li>
            <li> The new heads work OK.  I cannot tell much difference in the new and the old ones in the way it shaves.</li>
            <li> First time I ever replaced shaving heads. I was finished in less than a minute and the old norelco works like brand new!</li>
            <li> I would  recommend buying a new razor rather than getting a replacement because the new one feels the same as my old razor heads. The cost to replace this each year makes this something to pass on!</li>
            <li> shaving head works well and was easy to install.  the only problem was my own when i didn&#x27;t even know the model of shaver i owned! once researching this, ordering was a breeze. price was reasonable and shipping was fast. i now have basically a brand new electric shaver</li>
            <li> To whom it may concern:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any major problems with product misrepresentation on Amazon before now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sent email feedback that the HQ8 replacement heads didn&#x27;t fit my model razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately I hadn&#x27;t disposed of an older model Norelco Shaver and when I checked and&lt;br /&gt;the HQ8 did fit it so I decided to keep the HQ8.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product description listed my model shaver as compatible but it wasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Understandably I was not pleased.</li>
            <li> easy to replace and works fine.  nothing spectacular to say about it except that it reliably works like it should.</li>
            <li> waited to long to replace heads&lt;br /&gt;new heads made electric shaver perform like new. should replace heads at least once per year</li>
            <li> I followed the directions on the website to make sure I was getting the correct replacement razor heads, but something didn&#x27;t look right with the recommended heads.  (My razor, a Norelco says it need HQ8 replacement heads.0  The screens on the ones that arrived did not fit my razor.  I was able to salvage things by re-using the old screens and put in the new cutting blades/wheels.  Seems a waste to have to throw away perfectly good new screens.  I think there is a problem with the links on the website that result in getting the wrong replacement heads.</li>
            <li> This was given as a gift.  The person who received this item sems to like it just fine.</li>
            <li> Much improved after very easy change.</li>
            <li> The first time I purchased this product from Amazon I had to return the blades because they didn&#x27;t fit. That was not the case this time.  Everything fit perfect and within minutes I was shaving with brand new blades.  The price is substantially better than what&#x27;s offered on the Norelco website.</li>
            <li> These heads last about a year or more as advertised.</li>
            <li> Easy to install, made my razor as good as new.</li>
            <li> I unfortunately bent one of my previous heads on my razor, and so this was the perfect replacement. Includes the 3 spinning blades as well as the 3 metal slotted blade covers. Very reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li> It was so easy to  replace the old heads of my husband&#x27;s Norelco shaver with new heads.  He says it shaves closer and works better than it did when it was new.  Can&#x27;t get better than that.</li>
            <li> Not the best quality around.  I doubt that they were as sharp as they could have been.  But they fit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the  order I placed on Amazon. I received good service. The product was sent very quickly. Thanks for the fine response to my request. I appreciate it.     Maurice Hancock</li>
            <li> Has it really been that long? These things have lasted me more than a year, although I have a beard so I usually just clean up the edges. Still, good quality.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and does the job I expected.</li>
            <li> Great shave. Great value. Nice to have new blades for a more close shave. Will order these replacement blades again.</li>
            <li> product was what I expected and delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit works great. Will buy again when needed.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to cut as close as the original blade. Also, it was a little difficult to install the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit at perfect price</li>
            <li> as described fast shipping</li>
            <li> Shipped on time, item was what we needed. very satisfied</li>
            <li> Been a Norelco user for many years, I must say these foils(heads) are the best I have ever used</li>
            <li> Works great , good buy</li>
            <li> I use them every day.  work good but don&#x27;t get as close a shave as i would like.  would buy again</li>
            <li> About a year after I got my new Philips electric razor as a present I noticed it wasn&#x27;t shaving as close as it used to. Duh! The blades don&#x27;t stay sharp forever, dummy! I decided to go with the brand-name replacements, mainly because I trust the name - and I couldn&#x27;t find any cheaper, generic versions anywhere. They probably exist, but I didn&#x27;t find them. These factory replacements fit perfectly and it really only takes about a minute to make the switch. They will only go in one way, so it&#x27;s hard to make a mistake. Yeah, it would be nice if you could sharpen the existing blades, but that&#x27;s probably not very practical. Anyway, after the swap my razor was back working like new - and I even made a note to myself when I put in the new blades so I&#x27;ll know when it&#x27;s time to do it again.</li>
            <li> These blades last a good year or two. A good buy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe that they would be this sharp!!</li>
            <li> This is a great price for these replacement heads.  And, a few weeks after I purchased a set, my wife was shopping Amazon on Black Friday and picked up a another set for me at an even lower price ($16.88), with an on-line $5 off from Philips that Amazon automatically provided at checkout.  These replacement heads are made by Philips, for their Spectra line of razors, and are not aftermarket.  They correctly fit my Norelco Spectra model 8895XL electric razor (side note: my model is the &amp;#34;James Bond special edition&amp;#34; with a &amp;#34;Die Another Day/007&amp;#34; logo on it, that I purchased in 2002).  Not sure how long Philips is going to make replacement parts like this for a 14 year old razor.  [One slight difference from sets i purchased a few years ago.  The original ones were stamped with &amp;#34;8-SERIES&amp;#34; and these are stamped with &amp;#34;Double-Precision&amp;#34;.]</li>
            <li> My razor is an 8894 XL but others using the HQ8 cutters are similar. There is no reason not to replace the cutters when the razor advises to do so. It only takes about 5 minutes and most of that time is getting the package open. :)   When installing the cutters, lift them one at a time from the package and be careful to keep the 2 parts of each cutter together as they are matched.  To reset the \\&quot;replace advisor indicator\\&quot;, press and hold down the power button until the razor beeps. (About 4 seconds)  Then you&#x27;re good to go.  A new razor is over $200. Amazon&#x27;s price with free shipping is impossible to beat!</li>
            <li> The shaving heads were a perfect fit and they did what my old worn out heads could not do: give me a close shave.  I made the correct choice replacing my shaver heads instead of purchasing a new electric shaver.</li>
            <li> This item went for nearly twice the price on NORELCO site, and other sites.  Shipped and received earlier than \\&quot;due\\&quot; date, as is OFTEN the case with Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Promptly shipped; good product.</li>
            <li> Had the razor for about 4 years. Like new again. I think I will  change the blades after 2 years. Like the razor a lot. You are spending a lot replacing the whole razor. If I got another razor I would buy the same so I gave this a shot. Would do it again. .</li>
            <li> The HQ8 heads fitted perfectly, however, they seem to be of poorer quality than the originals. The proof will be in the time they last (usually 2 years).</li>
            <li> They work well and extend the life of mar Norelco.</li>
            <li> Product replacement works well, not the same blades that originally came with my razor, however they were the replacement heads listed.  They also seem to work a bit differint too, I am guess they are simply the new updated kind.  Paying $30 for replacement heads when the razor originally cost $40 is a bit steep.</li>
            <li> I ordered the HQ8 replacement heads for my 7310 shaver, came in timely fashion, but they did not work.  Someone had to put the wrong set in the box, probably fit a different model shaver.  Compared the new heads to my old ones and you could easily see that they were not a match, and indeed they did not work...the shaver rotors did not mesh and turn the heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Called Philips/Norelco and explained the problem;  they agreed that I ordered the correct heads and that they should work...much to their credit, they sent me a new set, yes, HQ8&#x27;s, came today, and yep, they did work!!  Same (identical) package that I ordered from Amazon, but different heads that looked like my old ones and did mesh.  Thanks Norelco.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I ordered, the timing was perfect and I got a great deal on it compared to what I would get it in stores.</li>
            <li> He determined they are not durable because the &#x27;replace heads&#x27; light came on soon after he installed them. That is just because he replaced the heads early before the light came on. The light is just a timer and comes on every so many minutes of use. His new heads were fine, but he did not understand what makes the &#x27;replace heads&#x27; light come on.</li>
            <li> 1. Ordering was easy &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2. Product arrived on date promised &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;3. Price was as advertised &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;4. No surprises &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;5. Would make another purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> I switched one year ago from a regular razor (Schick Quattro) to the Norelco electric razor, and I am very happy with the results.  These replacement heads are much cheaper than buying a year&#x27;s worth of replacement blades, and perform very well.</li>
            <li> Made a new shaver with comfort out of an old one. I would highly recommend this to everyone. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to shave closer... I had the original heads for a couple of years and they really needed changing.</li>
            <li> Great product cheaper than buying at the store.</li>
            <li> my husband really likes it.</li>
            <li> My husband was finally convinced to change out blades instead of buying a completely new razor...and what a difference!  It may as well be new again!!</li>
            <li> The most difficult thing about the replacement heads was deciding which was the correct one to buy.  I didn&#x27;t realize there were so many Norelco razors.  I received the replacement heads in record time.  And once I actually looked at the razor head, replacement was pretty much intuitive.  My razor now cuts like new.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit. I can shave again.</li>
            <li> Fast Service,  A!!!!!!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re working well for me.</li>
            <li> A good product to replace old units.</li>
            <li> Great, original quality. Forgot how a sharp set feels!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t make the diff I anticipated. I was expecting literally...a new razor . After all, you get new blades / screens?!?&lt;br /&gt;Why isn&#x27;t it like new?? I dunno.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was good..what more can I say..aside from ill see how long this...huh.. Replacement lasts!?</li>
            <li> Purchasing the Norelco HQ8 Spectra Tripleheader Replacement heads for my 5+ year-old Norelco razor was a really good move.  The \\&quot;old \\&quot;razor\\&quot; now works like a new razor.  I should have replaced the heads long ago but kept using the old ones and complaining that \\&quot;I need to get a new razor.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Amazon did great.  However, I thought the head aperture would be in one piece.  As a consequence, I don&#x27;t think the heads are properly aligned after I&#x27;ve inserted them numerous times.</li>
            <li> good product , excellent price</li>
            <li> As good as the one came with razer</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly. Changing them out could not be easier. I looked at the blades under a microscope just for fun and cannot see how those blades could &amp;#34;lift and cut&amp;#34; but I have been happy with the reslts.</li>
            <li> They may have been quality blades in the past, but they are not!!!! My husband and father have the same shaver and use to love it. But now our local stores don&#x27;t carry the blades. Of course, being a regular Amazon shopper, we look here. I still love Amazon, but beware of this seller!!! my dad went through 3! yes 3 blades in a month! After him using this shaver for over 4 years, I believe him when he says these blades are NOT legit! He checked they look real, they have the stickers and printing like the real deal! But they aren&#x27;t! Sad. Makes Amazon look bad, even though it&#x27;s not their fault the seller has real well done FAKE products!</li>
            <li> After I received my order, I simply placed the new blades in my old razor head and realized I may have been able to buy an inexpensive Norelco and placed its blades in my old razor. Even if they were not transferable, I would still have had a razor with new blades, albeit a more basic model. I intend to do that the next time my blades no longer provide a decent shave. Norelco charged a premium price for a replacement head, more, in fact, than the cost of some of its other razors. That benefit them at my expense. I won&#x27;t do it again. The new blades are excellent, and I am getting a close, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> My husband loves Norelco!</li>
            <li> Like shaving with a brand new razor, I had forgotten what a close comfortable shave this razor was capable of performing. But wait, did I mention the great price I got at Amazon? Ten bucks cheaper than Walmart.</li>
            <li> I replaced the heads after two years when I noticed that the current shaver just wasn&#x27;t getting the job done.  Now it is back to original performance.  Won&#x27;t let it go that long again.</li>
            <li> Finally replace my shaver heads after 4 or 5 years of use. Immediate improvement!</li>
            <li> I would even re-order if I knew how to do it</li>
            <li> Its perfect for me and really useful.</li>
            <li> Quality product, with a great shave at a reasonable price without gouging your pocket.  The product(s) arrived on time, as described by Amazon &amp; manufacturer, it was shipped without issue, arrived within prescribed estimates, the packaging was undamaged, and the product itself was unmolested and made with quality materials.  Description, photograph, website presentation, and what arrived are the same-size, shape, color, and it matched my expectations.</li>
            <li> I had no problems with the replacement heads.  They work as well as the originals.  Time will tell if they last and continue with good shaves as long as the originals did.</li>
            <li> Blades don&#x27;t seem to be sharp as they should be, have to keep going over the face to finally get shaved.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to be as good as when bought the shaver in the first place.</li>
            <li> These shaver heads make my 20 year old shaver work like new.  Excellent product.  Can&#x27;t beat the price.  Recommend.  A+</li>
            <li> Purchase was very good.    Product was what was ordered.    Price was good.    Very Pleased.</li>
            <li> Not really worth one star. Contrary to label HQ8 does NOT fit all 88__ Norelco. The one plus: I was forced to go back to a razor and it sure shaves closer than the Norelco ever did.</li>
            <li> these blades are the right ones and I would order again when I need them again. also the price is right</li>
            <li> Replace once a year for a comfortable close shave</li>
            <li> Great shave every time, I love these blades.</li>
            <li> I have been needing replacement heads for some time...I couldn&#x27;t be happie,r&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s shaving so much better and faster, don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to order&lt;br /&gt;the heads.  Dean</li>
            <li> Great buy, price wise. The package did arrive completely smushed so I was grateful that the product was not damaged at all. It works like new again.</li>
            <li> I replace the heads on my shaver every year or so to keep them sharp.  Amazon has a pretty decent price on the heads.  Usually if I see them in stores they are around $30 to $35 for a set.  I see no reason to buy a new shaver if heads are all I need.    I bought my shaver in 2004 or 2005 and it was $100 at the time for the model with NiMH batteries.  At the time, lesser models came with NiCad batteries and held less charge and the higher model had lithium batteries and held more charge.    These heads keep my shaver going strong even after 6 or 7 years.  I get a decent shave without the mess of a wet shave with razor so I&#x27;m content.  Only problem I&#x27;ve had with my shaver are the batteries.    For the past year or so I noticed the run time on my shaver was decreasing.  It cost me about $8 to get two AA-sized NiMH batteries with solder tabs and about an hour to replace them.  My shaver is good for another 6 years unless something else breaks.  No reason to buy a new shaver if all it needs is batteries and heads to keep it going.  At $25/year I think this is less than I&#x27;d spend on blades.  Please note that not all shavers will use the same batteries; you&#x27;ll need to verify the quantity and size before proceeding with the replacement.  Replacement also involves cutting leads and soldering the batteries in place; it does require a bit of soldering knowledge.</li>
            <li> Changing out the blades each years is a must to keep the razor working fine. I&#x27;ve done this for years now. Some will say it is an unnecessary expense but for me it&#x27;s a must.</li>
            <li> Product met all my expectations and more.  It was better for me to replace this item than to have it sharpen.</li>
            <li> This is the second time that I have replaced the razor heads in my Norelco.    They seem to need replacing about once a year but my shave experience is like a new razor.  Replacing the heads took me all of 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> This was a very timely request and was honored with a quick delivery. Thank you for providing this service.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads work great.  Because of the age of my shaver, I had to use the original casings to allow the heads to work properly.  My shavers is ten years old and with the new heads it shaves as good as new.  Always save the head casings because of the change in design that seems to happen over the years    Brian from PA</li>
            <li> I am a big online shopper, and have been let down many times.  Fortunately for me, I started up a subscription for the replaceable razors, and it worked out fantastic.  It was much cheaper on amazon than any other store, and shipped fast.  Very pleased about the purchase.</li>
            <li> Wanderfull, like a new.</li>
            <li> great price for value</li>
            <li> I saved $5 buying these online instead of going to a brick and mortar store.  Be aware paying attention to the small print as it&#x27;s hard to determine which ones will fit your razor.</li>
            <li> These heads should be resharpened rather than replaced every time. The replacement head shaves smoothly .... cost needs to be a consideration.</li>
            <li> This is a great product by a solid company.&lt;br /&gt;Buying online is the best way to go vs trying to go from store to store or spending time trying to locate them by phoning stores.&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase these again through Amazon when the time comes.</li>
            <li> The razor is working just fine, thanks/</li>
            <li> The Norelco replacement heads were just what I needed and they work perfectly.</li>
            <li> Purchased with shaver, good price but haven&#x27;t had to use yet.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the replacement heads.  They made my shaver cut like when it was new.  Reassembly of the shaver is kinda tricky:  Be sure the little \\&quot;ears\\&quot; on the cup-shaped  combs in which the cutters sit are properly oriented (rotationally) with the shaver head pieces in which they sit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful to get the right replacement cutters!  The HQ9&#x27;s are almost identical to the HQ8&#x27;s, but will not work!</li>
            <li> Exceptional quality.  These are true Norelco brand and it shows. Replaced a 2 year old set of 3rd party blades with these, and it was like night and day.  Far better shave with less pull and bite.  Only thing to be careful of is to use a VERY gentle touch when getting used to a new pair of blades.  it takes a few days for your face to get used to them (or maybe it is the blades breaking in, I am not sure).  But after a few days, they are perfect.</li>
            <li> Ahhhh. Like a new razor again</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product. I bought these razor blades to replace the old ones that had been in the razor for over 1 year. The new ones lasted no time at all. I am saving up to buy a different razor, because I have no intention of paying another $30 for worthless blades. Do not buy!</li>
            <li> By searching Norelco&#x27;s website, I managed to ascertain the correct model number to order. The replacement heads arrived promptly and work wonderfully.</li>
            <li> worked well for replacement cutters</li>
            <li> Excellent replacement rotary blades.</li>
            <li> Spare part that works well enought</li>
            <li> Perfect to replace shaver&#x27;s heads yearly.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I debated about this, since they&#x27;re about half the price of a new shaver, but since I had already found and soldered in a new battery, I figured what the heck.  I have had this shaver for three or four years, and the new blades truly made it shave like a brand new one again.</li>
            <li> Cuts my Heavy beard like a razor.</li>
            <li> Nice that Norelco makes replacement heads and Amazon had the best price. Better than having to buy another razor, very satisfied with the quality.</li>
            <li> Replaced old worn out razor heads,</li>
            <li> It is a precision product. Works excellently after a few shaves (about a week). I guess it is perhaps because it takes a few shaves for the blades to run in.</li>
            <li> I have 3 shavers that I rotate weekly that take these heads.  The original heads are just now starting to go (9 months each set).  I have had this particular replacement head in the past and I know they will not last more than 6 months - hence the 3 stars.  The original heads always seem to last longer - not sure why.</li>
            <li> Need a new set every year.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT, TIMELY SENT,</li>
            <li> This was an easy way to make my Norelco Spectra feel like new.  Easy to use and they arrived fast.  Great transaction.</li>
            <li> Not much to review.  Had the same razor for over 5 years.  Just keep replacing the blades and it&#x27;s still going strong.  These are direct factory replacements so it&#x27;s good as new.</li>
            <li> What can I say,  order the replacement that your shaver calls for and they keep working as always.  They are shaverheads, not precise tools.  Enjoy!!!!!</li>
            <li> I still have an old  Norelco razor and these replacement heads make it work just like a new razor, I was very pleased and would recommend them</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are as good as the originals and were easy to install.</li>
            <li> Me and blades do not get along. I have used electrics for years. I have to say these heads are the smoothest shaving I have ever used. Period. I have tried many other brands and heads, even older versions of the HQ8, but these new ones are by far the best. There was no break-in time like I usually have with new replacement heads; from the very first shave these were extremely comfortable to use.   Considering these are some of the cheaper replacement heads you can find, you cannot go wrong giving these a try. I am not sure what Norelco has done, other than changing the foil design, but these are great. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> When the razor got so dull my husband started looking into new ones, I decided to buy these and give them a shot to see if it would fix the issue. He took the old blades out, washed the unit and put the new ones in and it feels like having a brand new razor. A great way to save money, replace the blades!</li>
            <li> Purchased this to replace 1 year old blades that were leaving my face with fine short stubs.  New blades did the trick of leaving a smooth clean shave that makes shave time very brief.  Good product.</li>
            <li> This electric razor works so much better then the Braun I have.  Hard to beat the triple header expecially with a new set of blades.</li>
            <li> The tripleheader replacement heads are very sharp and quick to shave, although it is a little expensive. It takes around 10 minutes to shave my head, while a used one would take 20-30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Really like my Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li> Just what we needed.  Decent price.</li>
            <li> Product was as I expected.  Have purchased these before</li>
            <li> because I thought there were three sets of head but there was one set of three heads, my mistake. Product is good but a little pricey</li>
            <li> Since I retired from the business world 20 years ago, I have used the same Philips Norelco Tripleheader electric shaver. I then taught high shool for 13 years and was able to keep clean shaven every day as long as I replaced the heads every 6-9 months. Amazon has consistently had the best deal on replacement heads which do the job as well as the original. Hat&#x27;s off to Amazon for\\&quot;keeping me sharp\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Good replacement heads for my Norelco, maybe even better then the originals my razor came with. But...three days after order i saw that you can buy a totally new Norelco razor for 3$ more which would be better. Just check the current prices for new razors before buying replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I purchased my Norelco electric razor about 7 easy ago and it is still going strong. I change out the heads every year. Blades are very sharp and will last a year with regular daily use.</li>
            <li> Work great, worth the price.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected but way overpriced in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I never even knew you needed to change the blades on this shaver. It&#x27;s my first electric, and I&#x27;ve had it a couple years. I never realized how much longer it has been taking me to get a close shave. The new blades make all the difference. If you&#x27;ve had your shaver more than a year, you need these new blades. Buy them.</li>
            <li> As advertised, good replacement, razor cuts great again</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 88xx series Norelco razor and the product arrived on time in perfect condition. It fit my razor as described and has been working perfectly.</li>
            <li> Replace existing blades on Norelco Phillips rotary razor. Razor is as new. Blades fit and work perfect restoring previous cutting of razor</li>
            <li> I purchased the Philips Norelco HQ8 Spectra Tripleheader Replacement Head for my husband&#x27;s razor. He told me his razor was acting up and he thought he needed a new one. I got on line and read the reviews on this razor and found all he needed was the replacement head. After receiving it he put the replacement on his razor which took a matter of seconds and used it right away. It worked fine. He was so happy and relieved and the razor is still going strong and doing the job. He loves it and I&#x27;m glad I found this through all the other reviews.</li>
            <li> These are the only replacement heads that I&#x27;m aware of for the Norelco Electric Shaver.  They restore the shaver to like new performance but in my opinion they are overpriced.</li>
            <li> the replacement heads work great.  the old heads were worn out, so the new ones are just what i needed.</li>
            <li> The product was the solution I needed to make my shaver as good as new and a better price then I could find locally.</li>
            <li> It was so convenient to order these heads and receive them in the mail.  I have used a Norelco razor for many years.  It was great to have new sharp blades.</li>
            <li> The price was less by approximately 30% than the price in the local drugstore. My old shaver now feels like new. I had been thinking of buying a new shaver, but no more, The delivery was prompt. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Just what I need now my shaver machine works as a new one with this replace, you should buy it too</li>
            <li> One of the three heads doesn&#x27;t ride properly in the shell and its extremely noisy.  It works but it is obviously not very well made.  I&#x27;ve been ordering replacement heads every year and this was by far the worst set so far.</li>
            <li> It had been 2 years since I replaced my razor blades.The second the new blades touched my face, it felt as if shards of glass were slashing me. When I looked in the mirror expecting to see blood gushing, staring back at me was a baby faced boy.I recommend them to all masochist, needless to say they are good replacements. 2 thumb up..</li>
            <li> These are the heads manufactured by Norelco for the razor they fit, so they have to work.  I will use them about a year and then replace them.  The price I got at Amazon was the best I found.</li>
            <li> Great item right price.  The blades and combs were very easy to change out and brought my razor back to new condition.</li>
            <li> They came yesterday. Great price. Easy to install but they fell out.</li>
            <li> I had a old 10yr triple header that did a much better and closer shave!!!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know what to do, razor is not what I expected..</li>
            <li> Perfect fit just like new. The shaver says self sharpening but also recommend replacing them once a year. After about 5 years I was getting a lot more shaver burn. Now the shaver works like new again and with the Phillips cleaner lube spray used once a week I have no burn and get an even better shave than ever. Why buy a new shaver when this simple replacement makes the shaver work better than new. I am hoping with the Phillips lube spray I will get at least 5 more years out of these heads.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stay sharp for very long...only last for about 4 months;&lt;br /&gt;then you have to really press them into your skin to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> Need these for a while. It&#x27;s amazing what NEW blades will do. Just what I was expecting and got it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this set of blades for a while now. They haven&#x27;t failed in any way. They&#x27;re name brand replacement heads and fit perfect. Product is shipped in a padded shipping envelope and are still inside their plastic protective shell inside the manufacturers brand box. No damage at all in shipping. And the price is about half of what the big box stores have, if they even have them in stock at those stores. Great deal shipped right to the mailbox.</li>
            <li> They work just like the originals</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Good replacement, reasonable price.  Shaver is like new again.</li>
            <li> It should be advertised as replacement blades not heads. The actual removable head is not included, only the three blades.</li>
            <li> Hi quality OEM heads, not cheap knock off.</li>
            <li> Works great as a replacement of the original heads. I get a much faster and smoother shave with less noise once replaced. Bought another one as a spare.</li>
            <li> The blades in my Norelco razor were getting very dull. The tripleheader replacement blades have made my razor like new. Also the price was lower than local prices.</li>
            <li> Great price and very fast delivery</li>
            <li> These replacements heads will enhance your shaving experience. &lt;br /&gt;Replace the heads every year for optimal shaving performance.</li>
            <li> Fast arrival. Product as expected.</li>
            <li> Easy to assemble.  Now it&#x27;s like new.</li>
            <li> Arrived well packaged and intact.  They fist as advertised, haven&#x27;t installed yet...saving as spares.</li>
            <li> The HQ8 worked very good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used my Norelco shaver for several years and have no problems. Love it. The blades over time became dull although the shaver worked fine. Replacement heads were a very affordable alternative to give my shaver new life.</li>
            <li> Rather difficult to install but once accomplished works great!</li>
            <li> This item does not last too long particularly if you use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Came on time and is a good buy.  They are working just fine</li>
            <li> great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Good value. These are originals.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads gave my machine a new life. Machine works as it did the first day. GREAT PRICE BUY BUY BUY</li>
            <li> The product got  here when I was told it would and the quality was fine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  To me it is important to have a vender do what they agreed to  do on time and on budget</li>
            <li> Second time that I have replaced the heads instead of purchasing a new electric.  This seems a bit less effective than the first replacement, but adequate for my purpose.  The technology may be moving forward.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads improved the shaver performance beyond what I expected.  It is almost as good as shaving with a blade but much, much, easier and faster.</li>
            <li> I forgot how easy it is to shave with sharp blades.  I will replace them much sooner than I had previously.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy the name brand instead of generic. They are definitely a good bit more expensive, but fit perfectly and work very well.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are a must. I replace them about once a year, or longer sometimes. This was the first time I ordered them from amazon. They were cheaper than what I can buy them locally for.  The quality is the same as the ones I have bought in the past. they cut great and I will be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> THE REPLACEMENT HEAD WENT RIGHT ON THE RAZOR WITH NO PROBLEM. EVERYTHING IS WORKING JUST LIKE A NEW&lt;br /&gt;RAZOR AGAIN.</li>
            <li> I received the item and the parts wouldn,t fit my razer either the information is not plain enough from one model to another or I didn,t understand them properly anyway I did not have a very good experience with this item !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always best to replace shaver heads often to get a good shave.Always stick with original heads that work properly.</li>
            <li> I purchased the replacement heads with my razor to take advantage of the bundled discount. They recommend changing them every year. I typically rotate the heads every 3-4 months before replacing at the end of the year.</li>
            <li> Just a couple notes:    The HQ8 blades are also compatible with the 7325XL, which is not listed on their Norelco compatibility chart.    Also you can buy \\&quot;Norelco HP8 blade sharpeners\\&quot; for cheap, they are compatible with any product that uses these heads. I always make sure the device is compatible with these sharpeners before purchase, so I can always have sharp blades and never need to buy a new head.

            <li> Quick and easy blade exchange</li>
            <li> Great way to save a good shaver. Wonderful that you can do this.&lt;br /&gt;Great part for a great price. I have already ordered another one.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the great service&lt;br /&gt;Jonesey Wv.</li>
            <li> Easy replacement of original parts.</li>
            <li> Great product will buy again</li>
            <li> I have used my electric shaver for years and replaced the heads few times so I have no comment on it.</li>
            <li> it was time for a replacement head and i found what I needed through amazon.  everything worked to meet my expectations</li>
            <li> Nice close shave with no irritation.  Works wonderfully.  Product meets expectations and was as described.  The extra replacements heads to go with the razor are a bonus.</li>
            <li> the product which is by the way original and not generic, is exactly what is described and the delivery in my case to australia was quicker than some of the local companies deliver locally.&lt;br /&gt;a very good deal all around.</li>
            <li> Great replacement product. Way less expensive than the same product at the local Target. Better design than the original razor foil. Relatively easy installation. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I had a very hard time finding these until I found them on Amazon. Saves me the cost of having to buy an entirely new razor,so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> It takes my husband shorter time to shave.</li>
            <li> Wow. I had the original blades in for about 14 months, but I could definitely tell the other ones were getting dull at around month 8. I can&#x27;t believe what a difference new blades made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Installation took me about 10 minutes, but it would have been significantly less had I chose to read the instructions. Doesn&#x27;t take a rocket surgeon to install them.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Will definitely use this seller again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this since, the spring near the head of my shaver broke. I didn&#x27;t read this through and it turns out that this product is only the blades and not the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned the product and the return process was really easy. No hassles, just got an RMA, shipped the product back and got the refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wish they would write this in the description that these are just the blades and not the header.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love the way amazon service handled it. Once again, Amazon proves why they are the best seller. Its things like this makes me wanna use Amazon for everything. Now, if only they would manage rental properties ...</li>
            <li> If your razor is not cutting as it should its time you replace the blades. They make the razor feel like its brand new.</li>
            <li> These were exactly what we were looking for.</li>
            <li> When I ordered the heads, I thought I was ordering the whole head assembly that contains the heads.  The airlines broke the head of my razor in handling.  The replacement razor heads are good and I used them in an old razor that I had.  Hopefully you will carry the part that the razor heads go into.</li>
            <li> Made my razor new again. Way cheaper than a whole new shaver.</li>
            <li> Work as promised.  Razor works like it did when it was brand-new.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor 14 months ago and haven&#x27;t regretted it an instant.  I use this razor everyday without irritation of any kind.  I use to use a regular triple bladed razor with shaving cream and I hated it due to the irritation.  The Norelco doesn&#x27;t shave as close but no electric will unless the blades actually touch your face (and then talk about irritation!) but it does a great job and I look well groomed.</li>
            <li> On February 17, 2005 I bought Norelco HQ8 Spectra Tripleheader Replacement Heads from Amazon for my Norelco Spectra 8894 XL electric shaver.  In September, the shaver displays the message \\&quot;Replace Heads\\&quot;.  I can only conclude the Heads were defective or of poor quality.</li>
            <li> Excellent razor, but if you are considering buying replacement blades you already know that...My biggest complaint is it was very difficult to get into the package, installation was easy.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not sure it is that much better than anything else.  They have been functional and well lasting blades - but I suspect you can get that with many other brands for less $$.</li>
            <li> The replacement blades are fine no problem.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Jumbled parts in box,  no useable/readable instructions in box. It was probably returned from a previous buyer and dumped on me.</li>
            <li> These blades work well with my husbands norelco and he gets a really close cut.</li>
            <li> Ordered replacement blades on a Friday &amp; received them via norml mail delivery in 4 days.  Thanks!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent price considering the ones in the stores are about 50% more expensive. I have a better-grade Norelco now. Before, the blades OTC cost as much as a new shaver. Now I won&#x27;t want to pitch a shaver just because the blades cost so much.</li>
            <li> Stopped using my Norelco because the razor burn on my neck was so bad.  Then, DUH, realized I hadn&#x27;t replaced the blades in years.  What a difference.  Can use it again, especially for a quick &amp;#34;touch up&amp;#34; shave.  Still use the blade when I want a really close shave.</li>
            <li> Good Product, just as stated</li>
            <li> I was very pleased for the speed of my purchase. And the blades help my aging husband do his daily shave.  Also when he reaches the mind-set to no longer do it at all, I will be able to do it for him since the heads are floaters.  Thanks</li>
            <li> They worked as well as expected.</li>
            <li> My husband is very happy with his new razor heads.  He said he is once again getting a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li> They are same as original - not used as yet but sure they will work fine...look easy to replace - same delivery as shown</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are excellent and do a wonderful job of cutting without pulling on the beard. The pricing was worth it. I recommend them.</li>
            <li> One of the best electric razors I&#x27;ve ever used.  Went on vacation and a buddy of mine had one and I liked it so much I bought it.  In the 2 years I&#x27;ve had it I never had a hair yanked out.  Not as smooth as a regular razor, but no electric is.  Be cautious with the replacement heads putting them in.  Make sure you don&#x27;t seperate the pieces as it&#x27;s hard to put back together, but it should just pop right into the razor.</li>
            <li> The product fits the shaver very well and was easy to install.  Highly satisfied!  If you are looking for replacement&lt;br /&gt;heads this is the product to order.</li>
            <li> Great product!! First Norelco I have owned and it is a perfect shaver. I had a Braun for most of my shaving time and it was a good product. When I could no longer get blades for it, I decided to try the Norelco. I was pleasantly surprised and am a fan of the new razor.</li>
            <li> Are currently working very well.  Ask again in 6 months</li>
            <li> Everything I expected.</li>
            <li> They perform very well, but for some reason, they added a radiused ear to the bottom which makes installation much more difficult.</li>
            <li> THEY GIVE ME A SMOOTH SHAVE; OFF COURSE IT HELPS WHEN YOU DON&#x27;T HAVE MUCH BEARD; AS MY DAD USED TO SAY, &amp;#34;WHY NOT JUST GET YOURSELF SOME CREAM AND PUT IT ON YOUR FACE, THEN GET A KITTEN TO LICK IT OFF, YOU&#x27;D NEVER NEED A SHAVER BOY!!!!!!</li>
            <li> After shopping at nearby stores, we found that Amazon had the best price, and with Amazon Prime it was a snap to order it.  This price also alleviated the &amp;#34;why not buy a new one&amp;#34; as the blades were cheaper than other alternatives.  I think its been more than a year since we have replaced them, but getting these heads have added new life to this razor used by my 85 year old dad!</li>
            <li> These definitely work better than my 5 year old razors I had. I can&#x27;t give an accurate account of how they compare to the new razor heads but, for now they are a reasonable improvement that didn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li> The new heads work very well.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s time to change heads, it&#x27;s time to change heads. What else can one say? Changed em out, and the face, as ugly as it is, is back to being manageable.</li>
            <li> Well, they did what they were supposed to. The shave was about as good as new. But, is it just me or is Norelco outsourcing stuff and it all and all, seems a little more cheaply made. Considering a new shaving system all in all. But, these heads were indeed good.</li>
            <li> The Norelco shaver is very good and the heads are the thing that makes it a good shaver. I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price beat Walmart.  Furthermore Walmart has a slot for this model number on their shelf but none of the stores ever stock them.  Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> the blades are factory replacement blades. The price was competative with other sources and the blades worked perfect.</li>
            <li> I felt that the product I was purchasing was the complete head for the shaver and not just the blades and screens. Phillips / Norelco over charges for these necessary product maintenence items.    NOTE: retailer delivered product in a timely manner in good condition. There was not a problem with the retailer, only the manufacturer and the presentation of the item sold.</li>
            <li> Lacks quality installation instruction. small 3 pictures (no  words)of install does  not tell all necessary details to install. Was about 5 minute from trashing and  buying  a new other brand electric razor.</li>
            <li> The heads fit and the shaver does work properly but the heads do make more noise than the original heads. I noticed that the heads are a different color and wonder if these are a generic replacement and not an exact replacement. It will be interesting to see if the noise is from some sort of dragging that reduces the life of a charge on the shaver. The jury is still out on that.</li>
            <li> The new blades are as dull as the old blades. I&#x27;ll just buy a new cheap razor each year instead. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco shavers for many years and still believe them to be the best of the electric shavers, but recently the heads just do not seem to hold there sharpness. Years ago I could get over a year an sometimes even two years out of a set of heads. Recently after 6 months they are already loosing there sharpness. In fact this is the second time I ordered these heads from Amazon this year. Amazon&#x27;s price is the best around but even here the price of replacement heads is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> nuff said.  as these are the only ones that fit my shaver.  the original&#x27;s were sharper. and why are these so expensive?</li>
            <li> Quick arrival of goods and exactly what was ordered. Thanks!  No problems with order or supplier. a b c d e</li>
            <li> Norelco is a good product and shaver works much b etter now did not rate at five because the price of Norelco heads are excessive anywhere you buy them</li>
            <li> A very good replacement head for the Norelco Shaver. This is a great way to go to avoid buying new shavers. Good price and good product.</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost. Was set to buy a new razor, but decided to try a replacement head.  Have always felt that replacement heads were not worth the cost and just bought a new razor.  However, my mind is changed.</li>
            <li> The product is fine.  Easy to install.  I was surprised that I received just the blades, it appeared to me that I was buying a complete new head.  My mistake.  Overall I&#x27;m quite satisfied with the razor and the replacement blades.  Thank you.  Bob O&#x27;Neill</li>
            <li> My husband usually has to replace these every year.  They don&#x27;t wear very well and lose their edge pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> The shave is not as close as the original heads when they were new, however the shave was improved over the shave of the original heads when they were used for over a year.</li>
            <li> Norelco replacement heads are a bit pricey, but make a good addition to an order from Ammo to get free shipping. Everything Norelco is excellent.</li>
            <li> My 94 year old Dad badly needed a replacement. This was great, went to his door, and is working well.</li>
            <li> These blades are direct NORELCO brand replacement blades for the Spectra razor.  They fit perfectly and restore the \\&quot;brand new\\&quot; shaving experience that you may be missing due to old, dull blades.    If your blades are more than a year old or you notice that your shave is not as close as it once was, getting a set of these new blades may make the difference.  This is my second set and they really did the trick.    Check the Norelco Website if you are unsure if these fit your model but other than that there is nothing to worry about.  Incidentally, there are less expensive places to buy them other than Amazon.  The shipping kills their competitive pricing.</li>
            <li> replaced with new heads works like new</li>
            <li> Gave my favorite old razor life!</li>
            <li> Blades are not sharp at all.  If I didn&#x27;t need the setting I would send back</li>
            <li> Really helped to perk up my old electric razor.  New blades make all the difference in the world and the price for these was outstanding.</li>
            <li> I got it for my brother and he said he liked it. I think we might need more of them in the future too as he loves his shaver.</li>
            <li> I had forgot what a close shave I could get! I would recommend to any anyone who thinks the might need one to definitely do it now!</li>
            <li> Really good replacement kit, it is not expensive and your machine is new again. I recomend this product. Good choice.</li>
            <li> just what I needed. Fast easy transaction..makes me a satisfied customer</li>
            <li> Better than the heads that they replaced.  Closer shaves.  Wish I could find replaced parts for everything else this good.</li>
            <li> I thought that I had another set of heads, but I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;Your speedy delivery was a big help. My razor is getting older&lt;br /&gt;so can count on delivery as I need more.</li>
            <li> Arrived when promised - good quality...</li>
            <li> The Norelco replacement heads were easy to install.  Now my husband&#x27;s shaver is working like a charm.  Amazon, I love your website.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco HQ8 Spectra Tripleheader replacement heads for my razor are a critical part for obtaining a close shave. The heads should be a normal replacement every 12 months. Somehow the time slipped by and it was a longer time period before I purchased these new heads for my razor. They immediately returned the shaver to its close-shaving newness.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> As advertised.  Very Usefull.</li>
            <li> The replacement blades worked beautifully !!!!</li>
            <li> I was pretty sure they should have worked with my Philips touchsensor device...but...sad to say I was wrong ..came to know only after opening the pack...the picture deceived me...so the one star...otherwise amazon is gr8 w/ service.</li>
            <li> The shaver heads are inexpensive and easy to replace.</li>
            <li> Not the improvement I expected.</li>
            <li> i have bought a norelco electric shaver and i was finally happy after trying a couple more, is just excellent, i felt lately that shaving was taking a little more than the usual, so i decided to get replacements, it had been a bit more than a year after all.. and you can feel the difference.. so it is a good idea to change them every now and then..</li>
            <li> A great source for a good price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the replacement heads! They are like new.  Ray</li>
            <li> It arrived very quickly.  My husband is getting close shaves now.</li>
            <li> It is a replacement head !  IT works very well, just like the old one 4 years ago when it was new.</li>
            <li> What can I say . . . They are new cutting heads for my electric razor and do what they are designed to do.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Razor performance is much improved with new blades.  There is still a problem with nicking the neck skin.  I am researching a replacement razor.</li>
            <li> very pleased with order</li>
            <li> item brand new and working just as expected. Convenient to have item shipped to my house since I hate shopping!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Philips Norelco Electric Shaver for fourteen years.It was a gift from one of my nieces so it feels good when I use it. This is the first time I needed to replace the heads.  Repalcement Head arrived two days earlier than originally scheduled.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the razor and the shave I get with it, but I was very disappointed to find out, after I bought the new razor heads, I could have purchased a new razor, same model, for just about the same as the cost of teh new heads. Bummer</li>
            <li> very pleased with the original product which I am still using. I am sure the new replacement will be as good also.</li>
            <li> Hlghly recommended. Very good quality/price ratio.  Would recommend  this product  to any people that would need it.  It worked perfectly the first time</li>
            <li> Wasted my time and now I have to return the item because it states it fits Spectra 7800XL series.  Fix the description!</li>
            <li> These replacement heads for a relatively inexpensive Norelco razor do the job and are appropriate replacements for the original heads.</li>
            <li> I would just like to say women like to have a close shave to on their legs and I am happy to say this shaver gives just that so I do not have to use a straight shaver. saves on blood. hopes this helps some women out there that think this is wrong but some times the men things are just better and who will know? as long as your legs are smooth and soft who cares if it is a pink shaver or a good shaver like this one is. it has my vote and all my women friends vote too. 5 stars here in phoenix.</li>
            <li> these fit my machine perfectly and work well.</li>
            <li> made my Norelco like a new razor.  liked the HG8 razor better than the new models. Amazon made the transaction very easy 2 days latter my old  razor was like brand new again</li>
            <li> it very cheap,in China jd.com,the HQ8 is sale ￥300 RMB,about $50,the package was broken a little,but don&#x27;t effect to use in life</li>
            <li> My husband ordered these in May 2012 - and we reordered just now in 2015 -- probably should have replaced them more frequently but they do last that long!</li>
            <li> My husband didn&#x27;t know the blades were easy to use. I ordered this and there was even a clipless coupon. Good price.</li>
            <li> Pretty good! It works quite well on my shaver. I think I will buy this item again. I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.......they fit my electric razor perfectly.  could not be happier, order them today you won&#x27;t be sorry</li>
            <li> Exactly back to factory specs. Like new. *** , ok? fully satisfied &amp; ok.&lt;br /&gt;the lazy programmer makes his users jump like fish...</li>
            <li> Look like OEM to me - haven&#x27;t broken them in yet after one shave so they&#x27;re still a tad rough shaving. Perfect fit.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted.  Couldn&#x27;t find it in stock at local stores.</li>
            <li> WORKS JUST LIKE THE ORIGINALS</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000068PBT Philips Norelco HQ8  Spectra Tripleheader Replacement Heads]]  just snap-in, now like a new shaver,   no need to toss the shaver, just replace the blades.  Ken</li>
            <li> The product is OK.  I replaced the factory blades with these blades and I noticed the pattern on top of each of the heads is different.  More holes/perforations instead of slits, this keeps it from cutting my facial hair as efficiently.</li>
            <li> There again, I have used Norelco Products for many years. They last - I usually throw them away after using two blades because I want the latest model.</li>
            <li> replacement blades worked great on a 7 year old shaver.... needed to add extra words for amazon to publish this</li>
            <li> So I got the replacement heads and they work fine. Thie bad is probably my fault for not reading the full product description but they are the 3 invividual replacement heads and not the single replacement cover with the blades as pictured. Again, they work but product not as pictured.</li>
            <li> received with no hazzle or problem and installed in my shaver giving me the closest cut i can always get-very good job!!!</li>
            <li> needed new ones because i was cutting my face every time I shave some needed and order more.  Them have been so good I will order more.  jg</li>
            <li> I should have done this sooner. Absolutely amazing. Smooth, close and through. Just like purchasing a brand new razor. Do it now.</li>
            <li> I know it was a while since I changed the head of my shaver, once changed immediately noticed a difference right from when I turned on the device. The shave is very smooth as well.</li>
            <li> Kind of a pain to install, not going to lie.</li>
            <li> The razors/replacement heads work great in which they are as advertised.  Up to this point they have served me well.</li>
            <li> In the past I have actuallypurchased a new shaver at the same price as the replacement heads, but the price here was appropriate.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how good a clean electri.c felt. My old head was over 5 years old</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a bunch of cutters.  What can I say about cutters; either the cut or they don&#x27;t, plain &amp; simple.</li>
            <li> The new blades did restore the shaving performance of my 6-year-old Norelco shaver. Its original battery, however, holds a charge for only a few days. Given the price of the blades, I probably should have purchased a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than replacing the razor every year.  If you saw my other review...Yes, I do have two razors used for different purposes.  These are very easy to replace and make your old machine new again.</li>
            <li> Good deal but frt is to high so I can buy replacements cheaper at Wal Mart now.</li>
            <li> Just a little tricky getting them installed.</li>
            <li> not and smooth as originals</li>
            <li> Worked great and arrived so quickly.  My husband loved it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought the HQ8 replacement blades several times and they always worked great.&lt;br /&gt;Not these!&lt;br /&gt;They &amp;#34;chatter&amp;#34; .... like a gear is slipping, or !???? I thought it might correct itself with time .... but no. I should have returned them.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it was still Norelco and not Phillips/Norelco .... Germans seem to have messed up a good thing.</li>
            <li> they came fast, easy to install, they work like they are supposed to.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item for my son at Christmas time.&lt;br /&gt;He is extremely happy with this electric razor and was happy with the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> They are expensive.  I end up buying a new razor every other time for about the same cost.  There has to be a better way for my husband to shave.</li>
            <li> Great replacement Heads.</li>
            <li> Their great, I am getting a lot of use from them, mark s. Anderson.</li>
            <li> Needed a new head on my shaver......Fit on my norelco shaver. What more can I say. It works great...nice and sharp....Fast shipping with Prime.....</li>
            <li> It is good to have new replacement heads; they do what they are supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Needed new heads and these are good to go</li>
            <li> It is get that we are able to get replacements for my husband&#x27;s razor.  We were able to get the exact blades he needed and it&#x27;s like having a whole new razor.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT RAZOR HEADS BUT WOULD NOT FIT MY NORELCO RAZOR.</li>
            <li> THE BLADES WOULD NOT WORK ON MY RAZOR. THEY DID NOT HAVE THE REQUIRED PARTS. IT APPEARS THAT  RQ12 MIGHT WORK.</li>
            <li> Norelco replacement blade are pretty decent. They&#x27;re not the high end of Norelco, and they&#x27;re not as good as a proper safety razor, but for your average electric razor they&#x27;re pretty good.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are great the first week. Then they become dull and don&#x27;t shave as close. I would pay more for a product that lasted longer.</li>
            <li> Makes the razor just like new again.  Had to be careful when removing them from the package not to mix up the parts. With the discounted price, the replacement heads cost less than a new replacement plastic guard that I need.</li>
            <li> The best Norelco has.  Prices vary slightly.  Pay S/H for the convienence.</li>
            <li> work great and have a spare.</li>
            <li> Great product, extends the life of a shaver 10 fold. For many years, i lived in darkness, everyone knows you need to change your razor blades regularly, but does EVERYONE know that electric shavers need replacement blades as well? This guy didn&#x27;t, that being said, i&#x27;ve ordered these several times right now. Perfect fit and great shave. Philips Noreclo reccomends changing annually, i&#x27;m more towards the 6 month plan to keep them sharp.</li>
            <li> Perfect great deal to local costs</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how easy it was to replace the heads.  Should have done it years ago.  The Spectra rules.</li>
            <li> Amazon has everything! When I couldn&#x27;t find these in a local store I checked here. Price was good and it filled my need to keep the electric going!</li>
            <li> My razor is a year old, so it was time to replace the heads. Installing the replacement heads was easy. They may not shave as close as a razor blade, but I don&#x27;t have to worry about nicks and bleeding. As long as I take my time and stretch my skin as instructed, I get a good shave.</li>
            <li> This is the third set of replacement heads I purchased for my shaver and this set seems somewhat improved over the last set.</li>
            <li> perfect, fast shipping !</li>
            <li> As with the oringinal heads, they work great when new, but dull quickly and are too expensive to have to keep replacing.  I probably will buy a differnt razor rather than continue to replace the heads for this one.</li>
            <li> Good replacements for my shaver.</li>
            <li> Works like a new razor with its original sharpness, feels great on the face and beard and a faster and satisfing shave.</li>
            <li> I purchased the main item before. I don&#x27;t just use this item on my beard I also use it to shave my head. The blades lasted under a year. A shame that it couldn&#x27;t self sharpen for the price of the main trimmer.</li>
            <li> Product was a replacement for shaver heads.  Ordered them, received them, and am using them.  They keep me clean shaven.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Norelco rotary shaver user for over 20 years.  Blades are long-lasting, easy to change, and easy to clean.  They usually last a little less than the advertised one year, but blade life is probably a function of many variables, so I don&#x27;t see this as a negative.</li>
            <li> The replacement blades are sharp but I have found the replacement screens that come with the blades less effective than the original screens.  The replacement screens have a different pattern of holes that do not seem to be effective at catching hairs that lay at certain angles, something I did not notice with the original screens.</li>
            <li> Quality product, quality service.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband and he reckons they are fantastic,</li>
            <li> These replacement heads repaired my husbands razor like new.  He is very happy.  Best price I could find for replacement.</li>
            <li> I have had Norelco razors for 40 years.  The HQ8 replacement heads always make the razor seem like new again.</li>
            <li> I have the Norelco 8825XL and this is my 3rd replacement set of head that I have purchased from Amazon over the past 8 years.  Since it really feels like a new shaver again, it is like buying your current shaver for just 21 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before buying yet another set of replacement heads, I took a look at all the current shavers, reading all the reviews, figuring that after 8 years, perhaps it was not worth it to spend any more money on my old shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I decided that I&#x27;d rather have an 8825XL over any of the current 2012 crop. They are all short in at least one of these areas that my shaver does fairly well with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a wet/dry shaver that travels well.  There is no bulky and fragile support stand to lug around for those 3 week+ trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be used plugged in when the battery finally fails or stops before I am done shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is completely reliable.  Many of the current Lithium battery shavers seem to be dying within 2 years.  There is no way to use them without the battery being charged and it appears that the chargers are killing the batteries prematurely.  This was never a problem with the old battery technology (tho I have always COMPLETELY drained my batteries before re-charging.. so far I am nearly 3,000 shaves and 8 years with the original batteries).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may not do as well as a razor, but none of the current crop do any better.  The $300 Norelco 1280X/42 SensoTouch seems to come close, but they are charging an arm and a leg for the attempt to get the battery technology working almost as well as the older-and-cheaper NiCad technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can replace the batteries when they finally do die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I figured that until someone decides to make a shaver that is clearly better than the one I have now, why not just keep getting these replacement heads every other year until the motor dies, which could easily be 50 years from now.</li>
            <li> The heads is sharp and does a good job. It was a little hard for me to put the replacement heads in but i got them in.</li>
            <li> This replacement razor works just as good as the original. I have not had any trouble out of it, and it was cheaper than any of the local stores.</li>
            <li> I found the head replacement was a fair price and it arrived in a very timely manner.  I like it that they can be cleaned very easily by simply rinsing in water.  Should have bought two but will reorder.</li>
            <li> I was not getting a great shave from my electric razor and decided to replace the heads instead of the entire razor.  This replacement head fit perfect and is providing excellent shaves.  The heads had not been replaced in two years, I will replace them sooner in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not 100% sold on the whole Philips Norelco thing these days, but this gets enough of the job done.  I&#x27;m actually buying another replacement pack because my blades have worn down again, but they seem to last about as long as you&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li> Just what the doctor ordered.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Norelco razors for years and expect to change blades every year, never had a bad set.&lt;br /&gt;Will be back next year.</li>
            <li> I have a 12 year old norelco shaver that keeps on working. I use it only occasionally. The new blades are great and I also loved it so much i purchased the 1280x/42. That is the best electric shaver I have had. Got it at target for less than 50% off the manufacturer&#x27;s listed price. Lists for $349 and got it at target for 150 on sale this month. That is the razor to get!</li>
            <li> these parts gave my old razor new life.  An electric is very convenient but still doesn&#x27;t give me a shave as close as I would like.</li>
            <li> I have had a norelco now for some time. Compared to other brands in the past, it is easy to clean and maintain as well as parts are reasonable. The replacement heads were easy to replace and saved me so much time and money.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in sharpness.  These heads are only a little better than the ones I replaced.</li>
            <li> I had my electric razor sitting in my bathroom cupboard for quite a while before I finally decided to look up the replacement blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were reasonably priced and made my razor shave very close like it was brand new again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have had your shaver for more than 6 months or so, you will definitely get better results getting a new set of heads for your razor and it&#x27;s certainly much cheaper than buying a new one!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot cheaper than sold in China Mainland.&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s very comfortable, if necessary, i will buy it again.</li>
            <li> blades dull. It took 4 times as long to shave. Had to use hand razer to finish the job. Should have returned</li>
            <li> The product was delivered on time, The head was  easy to replace and works as good as when it was new, I would recommend this to my friends</li>
            <li> Works well. No complaints.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> the replacement heads did the trick  shaver cuts like new  i hope to use this shaver for years and i will keep this website for any future purchases</li>
            <li> I have a 15 year old XL razor. When the blades stop cutting. I order a new set. They last about 18-20 months. drop in a new set and it&#x27;s as good as new</li>
            <li> Not sure what&#x27;s going on here, but after MANY years of using Norelco shavers and getting almost a year out of the heads; this one was not cutting well after only two weeks !  Metal Quality changed ?</li>
            <li> Good value for what I paid and still working very well.  Had the original set for over a year and these seem to be as good quality.</li>
            <li> Easy to replace and ok price.  About $4 less than Walmart. I get these auto  shipped.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco HQ8 Spectra Tripleheader Head  Will not shave as close as my old  HQ8 Tripleheader I am sorry I bought it  Sincerely  Joel Gallez  jaggrandpa@yahoo.com</li>
            <li> When you need it, you need it.</li>
            <li> Norelco makes an excellent shaving product. I&#x27;ve used them for over 50 years.</li>
            <li> I have two Norelco razors that I received as gifts over the last few years I would clean them regularly however eventually they just wouldn&#x27;t shave close any longer. I was prepared to purchase a new high dollar razor when the clerk at a local store said that the only real thing that goes bad over time is the heads so why not spend less money and purchase new heads. Well that&#x27;s exactly what I did and the razors work just like the day I received them.</li>
            <li> Was a good price and quickly shipped from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several weeks of use, the new blades have given me razor burn and several small nicks and cuts that I never received before.  Cant even use it now without getting heave irritation and burn.</li>
            <li> Happy  Happy  Happy  I got this!☺</li>
            <li> These were used on a shver atleast 20 yrs. old. Gave it new live and a much better shav to say the least,</li>
            <li> I have tried all razors over the years and still go back to Norelco.  This heads from Amazon are at about the lowest price I could find. I have tried expensive Norelco and cheap Norelco razors.... I think they all work about the same.</li>
            <li> Love electric shavers. My beard wears out Schlick blades. These are very smooth.</li>
            <li> Hubby needed new blades for his razor and could not find locally.  These replacements fit &amp; worked great great he said.</li>
            <li> Fits the Norelco razor and shaves the whiskers close. No problems at all and the price was right, better than anywhere else that I checked.</li>
            <li> These things start to wear out after about a year so they must be replaced.  I find these work exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Even though the razor head lasts a good, long time, it&#x27;s always nice to be able to have spares on hand--and at a reasonable cost!  Bought these with a the razor without breaking the bank.  Awesome deal for everyone.</li>
            <li> i got mine about a year ago. its been very handy. the battery last a long time. dont have to take the charger along or anythign its awsome. if im going out on a date or something i usually use a mach3 to get it real smooth but other than that this is preobobly the easiest way to go.</li>
            <li> i havent changed the blades in 2yrs and i was looking around for the ones that would fit and this one fits perfectly to what i needed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so if you need new blades i recommend this one</li>
            <li> Shaving is sooooo much easier with new heads installed.  Thank you Amazon, for a great deal... again!</li>
            <li> SHEESH, YOU CAN&#x27;T EVEN FIND THESE RELACEMENT HEADS IN   WAL-MART ANYMORE.  THANK GOD FOR AMAZON. ABOUT THE SAME  PRICE AS WAL-MART TOO, EVEN WITH SHIPPING.   AND NORELCO IS ALWAYS A GOOD PRODUCT. MY DAD &amp; BOYFRIEND  BOTH ARE LIFE-LONG NORELCO USERS.</li>
            <li> I noticed the reviews on this item were sort of all over the place. Since most buyers seemed satisfied, I decided to order them. I am glad I did. They have been working out well for me. Recommend to others.</li>
            <li> The product works great.  It arrived when it was supposed to and will order again if need to later.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for my model (800 series) Norelco triple headed razor. Razor is now back shaving just as well as when the razor was brand new.</li>
            <li> If you have an older Norelco that you just can&#x27;t part with like me get your new heads here. I replace them about every 18 mos or so and they are factory fresh at a fair price and work perfectly.</li>
            <li> Great product. Very happy with buying experience</li>
            <li> I had used a Norelco triple head shaver for years and was not getting a good shave.  Ordered a set of replacement blades and installed them (with difficulty).  I was surprised the shave was not even as good as with the old blades.  Was so dissatifed t began searching and studying other rankes.  Seattles on a Four Head Panasonic and find it to be the best razor i&#x27;ve ever Usedom.  Never New i could get such a comfortable close shave.</li>
            <li> This is an exact replacement and works perfectly, and still does as of this review which is several years after purchase.  I only replaced my original heads because I damaged them during a cleaning, otherwise I think they would have had many more years of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some help on replacement heads can be found on line:  [...]</li>
            <li> These blades made a good improvement in shaving. Arrived in record time.Made my razor like new. Norelco lives up to it&#x27;s name.[[ASIN:B000068PBT Philips Norelco HQ8 Spectra Tripleheader Replacement Heads]]</li>
            <li> OK OK OK OK&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It complied with the function it was designed to perform.Why do you insist on comments when it clearly is a routinaire product ????</li>
            <li> These worked OK.  The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that there were no instructions. I had to go online to find directions.  Most people probably don&#x27;t keep their product booklets, so it would help to include the \\&quot;how-to\\&quot; with the replacements.</li>
            <li> replaced the blades in my old razor and it worked great, gives a nice clean shave, and the price was right</li>
            <li> I was skeptical until I used the razor after installing these. To my surprise I got the closest shave I remember ever.</li>
            <li> arrived on time and as advertised</li>
            <li> Worked great in my older razor . Just what I wanted</li>
            <li> Everything was what I expected</li>
            <li> works perfectly with my old Norelco shaver, now if I can remember to replace it on occasions.</li>
            <li> I had forgotten what a difference new blade make.  It was like having a new razor!  My husband was thrilled.</li>
            <li> These were a perfect replacement for my worn out heads.  They brought new life to my shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included are 3 round blades and the 3 &amp;#34;combs&amp;#34; that the blades fit into.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  Satisfied.</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and cut very close...very good quality.The HQ8 replacement blades are top quality and I&#x27;m pleased that I can extend the use of my Norelco, without purchasing a new one.</li>
            <li> Excellent Replacement parts when the current one wear out. A much closer shave.</li>
            <li> There must be dozens of Norelco models that have similar parts however this product matched my model perfectly. Good price too.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers for many years.  These replacement shaving heads were so bad, I will go back to the original product.</li>
            <li> Hey, I&#x27;ve been using a Norelco Electric Shaver for over 60 years. Need I say more?</li>
            <li> These were just a little tricky to install, so be sure you study your current razor head before taking the old blades out.  Now I get a really comfortable close shave,</li>
            <li> I have ordered before and they have the best price. Works great with the razor I purchased years ago from amazon (again the best price)</li>
            <li> The blades are very durable I shave as much as three times a week and I had the blades working just fine since 7 months now, and the shaving experience is awesome, at the beginning requires time to get use to them.</li>
            <li> item was received and met expectations</li>
            <li> So much better (and cheaper!) to replace the blades on my husbands favorite razor than to buy a new one!</li>
            <li> Easy to assemble, fair price. My shaver is sharp again. I&#x27;ve been using for two weeks, and hope it lasts one year as the original blades.</li>
            <li> I had a loved a Norelco shaver for many years, then bought a new one but found it just did NOT do the job the way I was used to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaves were so bad I could not believe Norelco would sell a piece of junk like this. I could not get any response from Norelso. I was ready to throw it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I came across a site called PaulpersDime.com, which reviews all the shavers including al lthe Norelco models, and one piece of advice changed everything: The cheaper models, like the one I bought, are saddled with badly designed heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead I should buy the heads that come with the more expensive shavers -- the HQ8 series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did that -- buying it from Amazon, of course, and for much less than Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my great surprise, that was indeed the solution -- in one fell swoop, my shaves are back to what I was used to with my old Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe it was that easy. And I can&#x27;t wrap my brain around the idea that Norelco would be so idiotic as to sell product lines deliberately crippled. It;s not like their site tells you :&amp;#34;This is the cheap line, but the heads aren&#x27;t that good; if you want a really good shave you have to pay more to get better heads.&amp;#34; The product descriptions seem to suggest that every item is exactly like every otehr item ecept for some extra features (which I don&#x27;t need). If it weren&#x27;t for that web site mentioned above, I&#x27;d have thrown this Norelco out and bought a Braun (which apparently does the same dumb thing so I&#x27;d still be frustrated and had to go back to razors, never figuring out what the heck went wrong).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I posted a review of the Norelco razer earlier, complaining about this. The Norelco people are too dumb, or too socilal-media dim, to react.</li>
            <li> I have had great success with these replacement blades. They provide me with a great close shave and perform flawlessly. Bought them through Amazon and I am completely satisfied. I fail to understand the negative reviews that have been posted, I have not experienced any of those issues. Right out of the box on the first use, they were spectacular. They have continued to work perfectly from there. My blades did not need a break in period.</li>
            <li> they are blades, they cut, what more do you need to know?</li>
            <li> Perfect fit and function.  Just not worth it to by a cheap knock off for a shaver you use every day.  Treat yourself to the best for just a few bucks more.</li>
            <li> I used my razor for about 1 year and it wouldn&#x27;t cut anything. I replaced the heads and viola, clean shaven again.</li>
            <li> As good a price as you can get anywhere</li>
            <li> Work as expected. Hold up better than expected and we don&#x27;t have to replace them too often. Usually cheaper than in store.</li>
            <li> This Norelco HQ8 replacement head is awesome and did the trick, Now my razor shaves like new again, and now it takes two days for the beard to start showing back up again. Where before I would have to shave every day, and by the end of the day I looked like the beard was growing back already. Loving my like new razor . Awesome Factory replacement head. Also I read they should be replaced every 13 months. So when the time comes I&#x27;ll buy another new one for sure.</li>
            <li> Gives a very close shave, better than the original did. I would recommend this to anyone with a tough beard like mine.</li>
            <li> They fit nicely on the shaver. They were easy to replace. I now have a nice clean cut after shaving.</li>
            <li> I love the product.  I WILL buy this product through you again when the time comes.  Take care and have a good day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keith</li>
            <li> About a week ago I received HQ8 replacement tri-heads from Amazon for my Philips Norelco, Model 7310 shaver.  After a few shaves I noticed that I was not getting as close a shave as with my old HQ8 blades.  The new blades even cut my chin once causing it to bleed.  Fortunately, I had saved my old blades, so I put them back in and got good long lasting shaves once again. I suspect that I paid for a poor quality knock-off set.  Looking closer at the blades, the surfaces had differently shaped hair slots, and my old blades had the words \\&quot;\\&quot;Lift and Cut\\&quot; engraved twice on each head surface.  The replacement blades did not.  AMAZON, CAN YOU HELP?  I KEPT THE BAD BLADES!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t able to purchase this retail and very happy to have it available for my father!! Speedy delivery, thanks for the good job</li>
            <li> Perfect fit and function</li>
            <li> My husband lost one part of the razor down the sink and expected to wait 7-10 days to get the replacement parts.  Not so with Amazon ... the item arrived in 2 days after my order with no expediting or special options.  It fits the razor perfectly.</li>
            <li> shipped on time, product was right, great, thanks</li>
            <li> Just like a new razor since I put these in.</li>
            <li> Purchased these for hubby as he goes thru shaver heads quickly with his tough beard.  They work well and seem to last longer than other brands.</li>
            <li> My husband is very pleased with this replacement.</li>
            <li> Nice to be able to shave clean again - these are new, as described in OEM packaging.</li>
            <li> The razor blades work fine for a close shave. The problem here is that the blades are shipped from an independent seller who has charged me 10$ shipping costs on a product that costs just 33$! Why does an item that weighs just a few ounces warrant an inflated shipping cost like that? Shaver&#x27;s Outlet, who supplies this item for Amazon customers, care to explain yourselves? I can go into any retail discount store and buy a new razor for that price. This will be the first and last time you receive an order for one your products from this very ticked off customer.</li>
            <li> Tried to purchase this item but it was lost in the mail.  Amazon tried to send me another one but that one was on back order.  Needless to say I canceled and received a credit for the order.  Thanks to Amazon for a quick credit and response.  Maybe it wasn&#x27;t them but their supplier. Got this product from another source and works great.  Although, it seems to perform as well as the 3yr. old blades that were in the shaver.  They recommend replacement once a year?  I think not.  Still a great shaver anyway.</li>
            <li> While a bit pricey, they were easy to replace and after a short break in period, provide a good clean shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that norelco makes replacement blades and I dont have to throw away a perfectly good motor. It&#x27;s good product stewardship.</li>
            <li> Good stuff great quality s</li>
            <li> I just ordered the factory Norelco replacement heads for my old (80&#x27;s or early 90&#x27;s)shaver.  Regular shipping.  The came fast, fit perfectly, and shave WAY better than before. No reshaving and following up with a blade.  Should have replaced them 10 years ago.  100% happy. Very easy. (if they sucked even a little bit I&#x27;d sure tell you)</li>
            <li> Love my Norelco razor, I have had it for 12 years and never had any problems, These replacement blades are always great for it, they hold an edge for a long time. I replace them every year.</li>
            <li> What a difference new blades make in the quality of the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My razor was a little over a year old and I guess the change in the shave quality was so gradual that I didn&#x27;t really notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After replacing the blades the razor now performs like it did when it was brand new.</li>
            <li> I though I&#x27;d see a big improvement in closeness after installing these. No real difference at all! Very disappointing...</li>
            <li> The new heads seem to slip in the shaver.</li>
            <li> My husband uses them and loves we can have on autoshipment as needed.</li>
            <li> So far working good. Headline misleading! I thought I was getting more than one because it headline says &amp;#34;Heads&amp;#34;. Unfortunately not so. Disappointed when only one arrived. For that reason likely will not buy again.</li>
            <li> My husband likes his  shaver. He tells me he will not wait so long next time before ordering a new head for his shaver.</li>
            <li> I was about to go back to a blade, but these new Norelco HQ8 returned my electric to 100% new at a reasonable cost</li>
            <li> They fit perfectly and my husband who has been a traditional razor blade shaver for 60+ years has been won over to this electric razor.</li>
            <li> The price is great and the shipping fast however it seems like I got a little closer shave with the original blades , that being said ,They work fine I just have to shave a day earlier.</li>
            <li> Restored original performance of my razor!  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My razor used H6 blades.  The HQ8 dont seem to fit that well and are quite chattery/noisy. Dont seem to be a great fit in my case.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to get my shaver in tip top shape.</li>
            <li> Purchased the new cutting blades for my old Norelco , fit and worked well.</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to install and my first shave was as close as I&#x27;ve had since I first bought the razor.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000068PBT Philips Norelco HQ8  Spectra Tripleheader Replacement Heads]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon for: having this, the great service and very good price!</li>
            <li> They work perfectly, I now get a great shave again.</li>
            <li> I love the Philip Norelco electric shaver. I finally changed the heads and it shaver is as good as new though the one old weren&#x27;t that bad even after using it for last 2 years.</li>
            <li> Have used Norelco razors for years.  Purchased replacement blades many times and the result is always the same.  The after market product doesn&#x27;t provide the same quality shave as the original equipment.</li>
            <li> GREAT SERVICE &amp; GREAT PRODUCT, THANKS</li>
            <li> Good product and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Often I am on the go and the AT810 electric shaver with the HQ8505 heads work very well away from home.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. The very last Norelco I&#x27;ll ever buy. Bought a $15.00 travel Braun and it shaves better than a $100 Norelco, which won&#x27;t stay together. What a complete piece of junk, and no the shaving heads didn&#x27;t help. I didn&#x27;t want to put 1star, but they made me</li>
            <li> Work fine, razor works as well as when I first bought it.  Docked a star for clamshell packaging inside the box.</li>
            <li> So much better now that I&#x27;ve replaced my heads. No more nicks!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Never disappointed.</li>
            <li> I installed these and after the first use they worked perfect and I didn&#x27;t have to press the blood out of my face. Amen.&lt;br /&gt;JJK</li>
            <li> OEM razor replacements - perfect; fast ship, no complaints.Installation takes a few minutes and requires careful practice the first time. Greatly helps if you have opposable thumbs!</li>
            <li> Perfect Fit!  Nuff said.</li>
            <li> Have ordered before, works good.</li>
            <li> Great!  Added new life to razor.</li>
            <li> Husband very satisfied with these!~</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this heads since almost a year by now and still working perfectly, they shave my bear in a lovely way and I can barely imagine a better product!</li>
            <li> Great product.does what its sapposed to..</li>
            <li> Replace the three heads and you practically have a new razor. These are easy to replace and come with complete instructions. Good price, quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I really trust in Philips Norelco replacements heads. It does what it does. Every year I change the heads for better results. I recommed this article</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased these replacement blades for my husband a couple of times now and each time he puts them in his razor he comments that it&#x27;s like new again.  He is very satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect fit and at a lower price than retailers. What else can be said about a replacement head?</li>
            <li> Made my 5-year-old razor perform like new!</li>
            <li> Great! made razor like new,</li>
            <li> These are individual blades. When I first saw this I got the impression it was the whole head. However, they clip in easily enough and the one I bought this for is pleased with them.</li>
            <li> Works good! Fits my Philips Norelco PT720 perfect!</li>
            <li> The original blades lasted about a year and a half. These blades don&#x27;t even compare, they don&#x27;t cut as well which now I have to follow up with a razor, and I hate using my once loved shaver. Looking for a new electric razor that has replacement blades that don&#x27;t suck.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT AND STILL USING IT FOR OVER A YEAR NOW.... THE RAZORS ARE SHARP AS EVER AND ARE WORTH THEIR MONEY.</li>
            <li> Exactly the right replacement heads for my husband&#x27;s Norelco shaver.  Easy to replace.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> like it the battery holds a charge for a long time. can&#x27;t compete with a straight edge though that&#x27;s why only 4 stars but otherwise I really like it as a quality product</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness these are difficult to get into place. If you don&#x27;t have a degree in engineering or have someone who is extremely handy--really just buy a new one.  Once they are in place they work fine.</li>
            <li> everything is outstanding. if it is not broken don&#x27;t try to fix it.&lt;br /&gt;one problem I guess whay back when we ordered something and put it under my wife&#x27;s name (Dee ((Dolores))). Thats ok don&#x27;t change nothing, it&#x27;s normally Edward J. Woods is the buyer and receiver.</li>
            <li> This item was exactly what I needed.  The shipment was prompt and professionally done.  I recommend this item and phillips razors and I speak from experience.  No cuts and closer than a blade results.  Excellently done!</li>
            <li> Package was damaged.  But product was fine.</li>
            <li> Easy to replace. Does what I expect them to do. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> The Norelco does not shave as close as a blade, but it is faster.  I tend to alternate between shaving with a blade and using the electric razor.  The electric works better (for me) the day after using the old fashioned razor because the stubble is shorter to begin with and I do not have to go over my face as many times compared to if I had also used it the day before. I use the electric regularly because I don&#x27;t always need a really close shave and it results in zero nicks compared to the old fashioned shaver.  I take anticoagulants for a cardiac condition, and even small shaving cuts can be a problem to stop bleeding at times.</li>
            <li> Hard to get excited about razor heads... They work as expected and shipped on time for a good price. What&#x27;s not to like?!</li>
            <li> My old razor was getting dull and this was a much needed reaplacement.  Item was the right price for the quality.</li>
            <li> Usually I just throw my old razor away and buy a new one because the replacement blades cost so much. But I had used the razor for about a year and had been shaving my head with it for maybe 6 months before the blades were simply to dull to use. I acknowledge that is not the intended use case for these but after getting a decent amount of time out of the original blades I figured I&#x27;d pay the crazy half a whole new razor price and restore my razor to new. It was a waste of money. The new blades installed and at first things were great. It was back to working like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After not even a month it was just as bad as before. Cleaning it made no difference. If I got 5-6 months, heck even 3 months I might be OK with it but 1 month (even shaving my head and beard) is useless. The blades cost half the price of the whole razor, I expect them to work. The blades won&#x27;t cut my hair at all either, my other old razors in the drawer with dull blades will at least do a poor job of it still but when this things blades go dull it does nothing regardless of different techniques.</li>
            <li> Made my razor cut like new again.  And the cost of these heads through Amazon was the best that I could find.  Very pleased with this purchase, the quality of the product and the shipping.  Thank you...</li>
            <li> Item as described fast shipping</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are better than the originals. They were easy to replace and cut great. I will recommend these to everyone.</li>
            <li> It seems I&#x27;m almost wearing the whiskers off, I go over them so many times and even then it&#x27;s nat a real close shave.</li>
            <li> Made my razor work like new !!!</li>
            <li> I have not replaced my heads as yet-so I will give you a report when I do.</li>
            <li> Grandpa is now able to cut off all those pesky gray stubbles and look handsome again.  I appreciate a smooth cheek to kiss.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> Not as expected. Shown were the entire head, not just  the little round cutters. I finally purchased a different brand razor.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor and good blades. They do to dull&lt;br /&gt;after a while so it is good to have a spare handy.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I ordered &amp; is an Exact fit, witha good price  too. I will order again.  Thank you</li>
            <li> They have worked very well and it was somethink I needed to do sooner.</li>
            <li> I have tried the newer norelcos that have different screen designs and have not gotten a closer shave than with this model.  The blades stay sharp for over a year!  It is rare to find a product that works exactly as it is meant to and exceeds your expectations for performance and longevity.  That is exactly what these norelco blades and razors do for me.  I highly recommend and won&#x27;t change from this razor set.</li>
            <li> Much better shave with new cutters. Should have bought them sooner.</li>
            <li> They are just as advertised. Just make sure that you get the ones designed for your model.&lt;br /&gt;My experience is that they t last about a year.</li>
            <li> Cost more than a new Philips razor and is worth it. &amp;#34;You get what you pay for&amp;#34;. Don&#x27;t buy cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> Currently chose these because living in Brazil and to expensive to replace my husband&#x27;s razor.  He says they work great.  There was no problem having my mom ship them through customs.  There&#x27;s definitly a huge mark-up on these though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these replacement blades for years.  I get a new set every 6 months, and by then, they need to be replaced.  But I&#x27;m pretty happy with the performance and longevity.</li>
            <li> I had my shaver for about 4 years and decided to buy a new set of blades for it.&lt;br /&gt;It called for the HQ8 which is what I ordered and received. The design they&lt;br /&gt;send now for these shavers are different from the original one which was a&amp;#34; lift and cut&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;one.&lt;br /&gt;This one says &amp;#34;dual precision&amp;#34; and has different design of the holes in it, it does not&lt;br /&gt;shave as close as the old design, I checked at Walmart and saw their new shavers&lt;br /&gt;have several different head designs.&lt;br /&gt;They should stick with the original design the customer bought at least for longer than&lt;br /&gt;4 years.</li>
            <li> I have shaved about 8 times with these new heads and they are cutting smooth and  I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Just thought you would be interested that I shaved with a blade razor since I was 18 and six months ago on my 69th birthday I received a Norelco electric razor as a gift.  I decided to try it and was very pleased with the shave I was getting and the ease of cleanup after each shave.  I figured the big test would be when the heads wore out and I replaced them, would I still be satisfied with the shave?  Well, I was not disappointed by the new heads.  They perform every bit as well as the originals.  An additional service that I really like is that Norelco will send me my next replacement heads at precisely the time that these heads should be wearing out.  Talk about satisfaction with the heads and the service, I am a fan for life!  Why didn&#x27;t I go electric long ago?</li>
            <li> New shaver head made the razor feel like new and was much cheaper AND EASIER than purchasing a new one</li>
            <li> Worked as designed. It was my first time changing the heads (in 2 or 3 yrs of use) so I had to fiddle a bit with them to get it all lined up properly, but once done they worked.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize my old shaver heads were so dull.  The new HQ8 heads give me such a close shave.</li>
            <li> I used my original blades for a couple of years, and thought a brand new set would be much sharper. They were just barely noticeably sharper, but they do work and fit fine. Could be that the originals, though old, were just not worn. I alternate between this shaver, and a traditional Panasonic wet/dry shaver, so this doesn&#x27;t get used daily, only a couple of times a week. Not sure if I would buy these again.</li>
            <li> These have made a tremendous improvement in the operation of my razors, I was not aware of the need to change them.</li>
            <li> What can I say they are Replacement Heads for a Norelco Razor - except that you can not beat the price! Try searching for these anywhere and this price is the lowest anywhere!</li>
            <li> I replace my blades every year. Easy to install new blades, after removing old ones.  You can extend the life of your razor by years. The rechargeable battery wears out, which limits the number of years you can get out of this type razor. Blades are still cheaper than buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> Fit right, and cut nice.  A huge improvement for a worn out razor.  If yours is not making a close shave or pulling whiskers out, you need this.</li>
            <li> 2nd time I&#x27;ve ordered these replacement blades for my shaver. They make a world of difference to the shave and come at a decent price.</li>
            <li> Shaver works like new again.</li>
            <li> I have coarse hair and the blades don&#x27;t seem to last.</li>
            <li> Superb  replacements at a reasonable price. Good clean shaves just like a whole brand new razor. EASIEST WAY TO GO for a like new device.</li>
            <li> product was as listed,easy to install and gave me a very close shave with comfort,price was as good as you will find!</li>
            <li> These blades are actually better then the ones that came with my series 7130.  I tried sharpening the old blades, and it helped for a few months, but new blades are SOOOO worth it.</li>
            <li> It took a while to get these seated correctly. Once they were in, they worked fine. I should be good for another two years.</li>
            <li> Replacement give new life to my old razor.</li>
            <li> good product woks great in my razor</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, my husband doesn&#x27;t think it shaves close enough.</li>
            <li> These went right on my razor, and it&#x27;s running and cutting just like new.</li>
            <li> Have used for 2 weeks. Application is simple. Appears to make razor operate more smoothly with little effort. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> After years of searching stores for these, it&#x27;s so nice to get them here. Also nice that Norelco makes them so easily replacable.</li>
            <li> Its always good to find these replacement blades at a good price. Amazon has my go to place for these items for the last several years.</li>
            <li> My razor works like new.</li>
            <li> The product is a necessary rip off.  My first Norelco I had for 22 years and it had self sharpening blades.  Now you have to replace the blades every year because they get dull so quickly.</li>
            <li> Exactly what is is. Replacement blades for your Norelco shaver. Doesn&#x27;t come with housing as perhaps depicted on the packaging. Simply 3 blades with 3 mesh screens.</li>
            <li> Blades cut worse than the old ones they replaced and took me almost twice as long to shave as normal.  The good thing was that Amazon.com provided exceptional service and quickly sent me a new replacement set.  Those blades were just fine.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Changing the shaver heads gets you a better shave. That&#x27;s all there is to it. Electric shavers do not free you from buying blades.</li>
            <li> I replace my blades once a year and being able to buy them inexpensively online is very handy for me.....it just makes sense.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t changed my heads in years and when I put the new ones in I was stunned!  I will be changing them every year if not more often.  I would recommend that you do to.</li>
            <li> Design is good except there is room of improvement on its materials.</li>
            <li> Blades work very well.</li>
            <li> The order arrived on time and correctly. The replacement heads are exactly the same as the original. Very good fullfilment.</li>
            <li> Works fine, same as the original that came with the shaver.</li>
            <li> Newer is not always better.  Bought these replacement blades in the hopes that it would not take quite as much time and effort to shave my neck and face.  I like the Norelco triple header razor, it&#x27;s easy to shave around the contours of my beard.  Been using one for 30 years (give or take).  I&#x27;d been using the same blades for probably 5 years, decided it was time to buy new ones.  Relatively simple to replace, started shaving.  Long story short, it took just as long and with just as much effort to shave as it did with my 5 year old blades.  I was expecting an improvement, I got none.  The new blades didn&#x27;t cut any better than the old ones.  What a waste.</li>
            <li> Thanx, arrived expediently my beard enjoys the comfort of a sharp electric blade...that&#x27;s all, its&#x27; a freak &#x27;in electric blade....the demands for more described happiness is BS in my review .</li>
            <li> Great product. Make it feel like my razor is brand new.</li>
            <li> They work perfect for my shaver.</li>
            <li> For some reason this particular set of heads is nearly impossible to fit evenly in my shaver; one head is always off kilter.</li>
            <li> Makes the shaver like new</li>
            <li> The blades are good but it&#x27;s difficult to insert</li>
            <li> I had previously thought that this didn&#x27;t arrive, but I was mistaken. I still like my old Norelco shaver, and it&#x27;s great to have options for new blades. Thanks, mochi3000, sorry for the misunderstanding.</li>
            <li> I used the old blades during a tour of duty in Afghanistan, starting getting dull after two years of daily use. I will replace these once a year going forward, as I have thinner hair than some.</li>
            <li> Not as good as a cut I was hoping for from a brand new blade. Has less blades on each head than the original head.</li>
            <li> easy to install, I love thny othere razor and like another sharp they need to be replaced...</li>
            <li> Fair price for a great product. Why buy a new razor (or become red-faced with irritated skin) when an easy swap is all you need!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to do - just like new!</li>
            <li> The quality seems equal to any other Norelco replacement heads that I have ever&lt;br /&gt;replaced.  The price is reasonable.  I can&#x27;t think of any issues or negatives, so I&lt;br /&gt;would recommend these replacements without any reservations.</li>
            <li> When the need comes up for backing up the right part for the right jpb there is no doubt that this is the right part when I will need to replace it.</li>
            <li> It seems fake replica with very cheap packing !!!</li>
            <li> They work a lot better than the year old (worn) ones. I would change more often but the price is pretty high.</li>
            <li> Seem to work well enough.</li>
            <li> I am always amazed at how much better I do with new heads!  Seriously it is a treat to shave with sharp blades.  I am going to treat myself every 6 months</li>
            <li> This product was shipped well and works well.  It is the same Norelco quality you learn to expect when that is your product of choice.  No complaints and no regrets.</li>
            <li> A little difficult to postion but works great once you get it installed</li>
            <li> Arrived exactly as advertised. Works as it&#x27;s supposed to, my husband has no complaints with it. I will but again.</li>
            <li> These were a gift for my Husband to go with the razor that I bought him at the same time.  They will be used I am sure and he loves his razor as well.</li>
            <li> I thought we whould have to purchase a new electric razor because it was getting old, but this replacment head was easly to install and he loves it!</li>
            <li> Bought as gift. Loves the razor so this is a must! And great price at the time of purchase....! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Each year when I replace the used heads I am surprised by the difference new heads can make: smooth, close shaves!</li>
            <li> I have looked for these blades and usually cheaper to buy a new razor. Now I get my good razor back with all the bells. These blades are the best price online</li>
            <li> Bought it at a relatively cheap price and I like it. It is easy to assemble and change. I actually have it for another Philips shaver that is not on the list, and it works fine.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000068PBT Philips Norelco HQ8 Spectra Tripleheader Replacement Heads]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great...  So far so good...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But - This is the designated replacement head for my Norelco 7310XL but the screen is different from the one that came with the razor. Not a perfectly round shape. The new screens do fit perfectly into their own place despite the difference.&lt;br /&gt;The blades are different too. The original disc had 14 or 15 blades and the new one has 9. Is this just saving pennies? Will it affect the quality of shave?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A notice on the box would have been helpful. It would have been nice to know these differences...</li>
            <li> I have no independent knowledge of the efficacy of this product, although these are the Norelco brand replacement, my husband says they don&#x27;t give as close a shave as the original contained in the razor when purchased.</li>
            <li> Got them in a timely matter and for the price gotta love it need new replacement heads got them in a day</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Installed&amp;#34; is the word for the fussy placement requirements these heads require.  NOTE: this is just 3 new blades and 3 heads, not the entire top unit like the picture suggests.</li>
            <li> I was looking to buy husband a new razor and then found out we should have been replacing the heads every 6 months or so.  Glad I found these!!</li>
            <li> The best blades on the market,with no pulling,or binding,in use. Would highly recommend,these replacement blades,as in time,they will dull. Very easy cleaning and a must buy if you have the razor or buy the razor and need another gift too add,this should be it.</li>
            <li> Heads are great replacement and cheaper than replacing the whole shaver.  Work very well.  Although I bought a newer shaver, I still use this shaver as well.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice replacement head from Philips. The product description is accurate enough and It is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Being a bit cheap, I was running my razor too long with the old razor heads. Got the replacement, and it is almost like having a brand new razor!q</li>
            <li> An  economically priced product for keeping your Norelco in tip top shape. Better than  buying a new razor. Eaay to install.</li>
            <li> 2 packs from the 3 were squashed and looks like old packs. the 3rd pack was ok.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m not sure about the quality of the product itself, if this pack is like this.&lt;br /&gt;im not sure i will continue to buy it here in the future.&lt;br /&gt;thanks&lt;br /&gt;Meir</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know that replacing shaver heads would make such a difference. My husbands is so happy to have that close shave again.  Two thumbs up for this product.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 19 year old grandson for Christmas. He said that it gives a very close shave and he loves it. He even used it for shaving his chest and stomach.</li>
            <li> As you would expect these return the shaving performance to new condition. Glad I bought them. Here several months later I don&#x27;t see any sign of wear different from the originals heads.</li>
            <li> I previously bought another brand (although, I didn&#x27;t know it at the time since the item said it was for Norelco).  I stretched a little over 2 years out of them until a small metal piece broke out of the heads due to wear.  It had the long slots all the way around the head.  These ones have round circles on part of the head so they take a little longer to shave long hair off.  My old set would shave faster, but maybe not as close?  I&#x27;m thinking this because my 5 o&#x27;clock shadow hair isn&#x27;t as long as it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set took a few days before they started to shave better (and possibly a little faster, unless I&#x27;m imagining that since my facial hair isn&#x27;t as long now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These heads can only fit in one direction and my old ones could be put in 3 different possible directions since they didn&#x27;t have a distinct slot to force them in one direction only.  I suppose the reason for the slots is so the circles can be towards the center of the head.</li>
            <li> That was the product I expected.</li>
            <li> A very Google product nice to have a clean shave again in seconds</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. It is exactly like the original that came with the razor. Nothing much else needs to be said.</li>
            <li> I shave about 3-5 times a week.  In 12 months, it feels like it&#x27;s time to replace the heads.  After getting them from Amazon the razor cuts much better.</li>
            <li> So nice to have a close shave again!  My razor is only two years old but the original blades just weren&#x27;t doing the job.  These work great!</li>
            <li> This picture totally mis-represents what I received. there are no instructions with the merchandise, the replacement  heads are useless, without instructions or as received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wallace Berrie</li>
            <li> I got this set of replacement shaving / cutting heads recently, for my Phillips AquaTouch AT890 razor.  The razor gives a nice shave, and it includes a &amp;#34;replacement indicator&amp;#34; which lights up when the cutting heads need to be replaced.  Although the packaging says that the blades should be replace once a year the indicator only lit up after about 18 months, so I got extended use out of them.  The blades are relatively easy to replace.  I found the instructions on the package to be less clear than they could have been, but it didn&#x27;t take long to figure out - an assembly that holds the blades needs to be removed from the razor; small locking screws that hold the blades in place need to be removed; then the blades themselves need to be removed from the assembly.  The new blades need to be inserted into the assembly; new locking screws installed; and then the assembly placed back into the razor.  The replacement only needs to take a couple of minutes once you figure it out.  Shaving / cutting blades do need to be replaced, and Phillips has developed a relatively easy and effective replacement routine.</li>
            <li> My Norelco is over a year old these replacement heads gave it a new go , shaves like new again for a decent price</li>
            <li> Not much to say, it is a replacement part.  Does what is expected.  Seems like they changed them from the original.</li>
            <li> Changed out the heads in lieu of buying a new razor and WOWSAH! What a DIFFERENCE. Easy to clip on install. Nice price here on Amazon. What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> Good price, works good, and good quality, and can&#x27;t  always find in a store</li>
            <li> I toyed with just buying another razor when I saw the price for replacement heads at the store.  But this seller had a nice price.  It makes the razor feel like new again.  Smooth and close shave.  A+</li>
            <li> Have had Norelco shaver for a few years and this is 3rd or so new heads. Heads are fine. I think the razor may be slowing down some making it a less than perfect shave.</li>
            <li> These heads were just the right thing for my Norelco shaver.  They are easy to install, and the package had good instructions. Shaving goes much better with these in place (the other ones had been in use over a year).</li>
            <li> Very good replacement shaver heads.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads made razor like new again.</li>
            <li> It was just what I wanted</li>
            <li> Great product.  I usually just buy a new razor vs investing in new blade.  Thought I would give this a try.  They work great and Much easier to install than I expected.</li>
            <li> Norelco encourages its customers to replaces parts often and they are very expensive. I recently purchased the blades and the holder and they costed almost half of the total cost for the shaver. Unless you like how the shaver works, I would buy another brand.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads fit perfectly in my razor.  It is amazing how much better the razor cuts and feels!  My old heads were about 2 years old.</li>
            <li> Switching the old cutters to a set of new ones made my shaver work like a new one.  It is now faster and the shave is closer.</li>
            <li> I am glad I purchased my replacement heads for my shaver that is about one year old and yes it was time to make a change. It did make a difference in the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly with  my electric razor.</li>
            <li> Easy and worked as described. easy to swap in and out and seems to cut better than my 5 year old razor set.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the product, which I purchased as a replacement for my younger brother.</li>
            <li> I give this product a very low rating.  As far as I can see these heads are not much sharper than the ones I had been using for  the pastyear.</li>
            <li> I ordered a new Norelco replacement triple head. In my previous orders I received the item in a factory blister package with the package imprinted at the manufacturer with the model number and the name. This time I received the heads on a blank cardboard in a shrink wrap, no imprint of any kind. It appears to be either a reconditioned triple head, NOT WHAT I ORDERED.  I am truly disappointed with AMAZON. I will not order from you again.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t replaced the blades in my razor for a long time and I couldn&#x27;t believe the huge difference these made. It&#x27;s only been half a year since I&#x27;ve switched them now, but they&#x27;re still going just as strong as the day I got them. Definitely intend to purchase these again, but judging by their performance, that won&#x27;t be soon.</li>
            <li> This was a great buy , less money than discount department stores. Extreme difference for the better in my razor. I thought my razor was cutting good and I was just in a hurry until I put in these new cutting heads. Guess I was wrong, these cutting heads are all the difference. Smooth shave in only a couple passes. Highly recommended and the shipping was quick with free super saver shipping from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> The heads fit perfectly and I got a very clean close shave this morning.  BUT, I was a bit mislead by the posted advertisement for this item on Amazon.  It says &amp;#34;3 replacement heads for Norelco&amp;#34; and the photo displayed shows the shaver head assembly with 3 heads inside.  Thus I thought I would receive 3 shaver head assemblies.  Instead, I received 3 individual shaver heads which replace the 3 in the shaver head assembly.  Although disappointed, I still felt it was a fair price.</li>
            <li> This Is The Third Time I Have Ordered This Product. Excellent. Will Purchase Again.</li>
            <li> Fit my Norelco shaver, even though the ones that came with the machine are not these.  They were a bit hard to put in, but in the end fit fine.  Not sure about durability and long term performance at this point, but having other Norelco shavers, I&#x27;d expect this product to perform well.  It is an original Norelco product.</li>
            <li> EASY TO INSTALL-- WORKS GREAT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my razor for years and have bought many replacements and these are the worst ones yet. I have bought another set but by accident ordered the wrong ones (HQ9). The HQ9 fit my razor (7140XL) even though it&#x27;s not listed for it but they work far better then the originals</li>
            <li> I replaced the shaver head after over 2 years of using the same one despite it seemingly shaving the same as ever. The new head gives a much close shave with fewer passes. I definitely recommend replacing yours if it is over a year old.</li>
            <li> Need to replace these shaveing heads so you can get a smooth and close shave. By replacing the heads. I don&#x27;t have to replace the shaver.</li>
            <li> I purchased the wrong replacements heads.  They did not fit my shaver.  I place some degree of responsibility for this misunderstanding on the manufacturer and, perhaps on Amazon.  Why are there so many different varieties of replacement heads?  And, perhaps more importantly, why is there no sincere effort made to effectively describe and differentiate between the available options?  Norelco can do a better job of servicing their present customers.  They may have little motivation to assist their current customers if they earn more profit from sales of new shavers than they earn from sales of replacement heads.</li>
            <li> This is the third set of heads for this Philip Norelco and it just keeps on keeping on. He may never have to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> Good product, works well.</li>
            <li> Restores my Norelco to factory condition.  Well worth the price.  There is really nothing else to say, it simply works very well.</li>
            <li> The new HQ8 replacement blades seem to work well.</li>
            <li> A clean shave! Old heads were worn out.</li>
            <li> This is the exact replacement blade set for my razor.</li>
            <li> Love it! Great price!</li>
            <li> just what was needed and was what expected.</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace the blades that came with my razor when it was new. They are not as sharp as the blades that came with my razor when it was new.</li>
            <li> They work great! Easy to change and seem to give even a better shave than the previous models that i have tried....</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my husband, since Wal-mart and Walgreens said they no longer stock these replacement heads for electric razors.  They were exactly what he needed and will last him at least a year or more.</li>
            <li> Completely met expectations</li>
            <li> Proper fit and working well.  Shipping on the item a bit high for what was provided.  The padded envelope did not prevent crushing, distortion of the box which contained the cutters.  If it had not been for the manufacturer encasing the cutters in hard plastic, they definitely would have been damaged.</li>
            <li> Nothing new wrt my old shaving head. It does the job.</li>
            <li> Pefect replacement for my electric razor that I had for years. Does not give me irritation in sensitive neck skin.</li>
            <li> Exact fit, which is what you want in a replacement.</li>
            <li> Great product and a fantastic price!</li>
            <li> Not the perfit but they will work</li>
            <li> Shaves better than prior replacement. Believe screens have been improved.</li>
            <li> My husband enjoyed his shaves with the new blades.</li>
            <li> Great price for these replacement blades.  I waited to replace them for years because I could buy a whole new razor for the normal shelf price.  Product was new and in original packaging as advertised.</li>
            <li> shaving heads cut great and were an exact fit</li>
            <li> Replacement shaver heads arrived on time.  They were a little tricky to install because my fingers are pretty old and worn out.  Once installed they worked fine.  I really cannot say that I could tell the difference though.  I think I will try some of those blade sharpeners they sell for them.</li>
            <li> Found the blades to be a welcome change. It is early yet, but blades are providing a nice shave&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> My new Philips Norelco HQ8 is working great.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You,  Marcus A. Lanthier</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as advertised.</li>
            <li> same razor for years. This Replacement has made old razor young again</li>
            <li> just what I needed. Fast easy transaction..makes me a satisfied customer</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I have used these blades for yearly replacements and they have kept my razor working great.  I get a good close shave every day.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working fine.</li>
            <li> Good quality and price, very fast delivery! Thaks</li>
            <li> very good, wish for a sharper type for harsher bristles</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how dull the old ones were till I put these new ones in.  Very easy to change.  Plus with the Prime membership you get free 2 day shipping.  Its cheaper than going to the store and a lot easier.</li>
            <li> needs better instructions for first time user</li>
            <li> Made my razor like new.  Be sure to replace blades yearly like the instructions say.</li>
            <li> they work, they are decent price, they fit the razor . i will re-buy them but hate leaving a comment on a razor replacement</li>
            <li> I have had my AT880 for one year. I was going to replace the HQ8 heads but before doing so I decided to clean the heads. Remember to keep the cutters and covers as  matched pairs. I cleaned out each part where the hair had gotten caught and created drag on the blades. Also cleaned around the cover. The razor now cuts almost like new. I may hold off replacing the heads. Soap and water plus a toothbrush cleaned everything.  In order to keep the matched heads, I marked each set with dots, 1,2,or 3. When cleaning , the heads sometime fall into the sink and would be impossible to match without my markings.</li>
            <li> Wow what a difference! I should have bought this six months ago. My face says thanks every day. I think I will order a set for my razor  downstate.</li>
            <li> Good replacement! Fits perfectly!</li>
            <li> I was getting a bad shave for years before realizing that my Norelco blades were too dull.  The new blades have enabled me to get a smooth shave in a fraction of the time it used to take for a so-so result.</li>
            <li> Very good.  Makes the razor perform like new again.</li>
            <li> Not shaving any closer than old one. Think i have a lemon Norelco razor. Expected better.&lt;br /&gt;Not fault of blades, but razor</li>
            <li> Replacement blades for an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is extremely improved with the replacement blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They need to be replaced about once a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the best price I could find.</li>
            <li> It works well, as advertised.  The blades give a fairly close shave, but still some razor burn.  It performs well for the price.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly and brought my old razor back to life.  Works just like new.  I now use it as a travel razor.</li>
            <li> This product work very well. I will continue to order as needed. I will recommend to anyone needing a razer head for electric razor.</li>
            <li> Replacing these heads was very simple, very easy, and the key to a much better, smoother shave.  No need to buy a new razor!</li>
            <li> It was very easy to change the old heads to these and they leave my boyfriend&#x27;s skin as smooth as when he first got the razor.</li>
            <li> Be aware that there is a kind of a pointy nib (at least on the ones I purchased here for my husband&#x27;s razor). He originally thought they were the wrong model blades/cutters when he got them.  But the Amazon page gave his Razor&#x27;s model number as one of the models these blades would fit in.  But his original blades did not have this nib.  What you have to do is find the slot inside that this nib will fit into.  Don&#x27;t give up.  I almost did but located it and they fit and work fine.</li>
            <li> I had my Norelco for over a year and needed replacement head or a new electric razor.  well, guess what, these are much cheaper than getting a new razor!  Works great.</li>
            <li> I try to replace my Norelco heads annually, and I always buy genuine Norelco-brand when I do.&lt;br /&gt;These replacement heads (blades and combs) make my older Norelco razor work like new.</li>
            <li> It is as rated a great shaver. Worth the money. The shaver heads fit as described. There is no other words required.</li>
            <li> Shaver 7310 original blades were starting to leave stubs behind and with these replacement heads, shaver is as new!  Easy to replace.</li>
            <li> These replacement blades for my Phillips Norelco works great. I will always purchase from Amazon when the time comes for another set of replacements blades. Comes complete with the whole head.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied. I love my razor, now I can keep it and not replace it with something else</li>
            <li> I should have bought these sooner.  New Blades&#x3D; New razor.</li>
            <li> I forgot I needed to replace heads every year, mine were over 6 years old. Now, back to a clean shave again.</li>
            <li> The product showed up in new condition and timely.  It was slick to use Discover card points to pay directly and not come up with $$ out of pocket.</li>
            <li> The blades I recently received do not provide as close of a shave as compared to this same product which I purchased two years ago.  My opinion is something has changed with this product and it no longer provides as close of a shave as in the past.</li>
            <li> Not sure what to think about these. They fit and work (as in they shave a person), but they don&#x27;t seem to last as long as the blades of the same make and model which I buy at brick and mortar stores???</li>
            <li> I love them!  Best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. They get the job done. Great for both wet and dry shaves.</li>
            <li> After 3 yrs just replaced the blades, so the shaver is like brand new. Have done this at 3 year intervals with no problems. Why buy a new razor? Have used Norelco for 25 yrs with no complaints.</li>
            <li> Replacinf this heads are not an easy tasks. All parts are loose so you have to be very careful with removing the old heads and placing the new ones. At this time I am not a 100% sure I set the heads up properly. However I am still able to shave but it is my perception that it takes me a little longer to do it. Perhaps I should check Youtube for a video on how to replace the heads.</li>
            <li> frustrated by the experience. It all fell apart when trying to replace them. Parts flying everywhere. Still don&#x27;t have use of the razor.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads come as three unmounted cutter assemblies, rather than as a single assembled head as shown in the description.  Replacement was not difficult, providing you can see and understand the micro sized instruction drawings on the package.  No other guidance is provided.  It took some playing around to get the three loose subassemblies in posiition, then replace the holder (spider), assuring the three points of engagement are made.  A separate, larger instruction sheet would have been useful.  Shaver works fine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much to say on this product, as it is OEM and a must buy for whom using a razor. Frankly all of the business models of razor is the same as a printer: machine is cheap but profit from parts. The razor was bought at $40 and this blades are $30 or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course I am glad Amazon offers a choice of both cheaper and more convenient than a trip to Warmart.</li>
            <li> Rather than run all over town ordered new replacement heads for my 7 year old Norelco. Just what I needed without having to drive all over the place. Package came in 4 days . Just what I ordered .</li>
            <li> I found out that these heads work better on my beard and do not snag like the ones with the inner blades and holes.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old blades and they work great.  I generally replace my blades at least once a year. Great price here on Amazon too.</li>
            <li> The original razor lasted about a year.  I purchased a replacement head at the same time.  I alternate between flexible throw away razors and my electric.  I replaced the original heads after about 12 months and the new ones lasted 2 months.  I did not alternate my usage.  I wanted to see how long they would last.  I am retired and don&#x27;t shave every day.  I have found the Norelco heads in general are not worth the money.  I will not purchase any more.  Done with electric or will try remington again.</li>
            <li> This is only my fourth Norelco because they last so long.  They are quite reliable.  I replace the heads probably once a year but if you watch, sometimes is it less expensive to just buy a new razor.</li>
            <li> We thought it would fit the old razor, but it did not.&lt;br /&gt;There should be a better explanation of the sizing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually been years since I last replaced the blades in my razor so as you might guess it made a major difference when I replaced them.  I have found electric razors work well on one or two days of hair growth but after that you are more pulling out the hairs than cutting them and you always seem to miss a couple.  After three days of not shaving I usually go for the old razor and shave gel.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly as I expected. I  have purchased these razor blade replacements in stores in the past and the product was the same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my razor a little over a year now. Where it&#x27;s been starting to give me a little razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, these replacement heads make it feel like new.</li>
            <li> They just do not make these things to last very long compared to the expense of the purchase.  The shaver itself is nearly a throw-away.</li>
            <li> they are just exactly what fits with the norelco I have and they are much cheaper through amazon.  Work and fit really well</li>
            <li> I have used this product, or its predecessor for many years.  I prefer using Norelco shavers...since I have been shaving for about 60 years, my experience tells me this is the best product for me.  It would be nice if parts didn&#x27;t wear out, but, unfortunately, they do.  So, I feel it&#x27;s a relatively small price to pay to basically have a new shaver every year.</li>
            <li> THE REPLACEMENT HEADS I ORDERED CAME VERY QUICK AND MADE MY SHAVER WORK LIKE NEW AGAIN. I ALWAYS CHECK AMAZON.COM FIRST AND THEIR PRICE IS VERY COMPETITIVE AND SHIPPING IS FAST AND ALMOST ALWAYS FREE. THANK-YOU AMAZON.COM</li>
            <li> This was just what I was loooking for. Thanks for the great business and fast shipment. Loving the new razor heads.</li>
            <li> This is the proper replacement blades for my shaver.  I needed to be able to keep a sharp shet of blades available for my razor and this will allow me to do so.</li>
            <li> Arrived ahead of schedule.  Makes my old razor cut like it did when new.  Will order again when I need a new set of blades.</li>
            <li> It has been an easy and pleasant experience viewing and ordering this item.  [[ASIN:B000068PBT Philips Norelco HQ8  Spectra Tripleheader Replacement Heads]]</li>
            <li> Ordered these replacement heads from Amazon.  Received the order within a few days of order placement  Excellent product, works fine.  Would reorder from this site again.</li>
            <li> Works great as replacement.  Not sure what else to say. It was great to replace my dull blades.  Will buy these again next time.</li>
            <li> These added life to my Norelco -- good product -- highly recommended -- easy to remove the old heads and snap in the new heads (although directions could have been easier to read).</li>
            <li> I accidentally dropped my razor and damaged one of the cutter heads.  I was overdue to replace them anyway.&lt;br /&gt;These replacement heads dropped right in and cut as good as new.</li>
            <li> Happy wife Happy Life... she loves it thus mission accomplished ;)&lt;br /&gt;get it and get&#x27; r DONE</li>
            <li> Poor quality. Only includes blades.</li>
            <li> Made my shaver into a new one again! This comes in the box, not like the white box one I bought a year ago also from Amazon that never gave me very good shave. This one is great!</li>
            <li> Work great.  Drop in replacement heads for my Norelco razor.</li>
            <li> Super sharp and gives me a very nice close shave</li>
            <li> Great replacement blades, lasted me a good 2 years before I needed to change it again.</li>
            <li> Good product, easy install, delivery on time.  Will use again.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and no excuses for stubble now!</li>
            <li> These are authentic Norelco heads and they are a perfect fit and work very well.&lt;br /&gt;New heads give a really nice shave and these are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Nice replacement head.</li>
            <li> The package arrived in time for my dad&#x27;s birthday present, which made us both very happy!</li>
            <li> Works like new. 100% recommended.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Brought new life to razor</li>
            <li> These blades do not cut as well as the original.</li>
            <li> original heads lasted over a year, and I shave everyday</li>
            <li> Came just as described.</li>
            <li> Great Deal on Amazon on these heads! First electrical razor that my husband could use. One set lasted him about a year. Saying that, he grows his beard out in the Maine winter but still shaves towards his neck area.</li>
            <li> I only got blades, picture shows the hole head.</li>
            <li> It worked, still working</li>
            <li> Replacement heads don&#x27;t seem to  work very well. I bought the set of two and the first set so far has only lasted a couple of months. I suppose I will have to  put the second set in and see whether I have an anomaly, but I fear it is not. I will straighten it out in the near future.  Just dropped one star off because I received the  Panasonic replacement heads and they simply give a smoother, closer quicker shave after the 15 years I have owned this machine (.vs the 10 years of ownership for the Norelco). I only picked it up again (the Panasonic, that is) after retiring it when the Norelco floating heads first came to me. But now, I am afraid the Norelco has gone dull again and I am using the Panasonic exclusively. I would normally ask for a refund on the N.  heads and I KNOW AMAZON would grant it, but for the first time ever I think I will allow convenience to override economics (mainly because I have a disability and it would be a hardship at this point, although  minor, to send them back).</li>
            <li> What can I say. They do the job at very near the cost of a whole new razor. However, it does mean I don&#x27;t have to throw the whole razor away creating even more waste.</li>
            <li> The replacement blades lasted only about two weeks before they were as dull as the original blades. By comparison, the originals lasted for months.</li>
            <li> I got it  fast  and is original Norelco. The price was right</li>
            <li> Theses new heads makes my razor feel like brand new.  I really need to get another set for my other one.</li>
            <li> Returned -- not the right model.</li>
            <li> Great product. It works perfect as expected</li>
            <li> wonderful. No problem. easy</li>
            <li> Good new heads. Cheaper than buying direct. Fit my shaver perfectly</li>
            <li> good enough to get a close shave everyday for well for a year</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT WOULD BUY AGAIN</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and he is so happy to have a new head for his razor.</li>
            <li> great price, shipping time minimal!</li>
            <li> Husband loves his shaver! He uses it every day. His face is so smooth!!</li>
            <li> Works great. Price was $8 less than other stores.</li>
            <li> REPLACE HEADS EVERY YEAR FOR LAST THREE YEARS AND FIND THEY ARE GREAT FOR EVERY DAY SHAVING</li>
            <li> My original blade lasted me years, but I feel like these new ones are dulling after only a few months... I&#x27;m not too impressed with this product for that reason. I&#x27;m glad I got these on sale, but next time I&#x27;m going for the slightly more expensive replacements with the extra blade rings (which is what came with my razor originally.)</li>
            <li> Good price and my shaves got much better.</li>
            <li> Expensive IMO but they work fine</li>
            <li> Replacement fit the razor fine, but don&#x27;t seem as good as the original heads in my opinion.  They will do for now.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads &amp;#34;chatter&amp;#34; when pressed firmly against your cheek.  The box shows the correct number,  but  evidently the blades do not fit firmly enough like the original ones, making the razor impossible to use.</li>
            <li> New Norelco cutters fit my 10 year old Norelco shaver just as well as the previous set.  The shave quality was markedly improved.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads have bought my electric razor back giving great shaves. They were very easy to install in the razor head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my shaver for 10 years and have only replaced these heads twice. Then again I don&#x27;t have a thick beard at all. These aren&#x27;t as advanced as some new shavers because it only has 1 outer ring of holes. Some are triple action now!</li>
            <li> Who thought that changing the blades could make the razor function like brand new! I laughed when my neighbor told me he HAD to get a new razor for $100.00...</li>
            <li> Iv&#x27;e been using them for a more than 5  years with the 8883XL Norelco dry shaver , they work well .&lt;br /&gt;just tried them once with the AT810 Philips shaver - and was pretty much disappointed&lt;br /&gt;even though a bit expesive (after you buy 2-3 heads it adds up to a new shavers price) I still like to use them .&lt;br /&gt;too bad they stoped selling the 8883XL shaver</li>
            <li> This was simple to install and it works much better.  I will replace annually as suggested.  The cover to the machine unfortunately does not stay on an the heads rub against things and that could short change the customer.</li>
            <li> The new heads work very well and were easy to install.  The shave is now much shorter as the old ones were dull.  The only comlaint would be the price almost price of new shaver if ordered from Phillps.</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised.</li>
            <li> Makes the older razor work like a dream!</li>
            <li> They even shave my wife&#x27;s legs they are so good :-)</li>
            <li> Wow, what a difference a new set of blades make. I was ready to toss my  10 year old Norelco and buy a new one. But a new set of blades made all the difference. It is like getting a new razor. Best advise get new blades at least once a year.</li>
            <li> The blades were easy to replace and, so far, have produced an, acceptable, shave. I only hope that they continue to do so longer than the ooriginal ones which, I feel, dulled prematurly.</li>
            <li> back to a nice clean shave after the new heads were installed.</li>
            <li> My razor is back in business. Good quality heads made my old razor just like new at only a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I have bought these before and they work very well in my cordless razor. They last a good long time for me too.</li>
            <li> So far the heads have worked good. Very easy to install. Have not had long enough to say how sharp the blades last.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. This is the second time I have ordered this item. It lasted for one year as I expected.</li>
            <li> THIS IS PERFECT REPLACEMENT, IT IS JUST WHAT ANYBODY NEEDS WHEN THE HEADS BECOME OLD....THIS ARE THE RIGHT HEADS FOR THE RAZOR...</li>
            <li> the shaver works well once again after putting the new blades in.  A little hard to put in or would have given 5 stars....</li>
            <li> Get them now while you can. I had an older Phillips Norelco model (discontinues about three years ago) that worked great for years.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, after discontinued, replacement blades increase in price greatly. $20 replacements cost over $80&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, these are excellent blades.</li>
            <li> The product image is misleading.  While the image clearly shows blades and the plastic head holder, the shipped products includes only the blades - no holder.  A big disappointment.</li>
            <li> it was good it meet all my exspection pit allthat good i love them thank you i was nice doing bussness with u</li>
            <li> As usual Norelco provides the best electric shaver experience. East to attach and work well. I will continue my annual subscription on this product</li>
            <li> Best electric shave heads... period.  I&#x27;ve tried others and these are the only ones that don&#x27;t irritate my skin and they last a long time too even with daily use.</li>
            <li> the heads fit and I do feel a difference.  These were pretty cheap...usually, I find the entire razor for less than the replacement blades.</li>
            <li> Right price works great easy to put together in your razor it is good</li>
            <li> perfect fit, nice shave again</li>
            <li> Fitted well blades sharp, Woking so far need 6 maths to see how well they last</li>
            <li> While alright for everyday use it still is not as good as a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; razor shave.  However, it does the job.</li>
            <li> Excelente producto, recomendados para pieles sensibles, rasura perfecto.</li>
            <li> They show entire snap in triple razor head in picture but all you get is three new single cutting heads. You have to dissemble cutting heads and re-install into your existing cover.</li>
            <li> Great price on an item that is hard to find in stores.  Fits perfectly and has enabled us to not have to buy a new razor.</li>
            <li> excellent value easy to install</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, perfect fit, works great. Replace heads once a year to keep a close shave!  What else can you say!?</li>
            <li> They work  well but they cost too much (about half the price I originally paid for the razor).</li>
            <li> another 5years before buy another set ok! great product well worth the wait delivery right on time packed perfect ready to use</li>
            <li> Amazing how much better these work than even the original heads did. Maybe not needed every year, but worth it even at the {high} price.</li>
            <li> Good product.Performed as advertised and ease of use. Delivered on time as promised.</li>
            <li> The heads work perfectly and have improved my shaves a lot. I waited two years before replacing my heads this time, but i won&#x27;t do that again.</li>
            <li> Blades work better than it was, installed these after 3 years, works good, but not as sharp as when razor was new, must be using different materials maybe Chinese ?</li>
            <li> My Norelco works like brand new with these replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and working just fine.</li>
            <li> Items as described, smooth transaction.</li>
            <li> Item worked out just fine.</li>
            <li> Great replacement pack.  So very cheap in price!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Works like OEM for 1/3 price!</li>
            <li> Works ok...a real razor is better</li>
            <li> Work great but don&#x27;t last forever. I have a tough beard and replace them every 2 - 3 months.</li>
            <li> Been using this model of blades for 2 years and have had multiple replacements for my shaver. Love them. Always great quality and easy to install. Great precision trims.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this shaver for years but it has become more difficult to find the replacement heads.  This was perfect - exactly what he needed and he really appreciated the quick delivery.  It arrived ok in spite of the post office&#x27;s attempt to smash it.....</li>
            <li> The blades give me a good shave.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s shaver is several years old but an expensive model.  So we decided to replace the heads instead of buying new shaver.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I got the product on time, it was the product i was expecting , nice, original, very cheap...i am happy with it...i definitively would recomend to buy @ AMAZON....    alvaro  Acworth,Georgia (USA )</li>
            <li> It got to me quickly and they work well.</li>
            <li> Good product. Allows me to keep so-called James Bond razor longer. But who produces similar 100+ minute capacity razor today?</li>
            <li> Use care to select the correct cutting head model and you can return the old razer to a like-new function.  AMAZON offers good price and delivery for Norelco razor heads.</li>
            <li> The new heads suck compared to the heads that were sent with the razor. They don&#x27;t get nearly as close because they are a different style. It&#x27;s also a lot of money to pay for one change-out of the heads. I am very unhappy with the purchase and haven&#x27;t used that razor in a month - I have went back to the Schick Quatro.</li>
            <li> Order was received in allotted time. Heads appear to be new, but am having trouble getting one to &#x27;set&#x27; in.  Don&#x27;t know who or what is to blame....could be me.</li>
            <li> The heads were very easy to replace.  I searched with Google to find exact how-to directions.  That worked very well.  I was surprised.  My husband&#x27;s shaver works like new now.  He thought he needed a new one before I changed the heads for him.  I later read that the heads should be changed every year, not every 10 years.</li>
            <li> A perfect fit, made my Norelco shaver feel like new. Takes only a few seconds to install</li>
            <li> This was cheaper than I could find in stores, so I opted to order from Amazon. Installation was easy, and I was back up and shaving in no time.</li>
            <li> better than buying a new shaver</li>
            <li> Work well and fit perfectly. Not too difficult to install. However, compare price to new shaver, not a lot of difference.</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly and are &#x27;sharp blades&#x27;....</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t cut as closel as orginal</li>
            <li> Needed some new razor heads and these delivered. I love Norelco. My only complaints are that they took a little effort to swap and the package was quite beat up when I received them. Product works great though and is delivering day after day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a excellent product and it was on time. I recommend it a lot</li>
            <li> The same great Norelco heads I&#x27;ve been using for the past ten years! Its great to have a clean shave every day!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as advertised.</li>
            <li> What can you say about a perfect product......</li>
            <li> My Norelco model has an internal system to let you know when to clean it, recharge it, or replace the heads based on actual usage.  Very civilized.  These replacements are very easy to install and do a fine job of restoring a close shave.  The blades and heads are matched sets and the blades are razor sharp (duh), so you need to be cautious not to let the head sets come apart, including when you open the packaging.  Each goes in only one way, so take note of where the flat spot on the side of each head is oriented as you remove each old head and match it as you put in the new.  I removed the heads and replaced each before moving to the next position, just to make that orientation easier.  This is much easier if you remove the entire head assembly from the body of the shaver first.</li>
            <li> Fitted my husbands needs perfectly.</li>
            <li> Changed the shaver blades in my Norelco Shaver but didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in the shave.  Not sure if it was necessary.</li>
            <li> Fit my husband&#x27;s razor perfectly!  He&#x27;s now back to that close shave that is out of style but still his favorite!</li>
            <li> Be careful to buying this item, and make sure it is what you are really looking for. This is not Replacement Heads ( what is suggest picture on it ) , but only some parts of the head and in my opinion better to buy new whole razor.</li>
            <li> My husband was very pleased with the new razor heads. Great price compared to the price at the local box stores or pharmacy chains. Will definitely order these again when needed.</li>
            <li> This was for my husband.  He has the Norelco and has had it for many years.  This is the second replacement head.  We order on every 2 years or so.  It&#x27;s like a new shaver again.  They got here so quickly too.</li>
            <li> The difference a new set of heads will do. Back to getting a nice close shave. I will not wait so long to change them next time.</li>
            <li> Finally, after 5 years (!), I replaced the original heads of my Norelco 7810 shaver! It&#x27;s like having a new shaver. This is original manufacturer Philips product. Avoid the &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; cutters. Who knows how well they will stand up? Plus they are no cheaper than these.</li>
            <li> Razor heads work great</li>
            <li> Philips replacement heads continue the shaves of the past before the blades get dull. Much  faster and closer shave. Really enjoy being able to wash the head with warm water when they are dirty</li>
            <li> The above item was a replacement head for my razor it was a easy off with the old one and easy on with the new. Head work&#x27;s just as the old one did.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for my &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; head. The old one was about 5 yrs old. I am pretty sure I got a better shave from the old one than I have this one. Fortunately, it fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase. They work great.</li>
            <li> My husband says he doesn&#x27;t see any difference from the old heads to the new. The company says to replace them yearly and this is the first time he has done so. He&#x27;s had  Norelco shavers in the past too and never replaced the heads so he thought maybe he had better do that. He&#x27;s not happy with the results.</li>
            <li> My older shaver works like new again. These are original Philips and not aftermarket. Great fit and good shave</li>
            <li> Great improvement and shaver works like a champ now</li>
            <li> got them quickly but the don&#x27;t fit.  Don&#x27;t know how to send them back.</li>
            <li> Cuts great but changing out the old ones is a tedious task.</li>
            <li> worked for me!  Still using them</li>
            <li> The actual process of changing the heads was easier than I expected.  I am not especially mechanical and wondered at first why I could not buy the entire head assembly and just pop it on.  There was a video of the head change I watched about 4 times.  You twist the clover leaf looking thing and lift the assembly that includes the three little rings that holds the heads on.  Then you can dump out the heads and old cutters.  The instructions say &amp;#34;Make sure that the projections of the shaving heads fit exactly into the recesses.&amp;#34;  This is the slightly tricky part.  Little tabs on the sides of the heads have to fit in little spaces to seat properly.  I am not sure I actually saw how those go together but if you have reasonably good eyes and are patient you can see when it is right (it will go together wrong).  I&#x27;d recommend just putting in the heads and when you get those seated properly you can just drop in the cutters.&lt;br /&gt;And no more pull when I shave.  Yay.</li>
            <li> I am using the shaver and seems to be ok. I did have trouble getting the blades in and the shaver is making strange sounds.</li>
            <li> prompt service ,right product</li>
            <li> These are poor quality.  I ended up just throwing them away and buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Just wish they weren&#x27;t soooo expensive.</li>
            <li> Works adequately. Shaving takes longer than I&#x27;d like with this head, but I find that&#x27;s par for the course with most electric razors.</li>
            <li> Once a year I need to replace the shaving heads on my electric razor. Buy them on Amazon for the best price.</li>
            <li> The blades work better than the old worn out blades, but certainly no close shave</li>
            <li> Like all the ones, I have used, great for a few shaves then seem to dull quickly.</li>
            <li> works as always  great service.</li>
            <li> Arrived on date stated and was exactly what I needed for a clean shave very easy to replace.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d picked up a second shaver for travel--but that was years ago.  The &amp;#34;self-sharpening&amp;#34; blades were now pretty dull and made shaving slow and uncomfortable.  Rather than buying a new razon just to get fresh and sharp blades I got these replacement heads.  They work well.  I think they are expensive but still are less expensive than a new razor.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco razors for 25+ years &amp; am satisfied with the product &amp; replacement parts.</li>
            <li> It feels much better now with new blades.</li>
            <li> works like a new razor now.</li>
            <li> Good replacement blade</li>
            <li> When your razor needs replacement heads, it&#x27;s great to be able to get brand-name parts at a good price delivered to your door.  As expected, they fit and work perfectly.</li>
            <li> Norelco heads are pricey but work well.</li>
            <li> Keeps my husband&#x27;s razor working well.  Good price compared to off the shelf prices.</li>
            <li> Received the product I ordered in a matter of couple days. Fit perfect and works good.</li>
            <li> Could use better installation instructions.</li>
            <li> Yes, the replacement rotary blades are perfect</li>
            <li> So nice to have new blades for a much closer shave.</li>
            <li> By ordering this item I saved money and didn&#x27;t have to purchase more then I needed. At another outlet I would have had to purchase 2 to get what I wanted. That was also twice the cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my razor for many years and these are perfect replacements.</li>
            <li> replacing them made all the difference in the shave</li>
            <li> Fits my razor, makes it work like new. :) I recommend cleaning off the razor head with isopropyl alcohol after each use to keep it semi-sterile.</li>
            <li> Excellent service and quality.</li>
            <li> They fit right and are still cutting my whiskers, cheaper than a new razor, so I bought two sets.</li>
            <li> These things are expensive.  They work well, and fit well, but I just can&#x27;t give them five stars.  The packaging with my razor said to change the blades at least every 12 months.  However, I find that if I don&#x27;t change blades every six months, it&#x27;ll take me an eternity to finish shaving because my sandpaper face reduces the metal shave heads to wimpering French soldiers.</li>
            <li> Fits in easily once I figured it out.  The Phillips shaver he has is very convenient.  Can rinse it out with water since it is waterproof.</li>
            <li> As always, new shaver heads cut much better and are more comfortable by a long shot.  I&#x27;ll do this again in a year or so.</li>
            <li> my old blades didn&#x27;t cut it anymore and just span  around making noise but not shaving anything. Strange that I had old Norelos from Japan that cut for decades but since they went to The Netherlands (but my pt730 was made in China now) both my Netherlands model and china model blades wear out pretty quickly and completely. Still more convenient than a manual blade, the new heads have renewed  my shaver and it now works as if new. And sometimes through Amazon you get a coupon and prime shipping which arrives next day (must have come by drone?) I was thinking a buying a different brand razor till I thought of Amazon, liked the price, and it was i think the right price/choice to just  get new heads instead of a  new razor. (they do come with new heads and new blades, takes about two seconds to install</li>
            <li> One tip - you can often get a lot more life out of your heads by carefully and completely cleaning your razor. In any case, these are the real deal and work very well.</li>
            <li> Great blades, easy to change out and last a long time. I have owned many Norelco Razors and these are great.</li>
            <li> Having purchased this razor about a year ago I knew it was time to replace the blades.  I ordered the replacement heads expecting a similar shave as the new shaver.....WRONG.  It is bearly better than the old worn out blades.  What gives?</li>
            <li> My husband is active duty military and has used his razor since he bought it FIVE &amp; HALF YEARS AGO!!! He didn&#x27;t really complain of dull blades yet but I could see a difference in his pattern of shaving he would go over it two or three times so I surprised him with new blades. After exhausting all efforts of finding them in local stores ...&amp;#34;a little light-bulb came on&amp;#34; and I knew I could find them here in a snap! Reasonable price and shipping cost - delivery was on time as well!&lt;br /&gt;Thankful to find you selling them since my husband refuses to buy a new razor!</li>
            <li> It works well and is something we have needed for a long time. We got the product that we ordered</li>
            <li> Love these OEM replacement Heads for my Norelco razor. I didn&#x27;t notice how my original cutting heads were slowly getting duller over the year, but I did notice my face burning after shaving, so I decided to replace the heads. I used to just chuck the whole razor, because replacement heads were often times almost the same price as a whole new razor - But I really like this razor (the Philips Norelco 7310), because you can rinse it out, and the cost of these replacement heads was pretty reasonable (about $22 US), so I bought them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Installing the heads was about a 2 minute job, and presto! Brand New Razor again! Really smooth shave, no more burning. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how bad my old blades were until I put in the new blades.  Quality product and very easy to install.</li>
            <li> These are for an old model now and I could not find it in any other price with a better price. If you need it just get it</li>
            <li> The blades are nice and sharp, work great. Just wish they lasted a little longer, they seem to wear out and need replacing too soon.</li>
            <li> estas cuchillas son muy buenas y de exelente calidad las recomiendo el vendedor las envio con mucha responsabilidad okey gracias.</li>
            <li> Almost threw out my razor to get a new one because of poor shaves. The old blades were two years old. Now with these new blades, the ol&#x27;gal is just like new.</li>
            <li> As good as expected. As long as it is made by Philips Norelco I didn&#x27;t worry about it not being good.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this part, It works better than the ones it replaces.&lt;br /&gt;As usual for Philips Norelco</li>
            <li> Not the quickest delivery but it arrived as ordered and works fine. No issues at a all.</li>
            <li> There seems to be little point to review a replacement head or refill or some such.&lt;br /&gt;The product worked as expected. Your shaving unit has the three circles on top which are the blades.&lt;br /&gt;They recommend you replace said blades every year or so. I have managed to wait longer myself.&lt;br /&gt;This purchase will come with three blades to replace one of each of the blades currently installed in your shaving unit.&lt;br /&gt;This will allow you to shave the hairs of your chiny-chin-chin for at least one more year.&lt;br /&gt;Installation was easy and came with instructions. Took about a minute to install and results were good.&lt;br /&gt;If you need replacement heads for your electric razor just buy them.</li>
            <li> Works as original. Easy to install.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads for Norelco HQ8 razor. Good price with quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly and the product was new as advertised.</li>
            <li> it was a great product</li>
            <li> I dreaded having to change my shaver&#x27;s head because it used to be so complicated that when I could not figure it out I just bought another razor. The huge improvement here is that these blades slip out easily and are easily replaced and snapped in place. This improvement is great for me and I suspect for most users of a Norelco shavers.</li>
            <li> Just what the doctor ordered</li>
            <li> Fixing the blades in the shaver was not easy. The blades are not at all sharp. Would not recommend this</li>
            <li> It sure makes a difference to put in new heads.  I guess I should follow the instructions  and do it annually, but usually you wait until you notice the razor isn&#x27;t cutting like it used to.</li>
            <li> I just installed a new set of these Norelco HQ8 Replacement Blades on my OLD Norelco shaver.  I had never replaced the blades in the years that I owned it.  They had pretty well worn down to nubs and pulled out more hair than they cut off.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  These HQ8 blades turned my old shaver into a new shaver in just a few minutes.  I couldn&#x27;t ask for a closer shave..  Highly recommend buying these blades..</li>
            <li> They work fine  my husband likes them</li>
            <li> Fits and a good price.</li>
            <li> Night and day vs. my old, dull blades. Like I got a brand new razor, definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> fits and works as advertised</li>
            <li> As usual, Norelco is superb!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jimmye Hillman</li>
            <li> fit perfectly and was pretty easy to install!</li>
            <li> I ordered these replacement blades for my 4 year old Norelco and they came in a ridiculously short amount of time. The blades are great, I think, but with the new blades I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of razor rash especially in the area under my chin. Apparently it takes a while for your skin to get used to the new blades, but the rash was really bothering me, so I went to the internet looking for a solution.    I found online that the rash was really avoidable if I exfoliated my skin a couple of times a week to get rid of dead skin and bacteria, and exfoliating also gives you a much better shave. I figured it was worth a try, so I ordered this[[ASIN:B00U1J83SQ TreeActiv Anti Acne &amp; Rosacea Treatment Sulfur Mask Plus Rhassoul, Bentonite Clay Mask with Witch Hazel &amp; Aloe Vera - Refreshing Lemon Scent (1 Jar) (4 Oz)]] online, and whoa--it worked really well. It felt a little funny at first to use such a thick cream on my face, but it really helped make my shave so much smoother and I also was able to get rid of some of the painful razor bumps that I get every so often on my face.    I definitely recommend changing your blades more often than 4 years in between, and just in general it helps to exfoliate your face a few times a week for super smooth shaves that you will have to do less of. Also, I use [[ASIN:B00LFT0CEO TreeActiv+ Tea Tree Oil Acne Solution for Advanced Acne Treatment - All Natural Acne Spot Treatment - Blemishes Gone or Your Money Back! (60ml)]]to clean my razor, apparently it works better than anything else in preventing dullness of the razor, and its good for keeping your razor in good shape.</li>
            <li> These shaving heads work very well and my husband is happy with their performance.  We are looking forward to getting the next head in 5 months.  I think you are right on target with that replacement time.</li>
            <li> Great fit for my old razor!  I will continue to purchase these replacement heads in the future.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are definitely of higher quality than the cheaper alternatives you find on ebay. However, considering my razor was $35 by itself, it is certainly pricey for replacement heads to be 1/3 of that price.</li>
            <li> Service was great,  The new blades were easy to install and  were so quite and smooth on my face that I thought&lt;br /&gt;it wasn&#x27;t running or cutting.</li>
            <li> WOW! I didn&#x27;t realize my old cutters were so dull. I guess they got dull so gradually, I didn&#x27;t really notice it until one day I noticed my face being irritated after shaving. Glad I got them!</li>
            <li> Keeps me clean shaved!</li>
            <li> Cheapest place to buy these. Walmart is always out. It saves time and energy. Great prices too.</li>
            <li> my shaves are way more comfortable now great price too</li>
            <li> I definitely notice a closer, more comfortable shave after replacing the shaver heads. My old ones were almost two years old.</li>
            <li> Glad to find these replacement shaver heads for the Philips Norelco. Extends the life of the shaver making the electric shaver more affordable.</li>
            <li> Very professional as always.</li>
            <li> very sharp and a good price</li>
            <li> I have been using these replacement units for years, and they are excellent. This solution is a good value rather than buying a new shaver each 2 years..</li>
            <li> Makes shaver almost like new - a little pricey in my opinion, but a lot less than an actual new razor.</li>
            <li> These, according to my husband, do a great job with his electric razor.</li>
            <li> It seems like a bit if a high price for what you&#x27;re getting, but they work well. It beats replacing the whole razor for sure.</li>
            <li> 1st quality, manufacturer original, and half the price of walgreens. no excuse not to change heads.</li>
            <li> much improved performance.  Quick service.</li>
            <li> Wow. I got a new razor. Or so it seems.  I was about to toss my ten year old Norelco but was feeling bad about doing that.  I ordered the blades as a last ditch effort, knowing I could return them if I wasn&#x27;t happy. I am and my razor works like new again.</li>
            <li> I replace my shaver heads every six months to keep my shaver operating at peak efficiency for a great shave.</li>
            <li> Amazon has always provided me with great merchandise with fast delivery. The blades were exactly what I neded for my husbands stocking this Christmas.</li>
            <li> The replacement blades for my Norelco razor are excellent, fit properly and provide an outstanding smooth shave in less time than those that were replaced after a year&#x27;s service. I highly recommend changing blades annually to insure clean shaves in a minimum of effort.</li>
            <li> I never knew you had to replace the blades, so when I did, It worked again. Saved me from buying a new one.</li>
            <li> It works well but not as good as the set that came with the razer originally.  The design is a bit different but fits well.</li>
            <li> I have been replacing the blades on my Norwood for a couple of years, the ha8&#x27;s seem to go dull every 6 month or so. I have decided to try another razor as the cost of replacement the blades is about the same as a news mid priced razor.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using the Philips Norelco Spectra razor.  It helps to replace the cutting assemblies once a year. These will do a good job when their time comes.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re razor head replacements, there isn&#x27;t much to tell. I looked up the replacement part number online, matched these to my razor, and all is well.</li>
            <li> I thought getting replacement blades would make a big difference...perhaps they&#x27;re seconds?&lt;br /&gt; Next time I&#x27;ll buy locally or just get a new razor.</li>
            <li> I have my shaver now for about 2~3 years, and I thought It would be time to change the heads.  Surprisingly, the new ones were not so much better than the old ones. They shave nicely, but it shows the quality of the previous ones. So I&#x27;ll keep with Philips. I am very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Bought these for my dad&#x27;s norcello razor which he loves. Have not heard of any problems with them so far.</li>
            <li> mostly tired of every thing made in china because they use cheap help and materials to put more americans out of work</li>
            <li> Prompt shipping and item as described...</li>
            <li> Expensive for a refill but you only change them out once a year if you keep them clean.</li>
            <li> Best price for genuine Norelco replacement razor blades. They make razor work good as new. They will last about a year and I will buy them from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp, giving a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> To anybody that bought this: Keep the original blades your razor came with. I used my original blades for 4 years and they are still good. I bought these and they cut, but not as good as the original.</li>
            <li> IT IS ON MY OLD SHAVER AND NOW CUTS LIKE THE ORIGINAL AS NEW ,BUY ONE YOU WILL LIKE IT  KENB</li>
            <li> Second time I got these for my husband in 3 years.  He only will shave with this razor.  These blades stay sharp for longer than a year.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again.</li>
            <li> on time and as described</li>
            <li> Second time I have ordered these. They are great.  The shavers are like new again.</li>
            <li> I found a 5 year old expensive Norelco razor in my cabinet that I loved but had quit using years ago because it quit shaving well. I took a flyer and ordered these replacement blades. I&#x27;m glad a did because after just popping out the old blades and putting in the new ones, I had a like new razor that shaves great.</li>
            <li> They are what they are, great price though Amazon</li>
            <li> Fit in my razor and cut well.  Too bad they cost so much.</li>
            <li> My old blades were at least 18 months old. So, when they started pulling and yanking my chin hairs I knew it was time to replace them. I almost considered buying a new shaver but I&#x27;m glad that I saw the replacement blades instead. Saved me about $40. The new blades were simple to install. They only fit one way so it was fool proof. I already had my shaver recharged so when I shaved with the new blades I was amazed at how close the shave was -- again -- just like when it was brand new. I think my face actually said, &amp;#34;Thank you!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I picked this up the replace my old heads on my older Norelco which featured the &amp;#34;lift and cut&amp;#34; system.. I think these are designed differently and it takes a couple extra passes to get the same close shave as before.. also if you look closely, these have small &amp;#34;pinholes&amp;#34; where as my original head had fins all the way around.. oh well.. it still works.. just have to do extra passes to get all the stubble..</li>
            <li> these heads give a very nice close shave and i would recommend them to others wanting a good dry shave</li>
            <li> A very easy installation and the best shave I have had in a long time.  Just a great product and I will replace these when they dull up instead of waiting as I did this tme.</li>
            <li> I purchased 3 of these grabers.  2 are great but one of them doesn&#x27;t click right so it&#x27;s very hard to use.  They really should replace the faulty one.</li>
            <li> This item is well worth the investment. I love my Norelco, and having fresh blades makes my experience that much more enjoyable. If you own a Norelco shaver, buy the replacement blades, they are simple to install and cheaper than buying a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Thankful to be able to replace the blades and not have to trash&lt;br /&gt;the unit, which seems to be the trend these days.&lt;br /&gt;Worked like a charm and easy to install.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads work fine</li>
            <li> My razor was cutting my face instead of shaving it. The new blades were just what the doctor ordered. The shaver works like new.</li>
            <li> Clean shaven again!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Good price with coupon!!</li>
            <li> Everything was great! Super service!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product. They delivered as they said.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> After several years with the same blades, I saw in the mirror that I wasn&#x27;t getting a decent shave.  I bought these replacement blades hoping that would solve it.  Well, it&#x27;s better, but still doesn&#x27;t look as good as I&#x27;d hoped for.  I&#x27;m not expecting \\&quot;blade close\\&quot;, but it isn&#x27;t even as good as some of my other electric razors over the years.  It&#x27;s good enough for everyday, but for important occasions I&#x27;ll be using a blade again.</li>
            <li> The Norelco replacement heads enabled my shaver to get the whiskers cut off close to my skin again, and the price from Amazon was the best I found.</li>
            <li> Work great as good as new razor for a fraction of the cost</li>
            <li> Great Product for Price!!!</li>
            <li> Good price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> These blades lasted about 11 months. I use the Norelco Spray Lubricant and kept them clean. It is a nice razor compared to Remmington, which is junk and that is another story. I know the blades lasted longer 15 yrs. ago, I am sure they are keeping the cost down because when started shaving they were 15.00 dollars, which says alot........... Enjoy</li>
            <li> It gives me a close shave and I don&#x27;t have to replace it often.</li>
            <li> great price and works like a charm</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Just what was needed. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Replace yearly makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I have allways used norelco shavers,there great shavers these heads are great, really get a nice close shave with them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why you have to buy the whole head set when you used to be able to buy just the blades for a fraction of the cost.  Unfortunately, you either have to pay the price for these or get a new razor.  On the plus side, they work.</li>
            <li> The new heads made my shaver almost like new works great</li>
            <li> Great electric razor.</li>
            <li> thank you very much....</li>
            <li> The replacement heads arrived right as promised.  They were very easy to install.  Now it is as if I have a brand new shaver.  Really close and smooth.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed to make my shaver perform as new.</li>
            <li> These do not seem to be as sharp as the ones that come with the new razors. Is this intentional? Maybe I just got some that were under quality.</li>
            <li> Nothing too special.  These heads simply made my razor like new for less than purchasing a new one.  Very simple to install.</li>
            <li> Great replacement heads! Like a brand new razor.</li>
            <li> After replacing these my shaver again gives a close shave. Thought maybe the problem was an old shaver. Nope, just old blades. The package recommend changing once a year. Mine were much older than that!</li>
            <li> Good price on new shaver heads. Happy with product</li>
            <li> Just as advertised. Fit my shaver as expected and price seems reasonable.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads work fine for about 6 months before needing replacement. But if you replace every 6 or even every 9 months then the replacement head cost more than buying a new shaver. So way too expensive for just the heads.</li>
            <li> It was a good purchase and I like it</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s to say?  They fit.  They work.</li>
            <li> Great replacent blades good price, fast delivery</li>
            <li> Great factory replacement blades for my Norelco razor.  Norelco makes what I think is the best razor available, with the addition of these replacement blades, it turned my 3 year old razor back to its superb shaves again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the bvest. SHipped early</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been 2 years since I replaced blades on my 6-year old shavers. (I rotate between two at different homes).&lt;br /&gt;I usually go just 1 year between replacements.  What a difference.  Yes they&#x27;re expensive, but cheaper than the drugstore..</li>
            <li> These fit my husbands razor perfectly. He had gone so long without replacing heads, that the razor was pulling hair out. These fit so well, and now he has a smooth shave without hurting himself.</li>
            <li> When you notice you are standing in front ot he mirror longer than you did some months back it&#x27;s probably time to change the blades. Norelco recommends every year, I think I went 2-3 years before I even began to notice but that depends on your beard type.  Nothing cuts like a new blade, so change &#x27;em out.</li>
            <li> Good blades, good price.</li>
            <li> OEM blades, fit well, work well, last long.</li>
            <li> perfect, didn&#x27;t realize I had to even change them</li>
            <li> It works. but not very well</li>
            <li> quick and easy way to make electric razor last years longer</li>
            <li> Performs as advertised</li>
            <li> Works perfectly.  Great shave.</li>
            <li> My husband never knew his razor could be so efficient. He&#x27;d been using it the same as when he got it a year ago. He was amazed when I put the new piece in. I didn&#x27;t tell him, you see. I just did the replacement. He&#x27;s very pleased and so am I.</li>
            <li> Arrived early.  Worked as advertised.</li>
            <li> I think there was a mistake in filling the shipment box. I received 3 razor blade heads and not the Dual Precision Head. Thank You for concern. Burley Melton</li>
            <li> It was a wise decision getting these replacement parts. Replacement was easy and works like a new one. I was infact planning to throw my year old shaver and get new one, but changed my mind last minute and decided to get replacement head. I would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Good quality, excellent service by seller.  These are stock Phillips parts and the second time I have purchased them.  For some reason they just don&#x27;t seem to last as long as the ones that came on the razor but still last about a year and a half.</li>
            <li> Using the same Norelco I&#x27;ve had for the past 4 years. Keep buying these replacement heads every 6 months, works fine.</li>
            <li> Hubby&#x27;s Norelco shaver wasn&#x27;t doing the job.  We considered buying a new one, but decided to get replacement heads instead.  These are fine, but as some reviewers have noted, there does seem to be more spacing between the cutting blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, they work, so that&#x27;s what we wanted.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Used them for&lt;br /&gt;Years cuts well as long as the growth&lt;br /&gt;Is not too long. Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> They certainly work a lot better than the original heads, which were probably worn out. The new heads were much quieter and cut much better.</li>
            <li> Doubled or tripled the life of the razor</li>
            <li> Replacement heads are one set for the Norelco Powertouch, among other razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product can be easily swapped with old set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if users have any other choice to replace heasds on Powertouch PT730.</li>
            <li> just what my husband needed</li>
            <li> Works great - just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> my one star rating has nothing to do with the product.i ordered the wrong head for my razor and therefor didn&#x27;t use it,however I don&#x27;t think it was clear to me  as to which razor they were for.</li>
            <li> It was what we wanted. Works good. Would do buy it again.Easy to install. Excellent price.Fast shipping. This is a great deal.</li>
            <li> PERFECT FOR BOTH RAZORS. THANKS</li>
            <li> Wish I would have replaced the blades a long time ago.  Feels like I have a new shaver.  I won&#x27;t wait that long next time!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used my Norelco for years but after I replaced the heads I remembered what I was missing. Replacement blades were easy to replace</li>
            <li> Razor heads were delivered as promised, and work GREAT!</li>
            <li> The razor heads fit perfect and made my electric razor new again. I ready to order another set of heads just for spare.</li>
            <li> The new shaver heads were needed &amp; helped a lot. The shaver could be a little more powerful to be more efficient.</li>
            <li> Now if I could only get my retired husband to shave a little more often.  :)</li>
            <li> Everything was great.</li>
            <li> recommend you replace once a year if you are a daily shaver like me.  It will take a couple of shaves for the new blades to get set in place, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> They work as expected.</li>
            <li> Lasted longer than the razor stayed in style.</li>
            <li> A fine razor, easy to use and maintain..The users manual is very well written and very helpful. Customer service is outstanding.</li>
            <li> My husband is happy again.  No more pulling when he shaves.  Good for another year.  Makes gift shopping easier when you need the same thing year after year.</li>
            <li> arrived on time and was as advertised.</li>
            <li> Worked fine easily replaced the old blades on my wife&#x27;s razor!</li>
            <li> Make sure you get these too....as they can be difficult to get with the razor....</li>
            <li> Great price, and fit right in. Swapped out in under 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Restored my shaver to excellent perfromance. Like new again.</li>
            <li> Received what I expected.</li>
            <li> Did the job neatly.  We saved a bundle by purchasing these replacement heads.  My husband&#x27;s shaver was at least 10 years old and he did not use it often.  However, he is now in a position in life where he cannot use a blade razor so he is very pleased with just replacing the old dull heads.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and was the perfect fit.</li>
            <li> Got my razor working again.</li>
            <li> Quite an improvement !</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for several years and never changed the&lt;br /&gt;blades. I know what is the use to shave. So I finally checked out&lt;br /&gt;the replacement blades and got the right one, so now I get a good&lt;br /&gt;close shave.</li>
            <li> These were replacement blades for my son&#x27;s razor. They fit just fine and his razor is working very well. Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Came quickly, easy to replace and works like new... my husband loves it.</li>
            <li> Easy enough to change out the shaver heads. They work just fine.</li>
            <li> Looks like new, plan to change it in one year. Don&#x27;t know how sharp they are. So far so good.</li>
            <li> These heads do not provide a reasonably close shave and are thus excessively priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are supposed to put a drop of oil in the head somewhere to help the heads but the directions do not say where the oil is supposed to be placed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not magically getting a closer shave, but the act of shaving is smoother. This was the right replacement head.</li>
            <li> Clean shave every time. Tricky to pot in.</li>
            <li> Fit my husband&#x27;s razor perfectly.  Works great!  He is very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Using a shaver daily and the incremental degradation of the cutters is so imperceptible, but these replacements made me realize how important sharp cutters are.  Great product at a decent price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there is anything that feels as good as a nice clean shave. My other blades were dull and causing a rash, these are a GREAT improvement!</li>
            <li> This is what I ordered.  It was the right Manufacturer&#x27;s parts for my razor and they work as designed.</li>
            <li> These blades cut only slightly better than 2 year old originals -- which are ripping my face they are so worn out.  The new ones still hurt my face and leave some stubble, despite many passes.  This high price would be worth it if they were equivalent to new blades --- but they are not even close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star for making the packaging look like it&#x27;s really from Norelco.  Could it be a counterfeit?  Or has Norelco gone this far down hill?</li>
            <li> My husband is very pleased with these replacement heads for his Norelco razor.  He commented that the shave was more comfortable than when he first got his razor,</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t changed my razor&#x27;s head for over 3 years. I almost bought a new shaver but then I decided to try replacement heads. I was pretty excited after reading all of those great reviews. Disappointment came with the first shave.. I simply couldn&#x27;t feel too much of a difference!</li>
            <li> pleased with replacements</li>
            <li> These are very good equivalent replacement heads for my Norelco Quadra Action razor that is supposed to use HQ6 type heads.&lt;br /&gt;Those are discontinued and they work almost as good. They slip a little bit when you shave, so it takes a little longer to shave, but the shave is just as close as with the recommended replacements that are no longer manufactured.</li>
            <li> This set of heads shave much closer than the ones that came with the shaver, I try to buy from another source and these were much cheaper from Amazon</li>
            <li> Norelco is my personal choice for best electric razor. Works very well on a thick, non-straight beard.</li>
            <li> I use my 8894 XL once in 2 days and the head doesn&#x27;t last long enough.  I replaced mine just about 3 months back and i think it already needs a replacement again (get that burning sensation after my shave)</li>
            <li> What can I say?  It&#x27;s the same as buying a new razor, but a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> Works as expected, deliver was very prompt and price was very good, too.I am very satisfied with this purchase</li>
            <li> Great product - best price</li>
            <li> Fantastic!  Stores don&#x27;t stock precisely all refills all the time.  My husband uses this shaver and now can ALWAYS have sharp blades. Delivery was supersonic! Yay.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect replacement for the original HQ8 shaver.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like shaving with an electric razor but it is much handier so the heads I ordered are as good as I could expect.</li>
            <li> My husband was thrilled to get this replacement head.  He had looked in several stores locally, but no one had it in stock.  That&#x27;s probably because his razor is getting old.</li>
            <li> Replacing my worn out hit-and-miss heads made SUCH A DIFFERENCE that I think I will replace them more frequently.</li>
            <li> Just like the original set that came with my razor.  I love the shave of the Norelco razor but hate the fact that the flip top too easily becomes detached from the razor body when cleaning.</li>
            <li> Worked as describe would get it again if I needed it.</li>
            <li> Very good item, Just as good as the ones that came with the razor.</li>
            <li> Buy this product about one each year as replacement heads.  Always seem to perform well.</li>
            <li> keeps the shaver operating like new</li>
            <li> Okay product but a bit too much &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; for my liking.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes it.</li>
            <li> Shaves better than the original heads that came with the razor. Closer and more comfortable. I am very satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> On time and as advertised.</li>
            <li> Great price, good service, no problems.  will probably purchase from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT REPLACEMENT HEADS. VERY HARD TO FIND RIGHT REPLACEMENT HEADS FOR MY SHAVER. HAD TO LOOK UP ALOT ON YOUR SITE TO FIGURE OUT WHICH ONE FIT.</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected, timing of delivery was excellent.  No issues, would order again.</li>
            <li> The fit was just right.  Heads a different design than the original.  Shave a little better, not much.</li>
            <li> It was the spare part i was looking for.</li>
            <li> works great, easy to install</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;s the correct part.</li>
            <li> Quality product, with prompt delivery.  As always.</li>
            <li> Order arrived faster than expected and the cutters work great!</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> Good price and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> My husband is always complaining how these are of so lesser quality than the ones that came with the shaver. They should try to make the replacement ones as good as the original ones.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t give a clean shave.  I may buy a new razor because they are so bad.</li>
            <li> Wonderful deal with the instant clip coupon!</li>
            <li> This was the first time I replaced the cutting heads on an electric shaver. I&#x27;ve always just purchased a new shaver when the old one started doing a poor job. My old shaver&#x27;s about two years old, but the motor runs fine and the batteries still hold a good charge. I&#x27;m glad I replaced the heads, it worked out well for me. It was simple; took less than a minute. It was much cheaper than buying a new shaver. Now it shaves like it&#x27;s brand new again. I can&#x27;t believe what a huge difference it made.</li>
            <li> The original shaver head that I got for this was better.  After a bit over a year of using the shaver it was getting dull so I decided to change the blades.  The new blades I got are no better than the ones that are over a year old.  Now I am looking for a new brand as there quality seems to have dropped.</li>
            <li> Made my year old razor just like new at half the price the retailer wanted.</li>
            <li> Fantastic purchase for my razor.</li>
            <li> They work as they should.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, work perfect.</li>
            <li> very good~ thank you!!</li>
            <li> Suspect these were cheap knock offs.  From day 1, the replacements have been terrible and didn&#x27;t get much better after nearly two months break in.  Takes an eternity to shave with these.  My 1.5 yr old blades worked better.</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery, easyily installed and makes my shaver like new.</li>
            <li> Had to replace my razors shaving heads. Mine beard would laugh when I attempted to use my old ones and it would take three times the time to shave and my face was like raw meat afterwards. With my new norelco razor heads it was zip, zap  whiskers gone, and my face thanked me. My razor suggests replacements every year, to save your face I think about every six months for a fast comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Easy to change and gives a quality shave.</li>
            <li> Just like gas in your tank, they work as advertised.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor on line for a low price because it was missing a head. Little did I know replacement heads are expensive. And, there are dozens of different heads available, so you need to know what your shopping for. This site was easy to follow; I found the right model number easily and the price was low. The razor works great now and I am happy.</li>
            <li> The upgrade in performance after installing the new cutter system was the difference between night and day. Close shaves again after becoming more and more dissatisfied with the old unit.</li>
            <li> works great when new,  but I can&#x27;t get more than 6 months out of them.</li>
            <li> These razor heads works great.  I recently replaced the heads on my Norelco razor and they give a very close shave.  Today, I shaved a full beard off in about 5 minutes with my Norelco razor.  I used the pop up trimmer to cut the bulk off then shaved with the razor and it came out extremely close.</li>
            <li> Fully met expectations. Received earlier than first posted.</li>
            <li> like a brand new razor!!! could have asked for a better replacement for my razor. had to replace my orginals after a lil over a year, and it was well worth the 2o bucks!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Been needing these for some time but couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere but for an outrageous price. When I thought about checking to see if they were here I jumped on it. No more pulling and ripping the the little tiny hairs out my face as Cosby said.</li>
            <li> Nothing negative to report</li>
            <li> Excellent purchase, Kept me from having to buy a new shaver. I really love this shaver, and thought I was going to have to buy a &amp;#34;newer and better&amp;#34; and more expensive one. You can&#x27;t go wrong! Amazon&#x27;s price for these HQ 8 Spectra replacements was the lowest I could find on the Internet. Shipped very fast! Thanx</li>
            <li> good blades, fitted fine, very sharp.  you can depend on&lt;br /&gt;Norleco. Excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;will definitely buy again thru Amazon.  like straight from&lt;br /&gt;the factory/</li>
            <li> The item arrived very quickly, much faster than expected, that was much appreciated, as these are replacement blades for my Norelco shaver, the old blades I had let go too long and were very dull. I will remember to replace them annually.</li>
            <li> Many of us buy a good electric razor and neglect the blades and use them until they are chunks of rust -- literally.  Well, I have done it in my time, anyway.  These replacement heads are essential and you should plan on changing heads every year.  I have learned that lesson through error.  These blades are a lot cheaper than a new razor.  RJB.</li>
            <li> This purchase was the worst I have made on amazon.  The box was crushed and the blades were DULL...  I used them for 3 weeks, as the instructions state so they will contour to my face.  These never did.  Beware of this product.....</li>
            <li> My old razor felt new again after installing the blades.  The instructions for changing the blades were not very clear so I did a google search and found a Youtube video that explained it.  Very simple after that.</li>
            <li> Good to get a clean shave again with these new shaver heads.  Good product for the money a lot cheaper than what they cost in the store.  Shipping was very quick, received in three days.</li>
            <li> I am really a cheapskate so I had put off changing the heads on my Norelco razor but I began to notice that it was taking me longer and longer to shave so I bit the bullet.  I changed my heads and now my razor is as good as new.  It makes a big difference.</li>
            <li> Replacements heads fit perfectly and give a faster shave.</li>
            <li> They are the same ones I have ordered before and they work just right / I will order them again ty</li>
            <li> I could almost buy a new razor for what they charge for the replacement cutting heads.</li>
            <li> Works well and fits my shaver.  No complaints</li>
            <li> I have done this once already</li>
            <li> as replacement parts go . the same brand , proper part, went as expected . price was motovating factor. no brainer . as to recomend product ,one must first owne one . thank you .NEIL</li>
            <li> My razor is like new again and works like a charm, as if  it were brand new out of the box!</li>
            <li> Easy to install and great pricing.</li>
            <li> direct replacement. works great.</li>
            <li> Have used Norelco razors for years. This razor in these heads are about as good is not taking a shave at all. I need to shave again within about 2 hours and I do not have a heavy beard. Once you use a series 8000 these are just not adequate. I actually lost one of the heads so I&#x27;m only using 2 heads out of my series 8000 and get a better shave that I do with all 3 heads with this. Look for another razor. This is not the one you want.</li>
            <li> My husband says they are the best one out there.  He said they not only do a good job but his other ones&lt;br /&gt;lasted for a long time.</li>
            <li> Great price that beat the official website which were out of these when we looked!</li>
            <li> I got a new Norelco from wife a couple years ago, and it always tugged at my face. Sometimes when I shaved my neck too long trying to get hairs it would cause skin burns that turned my neck red and sore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, recently wife suggested I replace the blades. I relented and Voila! I was going to buy a new shaver but this one is better than brand new when I first got it! Close, fast shave, no skin burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended. I&#x27;m going to change my blades at least once a year from now on. It will extend the life of your shaver.</li>
            <li> Work very well, make shaver almost like new again.</li>
            <li> Fast, cheap, and just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time. Works great!</li>
            <li> Made my shaver work like new. Will replace again when necessary. Cheaper than buying a whole new shaver.</li>
            <li> I was afraid I would mess up and delayed the changeover , but when I started the change it turned out to be very easy (following the directions given).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Norelco triple headed electric razor user for over 25 years. The razor which I use now is one which is about four years old and still going strong. Replacing the blades [heads] every 6 - 12 months is still cheaper than purchasing a new Norelco razor. I&#x27;ve not noticed any irritation after installing new heads, just a better shave with less effort. Keep your old razor and replace the heads! You can&#x27;t go wrong! Amazon&#x27;s price for these HQ 8 Spectra replacements was the lowest I could find on the Internet. Shipped very fast!</li>
            <li> The new blades made my 10 year old Norelco like new.  Love it!  I&#x27;ve priced similar replacement blades in the brick &amp; mortar stores and they wanted as much for the blades as a new Shaver would have cost.</li>
            <li> It would be helpful if there was a more accurate photograph of the parts that will actually be received.  The image on the package displays three cutting heads for the Norelco razor, in the housing, leading the viewer to believe that the whole assembly is what is being purchased.  What arrives is three individual cutting heads with the cutting blades inside.  What I needed, and thought I was getting was the entire assembly pictured on the package.  I still have an unusable razor with a broken housing.</li>
            <li> After toying with the idea of simply buying a whole new electric razor, I decided to look into replacement heads. My razor was a pretty old one, but the replacement heads were still available so I ordered them. I suppose lots of folks just replace the whole unit, but I&#x27;m just cheap enough to try head replacement first. Boy am I glad I did! Once properly installed, the old razor cut like a brand new unit! I&#x27;m obviously very pleased to have extended the life of my old razor by taking a cheaper/smarter solution to the dull razor dilemma.</li>
            <li> Really fast delivery and razor is like new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to have new razor heads.  The difference is quite noticable, but it is overpriced.</li>
            <li> The Norelco cutters should be replaced annually. These make a difference in the closeness of the shaving.</li>
            <li> Excellent price and arrived on time</li>
            <li> Works great, much less expensive than taking it to a local shop for service.</li>
            <li> Every site, including yours, says this HQ8 fits my shaver. (7310XL).  Not so!  This is the incorrect  replacement.  I think your new head set is HQ177.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was very unsatisfactory and now I have Three sets.</li>
            <li> I purchased these replacement heads along with the new razor just to have them on-hand when the originals wear down. The user, who has a heavy beard and shaves daily, really loves the Norelco electric razor and never wants to be unable to use it.</li>
            <li> Give a very good shave.</li>
            <li> Shaver works as new now :-)</li>
            <li> Wow, now I know why my son was not getting a close shave. It wasn&#x27;t the razor, it was dull blades. If you&#x27;re not getting the close shave you used to, order new blades, not a new razor.</li>
            <li> Awesome delivery, Highly recommend !</li>
            <li> Without question these are OEM Quality and good for hundreds of uses.</li>
            <li> My husband has a Norelco electric razor and replaces the blades at least yearly. He always gets a great shave after replacing the blades and they lengthen the life of the razor. Ordering through Amazon was about 1/2 the price elsewhere and it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Regular replacement; and I got a coupon for buying it here</li>
            <li> Great price, just what was needed!</li>
            <li> The shaver heads worked as expected.  No problems so far.  I soon will have to order again as the heads only last about a year.</li>
            <li> I was very happy to find these replacement heads in bulk because the heads are almost as expensive as buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> I just replaced the shaving head on my electric razor.  It pays to change the blades every so ofter for a better shave.</li>
            <li> quality item.haver works as new</li>
            <li> Item was as expected and shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly on my old Philips Norelco triple head shaver 7310XL</li>
            <li> Blades were difficult to align.  Worked for awhile and fell out so I purchsed a new razor.</li>
            <li> Easy to install and give a good close shave.  Quality product.</li>
            <li> Does not give as close of a shave as my previous Norelco.  Put new blades in but it didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> great to not have to replace the shole machine, but very EXPENSIVE by comparison...</li>
            <li> A bit expensive but it does the job.</li>
            <li> very easy to replace. I waited too long to change my blades, and when I finally did, I could tell a major difference.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery, as advertised; completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I know this sounds crazy, but my replaceement doesn&#x27;t seem to cut nearly as well as the original did in the beginning. Don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll last as long.</li>
            <li> perfect fit, fast shipping</li>
            <li> WHEN I RECEIVED,BOX WAS OPENED NOT IN SEALED PACK AND QUALITY IS NOT AS LIKE ORIGINAL.</li>
            <li> Item satisfied my needs.</li>
            <li> it wasnt I specting...</li>
            <li> worked well after a somewhat difficult instillation.</li>
            <li> These are OEM products. Great that I can still get them thru Amazon!</li>
            <li> Razor is as good as new.</li>
            <li> They arrived as scheduled, were very easy to install and they work great.  Ordering them was easy as well. Thanks.</li>
            <li> my old header broke a few weeks ago, I had a older model, this new header has greatly improved my shaving experience. I m having a cleaner shave comparing to the old header.</li>
            <li> What a difference the new heads made in my favorite razor.  I&#x27;m getting that close shave again we all love.  Easy to instal with no tools.</li>
            <li> What a difference new blades work!  They&#x27;re right, replace your heads every year!  Sometimes I forget to purchase the replacements in a timely manner, and I sure notice a difference in the shave once I do get the new ones!</li>
            <li> to get a good shave, you must replace heads periodically. these replacements, although a little pricey, work well. I would use them again</li>
            <li> Just like having a new shaver. Only takes a few minutes to change them out, and you&#x27;re back in business just like on day one.</li>
            <li> I purchased these replacement heads for my Philips Norelco shaver.  I installed the heads in about 1 minute and I was off and running.  I feel like I just bought a new razor!  I wish I had done this a year ago!</li>
            <li> Saves the cost of a new razor. Fits perfectly / cut like new if not better /  simple to change</li>
            <li> After changing the heads I get a nice clean shave! They were easy to install, it took about 3 minutes</li>
            <li> This is an easy and value way of replacing the shaver heads. I keep an extra set on hand for quick replacement.</li>
            <li> These heads seem to work pretty well.  I purchased them for a Norelco 7310XL and I am enjoying much less razor burn these days. Replacing the heads was pretty painless and I&#x27;ll probably get another pair when the ones I have wear out.</li>
            <li> It is sharp, new, and easily installed in my old razor....yada yada yada more words required.....good buy, but now Michigan is calling for sales tax to be TAKEN from us.......politicians are corrupt</li>
            <li> Best pricing around with free shipping and $5.00 off coupon at time I purchased it.  Norelco has always made a quality product.  I guess that is why they sell more electric shavers than anyone else.</li>
            <li> Read it if you have to for school. I would not recommend it otherwise. It is hard to stay focused on.</li>
            <li> nice razor however the heads do not seem to last very long, this is the third set of replacement heads for this razor and the replacement heads are about 65% of the cost of a replacement razor</li>
            <li> I think these things are a bit expensive considering for about 10 bucks more you can get a new shaver with same heads. (Maybe not a great shaver but still with same heads a whole unit..)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise new heads work great. I had my old ones for about 1.5 years and figured was time to replace them lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a $49 shaver so will be interesting to see how long these heads last or if shaver or battery die out first and make me get a new shaver.</li>
            <li> The part did what it was intended to and saved me from having to buy an new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;jj in stow</li>
            <li> I bought the blazes for my man and they work great thank u so much for your help it was the easiest way to order and u were fast.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, it works as expected. I wish someone designed a working sharpener for it. The one I saw didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> dubious about the replacement heads since they&#x27;re not inexpensive, as one would expect--  but pleasantly surprised with these-- works perfectly and have a &#x27;new&#x27; razor all over again!  btw... take the time to properly &amp; thoroughly disassemble and clean the heads, etc and all areas of the razor regularly--  the life of the razor is a direct reflection of it!</li>
            <li> after replacing the old blades, the shaving is cleaner and it is a bit quicker to get the job done</li>
            <li> Got this for my pouting husband when we realized we couldn&#x27;t afford a new shaver right now.  He&#x27;s extremely happy and so am I.</li>
            <li> The razor is two years old, should have bought them a year ago. The&lt;br /&gt;razor cuts like new and my face thanks y&#x27;all.</li>
            <li> The shaver itself has the advantage over rechargeable of a lighter mass. The replacement heads worked fine but worked noticeably better at first than after a few shaves.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace the worn out heads on my razor, I looked up the number I needed, searched the Amazon listings and ordered it.  The parts were delivered as ordered.</li>
            <li> Have been using this razor &amp; replace the heads as needed. Always been buying norelco brand razors if I need to replace the one I&#x27;m using. Provides me with a good shave.</li>
            <li> I had a Phillips electric razor and blades was worn out.  After i replaced this new head, it totally worked better.  Should get this.</li>
            <li> Replaced the heads and it made 100% difference. Razor is like new again. Don&#x27;t buy a new razor, just replace the heads.</li>
            <li> Replaced the original shaver heads in my shaver and it worked like new. While I wonder if purchasing the heads was actually cheaper than finding a new shaver on sale. Works now for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always tough describing a very subjective issue but, in this case, these Replacement Heads just don&#x27;t seem to shave as close or as smoothly as I would have anticipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the shaver for several years and other replacements have been OK not this one however!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;maybe this is not an OEM type product.</li>
            <li> Received expeditiously. Product as advertised.</li>
            <li> I went WAY to long without changing the heads on my razor. More often than not I was ripping hairs out instead of cutting them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally replaced the heads and the difference in amazing. Smoother, closer shave and no more ripping hairs! I&#x27;m definitely going to start replacing them more often now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These heads were the exact kind for my razor, just toss out the old ones, drop in the new ones and you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> This product was just as stated and delivered on time. I do wish I would have bought the pink curtain buttons to go with it right away though. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Never realized how much of a difference new blades would make.  I wish I would have bought these sooner.  The item shipped very fast and are working excellent.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Norelco recommends replacement of the blade heads every year.  My razor seemed to be shaving less well after about that time, so I shopped for the least expensive set and these were it.  They work just fine. I will be buying another set soon since year two has turned the corner.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the high price replacement blades, this time of year with price match and coupons you can get a break even deal to at least keep the razor you are used to.  The surprise that the replacement blades offered the \\&quot;precision cut\\&quot; was great. Overall I like the razor which is the 7310, not flashy by all means but, gets it done.  The other thing that made my decision was that the 7310 offers the corded and cordless use, if it were one of the models that only allowed you to use as cordless I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased the replacements. No use having new blades if the battery croaks.</li>
            <li> PRO: They are replacement heads, they fit, and they do work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON: They do not work well.  The old heads that are several years old give a smoother shave than these new heads.  This was even after trying them for a couple of weeks to make sure my face got used to them.  The shave was still not smooth, and when I put the old heads on, the shave was closer and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: these replacement heads are not better than old heads.</li>
            <li> I need a RQ12 replacement head but the negative reviews bothered me. Looking closely, I realized that many of the new product photos illustrated labels indicating HQ9, HQ8 or some other blade number which, I assume, fit. THEY ARE NOT REPLACEMENT BLADES. Just similar blades that fit.</li>
            <li> These replacements are marketed as suitable for use with the 73XX series shavers. I have a 7310 and they do not fit this unit.</li>
            <li> All though i was expecting the &amp;#34;complete &amp;#34; head as shown!!! What i recieved  was  3 seperate blades that was difficult to install:(!!  Once finally installed they were a plesure to  use:)Yes i would puRchase them again.</li>
            <li> always a reliable product ( for 25 years)</li>
            <li> great replacement, you can really tell the difference. It feels smoother and it trims the facial hair much better.</li>
            <li> these work fine, but a bit high cost for me</li>
            <li> The old razor can normal use.</li>
            <li> Fit just right and work great</li>
            <li> Great, considering I haven&#x27;t changed the heads in my razor for some time (about 5 years), it&#x27;s amazing what new heads will do for a shave.  It was a good deal.</li>
            <li> product was as advertised, new and from Norelco.  Delivered in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> fast shipping,works great.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re replacement blades.  They work well. It&#x27;s easy to forget how much faster shaving is when you have fresh heads in your razor after 6 months or a year, so in case you have forgotten... it should only take you 2 minutes or so.  If you&#x27;re stretching into 10, like I was, purchase now...</li>
            <li> These replacement heads were a perfect fit for my older Norelco 7310XL razor. They restored the cutting action to good as new and the razor once again shaves clean and smooth as it should. The heads seem to be made as well as the original ones were, so overall I&#x27;m quite happy with them.</li>
            <li> Nice to have new blades again. Reasonable in price also.</li>
            <li> There work really well.</li>
            <li> Have been using Norelco for over 35 years. Either my beard is getting tougher or the blades get dull earlier, but these are the best i have found.</li>
            <li> I use a razor that has these heads. I bought a new set to replace my others. I almost wonder if I even needed to do it. But I can tell my shaves are a little closer now.  In other words. I&#x27;m good with the replacement heads. They do the job.</li>
            <li> Great product recommended!  would buy again!!</li>
            <li> These blades were easy to install and were an exact replacement for my original blades.  So far they are performing well even though they do not give as close of a shave as I would like.  I have tried them both dry and wet shaving.  The wet shave seems to work better for me and my beard.  Not recommended for anyone seeking a non-electric manual blade shaving experience, but it does give a fast acceptable shave at home or for travel.</li>
            <li> They come with directions on how to change them so the new ones were installed in about a minute. The new ones run much quieter and ct quite well.</li>
            <li> Great Price! Arrived fast and is the exact replacement for the shaver</li>
            <li> Good price and fast shipping.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> These came at a good price.</li>
            <li> Arrived very fast and worked fine. No problems cuts real clean.Good replacement electric razor replacement blades fot the Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li> Always good to be prepared with replacement parts  and happy to find these at a reasonable price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What more could we ask for</li>
            <li> The HQ8 shaver heads met all expectations and were shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Love my new blades. I always neglect to change my blades at the recommend time and always appreciate it when I do.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it didm´t work. My machine a Philishave 4826 obviously too old  - ca 25 years</li>
            <li> Gives good electircal shave</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that the photo shows the heads installed and I was taken back a bit that they are separate units. After thinking about it for a while I realized that &#x27;s the way they should be?</li>
            <li> The heads fit perfectly.  This model was recommended by the manufacturer for my shaver.  However, the results are not great.  I have to shave over and over again on the same areas in order to achieve a passable shave.  Under the chin is especially time consuming.  I had used HQ6 before seeing that the HQ8 were the ones to use.  They seem to be no better than the HQ6.  I am disappointed since I was expecting a considerable change for the good.</li>
            <li> They still don&#x27;t shave as close as I would like them to.  Maybe Norelco isn&#x27;t the best shaver.</li>
            <li> It replaces the razor heads and gets a much better and closer shaves.  I reconmend to order the replacement heads for every man especially using an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> not as bright as I thought they would be.</li>
            <li> Norelco shaver blades works like original  ones</li>
            <li> Like most users, after using an electric razor month after month, you just forget how old the blades really are. Sure they get rid of the stubble and ok, it may take a little longer with the passing months, but gee didn&#x27;t I just get new blades less than a year ago?  Usually it&#x27;s more like 2 years as in my case.  New head makes the shave lots easier and takes less time. Worth the $20+.  As for the guy that said his shave was worse with the new heads, perhaps he didn&#x27;t seat them properly.  The housing screen surrounding each rotary blade must seat fully. There 2 tiny angles that fit precisely into the housing.  Otherwise the blades can&#x27;t do their job properly.  I had that issue several years ago with a previous model although this one is engineered similarly.  Once I discover the issue, it hasn&#x27;t happened again.  Do it with good lighting and not first thing in the morning when your eyes haven&#x27;t adjusted to the world. Great razor.  My only caveat should you need a new razor and not just replacement heads, go with the model that is made in The Nederlands.  Avoid the Chinese, Mexican, etc models.  They cost a little more but are worth it for durability and longevity IMVHO.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find an electric razor that can provide as close a shave as the disposable razors in the same amount of time.  I actually have not used these as I have boxed up the razor and put it on the shelf and returned to the good ole disposable razors.  I get a much closer shave in a lot less time.</li>
            <li> I got a clean shave for the first four or five months, then the shaver started to leave stubble and individual whiskers more frequently as the days went by. I do not have a heavy beard and only shave once a day. Was hoping to get closer to a year before having to replace the blades.</li>
            <li> If your razor is over 2 years old, I highly recommend replacing the blades to make it work like new again.</li>
            <li> A clean shave is now possible again.  Just what was needed by the old shaver.  Less expensive than a new shaver.</li>
            <li> I am a long time electric razor user and this product meets my needs.  I highly recommend these replacement heads.</li>
            <li> The product was received promptly and was what I expected at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;4 Stars is as high as I rate such objects.  I am totally satisfied with the product, but I wouldn&#x27;t say I &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; it.</li>
            <li> does what it should, pretty close shave for an electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-not getting red irritation marks on my neck anymore&lt;br /&gt;-they are nice and fast&lt;br /&gt;-they do the job!</li>
            <li> Excellent price and works as expected. Original replacement head...Not an after market product arrived in two days in original packaging.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with these replacement heads, made in The Netherlands. They fit my shaver well and were a little rough after the initial install (felt scratchy), but have slowly wore in so they are feeling smoother by the day.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s razor blades started chewing up his neck!  Instead of just tossing his razor I was able to find these blades on Amazon and they worked perfectly.  Now we are back in business!</li>
            <li> Great item for the price!  Would buy more in the future. My friend recommended these to me. Might be better to but 2 or three sets next time.</li>
            <li> Yes, I would recommend this product to everyone who needs to shave!...and there are many, MANY people who should and do need to svave</li>
            <li> Works well. You don&#x27;t know what you are missing till you put new heads on your razor. Replacements fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> Purchased these for my husbands shaver. It&#x27;s a little older so they are hard to find. They are exactly what I wanted and they came fast.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. He had just shaved and I said &amp;#34;whiskers&amp;#34;. He didn&#x27;t realize how bad his old blades were.</li>
            <li> Ther just blades they were sihipped quickly and fit my razor of course. Good Buy, good, good, good, good, good</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how dull my electric razor heads where until I bought and used these replacement heads.  Smooth close shave and no pulling.  I wish I&#x27;d replaced my old heads sooner.  Makes a big difference.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Works fine, absolutely no problems</li>
            <li> Nothing like &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> second time buying the replacement heads from here - best price found, came as shown and working well since replaced</li>
            <li> I was very happy to find these listed here!!&lt;br /&gt;These SAME heads cost 50% MORE at the big-boxW store that I first bought the shaver from!</li>
            <li> The new heads really did improve the comfort level of shaving.  The recommendation to replace the heads after 1 year is spot on.</li>
            <li> These shaving heads give a very closer shave than the ones that came with my razor when I bought it.  I&#x27;d highly recommend them to others.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads worked like a new razor for less cost. Would do this again when needed. Hard to beat the value.</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace the blades on my husband&#x27;s shaver and I think the shaver is flawed or these replacements.  It&#x27;s not the perfect close shave because it misses hairs here and there.  I&#x27;ll probably invest in a better shaver soon instead.</li>
            <li> I have not used this yet but wanted to get a set of extra heads so i can change them out in a year. Hope they do as good as the originals.</li>
            <li> My husband needed replacement heads for his Norelco shaver that we couldn&#x27;t find here on our Army post in Germany. We were happy to shop through Amazon for a great price, and the heads worked better than his original ones. Very happy, will buy again.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads fit and work. Maybe it&#x27;s just me but they don&#x27;t seem to cut as smoothly as the original. It feels like a rougher, tougher cut. Next time, I&#x27;ll just bit the bullet and buy a whole new shaver.</li>
            <li> Fits as it was suppose to and I received it in a timely manner</li>
            <li> The replacement heads are just what my husband needed.  It was so nice not to have to buy a complete new razor.</li>
            <li> this was shipped to me on time and they work perfect they fit my razor as advertised Im very happy with this product</li>
            <li> received in good condition .</li>
            <li> muy buena calidad de las hojas de repuesto. se recomienda cambiar las hojas cada año, por lo cual resulta muy practico comprar este repuesto junto con la afeitadora.</li>
            <li> This product is available in the local stores.  The product is also available on amazon.  I got fast service and did not have to fight the Christmas crowds to get what the manufacturer recommends.  I was not sure I needed to replace the heads after 1year,  but I do get a better shave after the change.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and work well.</li>
            <li> Their the same as the orginal and give a great shave</li>
            <li> Fits well, now cuts like a new one.</li>
            <li> Got these as backups for my razor not knowing how long the originals would last. Originals still going strong in 3 years.</li>
            <li> The new heads work really great!&lt;br /&gt;Wish I had found the site earlier; that would have saved my face from scrapes. I have another razor of the same type and will be ordering heads for it also.</li>
            <li> This are pretty expensive compared to the price of the complete unit, but the Norelcos I have have been going strong for about three years. (For about $40.) and this replacement heads really do last about a year. Cheap here on Amazon.com too.</li>
            <li> it fit and its ok don tthink ill by again since a nerelco razor is just a few dollars more</li>
            <li> i love them they are kust what i have been needing and were exactly what i wanted and the fit my shaver and works perfect</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Easy installation.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a better closer shave. This head takes several passes and still leaves stubbles.</li>
            <li> perfect and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Great value. Arrived fast.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and was easy to install. A great replacement part.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and is cutting whiskers instead of pushing them into the skin.</li>
            <li> Works great and nice price.</li>
            <li> disappointed not better in getting a shave</li>
            <li> I ordered these new shaver heard for my Norelco shaver,they shipped fast and came earlier than expected they fit in the razor perfectly and I get a great shave like I did when it was new,great price and good seller</li>
            <li> These heads work ell in my Norelco razor. The razor itself makes replacement a bit difficult - I have trouble properly seating the replacement heads - but once in place they work fine and provide a close shave..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these almost every day for almost a year now, with a Philips AT750/20 Aqua Touch. It might take a couple of minutes now to reach that stage where no trace of facial hair can be felt, which is longer time than it used to, but still awesome.</li>
            <li> My Norelco 7110XL razor wouldn&#x27;t do its job of trimming my bread anymore. I think the original heads were cheap versions that they put into razors just to sell them at a lower price point. Most of my razors in the past seem to wear out before the heads go bad. I replaced them with these and they are super sharp, better than when the razor was new. These have two small tabs that will let you put the heads in only in a certain way, so look for that, as the original heads did not have the tabs, even though the razor is set up to accommodate them. They are made in the Netherlands, so I&#x27;m hoping I can get a long life out of them..</li>
            <li> came on time and works very smoothly</li>
            <li> I like the Norelco, but the heads are pretty darned expensive.</li>
            <li> i was very happy with it.</li>
            <li> REPLACED OLD HEADS AND IT IS LIKE A NEW SHAVER</li>
            <li> Great to purchase new heads for such a great price - postponing complete razor purchase for yet another year. They work great!</li>
            <li> great product and seller AAA</li>
            <li> Good clean smooth shave, and I&#x27;m african-american. Not to be racist, but it works for us as well, without a lot of shaving bumps either</li>
            <li> Very Happy with this replacement Philco Norelco HQ8 Spectra Tripleheader Replacement Head.  It has made my razor like new again</li>
            <li> Working for the US Army, not shaving is not an option.  But fresh blades in this jobber really makes a difference.  Instead of pulling my hair out, it cuts it off now, and that is a pleasant difference.</li>
            <li> With the change to new Dual heads I now have a like new shaver.</li>
            <li> they fit perfect. i am now clean shaven. i can really tell that my old blades needed to be replaced. i should have replaced my blades sooner.</li>
            <li> these were a gift for my dad he likes them i&#x27;m sure thanks for a quickshipment</li>
            <li> it almost fits my norelco 76xx razor.  It works for the most part, but if I put pressure on the heads when I shave it starts rattling and skipping.  My norelco is listed as a compatible razor for these blades.  For this price, purchasing a manufacture&#x27;s replacement shouldn&#x27;t have any issues.</li>
            <li> I started to notice that my 13 month old Norelco was not shaving my face as close as it used to. I bought new these new heads and immediatly noticed the shave was as close as when the shaver was brand new. If you notice your shave is not as close as it used to be, buy Norelco replacement heads, no substitutions/knock offs</li>
            <li> arrived in a few days...quite timely and it took me about a minute to switch them out with the old ones...very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> These blades are a must for quick clean shaves with an electric shaver. Having blades set up for automatic periodic shipping is great to remind you that you need to change them on some regular basis to continue to get good results from your shaver.</li>
            <li> Needed replacement heads for my Norelco.</li>
            <li> After a while dull blades give a bad shave, replace them and enjoy the close shave you had when you first bought your shaver</li>
            <li> Made my razor like new again. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Perfect, works as expected</li>
            <li> Put the heads on and shaved very well. Satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li> Shipped and delivered as promised.</li>
            <li> When I received them I was a bit concerned since the number of cutting blades per head was about half of the original heads.  Thought I got a cheap knock-off or something and not genuine parts.  Checked packaging very closely and appears to be genuine product.  Guess they changed the design.  Anyway, they seem to be working just fine.</li>
            <li> Just what was expected.</li>
            <li> This is the second set of Norelco HQ8 Replacement Heads I have purchased from Amazon for mu older Norelco Spectra 8890XL shaver. Even when new, the replacement heads don&#x27;t seem to cut as quickly nor as closely as the heads that came with the shaver when I purchased it. Since there is no other alternative, I will continue using these replacement heads until I need to replace my shaver with a new one (probably not another Norelco, as they no longer get best reviews by Consumer Reports).</li>
            <li> O.E.M. just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Easy drop-in fit to my 5 year old Norelco shaver. Brought it back to like new again.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted.  I&#x27;m happy with Norelco&#x27;s replacement practice.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Norelco razor for years ...so the replacement blades continues to make a GREAT razor!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality.  Perfect fit....</li>
            <li> Replacing the originals as recommended after almost exactly one year, these made a huge improvement in the quality and feel of my shave. One thing that should be noted: I expected to receive a single triangular frame containing the three heads as the illustration implies. What you actually get is the three circular shaving heads as separate items that must be installed individually in the shaver. It&#x27;s not difficult to do but takes a little more finger dexterity than I expected. Each circular head has little tabs on its edge so that it can only be installed in one orientation. It can&#x27;t be done wrong, but you have to watch what you&#x27;re doing to do it right. The improvement in shaving performance was tremendous - almost beyond the performance of the brand new shaver.</li>
            <li> Hard to replace, no proper instruction given</li>
            <li> I decided to get a new replacement head under DURESS!!! (not my idea)  After being in the hospital for 5 days due to a blood clot in my right lung I was excited to go home.  BUT the first item on my HOME list-shave with an electric razor (to avoid nicks with a straight razor)  I haven&#x27;t used an electric razor for nearly 5 yrs!!!! It never shaves close enough-so I had changed to shaving with a hand triple edge razor.  I dug out the old electric razor (7-8 yrs old) my wife explained that she had seen ads for new replacement heads-so to AMAZON she went.  Sure enough-she found and ordered the right one.  While waiting for the shipment to arrive I picked up some \\&quot;Willams Electric Shave\\&quot; when picking up prescriptions. As soon as the replacement head arrived, and was (easily) replaced in under 5 minutes.    WOW!!  UNBELIEVABLE!!  The closest shave I have had in at least week................reading the small print \\&quot;should be replaced AT LEAST every 12 mos\\&quot;  I have used daily for 30 days, and have had no problems.  Easy all the way around.</li>
            <li> Brand new, excellent price, no surprises, good packaging, product was as described, no problems, clean and smooth transaction.  I recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> These are very good heads for the razor.  Nice to have more than one on hand to be able to change them when needed.</li>
            <li> appears to be appropriatly priced, but more important they are available for replacement for the cheap enough price. Able to get more use from it, rather than disposable. Whole lot cheaper than blades.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping--Love Prime! It was just what we ordered, not to exciting of item, but was just what he needed for his razor!</li>
            <li> Buenas tardes, alguien me pudiera aconsejar en un Philips Norelco Spectra Tripleheader Replacement Heads para una Philips Norelco 7340 Men&#x27;s Shaving System.!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good afternoon, someone could advise me on a Philips Norelco Spectra Replacement Heads Tripleheader for Philips Norelco 7340 Men&#x27;s Shaving System.!</li>
            <li> Works great and the price is good.  However, I deducted a star for the misleading pictures.  The pictures imply that you are getting the 3 replacement heads and the blue plastic retainer.  But you only get the 3 cutting heads.</li>
            <li> This item was delivered on time to Afghanistan. I use the product every day with no problems. It gives me a clean close comfortable shave. I worked out of the box and still performs like new.</li>
            <li> These work worse than the old ones with over a year of use. Not happy with this purchase. Thumbs down.</li>
            <li> I received the shaver head replacement in February. Used daily on my face and neck. Near the end of May the blades began to feel dull and leave much more hair stuble on my face and neck. Worked well initially, but closeness of shave fell noticeably after 4 months of use. Original shaving heads lasted 10 months, and were probably noticeably dull after 9. This was the first time I replaced the heads and hoped they would last about a year which is in line with Norelco recommended annual replacement.&lt;br /&gt;Shaver is model 7340XL, which works fine with new heads, but if I need to replace heads 3 times a year then this is not a worthwhile product.</li>
            <li> Fit razor perfectly, and had trouble finding locally so this fit the bill exactly.  Gift for my husband for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Exactly what my husband needed instead of buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat disappointed in these replacement blades.  They arrived fine and on time.  They were easy to install (replace) on my razor.  The low rating is for the splotchy shave.  It is not as good as it was with previous replacement blades - which I was happy with.  I will not re-order.</li>
            <li> Works like new. Easy to replace. It is the only one available for this razor, too expensive - half the price of the razor itself.</li>
            <li> Great replacement for my old shaver that still works.</li>
            <li> Awesome sauce here! havnt replaced my blades in about 6 years this was amazing! should have done it way sooner.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product. I was considering to buy a new shaver but after I found this option at Amazon I changed my mind and I am very happy saving money. That is why I recommend the product.</li>
            <li> Fantastic price.Amazon beat everybody by 8.00 dollars.</li>
            <li> Does a pretty clean shave for the first 6/7 months then the blade needs to be changed. Not sure I would buy another Norelco?!</li>
            <li> this package only contains the blades not the entire head piece. the blades were easy to change, by follow the instructions on the box. works great&#x27; couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product.</li>
            <li> This served as a gift to a family member.  Our last set of blades lasted nearly seven months, and we have every reason to believe that we will get equivalent service from this purchase.</li>
            <li> love this razor head - my husband is in a nursing home and he has to use an electric shaver - I bought these heads and they work wonderful - he has limited use of one hand so I needed something that would work for him.  This did the trick:)</li>
            <li> This was my first replacement for my Philips Norelco .  I really like the product and the replacement of the blades was very easy.  Everything works like new.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with the replacement blades.  Just make sure you get the correct Product number on the Blades.  Your Norelco Instruction book will give you that.  Amazon should have all the blades for your convenience.</li>
            <li> Very satisfactory product.</li>
            <li> According to my husband, these are working well.</li>
            <li> MY HUSBAND HAS USED THESE REPLACEMENTS PREVIOUSLY, AND THIS WAS THE BEST PRICE!!</li>
            <li> On the plus side, I&#x27;m glad to have sharper blades in my electric razor again.  Shaving is quicker than it had been for the past couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the down side?  It feels like one little blades digs out a little further than the others.  I get this little &amp;#34;ping&amp;#34; feeling as I&#x27;m shaving.  It hasn&#x27;t cut me, but feels like a little needle poke from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other down side is don&#x27;t purchase these at their full retail price.  I think my original electric razor cost $15 more than the regular price of these replacements.</li>
            <li> Good and cheap.  Can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> Great to have sharp blades again.</li>
            <li> I cant say much right now since they are replacement and I dont even have my shaver for 2 months</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like getting a new shaver. I hadn&#x27;t realized how bad my shaving action was until I put the new cutters in. Great.</li>
            <li> Loved that they got my father&#x27;s old razor working again (sentimental value), but could&#x27;ve almost bought a new Norelco for the price.</li>
            <li> Does what it does nothing more nothing less</li>
            <li> Great price, and a quality shaver head.</li>
            <li> Gives a close shave without cutting your face!</li>
            <li> The blades work well but they fall out of the frame too easily.</li>
            <li> Received with no problem&#x27;s</li>
            <li> good replacement cost</li>
            <li> better shave than non-Norelco products.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s to say....They work like the originals.  Going on 10 years with my razor.  Fresh blades keep it working like new.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast&lt;br /&gt;perfect for my husband&#x27;s razor</li>
            <li> These replacement blades are so expensive.  But you dont realize how dull your razor has gotten until you put in the new ones.  wow!  These fit my Norelco Aquatec.</li>
            <li> Works well it makes the raizer into a new instrument I could not believe how well it now works this is a ten year old razor</li>
            <li> I needed replacement heads for my husband&#x27;s electric shaver.  The right product at the right price and with tiumely delivery what could be better!</li>
            <li> la experiencia con este tipo de equipos me a sido muy satisfactoria pues mi cara es muy sensible y las hojas normales desechables me provocaban gran irritación así que con la maquina eléctrica combinada con los nuevos cabezales consigo obtener un mayor nivel de confort y la seguridad de no tener irritaciones, limpio y suave como debe ser una rasurada.</li>
            <li> Exact factory replacement at the exact factory replacement costs.  Priced similarly to printer cartridges and toothbrush replacement heads!  They cost as much as the entire printer/shaver/toothbrush itself!</li>
            <li> your shave will be closer and cleaner but comparing the new babies to my 3+ year old heads, the change is not very significant. it is a pleasant change yes but if you don&#x27;t NEED them then don&#x27;t buy. might be good to have some spares though.</li>
            <li> Great cutting and smooth finish after getting these new blades. Hard to find blades in stores but found them here.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco since 1965, and I started with the two blade Norelcos.  These are pretty good blades and I suppose the theory of having two different size holes for different hairs makes sense, but it slows down the overall shave time.  I currently use HQ55, HQ8, and HQ9 and the HQ9 are the fastest and closest and, of course, the most costly.  Since the HQ8 and HQ9 are usable on any razor that is designed for either, I mix both on the same razor with 2 HQ8 blades and one HQ9.  It saves a bit of money and I get the benefits of both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch for Christmas sales and coupons.</li>
            <li> Restored my razor to nice close shaves!!</li>
            <li> Norelco replacement heads work well and shaves me very close and good, no problem installing them works in my shaver.</li>
            <li> This product was returned becouse was a rong order</li>
            <li> Good price and pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I ordered this item for my husband--he liked it so much at the first time.</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly. No problems and shaves okay. Cant tell much different than the one I replaced.</li>
            <li> I purchased replacement blades for my son. They fit the razor head perfectly.</li>
            <li> Salesman did great job, delivery perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Quality of the heads no more than just good (material, sharpness).&lt;br /&gt; I purchased the second set of heads.</li>
            <li> HERE AGAIN, ONE REPLACEMENT PART IS VERY HIGH, BUT THIS IS WHERE THEY MAKE THEIR MONEY.  IF YOU OWN THE RAZOR YOU HAVE TO REPLACE THE HEAD</li>
            <li> Pretty good price point compared to say Wal- Mart. Same product, same results. They work as they are supposed to.</li>
            <li> Had to re-install them before the blades did better than the old  ones.  Not sure what I did wrong the first time</li>
            <li> These heads last me about 6 to 9 months of daily use. It will vary depending on the coarseness of your beard. Mine is medium.&lt;br /&gt;The shave is very comfortable with no pulling.</li>
            <li> After a year, my original blades had become dull.  I ordered the replacement blades and they are actually worse than the old worn ones.  It takes me longer to &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34;, and I put that in quotation marks because I find myself just running the razor over my face twice as long as I did previously, then cleaning up afterward with a blade.  I put the originals back after a month and found myself getting a better shave.  I had hoped this would give new life to a razor that I like, but instead it now has me shopping for a new razor and a new brand.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for one of these kits for quite a while, but could not find them anywhere.  I have had my electric shaver for more than ten years and these heads were exeactly what I needed to continue achieving a close shave.  This was a good product at a fair price.  Thank you Amazon.com</li>
            <li> I bought this product before. It shipped fast, was affordable, and was easy to install. I would reccomend this product for anyone wishing to update thier cordless electric razor.</li>
            <li> I change the heads after using the old ones for years. I forgot how good they cut when they are new</li>
            <li> This product arrived as expected. They fit my husband&#x27;s Norelco razor, and gave him a great shave! He was very happy with them.</li>
            <li> Great gift. My father love it, and the price is very competitive. Thank you, will buy it in the future.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my father who is using it for last year. He has asked for replacement heads that means he likes it and intend to use it further. I am sure he must be taking the routine cleaning care as well.</li>
            <li> I have had my razor for over 6 years. I am still useing the second set of heads. This is the set I am keeping in reserve and will instal when needed.  I purchased the set I am useing now from Amazon about two years ago and they have worked great.  I am sure these will to.  I would advise anyone needing them to Get them from Amazon.  You can not beat the price.  Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Hard to find these in the local store. When I do find them, they are very pricy. Great deal buying these online.</li>
            <li> Made my razor like new.  No need to pay $50 retail.  Was going to buy a new razor till I found this.</li>
            <li> I am not sure this is worth the money.  The new heads do not turn your razor into what it was like when new.</li>
            <li> I thought at the price that these heads might not be the real thing.  But they work perfectly. Glad I found them!</li>
            <li> The original cutters on the shaver had 15 blades and the replacement cutter only has 9 blades.  It takes longer the shave but is easier to clean</li>
            <li> just needed to replace the heads, little bit expensive, for every day shave and does not give you shave irritation and extra money waste on razors.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the shave I was getting from the shaver.  The replacement heads made a tremendous improvement in the closeness of my shave.</li>
            <li> I used to just buy a new razor because Norelco charges almost as much for replacement heads as they do for a new razor when their on sale. When I found this opportunity to get these replacement heads on an automatic delivery schedule at a lower price I thought I would try them. I did not have good luck with the first set, it seem to be dull. I thought I may have mixed them up so I waited for the second set {6 Months). This set is fine and I&#x27;m hoping all future one are also fine.</li>
            <li> They are very excllent and very easy to replace and use. Gives no problems at all. Does a great job cutting your beard.</li>
            <li> Correct replacement for my son&#x27;s razor; easy to replace as well.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this from Amazon for several years.  Fits my Norelco razor.</li>
            <li> Operation A  OK  Just like new.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement set for the Norelco shaver and is just as advertised.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; article. The installed easily and they work wonderfully. The razor is back to its original pristine sharp cutting.</li>
            <li> The replacement shaver heads arrived quickly.  They fit my husband&#x27;s  shaver perfectly.  Of course, one needs to recognize that the box contains just three replacement blades for the HQ8 shaver.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and was easily installed. I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> These blades gave an old razor new life. I was worried they wouldn&#x27;t work for my Norelco 7825XL, since it wasn&#x27;t specially listed. I am happy to report they DO work for that model, and do they ever work well!</li>
            <li> It is too bad these are so expensive.</li>
            <li> Great price and service...</li>
            <li> I was assuming it was the entire piece as pictured..not just 3 individual blades</li>
            <li> As always works great.</li>
            <li> Second time I&#x27;m buying them, once a year...  Perfect fit and they stay sharp for about 30 hours of shaving.</li>
            <li> works as it should, thanks!</li>
            <li> Old reliable razor gets new life.  Nice clean shave every time.  This is the third replacement head for this ancient razor.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t seem to cut well for new. Have to go over and over same places. May have to put old blades back in.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads brought my Norelco shaver back from the dead.&lt;br /&gt;And saved me the cost of buying a new Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li> Gives me a close shave.</li>
            <li> Only a replacement part, made to do what it was originally designed for, just sharpener from what I perviously had.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how the performance of a product can go down slowly over time and you don&#x27;t notice it.  I decided to purchase new replacement heads after 6-years of use for my Norelco.  What a difference?  I will do this every few years as long as it keeps running.  Closer shave, quicker.</li>
            <li> Glad I found this one on Amazon.  Now am able to use my shaver again and it works great. Did not realize there were so many different blade types for the Norelco electric shavers</li>
            <li> He hasn&#x27;t had to use these, as they only need to be replaced every 12 months, but I didn&#x27;t want to put it off. Glad to have them, pleased with the brand and the quality. :)</li>
            <li> Good deal, had some problem installing it but once I figured it out, it was not that hard.  Less money than walmart.</li>
            <li> I have been checking this product for a Norelco Shaver for several years until I found this company.  They had a great price, a great product and service beyond belief.  And being from NHI just knew they would be a good company.</li>
            <li> needed blades and these were easy to change out adn not a ridiculous price like other replacement blades. would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> While this product wasn&#x27;t the duplicate of the head it replaced, it still works tolerably well.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a good price point for it, which saves it.</li>
            <li> and it worked perfectly.  What I wanted and it worked perfectly all good....why do I have do write so many words</li>
            <li> This was not a direct replacement as advertised. It fit fine but the shaving surface was different and took some getting used to.</li>
            <li> I owned an older norelco model for over 10 years and only chnaged blades once. served me very well. only ditched it because wife messed up blades and replacements run as much as this new norelco. so i said goodby and welcome to the new one. but what a disappointment! it felt less substancial from the very first second. the shave is a joke. I go over the same area 10 times in circles, etc &amp; all the stuff per instruction until I start getting razor burn and it still didn&#x27;t get all the stubs off. I did it for over 6 weeks now because it says you need to give it 4 weeks for the skin to get used to, etc. no change! will send it back. too bad amazon only gives full returns up to 6 weeks! guess I lost out here and wont be that patient with the next products!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this item but the change out couldn&#x27;t be easier. It is a complete replacement item and a child could do it.</li>
            <li> Price was better than local stores and product is good quality, as expected. I think this product is over-priced and that&#x27;s why I took the trouble to find it cheaper online.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I&#x27;m clean shaven again.</li>
            <li> Worked great, my husband was very happy to no longer have dull blades, and I was happy to find these and not have to replace a whole razor.</li>
            <li> This will be my third set of blades. Easy to replace. Cuts like new</li>
            <li> Works like new again.</li>
            <li> Very dull, creates a bad shave and you have to for 10 minutes to get most hairs.</li>
            <li> Package offers trivia of how many trips to the moon your blades make yearly - as a reason to replace them.  Quite a difference in closeness is evident with new blades.  Worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit and working well</li>
            <li> Great product! Great service!!</li>
            <li> Not sure the blades are new or refurbished but is improvement. Been using original blades since receiving the razor 2yrs ago.</li>
            <li> These are ordered regularly.  Very helpful to find them without running all over town.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than replacing the entire razor.  Easy to swap out with the old heads and keep your razor going providing a close shave.</li>
            <li> makes my shaver work like new</li>
            <li> Excellent item at very affordable price.</li>
            <li> replace the heads give a new life to your machine, slogan for Norelco for free 8-)</li>
            <li> Good replacement blades.</li>
            <li> second set of replacements in the last 3 years; work as expected</li>
            <li> works as they should for close new shaing</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware of how much a difference new blades made, until I got these.  Shaving now is efficient and comfortable.</li>
            <li> These are spares. but I&#x27;m happy with the Shaver.</li>
            <li> What can I say?  They fit and worked on my razor.</li>
            <li> They are razor blades. They work fine. Not much more to say...</li>
            <li> Very happy with the new cutters. You get used to taking forever to shave with blades that are four years old. It is hard to describe the change from old to new. Great!!!</li>
            <li> My fit was perfect,works quite well...  Could have been better with clearer instructions. All in All a pretty good set of replacement set of heads ..</li>
            <li> These new heads cut better than the old worn heads, but not to such a great degree.  They, also, pinch occasionally.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh, our several year old razor cuts like brand new now! These are amazing, and a ton cheaper than buying an entire new shaving system like we thought we would have to!</li>
            <li> I ordered this replacement set with my last shaver and am using it now and it is like getting a new shaver. I am glad I tried this,</li>
            <li> Norelco has been my razor of choice since the sixties.  Hasn&#x27;t let me down yet.  I get new blades every year.</li>
            <li> These new heads made my shaver like new.  I had no idea how dull my old blades were until I put these new ones in.</li>
            <li> What more can I say?  The Five Stars speak loud and clear.</li>
            <li> Shaves just like it did when it was new .</li>
            <li> Husband is happy-much cheaper than replacing the electric razor. Works like new now!</li>
            <li> This item was the OEM part.number I needed for my razor. It was a perfect fit and installed quickly. My razor is back to it&#x27;s original quality shave.</li>
            <li> My razor was not cutting the way it should so I purchased the replacement heads and am pleased with them/</li>
            <li> Works well, Best price I could find. Shipped quick. Very easy to install and made a big difference in the quality of shave.</li>
            <li> no problem putting on old razor. gives a smooth clean shave. get one for your dad or for the hubby</li>
            <li> Got my shaqver back to full throttle!</li>
            <li> Installed new heads - shaver shaves the same.  I replace them as required, but I&#x27;m beginning to think it&#x27;s all a hype to sell more heads.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads met expections. This was the first replacement since purchasing the razor new (30 months ago)&lt;br /&gt;The heads were easy to replace.&lt;br /&gt;Have always used Norelco razors.&lt;br /&gt;Gives me a clean smooth shave. My wife also uses the razor.&lt;br /&gt;Norelco a very good product.</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard so I replace NORELCO HEAD EVERY 8 MONTHS INSTEAD OF YEARLY.&lt;br /&gt;I have used Norelco for over 30 years.</li>
            <li> Delivery was very prompt, the heads fit my Norelco perfectly and installation was very easy with the instructions included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed at how much better they worked then my old heads. I won&#x27;t wait as long to replace them the next time.</li>
            <li> As the old heads became ineffective and shaving time increased, I just accepted that this was the normal ageing of the Razor. The new replacement heads work so well that the razor is now like new. I highly recommend new heads for any razor over one year old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RDC</li>
            <li> I looked all over for replacement blades for my husbands razor and finally found them on Amazon.  Not one local store carries them.</li>
            <li> I chose these blades because they are of the same band them my electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work well and I recommend them.</li>
            <li> Once I put the new blades in my razor was just like it was brand new again. nice and sharp</li>
            <li> I use relatively low-end Norelco shavers, about $30-$40 at big-box retailers. These are the recommended replacement heads for the $35 shaver I&#x27;m currently using, and they do a substantially better job than the heads that came with this shaver when it was new.</li>
            <li> This razor (Spectra 8825XL) shaves comfortably and closely. Heads mould to your facial contours and just feels great on your skin. Battery lasted an entire week when I went camping.</li>
            <li> I recommend these replacement heads. They are exact replacements for the original cutter heads. The instructions for installation are clear and easy to follow. once installed the razor shaves just as it did when new.</li>
            <li> product arrived promptly, and was exactly as advertized. just be sure that you know the model number of replacement heads that you need--a mistake I made with my initial order.</li>
            <li> I replaced the original saving heads and blades on my aquatech electric razor after the recommended 12 months and it gives a much closer more comfortable shave. I will likely replace the blades sooner next time, though even after 12 months I wasn&#x27;t getting a bad shave by any means.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Norelco razors and used them for about 15 years.  I&#x27;ve never had problems with them and frankly the main reason for not using the same razor for the whole time is that I have wanted the \\&quot;upgrades\\&quot; available in newer razors after a few years either more battery life or newer shaving head, such as the Spectra which is superior to the older styles.  Their replacement heads are very easy to change and the new heads make a significant difference in closeness.  I highly recommend that you replace the heads on an annual basis for best shaving quality/closeness and don&#x27;t take a chance with replacement heads that are not Norelco OEM products.</li>
            <li> Quick service -- two days!  Just like a new razer! &lt;br /&gt;THANKS!</li>
            <li> I had the original heads on my Norelco for a couple years and finally had enough and bought these, they advise to replace yearly and I agree with that as 2 years was too long.  Love these new, shaver feels like new again with smooth cuts.  Quick shipping on this and worth it.</li>
            <li> For years my husband used a regular razor and shaving cream, but constantly had break-up/ingrown hair problems. He HATED shaving. Not only is the Norelco Spectra awesome, everytime we replace the blades (he has very coarse facial hair, so he must replace them after 9 months), it&#x27;s like having a brand new shaver. I agree with another comment - he starts to break-out when they dull, but new blades correct the problem. I thank God for this razor. He&#x27;ll finally shave at least every other day now. (It used to be a battle to do it 1-2 times a week with the way he bled from shaving.)</li>
            <li> When you want something good for a low price, do not click on the 1st picture that pops up. Even when Amazon has it for sale. This item had a range for price to double what I paid for it on the Amazon site. I got this item at 1/2 price the retail with free 2day shipping thru Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> Replacement blades are a must. The razor will remind you about once a year which is fine in most cases. But, if you have a heavy beard or shave more than once a day, as I do, then you should replace the blades every 8 months or so. The reminder on the razor is only a suggestion, not a command. After all, it does not know when the blades get dull. So, I simply ignore the reminder and replace the blades when I feel it is necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing you must do is use the new blades for several days until they settle in and adjust to your skin. Until then you may have a little irritation. Another problem I have solved is the hair on my neck. I use to think the harder I press the razor, the better it would get those stray hairs. But, all I got was a rash. I discovered that if I simply use a very light touch and not press hard then it got those hairs much better and with no redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replace your blades at least once a year and your face with thank you.</li>
            <li> The subject razor heads arrived on schedule and are performing satisfactorily. I more or less, have a new razor for much less than the actual price of a new one.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly what I expected, at a lower price than the manufacturer&#x27;s web site.</li>
            <li> I have had Norelco razors my entire adult life, and the only way I&#x27;ve found to truly rejuvenate them, other than replacing the batteries, is to periodically replace the heads....a little spendy, but if you use this every day for 2 years, they pay for themselves with renewed comfort.</li>
            <li> I had delayed replacing the heads because I thought this was just a money-maker for the company and it didn&#x27;t make any difference.  I was surprised that it did make a noticeable improvement in the performance of my shaver.</li>
            <li> After shaving exclusively with my Norelco for nearly eight months I started to notice occasional whisker plucks (ouch!) and I wasn&#x27;t getting the close shave I was becoming acustomed to.  I decided to replace the shaving heads, regardless of Norelco&#x27;s annual replacement recommendation, to see what difference it would make.  The difference was stunning.  I again get a close, clean shave without any plucks.  For all practical purposes I have a new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m posting this review just to emphasize that Norelco&#x27;s annual replacement recommendation of your shaving heads is just that... only a recommendation and is perhaps a little bit optimistic.  I&#x27;d say to replace the heads when you start to feel that you are not getting the quality shave that you expect and you&#x27;ll probably feel like you got a new razor.</li>
            <li> I am disapointed in this product . It seems to me that the old blades cut a lot cleaner and closer than the new ones.</li>
            <li> The product had quick shipping and this is a great product. The replacement parts are easy to put in but the product is just the razor circles, not the whole head.</li>
            <li> My razor is again performing like new.  I am well satisified with these heads. They cut at least as well as the heads supplied with the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I have learned is that I can&#x27;t go a year between replacing the heads.  Fortunately Amazon now offers a program to send the item each time interval, up to 6 months, that you specify.  I signed up for this to be sure that I will get new heads every 6 months for a price below the listed price and with shipping free.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a replacement part, so there&#x27;s not much to say. Since it&#x27;s from Norelco, then it ought to work as well as the original heads.  That they do.  If you have sensitive skin, like yours truly, it will take a few sessions for it and your skin to get used to each other.  Afterwards, it works just fine.</li>
            <li> I have a feeling that this replacement heads are not as good as the one that came with my shaver.  Atleast that is how I feel.</li>
            <li> I should have paid attention to the other reviews.  I have two older Norelco shavers.  One had the HQ8 heads and the other had the HQ9.  I always felt that the HQ8 shaver worked faster than the more expensive HQ9 shaver.  Even though the HQ9 had more rings, the blades were tiny and I always finished shaving faster when I used the HQ8.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered new HQ8 heads for both shavers (they are interchangable).  When replacing the blades, I realized that, although they look identical from the top, the new heads have about 50% fewer blades than the original heads did.  After replacing the heads, both shavers are as slow as the old HQ9 shaver.  I am disappointed.  I suspect Philips Norelco cheapened the HQ8 percicely because they didn&#x27;t want their cheaper shavers working better than their more expensive products.</li>
            <li> This gave me a new shaver for a small price. You need this if your Norelco is older than several years.. Size chart very functional and easy to you.</li>
            <li> If it is a question of a new razor or a new head this makes sense but either option is pretty pricey. One of those things that you have to live with and if your face is full of little holes from a worn out head it does work to fix the problems. guess it is like the owner of a big coffee chain said: &amp;#34;if you don&#x27;t like our policies don&#x27;t buy our coffee&amp;#34;. It is the only option in town in this case.</li>
            <li> These are original Philips Norelco brand blades. I have these on subscription. They last long and work well. They are much cheaper here than in any stores I have seen them in.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads are of good quality and you can really notice the difference when shaving.  They cut real close.  They are very easy to install.  Well worth the money after your original heads get dull, especially if you want a good clean shave.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Best price best service.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using these for years and he really likes them.  They cut close and are easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I use this replacement for my Norelco shaver.  Best price available, and they seem to last a long time, especially with the Norelco spray lubricant (See my other reviews).</li>
            <li> i laugh when someone brings their norelco in to local dealer to be rehabbed... this is all they do</li>
            <li> As requested, thanks.</li>
            <li> Shaving time was back to normal , closeness was greatly improved,  Wish that I had been able to fid the replacement blades much sooner</li>
            <li> Easy to replace, get a much better shave now.</li>
            <li> It worked like new. It was easily installed.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I purchased these through Amazon because of the convenience however I found out afterwards I could have got them for the same price at Walmart. I am not impressed with the technology of electric shavers, and the fact you now have to replace the blades every year. I remember 40 years ago when a Phillips or Norelco electric razor lasted until the head wore out, not so anymore.</li>
            <li> These are excellent quality and simple to install once you get them off the plastic shipping card.  While I hate to quibble, the plastic that the heads are entombed in is ridiculously tough to cut if you don&#x27;t have super sharp scissors or a machete.  Once you get the package open you will be happy.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads went into the assembly nice and easy, and what a difference! I should have changed my heads a long time ago!</li>
            <li> made shaver run like new.</li>
            <li> I had ordered it along with my shaver 4100 as an extra pack.</li>
            <li> They do the job, but seems like quality is deteriorating like everything else these days. Hoping I just got a sub-par set</li>
            <li> good fit,  nice to get fresh blades for  a close shave</li>
            <li> THEY WERE EXACTLY WHAT WE NEEDED.  MY HUSBAND  LIKED THEM A LOT.  WORK GREAT IN HIS RAZOR  THANKS  JUDY DEBATE</li>
            <li> The quality of the trim is so bad that I had to throw this away and switch to a Braun shaver.&lt;br /&gt;The customer service is also horrible. I submitted my rebate form for refund but the never send me anything.</li>
            <li> Nice to have a sharp razor again.</li>
            <li> These cost a lot, but are still cheaper than a new razor. It took four or five shaves before I was getting smooth results again.</li>
            <li> Never failed me.  Excellent service.</li>
            <li> Its okay. Does what you need it to do. Would I recommend, well if you are looking at these blades, then you really have no other choice. LOL</li>
            <li> I have a shaved head and this works perfect for me , no more cuts and scrapes , should have done this years ago</li>
            <li> The blades works just fine. You sure don&#x27;t get what you see in the picture. All you get is the blades. I called to complain and they said they  would pass it along but my complaint must have got loss. they are still showing the same picture and you only get the blades. Truth in advertising does not ring true!!</li>
            <li> The picture shows the whole top of the shaver but the package only contains the shaving heads. Very disappointing as I needed to replace the whole top.</li>
            <li> What I needed.  They work like a charm.  Easy to put in and to clean.  Long lasting and do a wonderful job.</li>
            <li> I bought these as a replacement for some older blades I was using. My shave got 10 times sharper and closer. It didn&#x27;t cost as much as buying a new electric razor; so it was worth the replacement fee. Comfort is important when you use something like this on a daily basis. I occasionally do a clean shave with a straight razor, but this saves the hassle in the morning where time is money. Thanks for a great product Philips. Guys everywhere are saluting you.</li>
            <li> Oh what a relief it is. Now it is a pleasure to shave again. Old head was like shaving with a snow shovel. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I finally order this replacement for my shavers and I could tell the big different. I been using my shaver and have not replace any since I brought it 6 years ago. So I guess the best performance is to replace the head every 1 - 2 years. In my case I was complaining since 3 years ago but I can still live with it until 2 month ago.</li>
            <li> gives a better shave than the old blades.... Still not as close as I thought.</li>
            <li> Even though the add said these heads are for my specific Norelco, they don&#x27;t quite fit the way they are supposed to.  One of the heads wore out quickly, perhaps because the fit wasn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li> The razor heads were a perfect fit and are working fine. I have two Phillips Norelco shavers and they both work great.</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as the original blades.</li>
            <li> Easy to install as a replacement for my husbands Norelco that was past due in having blades replaced</li>
            <li> Escellent blkades - purchased Chinese off brand and was very disappointed. These blades are just fine.</li>
            <li> These were quick &amp; easy to replace, and made my old razor cut like new. I&#x27;m only sorry I waited so long to replace my old ones.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as well as the original.</li>
            <li> Renews the razor, works like new</li>
            <li> Not designed very well.</li>
            <li> Outstanding price on these heads.</li>
            <li> i always buy the brand-name for this type of item. They fit best and work best.</li>
            <li> These are replacement heads, assume they will work as well as the original.  Not time to replace one since it was just purchased.</li>
            <li> Great buy for the money. Easy to install. I didn&#x27;t realize how dull my other blades were until I replaced them. Wow! Hopefully they will last a while.</li>
            <li> Makes the razor good as new</li>
            <li> Has given good service for years.</li>
            <li> Not bad stuff been using this brand for a while</li>
            <li> Work great and good price.</li>
            <li> Good blade replacements.  I have replaced my razor blades with these replacements over 12 months ago and they still give a close shave.  I would anticipate another 6-12 months before I order another replacement set.</li>
            <li> Best deal I could find.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to replace the blades in my Norelco 7310XL. Comes with instructions on how to replace the blades and it was easy snap on and off. The blades last about 6 months and then they need to be replaced in my opinion. Will buy again but little pricey. I will probably buy up new razors when they go on sale at the end of the year.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. It turned my junky near dead rotary razor into a beard whacking machine. I should have bought these a year ago.</li>
            <li> All products worked well as advertised that I have used so far,</li>
            <li> Product as described.  Good experience</li>
            <li> Yes, It does what I expected.</li>
            <li> These heads are a exact drip-in replacement as advertised for my model.&lt;br /&gt;The blades come in the head-unit dry... so without mixing the blades 1,2,3, (my numbering- they actually look alike), because they are run-in to fit their own sockets, (don&#x27;t mix them up later when spring-cleaning), I removed the blades carefully to examine them, and after applying a very light coat of 4-In-1 sewing machine oil to each blade-unit, I reinserted the 3 blades and ran the razor. The razor hummed along like new!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In use a few time now, I feel the blades (or metal/tempering), are not exactly the same quality or edge sharpening grind, as my original &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; blades from Norelco when new. The shave is not as close and clean as expected, (same as the throw-away razors/blades, also from major old-time brand companies...outsource from China?). But overall, this was a good purchase. It quickly &amp;#34;refurbished&amp;#34; an older razor at half the cost of a new one.&lt;br /&gt;A good buy!</li>
            <li> Great Seller. Oem heads arrived quickly and as described. Thanks</li>
            <li> razor works just like new again</li>
            <li> They work fine. I have used Phillips shavers for years and have been highly been highly satisfied.</li>
            <li> these are only the inner circle inserts not the whole outer plastic piece... works great</li>
            <li> Based on the performance of the replacement heads, it would be better to put the dollars towards a new razor.</li>
            <li> Great buy !!!&lt;br /&gt;Made my 7300 series (in use since 2011) younger than ever !!!!</li>
            <li> Just what Dad needed.  Couldn&#x27;t be found in any local stores!</li>
            <li> Just what you need for the Phillps Norelco 4500 Razor.</li>
            <li> Fits and works great.</li>
            <li> My Norelco 7310XL suddenly stopped working after 5 years so I opened it up and found all three stems rotating as they should.  Suspecting the blade part somehow got mangled, I decided to purchase a new shaver.... and then I found out Norelco actually sold these replacement blades.  Changing the blade was easy and now the $30 shaver works again as new with $20 parts.  I wish the blade wasn&#x27;t so expensive but I&#x27;m quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast free delivery</li>
            <li> I get less than 30 days out of them, I think they&#x27;ve cheapened the steel.</li>
            <li> Not much to say. The item was a match to the shaver and works perfectly. I will add that I appreciate being able to order parts from home and not spend gas money going to stores that may or may not have what I need. In today&#x27;s economy, that&#x27;s a plus for me.</li>
            <li> No better buy!  Lasts at least a year with daily use.</li>
            <li> Great sharp razor heads.</li>
            <li> I choose Philips to order replacement blades for my electric razor because of reviews. I was happy to find the reviews were correct. Since I have a older Norelco, I had some questions which I sent to Philips and they returned answers the next day. Surprisingly, the price with shipping was cheaper than I would have to pay at local stores. Only a few bucks but every little bit helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades came with very detailed instructions as to installing the blades and it only took a few moments to remove the old blades and replace with the new blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will use the same replacement method when it comes time to replace the blades again.</li>
            <li> Worked right out of the box. Just make sure the cutters and heads stay together as they are matched pairs.</li>
            <li> It was OK but the one replacement blades</li>
            <li> Did what it was supposed to do.  Fairly easy to install.  Not much more to say about it than that.</li>
            <li> Good buy.  They work everytime and retain a good cutting capability.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my new blades for over a month and they&#x27;re working just as well as the ones you&#x27;d get in a brand new razor.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Product comes as shown, easy to install, and assuming its the same quality as the original ones that came with the shaver, very good durability.</li>
            <li> replacement head made my razor like new</li>
            <li> I dropped my razor and it broke one blade head. The razor will work with only two, but I wanted it back to new. However; they don&#x27;t sell the original heads.  Which is a good thing; the new ones give a close shave. It was like buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted, what a difference new heads make! I purchased these replacement heads for my 2011 Norelco 7310XL. Shaving is now more comfortable and better. The shaver&#x27;s quieter. But what really surprised me was how much faster (less time per shave) as well.</li>
            <li> I had to replace the heads with new ones and had to buy these. As soon as i got them and replaced them you can tell the difference. Sharp and cuts better and faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another good buy on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the directions the first time I bought replacement heads for my husband&#x27;s shaver and got frustrated when the blades fell out of the triangle.  Turns out, it&#x27;s pretty simple to replace the shaver heads if you look at the diagram first.  Then you&#x27;ll want to replace  every six months or so to keep the razor working well (it also helps if you wash the razor head a couple times a week).</li>
            <li> new in box , fast delivery</li>
            <li> Barely seems to make a difference in my razor.  I think I got the razor itself for the price a few years ago.  Would probably just wait for another sale next time.</li>
            <li> Just what the doctor ordered -- buying replacement heads is all you need to keep this excellent shaver doing its thing.  With annual head replacement you can&#x27;t beat this razor!</li>
            <li> New blades worse than the used blades I replaced. Shame on Norelco! I expect better from a Phillips Norelco product.</li>
            <li> Yeah, it&#x27;s Norelco. Nobody does it better. If you&#x27;re still using blades, stop being a masochist and buy an electric made by these good folks. You&#x27;ll never regret it, though you have to replace the cutting head about once a year to insure that your shave matches blade quality. Still, the price for such a replacement has come way down, and the old-fashioned way of shaving is, cost-wise and ecologically speaking, no competition at all for a Norelco.</li>
            <li> What a difference the new head makes in the electric razor.</li>
            <li> These are my husbands favorite shaver heads, I buy for him all the time.</li>
            <li> Did not fit my razor as advertised.  I used the original parts from my old razor and inserted  the new blades.  This works OK, but it would be nice if the blades were sold by themselves.</li>
            <li> Great service and product.</li>
            <li> Great. Just as ordered. Excellent!</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift and son says he loves this razor.</li>
            <li> A direct replacement part.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and works just fine on my razor. Just make sure you by the right heads for your razor type and make sure to buy the brand name Philips Norelco, and you&#x27;ll be good to go!</li>
            <li> a great improvement to what my husband was using!</li>
            <li> Great price and product!!!</li>
            <li> Expensive and don&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like them to.</li>
            <li> It works, but not as a close shave as i hoped.</li>
            <li> I usually order these annually and they last a year.</li>
            <li> You just do not know how bad your blades are until you get new ones :-)</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. It works better than stated by the Phillips people.&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Works good for a replacement shaver head.</li>
            <li> Norelco&#x27;s HQ8 replacement heads are as good as original heads that came with razor. Very easy to install. I recommend this product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s the shaver or the heads but the closeness of the shave is not as good as originally. Last set of heads lasted for almost 2 years so no issue with that.</li>
            <li> Little tiny pieces for my big hands, but over all it is not that difficult.&lt;br /&gt;My shave is now as good as new</li>
            <li> Requries some assembly. Cuts much faster and better than the old blunt ones.</li>
            <li> The item that I received does not perform up to my satisfaction,although it was in a Philips box but it seemed like a fake (poorly made) .Next time I have to be more careful on ordering such a fine item...I AM NOT HAPPY AT ALL</li>
            <li> Nothing really to say or to compare. Buy Norelco or a generic for slightly less and as with other shavers the replacement heads are too expensive.</li>
            <li> My husband has an older model so we weren&#x27;t sure if these would fit but they fit perfectly and work wonderfully!</li>
            <li> Simple pleasures, like new blades!  Feels like a new razor now.  Why don&#x27;t I do this (replace the blades) more often?</li>
            <li> I have needed to buy new heads for my razor for more than six months, just kept forgetting to look around. When I did, the local stores were so overpriced I considered buying a whole new razor. I looked here and found them at half the cost of a local purchase, so I bought two. Delivered in under 4 days to boot. Thanks for the great experience.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re original heads and fit my AT814 razor just fine. Replacement was easy, and it was cheaper than on philips&#x27; website. They&#x27;re working fine and assume they will continue to for the next year. Couldn&#x27;t expect anything more :)</li>
            <li> Does the job it was intended to do. Take your time installing the new blades or you will have pieces rolling around. Very satisfied with the shave.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco HQ8 replacement heads are a very good item in my experience. Effectively they restore the razor to new condition.&lt;br /&gt;This is the second time I have replaced the heads on two Norelco shavers. The results of shaves with the new heads is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;This product receives my highest recommendation.</li>
            <li> Great Philips quality and long life. I always used Gillette razors, but they became so expensive and dull within a week. My Phillips stays sharp and there&#x27;s no plastic going into landfill every week. Great products!</li>
            <li> To get the best shave it is essential to change blades every year (or sooner).  Norelco replacement blade restore the shave to like new condition.  These did the job.</li>
            <li> The box was kind of tore up, but no major damage. Still in the box so I do not know if heads were damaged.</li>
            <li> These blades are not nearly  as good as the ones that came with my razor.&lt;br /&gt;They left out every other blade, why, like everybody else the all mighty&lt;br /&gt;dollar. Well I would not recommend these to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Well Norelco your just like the other money hungry companies, and you just lost this&lt;br /&gt;this customer.</li>
            <li> The product is not very good quality.&lt;br /&gt;It does not shave your hair very close.&lt;br /&gt;The old Norelco blades were much better&lt;br /&gt;quality than those at present.</li>
            <li> Actually, my sister ordered these on our computor, but I did ask her, and she really liked them . Said they were at a good price and just what she wanted. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Shaves are as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt with new blades!</li>
            <li> Shaver now working like it is brand new. Wish I had ordered the new heads months ago.</li>
            <li> excellent, had purchased an off brand which were awful.  These are sharp and great.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for years. Best product out there</li>
            <li> ez to install. works like a champ.</li>
            <li> The order was exactly what my husband wanted and is very happy with the close shave he gets with this razor.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Great Price especially with the coupon.</li>
            <li> Works very well! A little expensive to the point where I was questioning myself why I shouldn&#x27;t just go buy a whole new shaver but I can&#x27;t say this doesn&#x27;t work.Just wish it was a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> old heads were original ones. I have a facial condition that is difficult to shave with several hundred bumps, My old heads were missing a lot of the whiskers so I tried replacing them and was well pleased.</li>
            <li> I had an older Norelco that I loved It fell out of my gym bag and the parts went into the street and were ruined.&lt;br /&gt;It was one of the wet dry model shavers, I found out that the newer model price was more than double what I originally payed.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I could not find these on Amazon  could not figure out the part number I went to the Norelco site but they wanted $30.00&lt;br /&gt;for the blades and $30 for the retaining clip.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back to Amazon now that I had the part numbers and found the blades for $21.00 and the retaining clip for $9.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In less than ten minutes had my saver fixed and working like new.........</li>
            <li> After using these replacement blades for several days, getting them as a Christmas gift, I came here truly expecting a lot of negative reviews. But that&#x27;s not the case. So I&#x27;m wondering...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Norelco shavers most of my adult life (I&#x27;m 62). I have a light beard so they have always worked well, though the cheaper models don&#x27;t shave as closely or don&#x27;t have the adjustments that the more expensive (and much too expensive) shavers have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before the internet, I used to take my shavers to a local repair shop to have the worn out battery replaced. I&#x27;d also have the rotary blades replaced too. It was always like getting a brand new shaver for a quarter of the cost of a new one. That was before they started manufacturing many of the models in China. But now that we can order the blades online, I put them on my Amazon Christmas list and got them a week ago. This is my first time getting them online and I have to say I&#x27;m somewhat disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the model 7810 XL shaver and on the back of the shaver it lists the HQ8 as the replacement blades. And even though the above blade chart&#x27;s page alignment is messed up, the description above says that the HQ8 blades are for the 7800 series shavers. Good so far. Well I just put them in the shaver two days ago and am pretty disappointed in the shave I&#x27;m getting. I&#x27;m having to run the shaver over the same area two to three times more often and longer than with the old worn out blades I had. I&#x27;m guessing this shouldn&#x27;t be the case. Of course, over the years things change and quality goes down. I hope this is not the case with these blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now back in the day, we used to get &amp;#34;self-sharpening&amp;#34; blades. That&#x27;s kind of a scary thought since we are putting these cutters on our faces but they do rub against the metal combs and I assumed that over a period of time they keep sharp and maybe even become sharper. I don&#x27;t know if this is the case but maybe I just got a set of bad ones. Yet, all three wouldn&#x27;t be bad would they?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that&#x27;s my experience right out of the box. I&#x27;ll keep using them and see what transpires and update the review if things improve! I hope your experience is a more positive one. Merry Christmas!t, all three wouldn&#x27;t be bad would they?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that&#x27;s my experience right out of the box. I&#x27;ll keep using them and see what transpires and update the review if things improve! I hope your experience is a more positive one. Merry Christmas!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good. It makes the shaver suvive. So that no need to pay more for a new one.</li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth I think Norelco really messed up when they went to this style of head with the holes and slots instead of just the slots. I have an old beater Norelco that has the old style heads and it shaves twice as fast if not faster and gives a much closer shave. With these new ones you pretty much rub the whiskers off instead of cutting them and if you don&#x27;t look close it leaves stray whiskers here and there. Sure the old style did pull on the longer ones but at least it cut them off. I thought these would help and they did some, maybe it takes 5 seconds less time now. My beard is fairly soft so I suppose that could be part of it but the old style worked just fine.</li>
            <li> My husband really liked this Philips razor.  He tends to \\&quot;fix\\&quot; items rather than replacing the broken item with something new,  We ordered these replacement heads and they have worked out well for the past three years.</li>
            <li> I read the item description many, many times, trying to make sure it was the correct blade replacement for my shaver model. I ordered it and received it promptly, as always, but it didn&#x27;t fit my shaver. I finally went onto the Norelco website and determined that what I had ordered was not the correct replacement blade. Return was easy, refund was prompt, but more attention to detail in the original listing would have saved everyone a little money and hassle.</li>
            <li> They do the job, but for about $15 more I think I&#x27;d rather just get a brand new razor. Not a total disappointment but I think they are overpriced.</li>
            <li> The set of heads came in on time, fit as intended, and worked great. My razor works as good as new now.</li>
            <li> These worked perfectly in my 2 y.o. shaver, and I noticed modest improvement in shaving. I don&#x27;t use my shaver that much, so maybe the old heads weren&#x27;t in bad shape. But installation took &amp;#60;2 minutes and was very intuitive.</li>
            <li> Excellant value. Packaging looked perfect, nothing torn or deformed. Fitmy razor perfectly. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> The blades are ok, but using the shaver can be a pain in the butt.  It doesn&#x27;t give a great shave</li>
            <li> Revived my old razor!</li>
            <li> Genuine replacement part as advertised. It is also a very cost effective way to get this in Australia as the retail stores sell it at more than twice the price. Fast shipping to Australia.</li>
            <li> Price was right.  Delivery was as promised.  It was a genuine Norelco product.  It replaced a 2.5 year old shaver head.  However, it doesn&#x27;t provide a shave that is any closer than the old head.</li>
            <li> forgot what a good shave you get with new heads&lt;br /&gt;gonna have to buy a new set more often&lt;br /&gt;they work great&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t find them in store so online is only option</li>
            <li> These replacement shaver heads are a better value than buying an entire new razor. As long as your razor and any rechargeable batteries are in good condition.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these replacement heads through Amazon for years. They are always in stock, always reasonably priced and super easy to install. Fast shipping too, what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> I have been an extremely satisfied customer annually purchasing this specific model of Norelco replacement heads here on Amazon since 2011. It&#x27;s just the thing that my Norelco 7810XL and 7130XL shavers need to once again be restored to like new condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And you really do notice the difference in the closeness of the shave when first replacing approximately one-year-old heads with these new razor-sharp beauties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why waste your money frequently purchasing an expensive, brand new electric shaver when all that you really need to do in most cases is replace the shaving heads/blades to notice a dramatic difference?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, where the blades meet your skin is where the action is. Full-featured (many superfluous or gimmicky) electric shavers with fancy housings costing $200.00 to $300.00 rarely provide a better shave and certainly not one that is sufficiently better to warrant the significantly higher expense of upgrading your entire electric shaver every few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These precision HQ8 heads are very simple to replace/install on the pertinent Norelco models that use them. About the only thing that needs a little bit of extra attention is ensuring that the protruding edge/notch on each of the three replacement heads fits properly into the head holder. Either take a closer look at the old heads to see how they are seated before removing them, or slowly and carefully rotate the new heads when installing them and they will eventually just drop into place when everything is properly aligned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you purchase these HQ8 dual precision replacement heads through the Amazon Subscribe and Save program and get 15% off when ordering 5 or more subscription items at one time like I do, you will spend just about $20.00 for one set of these replacement heads - a very reasonable price indeed for a what is essentially a brand new electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hermit - and especially his whiskers - recommends this item without any reservations.servations.</li>
            <li> My husband has replaced the heads in his Norelco razors for years now. Makes them last a whole lot longer.</li>
            <li> Easy to change the heads without using any tools.  It is almost in like new condition and provides a proper shave.</li>
            <li> Quality replacement heads from Norelco.  I always feel the difference after replacing the heads.  Ordering here makes it all easy and, I find, saves a few dollars along the way.</li>
            <li> Not much to say. Needed new shaver heads got a great price. Delivery was on time. Will be ordering a new set when the razor says to.</li>
            <li> They work nicely when you treat them right and take care of them.Put a smidgeon of WD-40 in the heads and run your razor every month or so...you&#x27;ll get all the glop off your blades,clean them,and sharpen them.You&#x27;ll get all the rust off,too.Then you&#x27;ll have a super-comfortable razor with super-sharp blades for a super-nice shave.</li>
            <li> These cutters just drop in and twist of the clamp you have a good as new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;This was the best deal around, and shipping.was very quick!</li>
            <li> Yes, this does what it is supposed to. But what is supposed to is kinda weak. I mean your face has to be rather dry for electric to work well (or have a fancy electric which can do wet shaving) and when your face is dry it is usually not clean. So if you want to shave after a shower, it makes it a longer process. Also, the shave is close, but not as close as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has convinced me to try wet shaving with a safety razor and I am hooked. Way closer shave, feel more manly, can shave after a shower, and it is cheaper. Now I just use my electric shaver to trim below the waist.</li>
            <li> Made in the Netherlands, not China! Far superior to original blades, made I china? I dunno all, I know is best shave yet from Norelco!</li>
            <li> Checked my local Wal-Mart and they no longer stocked these replacement blades. It&#x27;s so great to just sit at home order the product and have it delivered to you. Really Like</li>
            <li> My husband loves them.  He says they are better than the ones that came with his razor when it was purchased.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I was able to find these on amazon . I am using them &amp; he loves it that his razor is back working so he doesn&#x27;t knick his face up. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this replacement head and the price was excellent.</li>
            <li> i had no idea how expensive the heads were until i went looking at a nearby brick and mortar store which carried my razor but no replacement heads! then i went searching local stores finally found a set but for forty bucks thanks but no thanks. so i looked online with amazon and was pleasantly surprised to find these at a fraction of the price plus i was able to make use of an online coupon for another five bucks off! when we spend a hundred plus on a razor it just doesn&#x27;t make any sense not to keep it in shape and that means swapping out the heads on an annual basis. my bad for waiting so long to replace the blades. getting them here is the best imho without breaking the bank or needlessly wasting time searching the isles of brick and mortar stores trying to find heads that will fit our particular make/model of shavers.</li>
            <li> these blades made my razor perform like new.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent.</li>
            <li> Im sure they were fine but they did not fit the the razor I was buying for im it was the right one oh well</li>
            <li> This product works with my husbands shaver and he likes it.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on-time. In good condition. product was exactly what was described. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I was about to give up on my Norelco, with these new blades it is as good as new. Buy 2 sets and save on shipping.</li>
            <li> My old stock heads which had been used for 2 years work much better than those new ones. It takes me much longer time to shave with these. I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit. back to shaving with good blades.</li>
            <li> Blades are good quality.</li>
            <li> What a difference in closeness!  I should have done this earlier.  Good price compared to stores.</li>
            <li> The shaver was originally purchased in 2003. Every year I get a new set of blades and the shaver works like NEW again. Thanks Norelco.</li>
            <li> was in stock, shipped quickly, fits my razor,&amp; the price was right.  What else could I ask?g</li>
            <li> Exactly what we needed and price is better than what I can get in store.</li>
            <li> These are placement heads which do what they should do - cut better than the worn heads that were replaced.</li>
            <li> Even though Amazon and Phillips claim my shaver model will work with the HQ8 replacement heads, they won&#x27;t with the Amazon heads. Phillips said that Amazon replacement heads are not original factory equipment and they sent me a box of HQ8 replacement heads for free for the wasted time and frustration I&#x27;d encountered with the Amazon heads sent to me. I will find out the next time I change whether or not my shaver has to be abandoned, as this time I used the new blades Amazon sent me in one of 2 boxes with my old heads that I had luckily not thrown away. The blades spin fine with my old heads.  If Phillips is correct I still have a good shaver!  If they are not, like Amazon, I guess I&#x27;ll have to buy a new shaver!</li>
            <li> I received three heads for less than 2/3 rds the cost for one at Target.  They are new.  I am using the first one as a replacement and I am very pleased.  I will reorder as necessary.</li>
            <li> This product works as described! Reasonably priced and of good quality and value.  I&#x27;ve had them for a few months and still going strong! I&#x27;d buy them again!</li>
            <li> I told my wife to get me a new electric razor for Christmas. She told me no because she did just that two years ago, and it was still working OK.  If anything it just needed new blades because I was such a &amp;#34;rough, tough guy&amp;#34;. I am not so rough tough but the instruction manual on the razor told me to change blades each year, and the memory chip in it flashed &amp;#34;change blades&amp;#34;, so I ordered these blades hoping I was qualified to replace them myself.  When they came, I (for once) followed the instructions that came with them and popped out the old blades and put the new ones in.  Took me all of a half a minute. I was proud of myself.&lt;br /&gt; Now the Norelco works like new and I am a happy camper. The new blades cut close and fast as advertised.  Now my wife can get me a new car or something for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I know they could make these to last longer! How naive of me to think that they would do that.</li>
            <li> I am lucky and do not have to replace my heads often and these are working great.  I will buy them again in another year or so. :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product before and am very pleased with it. I would recommend it to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;They do last a year.</li>
            <li> It arrived as expected, on time and as described. Already used this and it works perfectly. It is a great product for the price. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> These Philips Norelco HQ8 Spectra Tripleheader razor replacement heads are ust what we wanted.  Thank you for a reliable product.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best product. Worth for price paid. I would receommend every one to buy this though there other best models from Philips.</li>
            <li> Even since my shaver installed it, become sharp and efficient.The shaver have a very good working status , just like its new.</li>
            <li> been using them for years with no complaints use to buy a new razor for a couple of bucks more than i paid for replacement blades.</li>
            <li> Rather than buying a new razor we got new blades, it was an awesome purchase because it made the razor like new again!</li>
            <li> I was in very much need to change out my blades and I own the Philips norelco 7310 and these fit just right. I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent service. It arrived on time and an excellent product; I will re-order this product as soon as I need it.</li>
            <li> i use this unit to shave my whole head!  i have a beard.  i get a clean close shave, no nicks and i have been getting a good shave out of it for about a year.  this is my third replacement and i will reorder in another year</li>
            <li> I was hoping to replace only the blades for my father in law&#x27;s razor.  Unfortunately, had to buy the entire razor head at a substantial price.  I guess that&#x27;s one way for the manufacturer to guarantee a higher profit!</li>
            <li> My rating is based more on &amp;#34;room for improvement&amp;#34; in the listing than the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may have missed it, but for those that haven&#x27;t previously bought replacement &amp;#34;heads&amp;#34; for this type of razor, &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; means the package includes both &amp;#34;cutters&amp;#34; (the part that does the cutting, that isn&#x27;t externally visible) and &amp;#34;combs&amp;#34; (the part you see while looking at it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, while the manufacturer recommends annual replacement, the &amp;#34;subscribe and save&amp;#34; option has 1-6 months only, with 4 months as &amp;#34;most common&amp;#34;, which makes that seem like a generic option and not based on the expected use of the product itself. I don&#x27;t shave &amp;#34;every day without fail&amp;#34;, so these tend to last longer than average for me anyway. It would be helpful if the options were perhaps 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 months.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and worked very well. I will buy again in the upcoming months.  Thanks for a good product and fast service.</li>
            <li> Given the price of razor blades these days I thought I would try my old electric again. I replaced the old heads with these and my old razor is back on task.</li>
            <li> Not so sharp like the old ones...but it works.</li>
            <li> These wore out after about 2 months. I ended up just having to buy a new electric razor.</li>
            <li> Wow. These did the trick made my norelco like new again. I guess over time you don&#x27;t realize how dull the blades get.</li>
            <li> It was easy to change the head and it works just fine. It gives a very close shave just like the new product.</li>
            <li> fantastic. Made it so that my dad didn&#x27;t have to buy a whole new electric razor. Pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> Bought these replacement ones for my husband razor and he loves them</li>
            <li> The replacement heads work great, but I don&#x27;t feel the cutting quality lasts very long!  As with most of the replacement heads, you begin to see a decrease in quality after about six weeks to two months.  For the price you pay for replacement heads, I feel the quality should be better.</li>
            <li> Fast service. Works  like original</li>
            <li> Purchased new blades for my Norelco shaver. As others reported they did not last as long as the original blades. After 6 mo. I replaced the shaver.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  Shipped on time.  Fit my old razor.  The quality of the razor cut has improved but it still might be time for me to get a new razor.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband and he loves it. Great product, great price, great service, fast delivery. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Great deal; cheaper than most stores; works perfectly in my husband&#x27;s older razor. I expect these blades to last for several years.</li>
            <li> Pretty easy to replace.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Been buying these for several years in a row now. I have a pretty &amp;#34;tough&amp;#34; beard growth, so I change the blades every 6 - 8 months. Well pleased.</li>
            <li> This was a disappointment, after a quarter century of using Norelco shavers. I should have keep the old one.</li>
            <li> I used the Philips Norelco HQ8 Spectra replacement heads for my 1-year-old Philips Norelco 7310XL shaver. Please be advised, you should check to see which replacement heads your specific shaver uses before buying these. I used the manual I downloaded from the Philips Norelco web site to check for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These heads shave much closer and smoother than the original heads that came with my shaver! As an added bonus, the closer shave did not involve even minor skin irritation. Wonderful! The new heads are very easy to install. I highly recommend these replacement heads to anyone wanting to keep their old shaver but, experience a like-new shave.</li>
            <li> great buy works just fine</li>
            <li> Always happy with this shaver and the replacements.</li>
            <li> Bought these with the razor and they are great. Work better than the ones that came installed on it. Long-lasting.</li>
            <li> Very good product; it works well for me.</li>
            <li> VERY HARD TO INSTALL . COMES THREE PIECES NOT IN HEAD .</li>
            <li> Norelco is a fine brand of electric shaver and these replacement heads do a fine job. I am glad I used them.</li>
            <li> Electric shaver performance restored to &amp;#34;New&amp;#34; !</li>
            <li> Works perfect. Better price that CVS.</li>
            <li> They made my husbands razor new again!</li>
            <li> These heads are genuine Norelco heads and are a direct replacement.  They are easy to change and make a perfectly good shaver ready to use again.  The price at Amazon was much better than I could find at a local store and as usual the service was superb.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> works as good as originals</li>
            <li> I know that they are just replacement head, but I think this is a quality product. Great deal and low price</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for:  it barely outlasted it&#x27;s warranty. And blades were hard to change, flimsy.</li>
            <li> Replaced heads and although does shave closer, it also drags - at lot more than the original.  Probably should have just replaced the shaver.  Replacement head costs half of the shaver cost.</li>
            <li> I hated to replace a good working Phillips Norelco shaver and the replacement heads made it work like brand new.</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve kept the old blades. The replacements, although they look original, have done a worse job than the 4 year old blades they replaced. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Once a year if your lucky, or replace original blades every eight months.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to fit into the housing, and as sharp as the original blades.</li>
            <li> Easy to replace and worked great. Saved me from buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> Were exactly what we needed and fit perfectly.  Thank you for having it available and sending it out so quickly.</li>
            <li> These replacement blades are great.  Very smooth shave and they cut precisely in a very short period of time.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased that I purchased these. Will definitely buy more when needed.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit, works great!</li>
            <li> Very easy to install and probide a good cut.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Second time I have replaced the heads--do it once a year.</li>
            <li> They work great and were twenty five percent cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li> got it for my dad, he loves his razor, fabulous</li>
            <li> The picture shown was not what I got.  I got the shaver replacement inserts not the complete replacement head.</li>
            <li> They are replacement heads for the razor I have. They work as expected.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because there&#x27;s nothing wrong with my current Norelco electric, just needed replacement heads so it would perform like it did when it was new.&lt;br /&gt;These fit and work very well. The old ones only had slots along the cutting surface but these are designed like the heads on the more expensive razors, with slots and holes, and do seem to work better than the old ones did even when they were new.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with this purchase.  I&#x27;ll continue to replace the cutting heads instead of buying a new razor as long as mine is functioning properly.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly.  Easy to change.</li>
            <li> These replacement blades do exactly what they are supposed to: restore your razor to like new condition. However, my razor never did do an extremely good job. I still have to go over and over where I am shaving to get all the hairs, and sometimes it still leaves stray hairs. I find it is much easier and cheaper to buy these blades than to buy a new razer. And if you are not going to shell our the big bucks for a fancy razor, don&#x27;t bother buying another &lt;$50 razor because these replacements essentially do the same exact thing. Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied, but I will be buying myself a better razor eventually.</li>
            <li> I bought this replacement cutting head when it was available as a deal of the day from this website.  The cost was great and my electric razor wasn&#x27;t doing its job anymore.  A few days later and I had the replacement cutting head.  It took less then 5 minutes to remove, clean and replace the cutting head with the new replacements.  Now my razor cuts as good as new.  Next time these come up as a deal of the day, I&#x27;ll buy another set as a spare.</li>
            <li> saves me so much time shaving .. good fit for my norelco and last more than a year if you maintain them</li>
            <li> My husband is satisfied.  They repair his shaver.</li>
            <li> These appear to be genuine Philips heads, &amp; the originals on the razor work great so I assume the replacements di too.</li>
            <li> I bought them to replace the old blades. They work great. The price was great too. Will buy again when needed.</li>
            <li> I was going to throw my razor away and buy a new one. These new blades solved the problem. Happy!</li>
            <li> This product did a fair job of shaving, but have to consistently go over, often several times, curing areas around upper chin to get all the stubble.  Was somewhat disappointed in the length of time it takes to shave.  Using a safety razor is much faster.</li>
            <li> Should have replaced these sooner, smooth clean shave with new blades, although a little overpriced for what you get, but a good purchase overall</li>
            <li> Fits well.  Easy to install.  Restored shaver to original condition.  Probably cost more than they should. Can use to replace HQ9.  HQ9 become dull in a few months.  HQ8 lasts years by comparison.</li>
            <li> It is only the 3 cutting heads.  It doesn&#x27;t come with the triangular frame around it.  Mine was cracked and I was looking forward to replacing it.  I now have had to glue it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor works better now.</li>
            <li> I expected a part with the three heads mounted.  Instead I had to install each head separately. It was difficult and it is not working properly.  Furthermore, the cost was excessive for what I got.</li>
            <li> fit my razor. works like new</li>
            <li> The order arrived on time and in good shape. The new blades certainly made a difference and reminded me of how much faster a shave is with sharp blades.</li>
            <li> My razor heads were about a year old and not working as well, so I found these cheaply and gave &#x27;em a try.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  The old ones were quite icktified and dull.  These run like a sewing machine.</li>
            <li> this matches the razor i got , and it looks really good. hopefully my dad would love it. thank you</li>
            <li> I bought these based on price, and they worked like they were supposed to.  I consider it a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to my next rplacement. Held up very well but after a year or so , needs to be replaced. Good product.</li>
            <li> I wish I had know about these refills a long time ago!  What a great product to revitalize an aging razor!</li>
            <li> Razor works like new.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.  Well worth the cost!</li>
            <li> New heads are a requirement for good shaving.&lt;br /&gt;They give a closer shave in much less time.&lt;br /&gt;Good value and worth while.</li>
            <li> perfect fit it makes my razor feel like its brand new &amp;#34;n my razor is three years old&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;great replacement product</li>
            <li> Fits on my Norelco razor perfectly, restores a nice sharp cut to the razor, and saves me some money over buying at the local department store!  Shipping is in a retail box, complete with installation instructions and all.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was my razor, but it seems like these blades were dull out of the package. They were no more effective than the old ones I replaced.</li>
            <li> I GET A WORSE SHAVE NOW THAN EVER BEFORE.  I FOLLOWED DIRECTIONS AND DOUBLE CHECKED EVERYTHING TWICE, BUT A GET ONLY A NOMINAL SHAVE.  I&#x27;M GOING TO REPLACE THESE HEADS WITH THE OLD ONES UNTIL I GET A NEW SHAVER.</li>
            <li> Replacing the blades [heads] every 6 - 12 months is still cheaper than purchasing a new Norelco razor. I&#x27;ve not noticed any irritation after installing new heads, just a better shave with less effort. Keep your old razor and replace the heads! You can&#x27;t go wrong! Amazon&#x27;s price for these HQ 8 Spectra replacements was the lowest I could find on the Internet. Shipped very fast!&lt;br /&gt;Thes factory-authorized replacement cutters correct these problems. They are easily installed, but you must be careful to line up the stationary part wings with the slots in the shaver head designed for them or the cutters will not allow you to close the head properly. It is a simple positioning step.&lt;br /&gt;Be very careful not to separate the movable cutters from their stationary housing, as they are carefully ground together for a perfect fit - and a good clean cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried the newer norelcos that have different screen designs and have not gotten a closer shave than with this model. The blades stay sharp for over a year! It is rare to find a product that works exactly as it is meant to and exceeds your expectations for performance and longevity. That is exactly what these norelco blades and razors do for me. I highly recommend and won&#x27;t change from this razor set.</li>
            <li> Like a New Shaver again! I  replace blades about once a year and that  helps keep a close comfortable shave from my Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with the replacement.  I can now shave in comfort.</li>
            <li> Great to get these on Amazon for Dad. He lives by his Norelco. They last quite a while.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads will make your shaver brand new again.  My only regret was that I waited a year too long to order them.</li>
            <li> With a $5 discount in addition to the much lower starting price here, I paid less than half what I would have for these locally. And yes, they came in the manufacturer&#x27;s box and are in fact Philips Norelco replacement heads. So this is my new annual ritual.</li>
            <li> Great service, good price.</li>
            <li> I HAVE PURCHASED TWO SETS OF THESE REPLACEMENT BLADES OVER THE LAST YEAR AND THEY ARE EXCELLENT. I HAVE SEEN SOME NEGATIVE REVIEWS ABOUT THE SHARPNESS, BUT I THINK THAT SOMEONE MAY NOT HAVE INSTALLED THEM CORRECTLY.  YOU HAVE TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO HOW YOU INSTALL THEM. IT IS REALLY VERY SIMPLE THOUGH. THEY ARE EXCELLENT.</li>
            <li> just fits my husbands shaver!</li>
            <li> Not a good fit for my model even though it said it was</li>
            <li> Bought these for my husbands razor. He tells me they do the job and he&#x27;s very happy with them.</li>
            <li> Saved me the price of a new razor.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Looks OK, but since these are replacement heads that I do not yet need to replace on my electric shaver, I will not know if they actually fit until it comes time to replace. However, says Norelco on the package so they should fit.</li>
            <li> Buyer be aware. Like several others, I was enticed by the excellent price. While the box might say HQ8 the head covers did not fit into my Norelco razor that was also bought (twice) from Amazon.  Something is wrong!  I&#x27;ve subsequently found other reviewers with the same complaint. I tried for nearly an hour to twist and turn these new head covers to fit into the three holes from the cutting blades. THEY DID NOT FIT AND COULD NOT BE MADE TO FIT.  I followed the solution of others, removed the the cutting blades from their covers and used the old head cover with the new blades inserted into them.  I have no idea if these are fake copies of Norelco product, or if a new factory did not follow specs. But \\&quot;Something is rotten in Denmark\\&quot;, albeit this is a supposed reputable company in the Netherlands.  I now question my second purchase of the original Norelco shaver that I bought as a gift for my new grandson-in-law. This flaw in replacements parts will seriously impact my purchase of another Norelco product.....frustration!!!  The advertised picture shows a total new razor top containing the blades, but what you receive are three blades with their head covers sealed in a plastic box. Surprised! Yes. Disappointed and frustrated they do not fit. A label HQ8 means nothing if they are not the real thing.</li>
            <li> good product for a reasonable price</li>
            <li> its norelco so the quality is in the product</li>
            <li> Works as intended.  Better than stock blades.</li>
            <li> I have been pricing these and this was the time to buy</li>
            <li> Does a noticeably better, quicker job than my original blades from a few years ago.</li>
            <li> Standard Norelco replacement part.  Fit as expected.</li>
            <li> Went together fine - shaves fine - like it should</li>
            <li> The replacement heads work just like the shaver is new. All shaver replacement heads seem a bit expensive to me. Like many people I wait too long to replace them, thinking I&#x27;ll get a few more shaves from the old heads. When I do replace them, shaving, which is a bother at best, is much faster and easier. Perhaps not replacing them sooner is as Ben Franklin said, Penny wise and Pound foolish.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with norelco products.</li>
            <li> Easily installed and providing a good close shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always a joy to go from the worn out blades to new ones, getting a quick, close shave again.</li>
            <li> It was exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> outstanding-works great with a great price.  I installed it and found it fit well and woks well.  Truly a quality produce</li>
            <li> I bought a Norelco 7180XL about 18 years ago, so it was about time to change blades.  I believe that these blades are better than the original ones.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are an exact fit for the shaver.  Price isn&#x27;t bad.  Will buy them again in a year.</li>
            <li> The first batch I bought failed and had to send back for refund. But these worked ok. they came as individual blades that you had to drop back into plac--but they still worked fine once back in.</li>
            <li> The price for these replacement heads was great. So glad I found them and did not need to get the item for the manufacturer. They worked perfectly in my son&#x27;s razor. I will definitely look here when they need replacement again.</li>
            <li> I have always liked the Phillips razor my wife purchased for me many years ago. This will be the second set of heads. The old ones wore through but was used for about 8-10 years. Nice to have the razor working again.</li>
            <li> my husband uses this.</li>
            <li> I love my Norelco And will normally order a replacement head every year. Would recommend for a close shave.</li>
            <li> It was ok. The producto is good altough it was not the same as the original, but fit well. bye</li>
            <li> To start the back bar is over the seat an I . can only  set on less then 1/2 of the seat and that is&lt;br /&gt;not save for me.&lt;br /&gt;  I did ask for a back bar that would be at least 4 inches  longer so I could use the full seat&lt;br /&gt; but so far no re reply&lt;br /&gt;can I look for a new  bar shipped ,&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;  Manford  A  Repard</li>
            <li> Great blades fast delivery.  I&#x27;m still using the same one after several months.</li>
            <li> Works great. Easy to replace. Makes a HUGE difference in the quality of the shave. I bought to replace my father&#x27;s shaver. He mentioned it took a long time to shave and it wasn&#x27;t doing a good job. I checked and found the heads hadn&#x27;t been replaced in two years. What a difference! Annual replacement is what is needed for him, and I suspect for most men who shave daily.</li>
            <li> These heads seem to work just as good as the originals and are much less expensive than those in the retail stores.</li>
            <li> I have not yet used this new shipment of heads as they will be held in reserve.  However, I previously purchased the same heads which I have used.  I am extremely satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> Just used the product and was very satisfied, just as advertised. Would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Very good, price good on one time offer. Very sharp no need to apply any pressure when shaving. Like a whole new razor, cool!</li>
            <li> We are prepared for the &amp;#34;next time&amp;#34; by purchasing the required replacement heads now and storing them in a convenient spot.</li>
            <li> These replacement blades are a godsend - hadn&#x27;t replaced the blades prior to now and it made such a difference. The blades themselves were very easy to install, and looking at the new compared to the old you&#x27;ll see why they need replacing. Been using it with the replacement blades for about 2 weeks now and not only is it taking less time to shave, i&#x27;m actually not breaking out as much either (the old blades were probably filthy). Overall great - quick shipping, great product, very happy!</li>
            <li> is good but not awesome to my shave because with 3 days is pain to do it and require to many passages that irritate my skin</li>
            <li> In order to stop annoying e-mails, this is my review on this product. Then I have to come up with at least 7 more words.</li>
            <li> It fits but does not have blades as sharp as the ones that came with the shaver.  Seems like Norelco has cheapened up the product.  Perhaps now made in China out of inferior metal.</li>
            <li> seems to be working...not sure if I should have maybe bought new one</li>
            <li> Great Blades Great Price</li>
            <li> Well, got such a good deal on the razor, and the replacement Heads were such a great price, couldn&#x27;t resist! Now my son won&#x27;t need a new set for 1.5 to 2 years!!!</li>
            <li> IT CAME QUICKLY AND PERFORMS AS NEEDED!</li>
            <li> I am sure my husband will appreciate having new heads for his razor.  He has an extremely tough beard and the heads become dull quickly.</li>
            <li> I pondered as to whether to buy the replacement heads versus buying a replacement shaver at twice the price. The heads do a great job and the battery still holds a long charge so it did turn out to be a good decision.</li>
            <li> just like I expected.</li>
            <li> Too new for me to judge as just started using the razor but see no reason not to rate it high</li>
            <li> These shaving heads really work well.  They were at a great price.  Oreded them through Amazon and got free shipping.  Wonderful deal all the way around.  Good close shave on my face.</li>
            <li> i put the heads in the day I got them they have been great</li>
            <li> Why buy bootleg replacements when you get the real deal right here at a fantastic price!</li>
            <li> They fit perfectly and make a big difference in my morning shave.  It is cheaper than getting a new razor too.</li>
            <li> A little expensive but at least it works.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again? Hmmm, think no......&lt;br /&gt;Buy a new shaver? Definitely Yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected, box was not mis-shaped or tampered with in any way. Came just specified and pop right into my razor.</li>
            <li> Worked like I had hope they would</li>
            <li> cheaper than the local store and got to have them so I buy them here. Been using Norelco since 1994 and have just had 3 of their razors in that time. Very happy with these - arrived quickly and inexpensively and fit my model exactly.</li>
            <li> These dang things are hard to find in my area .. thanks to amazon I found it. Fits and does the trick!</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with the lack of sharpness to the blades. Replacement was easy but the shaving result isn&#x27;t a whole lot better than the old heads. In fact my travel electric razor cuts smoother than my home razor with new heads.</li>
            <li> Very good price.  My husband loves his Norelco Razor so I was excited to find these at a great price.</li>
            <li> My  husband has a Norelco shaver and needed a new head.  Shipment was prompt and excellent</li>
            <li> Works like a brand new razer. The motor runs alittle slower, This i suppose because of the new tighter parts</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used the new heads yet but expect them to perform as well as the original heads. Best price around. fast delivery</li>
            <li> Bought these replacements after about a year on the originals in my Norelco razor. Same as the original ones in the razor, but new. I wouldn&#x27;t expect anything less than a year out of the replacements as well.</li>
            <li> I get good results when I use this product you get a good close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Fits perfect in the European Philips shaver and works like the original part</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for the razor.</li>
            <li> great product value arrived promptly as expected</li>
            <li> This replacement head is annoying to put on. Cost almost as new shaver. Do yourself a favor.. buy a new Philips Norelco.</li>
            <li> Makes a razor work like new.</li>
            <li> Made my razor work better</li>
            <li> Awesome product and great example that you can find anything on Amazon.  I was able to easily find and order the correct replacement head for my razor.  Arrived on time and is the correct fit.  Very happy!</li>
            <li> It fitted and works very good for replacement part.</li>
            <li> The price is the main reason I bought it! Also did not use evaluation</li>
            <li> GOT THESE THESE ARE NOT LIKE THE ONES THAT CAME WITH THEM. THEY WERE NOT AS SHARP AS THE ONES WHEN WE BOUGHT THEM NEW. VERY DULL.</li>
            <li> Replaced my old blade head, new one doesn&#x27;t cut much better. Whom ever designed these heads doesn&#x27;t have a mustache growing close to there nose.Almost impossible to get to.</li>
            <li> Although a real pain in the posterior to get aligned and installed correctly, the heads work just fine. The design of the overall razor is not user friendly as to head replacement.</li>
            <li> good replacement parts</li>
            <li> It works out fine and definitely is an improvement over my old heads.</li>
            <li> Excellent!&lt;br /&gt;they arrived fast and they perform very good.&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend them&lt;br /&gt;i use this phillips norelco once per week and my face stays in a well condition</li>
            <li> Finally I can have a nice experience of shaving.</li>
            <li> I have this set up to receive new replace heads on a six month basis at a greatly reduced cost.  I forget what you call it.  They have not been late once.  Good quality for a terrific price.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for 3 months and they are not giving me a very close shave. I have been using this razor for approximately 4 years, I change the blades 1x a year around christmas time or the New Year. I wonder if these are either seconds or made by someone other than Norelco, unless Norelco is putting out an inferior product.</li>
            <li> Worked and fit my old shaver fine.  Was delivered on time.  Description was to follow to make sure I was receiving the right blades for the right razor.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my Dad who lives out of state. They were the exact replacement blades he needed; quickly sent to where he lives and my brother easily popped them in for Dad. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Fixed my problem. Very prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> Good price, good product.</li>
            <li> We have used this razor for years, and I was thankful to find such a good price on  these blades. Thanks for the good price and fast shipping..</li>
            <li> Product was as described and  advertise arrive on time or within the promise arrival time , totally satisfied  with my purchase , Price was good</li>
            <li> The description says it comes with 3 heads/cutters. That means 1 set for a razor with 3 spinners, not 3 sets of cutters. I just got my delivered today, so i haven&#x27;t tested them, but they appear to be the exact same as what came on my shaver (Philips Norelco 7810XL).</li>
            <li> I purchased New Blades that were duller than the 18 month old originals that I replaced.  The replacement blades are doing much worse job of cutting hairs, leaving random short and long ones all over my face.  Very disappointing, and I will not be replacing my razor with a philips Norelco, which is a shame, since I have been using their products for 15 years.</li>
            <li> They are the wrong size. thanks.</li>
            <li> Excellent-very easy to Install---my Norelco was 5 years old and with these new Heads it cuts like it did when it was brand new</li>
            <li> Excellent value at an excellent price.</li>
            <li> Blades don&#x27;t cut &amp;#34;sharply&amp;#34;, have to shave longer.</li>
            <li> I bought this one as a replacement for old heads. The old heads were exactly a year old and I can tell the difference with new heads. It seems expensive for what you get but since the product is expected to last a whole year, the price isn&#x27;t bad at all. There was also a coupon available on Amazon that took another dollar off.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I replaced the blades on my shaver. They worked fine at first but got dull a lot quicker than the original blades that came with it did. They were easy to replace.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave. Heads are easy to install. It only takes a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> New Norelco HQ8 work just fine.&lt;br /&gt;,</li>
            <li> just as described, fast shipment, good product</li>
            <li> Easy to install.  Work very well.</li>
            <li> Lacks any instructions on how to install the replacement.  There is a tiny incomprehensible drawing, and reference to the manufacturer&#x27;s web site, which provides only a sort of offensive video about how important it is to replace the headsm but no hint how to do so.  Absolutely worthless, which is unfortunate because the shaver itself was pretty good for a year.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast delivery - just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Exact replacement.  Works great.</li>
            <li> IT WAS WORSE THAN THE OLD ONE</li>
            <li> OEM.  Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Yes the new blade saved me from throwing the shaver away.</li>
            <li> they did not meet my expectations...&lt;br /&gt;.it feels like I had purcased a used set of blades&lt;br /&gt;since my shaves are not as close as I  had hoped</li>
            <li> I replace the blades every year and every time they pop right in and work great!</li>
            <li> waiting to use it. it was a back up</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to make my razor new!</li>
            <li> I shave regularly about once a week because I like to have a growth before going into trim the &#x27;stache and chin portion, but I shave clean the sides almost daily. This replacement was the perfect upgrade to my shaver to get it back to tip top condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replacing it was very easy and took no time at all. There was negative thing, that&#x27;s the noise. It&#x27;s much louder and more mechanical sounding than the stock heads that came on my shaver. But barring the noise, it performs just like if I had just bought my shaver.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads have your electric shaver working like it is brand new again.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it was an entire replacement head for my philips norelco 7310 but it&#x27;s actualy three individual blades &amp; guards. They do fit &amp; they&#x27;re actualy better than the stock heads on my 7310. I bought this because I was hoping to get an entire replacement head assembly but that&#x27;s actualy more than $25. (full head assemblies are $35 to $50)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They did exactily what I needed them for. They stay in place &amp; helps me get a good close shave. A part called a brace which keeps the guards from spinning with the blades broke but theses are shaped in a way that they stay in the socket &amp; have no chance of rotating with the blades. I&#x27;ll be buying these when ever I need new blades for my norelco 7310. (about once a year is when you should replace them)</li>
            <li> blades were fine.....razor called for hq8 replacement but the screens would not fit</li>
            <li> Easy to install and makes the razor work like new.</li>
            <li> Thought was going to get the entire heads because of the picture but instead just got the shaving heads.  Should explain this in add!</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> It feel so good to get new sharp blades, makes quite a bit of difference.</li>
            <li> Works great and cut my shaving time in half. Using in a 7345XL Philips Norelco model.</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised and met all expectations.</li>
            <li> Perfect, much less expensive that buying a new razor!</li>
            <li> Just installed and they make a HUGE difference. I top reviewer claims these are fakes, perhaps his were, not the ones I received, I actually bought a clone set on eBay, absolutely worthless. So if somehow you receive fake cutters and combs you will be greatly disappointed. These are Genuine Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For months these were listed at $29, just recently dropped to $21, with tax $22. Bought two sets.</li>
            <li> Philips brand replacement heads, the same as you buy in the shop.</li>
            <li> Husband loves them. Said they were super easy to install and was amazed how closely the new heads cut. Re-ordered right away.</li>
            <li> Vhard to find, very competivee pricing</li>
            <li> Needed very badly. Mine was dull and this was the best price I could find for the same thing.</li>
            <li> husband not happy, horrible shave.</li>
            <li> great price, change once a year, or depending on your beard. But if you clean the right way, you can chnage once a year. Beats buying Gillete Blades 4 pack @ $17.00, or more depends where you live.</li>
            <li> The only bigger mistake I made than buying the razor was buying these replacement blades.  For some reason, I keep expecting a cheap Philips razor to be able to shave my face, but I&#x27;ve had a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at 2PM every day for the last three years.  But hey, I can get a dry shave done in about 30 seconds in the morning, so if you&#x27;re more concerned with speed, frugality, and convenience than you are with the quality of your shave, then by all means, buy these replacement blades.  I won&#x27;t judge you too much... I did the same thing after all.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco HQ8 Dual Precision Replacement heads work great.  I&#x27;ve ordered these previously for my husband and he&#x27;s very pleased.  Good price!</li>
            <li> Now my old shaver is back in action</li>
            <li> great for the price, Norelco is a great shaver.</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly.....excellent buy!</li>
            <li> Good clean shave with new blades.</li>
            <li> Saved my razor for another year of use....Simple and easy to replace. Also replaced the battery(that is a little more difficult)</li>
            <li> Does not cut nearly as good as the original blades did. I should have bought a new razor instead of replacement blades.</li>
            <li> I give them 4 stores.  If they didn&#x27;t cost so darn much I&#x27;d give them a 5.  They last at least a year which I guess is good but I really hate having to buy them.  The razor is just convenient for me opposed to disposeable blades which would be less expensive.  There needs to be a generic replacement.  I have even tried to resharpen them but it hasn&#x27;t worked out very well.</li>
            <li> I foolishly almost gave up using my Norelco electric razor altogether. After about 2 years of use it electrically operated but wouldn&#x27;t shave my face at all. These replacement blades shipped quickly, were easy to install, and brought my electric razor back to life. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll buy another set in the near future.</li>
            <li> I have used this razor for years it does the job its intended to do you cant ask any more than that. ordering these heads this way is a lot cheaper that wall-mart and look at the time and gas you save.</li>
            <li> Works well and allot cheaped then the store!</li>
            <li> Replacement heads worked as anticipated.  The price was significantly less than other sources reviewed for the product.</li>
            <li> I finally bought new blades for my Norelco 8825 and I am glad I did. These blades turned my old 8825 into a great working razor! If you are thinking of getting a new razor consider new blades instead, the price I paid for these blades were much much cheaper than a new razor. $20.00 compared to $100.00 do the math...</li>
            <li> If there is any difference in these heads from the original I don&#x27;t know what it is. I&#x27;ve replaced these heads 4 time now and the shaver is still going strong. Do these batteries last forever?</li>
            <li> they work well and take the hair off my face, they only work on stubble because beards start to get pulled at</li>
            <li> Standard replacements.  Nothing out of the ordinary, but works well with the electric razor.  I&#x27;m still puzzled why replacments have to cost so much, but getting them through Amazon typically beats all the local competition</li>
            <li> This replaced the old cutters in the Norelco cordless shaver, so you get a closer shave...Have thru the years, made this replacement about every year, and have always been satisfied.</li>
            <li> Heads fit both my razors and work like new.</li>
            <li> Amazon made this an easy buy for me. The price was exceptional, delivery was flawless, and as these are name brand replacements, I could count on them doing a great job of shaving.</li>
            <li> You never realize that the heads are dull, you just shave longer. These heads make my shaver seem like a new shave.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find that they send the whole top half of the shaver head, not just the blades inside.  Simply pull the old one off and snap the new one on.  No disassebly of the blade holder on the back side like had been required on past models I have owned.</li>
            <li> The new blades decreased my shaving time by half.  Improved the comfort of shaving plus a closer shave.  From nom now on I will follow instructions and change yearly.</li>
            <li> Just ordered these the other day and of course they were delivered quickly as the warehouse is in PA and so are we.  My husband replaced the old blades with the new last night and said it was simple.  Glad we don&#x27;t have to go out and purchase a new shaver when the only thing wrong was the blades were dulling.  Should have done this months ago instead of looking for a new shaver.  Love the cost savings.</li>
            <li> Excellent product works well  and sharp blades  excellent brand name  I always shop this brand. Norelco stand behind there products</li>
            <li> good price .its like a new razor.</li>
            <li> bought online to get better price than through a box store.  bough them early to have when it came up on my yearly replacement time.</li>
            <li> This is a great product  and I have ordered replacement blades in  the past  with the same  although I was sent the wrong model. You sent HQ10 not HQ8 so I used the new blades with the old covers.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to buy another shaver so I bought these replacement heads. I was disappointed in that they didn&#x27;t seem to shave any better than the old heads I had used for a year and a half. I&#x27;ll use them and next time buy another shaver when I catch it on sale.</li>
            <li> great price for replacement heads :)</li>
            <li> I would have liked Norelco to have the OEM blades available, these are the best replacement one can buy but I would have preferred they keep the OEM style</li>
            <li> It is great!  It took a bit of juggling to install them, however they work great!</li>
            <li> The new heads work great.  My shaver now works like it did when I originally bought it.  Definitely recommend these replacement heads.</li>
            <li> So far these replacement heads are giving me a close shave. Will have to see if they last as long as the ones for my previous razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this replacement because last one was getting old and it was giving me skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;This was great replacement (not so irritation), and I think I will buy this one again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to decide to purchase this replacement head.  I once again receive a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I GOT THE PRODUCT IN A TIMELY MANNER. IT WAS WHAT I EXSPECTED AS FAR AS PRODUCT. SAME AS IN THE STORE. I SAVED A COUPLE OF BUCKS ON IT. I WOULD MOST LIKELY PURCHASE THEM AGAIN WHEN NEEDED.</li>
            <li> Perfect.  I was so happy to find these at a reasonable price instead of having to purchase a whole new razor.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and shipped on time</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco products for years in all types of environments, highly recommend the razors and the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> slightly difficult to take out old heads &amp; replace with these, but once they went in they worked just as good as the originals.</li>
            <li> These heads were a direct replacement for my Norelco AT810 shaver.  I used the old heads for about 2 two years when I noticed that I was not getting as close of a shave as I used to.  New heads took about 30 seconds to install. Very simple to install. I recommend cleaning all parts of the shaver thoroughly before installing the new heads. They provide a much closer shave with no irritation.  (No more red irritated skin.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price on Amazon was much cheaper than local stores. I would recommend these heads to anyone with a compatible shaver and I will not hesitate to buy them again.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the original blades</li>
            <li> Just Okay. I only shave once a week and I have to replace these heads every year to eighteen months. So I&#x27;m only 50 - 75 shaves out of it!!!</li>
            <li> If you use an electric razor and a blade you&#x27;ll want to change this out about once a year. If you use an electric razor all the time change it out about every six months. It&#x27;s like having a brand new razor.</li>
            <li> Worked good, like razor when new.  Year old head was still shaving pretty well.</li>
            <li> Makes my razor head like new! I replaced my original stock razor heads after a year of use. As soon as I used the new heads, I could tell what a different there was. These were also more shinier than my original heads, thus adding a bit of style to a dated razor.</li>
            <li> The advertising lead me to believe that I was to find 2 sets in the box. At arrival I only found one set of 3 blades inside original carton.</li>
            <li> Just what my husband needed. Quality product.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the replacement heads, I only wished I would have replaced them sooner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always liked my Norelco and guys who see and hear it run, say it is so quiet and they go out and by one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new blades make it run so much quieter now and it seems the shaver holds it&#x27;s charge longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller shipped my replacement heads in no time, in fact they arrived sooner than they were supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> Noticed difference as soon as I replaced the old blades. Great improvement. I do wish the replacements weren&#x27;t quite so expensive.</li>
            <li> All that was expected</li>
            <li> I change the blades about every 2 years.  These blades stay sharp right up to the end.  I will purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about these. They are replacement heads for a nice electric razor. If you like the AT830, then you&#x27;ll eventually need some of these.</li>
            <li> Fit my shaver and gives closer and better shaves.</li>
            <li> Work great. Have been installed for at least 30 days.</li>
            <li> They are working very well. My chief concern was the replacement process, but the instructions on the package were very clear. The unlock was easy, the old disks lifted right out, and the new ones could only be installed one way. No spectacular change in performance, but I&#x27;m a newbie and thus made the change when mama said I should, not after two weeks of shag.</li>
            <li> Have used a Norelco for 30 years. They are the best. This bunch has cuaght my whisers a few times and yanked them out. Ouch.</li>
            <li> There were no instructions for the installation. Found video which showed how to remove old heads and install new ones. Once installed, works great!</li>
            <li> I bought the Norelco 7310XL razor for my boyfriend for christmas last year (2011) and we just ordered replacement heads after the razor performance seemed to decrease (they also recommend changing the blades every 12 months). Although the razor he has specifies to only use with the HQ8 blades, it came with the lower quality HQ5 blades. He says his shave is smoother than with the original blades, and his razor actually seems to have increased battery life. It used to die after every shave, even after a full charge, and now it stays charged for multiple shaves. Not sure whether to thank the correct blades for that, or if it&#x27;s just a coincidence.</li>
            <li> Only Norelco for us!  You will definitely get your monies worth from this little bugger!</li>
            <li> Be careful evidently all &amp;#34;HQ8&amp;#34; are not the same, my razor is an older model that takes an HQ8 head but this one would not fit..  I had to take the blades out of the new head and put them in the old holder...  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Purchased this replacement head along with a new Shaver 4500 as a gift in December of 2013.  The Shaver is still doing a great job and so the replacement blades are still in the box.  I expect they will work great whenever needed.</li>
            <li> the best they&#x27;ve ever made</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used these yet; they came with the razor and I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to need the replacements.</li>
            <li> Product works well.  Better price than local stores for me.  Merchant shipped product very fast.  Would recommend this product from this merchant.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, well packaged, as expected. Great price too</li>
            <li> They look great in the package, can&#x27;t wait til I put them in my razor.</li>
            <li> This head works great and is cheap for as long as the products lasts. It is suggested to buy these and change them every year, but every two years would be fine.</li>
            <li> Ha! I was about to replace my electric shaver until i realized all I had to do was buy this! Very happy, more money for nefarious activities!</li>
            <li> not good for 7310 series.</li>
            <li> my husband says there is a big difference in shaving after he replaced the heads.  a quicker and smoother shave.</li>
            <li> The new Philips Norelco HQ8 Dual Precision Replacement head slipped into place and my husband now has a quicker shave with his like new Norelco.</li>
            <li> Received items (replacement razor heads) as promised thanks, would gladly do future business!</li>
            <li> Works, just as advertised.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive, but amazon has them for  good price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re razor heads, they fit the model as they&#x27;re supposed to. Will last 6 mos to a year, depending on use.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with the replacement head for my shaver because it works great and was offered at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I noticed no change in the cut! Maybe I didn&#x27;t need to replace the heads!! I know better next time.</li>
            <li> Old ones had worn out.  Happy that the replacements are a perfect fit.</li>
            <li> The replacement did not fit my shaver, although it states to match my shaver model. The policy is ¨once open¨ can not changed: Useless buying.</li>
            <li> Just as expected. Fast shipping. Awesome.</li>
            <li> Easy to replace the cutters and made my razor perform as new again. Not much more to be said about this product.</li>
            <li> I bought these to fit Norelco razors which I have had for a long time. The heads should be replaced at least yearly and some might do so more often. The problem with Norelco razors is that the blades wear out quickly.  However, Norelco is the only brand of razor that I have used for over 40 years.  One should keep a few boxes on hand, one for each razor.  The price cannot be beat. This is a grooming essential.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with Norelco razor Heads I received the fit my shaver correctly and they are cheaper than at a local store</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift so as long as he likes it, we like it!!</li>
            <li> The quality has dropped significantly or I keep getting lemons. These perform very poorly, especially compared to the heads that came on the razor. It now takes forever to shave and leaves behind lots of hairs. It&#x27;s hard to explain how crappy these are compared to the original parts.</li>
            <li> It is nice to have a close shave again although I don&#x27;t understand why replacement blades cost 50% of what a new shaver would cost.</li>
            <li> What can I say, it&#x27;s a replacement piece.  It is easy to reassemble the unit with this piece.  The electric shaver worked like new again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these replacement heads twice in the last couple of years. The price beats the local stores. The heads are easy to install. I&#x27;ve never had to replace the heads in my shaver more than once a year. Beats buying razor blades.</li>
            <li> Did not quite fit my older model resulting in a noisy uncomfortable feel.</li>
            <li> I thought I was purchasing the  the complete head  as well that holds cutters.  I can purchase a new razor for the price Norelco charges for the holder and blades.</li>
            <li> recieved the product promptly and it we easy to install. It was a good price and I will order again.</li>
            <li> Your product works just fine....&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m very happy with it and how it shaves much better then the original...&lt;br /&gt;I looked everywhere to buy them and I couldn&#x27;t find them so I went to AMAZON and found them right away...&lt;br /&gt;Should of looked here first... ty</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t fit my old Philips Norelco shaver. It only fits the new shaver, even though the part numbers are the same</li>
            <li> Work fine as long as I use the grocery store cleaner and lubricant</li>
            <li> Service was great, The new blades were easy to install and were so quite and smooth on my face that I thought it wasn&#x27;t running or cutting.</li>
            <li> They are okay, but not outstanding</li>
            <li> whaoaa...sharp again!</li>
            <li> As described.  Fits and works great.  Arrived promptly</li>
            <li> As advertised for Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li> Excellent replacement.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Fit in my razor with zero problems.</li>
            <li> Item delivered very quickly and as was advertised. I&#x27;ve been wanting to replace the blades in my shaver for quite some time now, but never got around to it. Let me tell - I am SO glad I finally did! I get a really smooth shave in half the time. Replace your shaving heads regularly, you&#x27;ll be glad you did. And use this seller, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> What a difference new heads make.  Next time I won&#x27;t wait as long!</li>
            <li> Nothing exceptional for these blades, they do the job.</li>
            <li> whats to brag about,they are only shaving heads.Could be norelco seconds for all I know.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for my razor.</li>
            <li> This was supposed to fit my Norelco 7617x, but it didn&#x27;t quite fit correctly.  It works but not great!&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, vendor doesn&#x27;t have exact fit for my 7617x model.</li>
            <li> Does good, I think my razor is getting on in life</li>
            <li> They work great and the price is right.</li>
            <li> My Norelco razor still works fine but of course need to replace the heads periodically.  Only problem is the price is excessive.  at a certain point, it pays to just buy a new razor.</li>
            <li> GOOD WILL ORDER AGAIN</li>
            <li> This was a replacement head for my razor.  It was long overdue and the razor is now working very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always woindered why it costs almost as much to replace the shaving head as it does for a new razor, but I decided to give it a try.  I was surprised at how simple it was to install the new head.  And for all practical purposes, I have a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; razor.  As a society we throw away too much stuff already.  I just helped to clear a &amp;#34;Land-fill&amp;#34;!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect, Good quality!</li>
            <li> good price and cheaper than cheaper than blade shaving.  no shave cream or soap to buy or $10 blades every week or two..</li>
            <li> Wonderful!  Brings your clipper back to like new operation.</li>
            <li> My husband said the replacement worked perfectly.  He&#x27;s happy so that makes me happy.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Great product</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have had good replacement heads. The first time I tried replacing them on another shaver they did not cut right. These did!</li>
            <li> As with the Remington heads --- just wash and dry them occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;The cutters will allow old whiskers to stick to them.&lt;br /&gt;They work great.</li>
            <li> Fit easily. Quite happy with the replacement</li>
            <li> Razor cuts like new. Good purchase to rejuvenate my rezor</li>
            <li> My father gave me his Philips Norelco and I bought this replacement head to use it. I was going to by a new one but my dad&#x27;s was like brand new and I decided for the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Part of an order placed last weekend and received today, All were received earlier than expected without any damage. All were just as advertised.</li>
            <li> fast shipping...good product</li>
            <li> Saved the price of a new razor.</li>
            <li> Makes the razor shave like it was brand new...</li>
            <li> New blades make all the difference.  My old one was over 3 years old and, needless to say, took a considerable longer time to do the job.  Will be changing them out sooner in the future.</li>
            <li> Easy to find on the web site and easy to pick out which set of blades for my type of shaver.</li>
            <li> Shaver working like new .</li>
            <li> Great price--quick delivery!</li>
            <li> Great price, an exact match of original head and with little effort, was easy to install on head. Price is okay.</li>
            <li> I bought it for a backup replacement for my  Philips Norelco PT730 Electric Razor. It is the exact head that PT730 uses.</li>
            <li> I ordered replacement blades and heads for my Norelco razor and the item works fine. I would recommend these replacement blades.</li>
            <li> Took a bit for this mechanical klutz to get them in.  Works great.&lt;br /&gt;They said that they need 7 more words, so now I have them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried most department stores (target, walmart, etc.) and most do not carry products for older model shavers.  I will definately be coming back to re-order.</li>
            <li> I have not changed these in 12 years. I was led to believe that instead of changing your blades get a new razor. There is no difference from old to new. Sorry.</li>
            <li> I have found that the shaving blades that come with a new shaver always seem to work better, and last longer than the blades you buy to replace them. I just purchased the HQ8 Spectra replacement heads for my shaver, and so far, I am impressed with the quality of the shave since I started using them about a month or so ago. Time will tell if they hold up over time, but I think they will..</li>
            <li> the Norelco hq8 fit my razor and worked perfectly</li>
            <li> Fit &amp; installed easy as should a direct factory item</li>
            <li> I have purchased these Norelco replacement heads a number of times and was always happy with them until recently.  While the other heads always lasted at least 10 months, the last set I ordered lasted only a couple of months before they quit cutting properly.  I don&#x27;t know if this was just a fluke or if the quality has really gone down.  I will try one more set, but if they don&#x27;t last more than a few months I will be looking for another brand of razor.</li>
            <li> Although both Amazon and the manufacturer state that these heads are for use in&lt;br /&gt;the 7310XL razor, they will not fit into that razor due the extended &amp;#34;lips&amp;#34; on the&lt;br /&gt;blade covers.  I find this ridiculous.  Terrible design.</li>
            <li> i am very well satisfied with speedy service &amp; quality of replacement heads</li>
            <li> Fit great, packaging a little troublesome but well protected.</li>
            <li> Ahhhh, 2 years on the old blades and I&#x27;m in love.  Easy to insert.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product</li>
            <li> order was not as pictured!</li>
            <li> easy to order and works great</li>
            <li> I bought a couple of sets - they become hard to find or damned expensive in a few years.  They work great and last longer than a year.  An example of price rise by Norelco is their HQ6 series $50 to 80 - just buy another razor.</li>
            <li> Easy to order and shipping was right on time, just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Replacement blades fit &amp; work perfectly</li>
            <li> Works great, did not know how dull my old blades were.</li>
            <li> they fit and work good</li>
            <li> No problem--they work fine</li>
            <li> I double checked to make sure I ordered the right ones and the new ones seem duller than the old ones I replaced.</li>
            <li> Made my old razor new again, don&#x27;t  know why I waited as long as I did!</li>
            <li> Husband still likes the old fashion way to shave best.</li>
            <li> a bit awkward to install as pieces fall out. but, when it&#x27;s put together it works good.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads were great.  It had been sometime since I had replaced the heads and it was badly needed.</li>
            <li> Works ok. Need to get a new one.</li>
            <li> New ones are always sharp so my shaving time is shorter producing less face irritation.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with order. Will re-order next year.</li>
            <li> was so easy to replace in razor, really does make a difference to have new blades</li>
            <li> This product gets 5 stars, it does the job it was designed to do and does it well. I recommend this product to anyone with the need to do what this product is designed to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several sets over the years and all have been top quality.  The last set gave a lot of good service but seemed to have finally lost their sharpness.  Installing this new set proved that and I&#x27;m getting quick, clean shaves again.</li>
            <li> The replacement cutter heads are not compatible as advertised.  The gearing of the rotary cutter heads is not a match to the drive pins of the shaver.  Very disappointed. Was not able to use HQ8.  On flat surfaces the cutters do spin but are slipping which produces a poor quality shave. The instant the head goes over a curved portion of the face the cutter gear skips badly making a racket.</li>
            <li> Some great replacement heads for the Phillips Norelco Shaver.  Great product, satisfied customer.  Would recommend to anyone in need of replacement heads.</li>
            <li> What an easy way to make your Norelco like new again.  Get them twice a year at least.</li>
            <li> Fit my razor works ok but I would not have bought it if I knew the batteries I also purchased from Amazon at same time could not be installed and I can only use my razor by plugging it in. I would have bought a new  razor. See my review of the batteries.</li>
            <li> Quality Phillips product!</li>
            <li> easy to install.  worked just as i hoped.  had my shaver for a long time and the replacement heads worked well.</li>
            <li> just so so, it looks not very good. I will keep it but I do not like its style nerther.</li>
            <li> Really easy to install, and made my razer like new you should buy one on these.&lt;br /&gt;Ist a good buy..</li>
            <li> It was returned with the shaver, for the shaver has not enough power to do the job,&lt;br /&gt;so I did not have he chance to see how it works.</li>
            <li> good product and good price. the real deal.</li>
            <li> They improve shaver performance and well worth buying about once a year, even though they are a little expensive, even on Amazon.</li>
            <li> When I purchased my razor, I did so partly because the heads were supposed to last one year.  At the end of a year, I replaced them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was astonished at how much better the razor worked with the hew heads.  My lesson is that the heads should probably be changed more often -- perhaps every six months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, I am pleased with the shave I get -- now that I have these new heads.</li>
            <li> Excellent blades, &amp; a perfect fit.</li>
            <li> Second time to replace these blades. Very satisfied with product and with Amazon.</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly, just what I ordered!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no difference in shaving with the new blades compared to a year old blade.  It felt like a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> The heads worked great</li>
            <li> The blades I replace every 6 months. I&#x27;ve used my Norelco razor for the past 15 years. They arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Good &amp; sharp. Good value.</li>
            <li> I had been using the original blades in my razor for over three years.  These fit exactly and give a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> they performed as expected and did not give me any trouble.</li>
            <li> Seems to be harsh on the skin.  looks like original but I went back to the old blades after a few days..</li>
            <li> Keeps my shaver working.</li>
            <li> my old blades shaved better than the new ones</li>
            <li> Better than the heads that came with shaver, they made an improvement .</li>
            <li> Contains 3 replacement cutters with combs.Works perfectly. Prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> They fit, they work, the price was about the same as the store.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly, was easy to install and made my shaver good as new</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement blades for my Norelco 7325xl razor. It shaves like new again.</li>
            <li> The new head works very well.  Shaving is quicker, and my skin feels better afterwards.  My skin Thanks you.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads are perfect!</li>
            <li> what an improvement in shaving should have got sooner</li>
            <li> Very pleased with these replacement parts.  They were a little tricky to install, alignment of the parts in the frame that hold the heads were the trickiest part.  I dropped the three heads in the sink, when I first took apart the shaver head,   so this time I disassembled the shaver on a cloth away from a place where I could lose the parts.  I like that you get all the parts that touch your face when you shave not just the cutting blades, including the slots that hold them as well and the part that aligns the heads in the shaver.</li>
            <li> These items are such a ripp at the big box stores.  I took the chance and bought this online looking for HQ8 blade replacement.  I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Exactly like the original!  My shaver is like new again.  I scoffed at the 1 year replacement logo on the shaver but it does need to be replaced after a year.  My beard is not heavy and I only need to shave once a day and I believe the timing is based upon a single use per day on an average beard.  Naturally is your beard is heavy and you shave it more often, your life expectancy will be allot shorter.  I&#x27;ve seen complaints about the quality if the replacement heads and I am not saying these people are imagining it.  But contacting the supplier does a world of good.  I worked with them on a shipping issue and they sincerely wanted me to be a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Should have purchased these months ago.  I can&#x27;t believe the difference these new heads make in shave quality.</li>
            <li> The heads were easy to install and work like a champ.  A great alternative to getting a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Popped right in, work great, no issues at all.</li>
            <li> This was nice.  It came quickly.</li>
            <li> nice to be able to replace the heads instead of purchasing a whole new razor, shipping is all ways awesome</li>
            <li> These are always good</li>
            <li> Worked well. No issues. Nice and sharp. Less pulling than the original.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve purchased replacement heads.  They work really well and it&#x27;s better to buy these than a brand new razor every year.</li>
            <li> I am still using the heads that came with my shaver. The new design of the Phillips Norelco heads cut extremely well. It has eliminated pulled hairs and the heads last longer. My expectation of the replacement heads will work as well when installed.</li>
            <li> Nice purchase, decent price. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> They made the razor preform like new.</li>
            <li> I received the shipment on time, new and functions as advertised on the site. Much cheaper than what I found on line at Walmart and Walgreens.</li>
            <li> Bought one and had it shipped to Japan.  Great value compared with ridiculously high price in Japan.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could have bought another for my Brown, which is forbidden to import.</li>
            <li> Good product, makes the razor new</li>
            <li> They were very easy to replace and mine needed them bad.  I did not know you need to replace them every year.</li>
            <li> My Norellco razor was just not \\&quot;cutting it\\&quot;. I made sure that these would work for my model and purchased them. now my electric razor works like new and w/o having to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> When I replaced my old blades with these, my shaver was like new again. Simply took them out of the package, put into my old shaver and was ready to go. Smooth shave.</li>
            <li> It was just what the old razor needed to be new again.  The new blades were easy to install and are working great.</li>
            <li> Good quality replacement heads ... works well ... shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> By replacing the heads in my Norelco &amp;#34;cordless&amp;#34; shaver on a yearly basis , maintains the shaver&#x27;s capacity to provide a comfortably close shave . Replacing the shavre&#x27;s cutting heads is not difficult and restores the top notch performance that I know my Norelco shaver delivers  .</li>
            <li> This my seconday Norelco shaver. I&#x27;m giving them a second chance my first lasted 2 years then the power would not turn off.  The shaver is a good one but this better last longer then 2 years.</li>
            <li> Easy to replace. Super smooth surface which surprised me. My past experiences with brand new blade were it would take more than multiple uses to get into shape. This HQ8 worked well at the first second.</li>
            <li> as hoped and as expected</li>
            <li> I dont know&lt;br /&gt;I liked the product it went very well&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure yo guys why you need 19 word in this review to require review....I just think I dont know</li>
            <li> These replacement heads make a Norelco shaver like new again.  They are well made and (for me) last more than the one year Norelco suggests for replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the blades themselves, they also replace the head, a grate above the blades.  This is important because the grate can bend if you just throw the shaver in your luggage without its protective cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the same reason, you should be careful when you open the packaging.  The inside plastic container is a little hard to open, and when I did, the heads fell to the floor and scattered.  I don&#x27;t know for sure, but I suspect that that is the reason they did not work well - so I got a replacement, and was more careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four stars, which on Amazon means \\&quot;I like it\\&quot;.  They do what they should do, and nothing to complain about (except maybe the packaging).</li>
            <li> Wrong size heads....a second set was shipped to me but still the same model...I returned them with a note to the model I needed and within a day a THIRD set of wrong heads came which I returned. I&#x27;ll try again for the correct vin number...</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT WORKED GREAT. I HAVE BEEN USING NORELCO PRODUCTS FOR MANY YEARS AND I&#x27; AM VERY SATISFIED. YOU CANNOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM FOR LESS AT THE STORE.</li>
            <li> Met expectations - was as advertised - shipped promptly.</li>
            <li> Just waht i needed for my machine. Im glad we have this service as these blades arent readily available in my country and the cost more than the machine (like 2x) for all 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, i needed a spare set, but i must say that im now using my phillips for 2 years and the blades are still good. I think there is a minimal sharpness loss, but my 2 year old blades still do the trick :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would reccommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> I noticed that I wasn&#x27;t getting a deep enough shave from my 7310XL.  I replaced the heads for the 7310XL after a year and I&#x27;m now getting a better deeper shave.</li>
            <li> we sometimes have a hard time finding the replacement heads when they are needed so i purchased this at the same time that i purchased is new shaver.  very happy with the Norelco brand.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads seem to work better than the originals that came with the shaver and the originals were very good.</li>
            <li> These are replacement blades… What more can I say?</li>
            <li> Years ago the heads lasted a couple years, now I&#x27;m lucky to get 4 months out of them. After 40 plus years of Philishave and Norelco I will be buying a Braun next.</li>
            <li> I thought I needed a new razor, but these brought my present one back to as good as new.  And the price was right.</li>
            <li> I did everything get my razor to work with your replacement...It does not shave well at all!</li>
            <li> I bought several packs.  Maybe the electric razor will die first.  It&#x27;s a little bit like another silly unnecessary thing I did many years ago: fill my wallet with rubber condoms.  Did not get to use those either.</li>
            <li> Just what i needed to make an old shaver new again!</li>
            <li> Exact fit!  And plenty sharp.  Good stuff</li>
            <li> I ordered these heads to replace the worn ones on my Norelco.  They were easy to install, and are working fine.  The price was right, and shipping was right to my door.  Thanks for a great product</li>
            <li> Easy to install ... just drop in &amp; twist a knob ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaver is as good as new, again ... ... ...</li>
            <li> These items arrived quickly and have lived up to the original equipment.  What else can I say but that they are OK.</li>
            <li> Worthwhile replacement.  Will replace them annually from now on.  Easy installation.  Works great.  Worth the price to extend life of razor.</li>
            <li> Quality seems to be ok. But, considering that I need a new one every six months, it is overpriced. The installation is a little tricky for a person with big hands.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect replacement. took a little long to receive it but I save a lot of money here.</li>
            <li> not much to say about a spare part. Came on time, actually a bit earlier, and package was really good!</li>
            <li> Made my shaver like it was new. I should have done this sooner, easy to install and and what a difference</li>
            <li> Does not stay sharp very long. Are the replacement heads the same as the original heads? Seems like the original stay sharp longer.</li>
            <li> Just like the original</li>
            <li> Fits my electronic shaver perfectly</li>
            <li> OK, I don&#x27;t buy the 12 month guideline for replacing heads unless you&#x27;re Grizzly Adams and grow brillo pad for hair.  I&#x27;ve routinely done 1.5x intervals and they work just fine.  The price here on Amazon is definitely cheaper than drugstores or even Target and Walmart.</li>
            <li> These cutters will last a long, long time.  I bought a set as a backup.  But I also have a little plastic sharpening kit I bought online for $5 that works great, so I will sharpen a set every time I notice my shave getting a little rough.  I had a set like this that I sharpened and didn&#x27;t wear out over the life of the last shaver.</li>
            <li> Work as good as the original blades.  I&#x27;d think no one was surprised here.  Replace your blades occasionally and you&#x27;ll still have a nice razor.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how dull the old heads were until I put these in.  They work great. The old heads lasted a long time. If these last as long I will be very happy.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried any other brand of Electric razor for over 30 years so I can&#x27;t make comparisons. Only complaint is if the blades are a little old (&gt; 6 months) and you push too hard, the blades take a bite out of your face.</li>
            <li> Just dont buy the 2 pack thats crazy expensive like triple the cost .  Excellant Product have bought these several times and will buy them again.</li>
            <li> Half the price and 100% more convenient than the store.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I wait so long to replace my shaver head cutters. My Norelco shaves like new again. Also, awesome price!!</li>
            <li> They work wonderfully. Received right away.</li>
            <li> I bought this item at a huge discount.  I was afraid it would come as a generic brand but it was the Norelco brand and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> Great product, and it works just fine.... a little difficult and tricky to install, but once in, it returns the shaver to a giving a great and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Heads wont stay in place no matter how you put them. Try different ways diferent positions and they fall out directions very poor and can barely see them.</li>
            <li> Work much better than the old ones. I need to remember to replace them every year!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s average.  The replacement blades work but overall the product is average.  The meet the need but I&#x27;m not overwhelmed by the blades</li>
            <li> We are fully satisfied with the Phillips Norelco replacement blades.&lt;br /&gt;They came in a timely manner and we are happy with them.</li>
            <li> Good deal to replace the shaver heads instead of buying a whole new razor.  The replacement is easy and it works great.</li>
            <li> makes a big difference and a good price</li>
            <li> Glad to find this on Amazon.  The big box store where I bought the shaver doesn&#x27;t carry or is out of them. Reasonable price, free shipping.  Great.  Simple to install</li>
            <li> Blades cut so much better with new rotary blades.. The old ones i had for over 2 years.. So these will be good for over 2 more years. I would reccomend replacement every 2 years..</li>
            <li> Every year I tell myself, Whoa, this is a lot of money for blades.  And every year I buy new blades.</li>
            <li> Good price, quick shipping.  Works great</li>
            <li> Obviously technology has improved.  My old blades - which I replced 1 - 2 times per year were old, old technology.&lt;br /&gt;I assume the housings are better [thinner] in the new ones too.</li>
            <li> The parts came on time, the replacement procedure was very easy, and the new replacement heads worked very well, making my shaver like new again!</li>
            <li> Received it quickly. It is the same product that is available at stores locally, but by getting from Amazon I saved some money. It&#x27;s just replacement heads for a razor, not much else can be said about them.</li>
            <li> Forgot how well my electric razor does the job until these new heads were installed. Great price, Prime shipping got them to me lickety-split and now my face is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s . . .</li>
