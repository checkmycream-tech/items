            <li>fixed it in a matter of days, worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>I love their products.</li>
            <li>Love the way this product softens the skin on the bottom of my feet</li>
            <li>I love this hemp lotion, it works wonders.</li>
            <li>This is the best product I have ever found to keep your feet smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>We are both in are 60&#x27;s and have tried many products</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame and a loss to have so many uninformed citizens reject any products made with Hemp.  </li>
            <li>Ok - made my point.  </li>
            <li>What a smooth transaction!</li>
            <li>I am a convert and will buy this product over and over again, i&#x27;m sure.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many foot creams and like this one -</li>
            <li>my feet looked better than they had before they started to crack.  </li>
            <li>My feet have never felt better and softer.</li>
            <li>The Body Shop Hemp Foot Protector is the best I have used for my very dry feet.  </li>
            <li>I have never put anything on my feet that feels as good, that softens so fast and works so well.</li>
            <li>Good product, not greasy, dries fast.</li>
            <li>Sweet!</li>
            <li>It adsorbs very quickly and leaves the skin feeling softer.</li>
            <li>Finding this lotion was a great relief, it&#x27;s the only foot lotion I buy anymore.</li>
            <li>It absorbs in pretty quickly, which is very important to me.  </li>
            <li>They heal, feel good, and are not addictive.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>The scent is a bit strong when you first apply the cream, but it is not overly feminine or overly manly and it blends in rather quickly.</li>
            <li>It works great in the barefoot days of summer and even better in the long, dry Colorado winters.</li>
            <li>and when i remember to use it consistently, it helps it from getting cracked.</li>
            <li>I have been able to wear shoes with socks and flip flops shortly after applying the cream without any problems.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using the Neutrogena Norwegian formula hand cream, it works much much better that I can see the improvement on my skin.</li>
            <li>Super dry and cracked feet are soft and healthy within two days, if not sooner.</li>
            <li>it is certainly one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>It is by no means the only cream that works well on dry heels but certainly a good one to keep on hand.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>, maybe I had too high of expectations.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the extra cash!</li>
            <li>It has completely healed my splitting&lt;br /&gt;dry feet.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using body butters on my feet, which are superior to other moisturizers, but they pale by comparison to this hemp foot stuff, which leaves my feet feeling moisturized for several days after one application.  </li>
            <li>We tend to stock up on Body Shop products in general when they have sales (they recently ran a four products for $30 deal).</li>
            <li>This is the only one that has fixed cracked heels and dry skin.</li>

            <li> had a really dry foot.</li>
            <li> Holy grail for dry feet.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my feet were extremely dry and were cracking.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in Colorado, and the winters are particularly dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dry where i live and my feet gets cracked pretty bad at times.  </li>

            <li> Both products do not work on my dry hands and foot, I am disappointed and they are expensive too compare to most of similar products.  </li>
            <li> Still have white dry skin in areas and pads are fairly tough after about 3 weeks of at least bi-nightly use and wearing socks to bed with it applied.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife because she uses and loves the hand cream, figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I suffer from very bad psorisis and I apply hemp foot proyector on it, the product removes dead skin and makes the condition easier to control  </li>
            <li> Stock up for the cold winter!</li>

            <li> Stock up for the cold winter! I love their products.</li>
            <li> We have tried every cream out there. This is the only one that has fixed cracked heels and dry skin. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I suffer from very bad psorisis and I apply hemp foot proyector on it, the product removes dead skin and makes the condition easier to control  it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> I love this product - great for your feet even though it says for your hands.  Great in making your feet softer</li>
            <li> Love the way this product softens the skin on the bottom of my feet and I have tried them all!</li>
            <li> I love this hemp lotion, it works wonders. Super dry and cracked feet are soft and healthy within two days, if not sooner. Finding this lotion was a great relief, it&#x27;s the only foot lotion I buy anymore.</li>
            <li> The Body Shop Hemp Foot Protector is the best I have used for my very dry feet.  It has completely healed my splitting&lt;br /&gt;dry feet.  Nothing else I have tried has worked for me.  This is my product of choice from now on.</li>
            <li> had a really dry foot. fixed it in a matter of days, worked perfectly. would recommend this too a friend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a number of years.  One of the best I&#x27;ve found for my feet.  The price was good and the product was delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever found to keep your feet smooth and soft. It works great in the barefoot days of summer and even better in the long, dry Colorado winters. I love it!</li>

            <li> My husband and I are both impressed by the Body Shop Hemp foot, hand, and body crème protectors.  We are both in are 60&#x27;s and have tried many products BUT these are THE BEST!  They heal, feel good, and are not addictive.  It&#x27;s a shame and a loss to have so many uninformed citizens reject any products made with Hemp.  Read about the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937 and learn how the Tobacco industry won the &amp;#34;drug war&amp;#34; - become informed.  Ok - made my point.  Try these products.</li>
            <li> Great product - I LOVE it!!!  What a smooth transaction!</li>
            <li> Holy grail for dry feet.</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference after only two uses!  Sweet!</li>
            <li> this is the best foot stuff i&#x27;ve ever found.  i&#x27;ve been using body butters on my feet, which are superior to other moisturizers, but they pale by comparison to this hemp foot stuff, which leaves my feet feeling moisturized for several days after one application.  I am a convert and will buy this product over and over again, i&#x27;m sure.  highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Good product, not greasy, dries fast. I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dry where i live and my feet gets cracked pretty bad at times.  Applying this helps heal my feet faster and when i remember to use it consistently, it helps it from getting cracked.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful foot/heel cream. It adsorbs very quickly and leaves the skin feeling softer. I have been able to wear shoes with socks and flip flops shortly after applying the cream without any problems. The scent is a bit strong when you first apply the cream, but it is not overly feminine or overly manly and it blends in rather quickly. I have tried many foot creams and like this one - it is certainly one of my favorites. It is by no means the only cream that works well on dry heels but certainly a good one to keep on hand. We tend to stock up on Body Shop products in general when they have sales (they recently ran a four products for $30 deal).</li>
            <li> This foot protector will keep your feet looking and feeling great!</li>
            <li> Product works as a great moisturizer.  I bought this because my feet were extremely dry and were cracking.  After a week or so of use (1x a day) my feet looked better than they had before they started to crack.  Definitely worth the extra cash!</li>
            <li> Love this product great moisterizer</li>
            <li> This product works for me.  It absorbs in pretty quickly, which is very important to me.  I don&#x27;t like the greasy feel that some products leave. I would recommend this to anyone whose feet needs some TLC and you don&#x27;t want that greasy feel.  The Body Shop was wonderful to work with, recommend them as well.</li>
            <li> Seems to soften but continuous use is necessary. Bought this for my wife because she uses and loves the hand cream, figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong. It&#x27;s not bad just didn&#x27;t get the results I expected, maybe I had too high of expectations. Still have white dry skin in areas and pads are fairly tough after about 3 weeks of at least bi-nightly use and wearing socks to bed with it applied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in Colorado, and the winters are particularly dry. My feet have never felt better and softer. Cracks and rough parts are beginning to go away or being minimized.</li>
            <li> Excellent lotion except for the smell.  I rated this an extra star higher than the hand lotion because although it smells horrific as well, my feet are far enough away that it&#x27;s not as bothersome as the hand lotion on your hands.</li>
            <li> This works great on my husband&#x27;s feet.  He loves this product.</li>
            <li> Works great, I use it for my hands to keep them smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Again, I read all the reviews before ordered this product with the Body Shop Spa Wisdom Africa Honey &amp; Beeswax hand &amp; foot Butter.  Both products do not work on my dry hands and foot, I am disappointed and they are expensive too compare to most of similar products.  I will not buy this or any products from Body Shop, I always regret.  I&#x27;m using the Neutrogena Norwegian formula hand cream, it works much much better that I can see the improvement on my skin.</li>
