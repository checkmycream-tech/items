    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t put them on perfectly, I found, that they would just fall off</li>
            <li>great product!!</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the results and recommend them.</li>
            <li>excellent product.</li>
            <li>I chose this item based on the best price I could find on the internet.</li>
            <li>Excellent product..</li>
            <li>But when i did use them before i had braces, the effects were incredible.</li>
            <li>and so I had real nice pearly whites for my wedding.  </li>
            <li>and I still had great results.  </li>
            <li>This product is great.  </li>
            <li>I know there are people out there who are happy with them</li>
            <li>This worked GREAT.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was happy with the results for about a month.</li>
            <li>The gel stays on the teeth and tastes like a pleasant toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>With this info, I used the strips with good results and no discomfort.    </li>
            <li>So reading, watching the news, driving to work, vegetating-these are all good</li>
            <li>So reading, watching the news, driving to work, vegetating-these are all good</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have a comparison but find these results good for the cost.</li>
            <li>Good luck, trying to make that work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not so great as expected...they do looks better though.</li>
            <li>I can not imagine fighting with the strips on my lower teeth for 6 more days!</li>
            <li>and I must say I&#x27;m actually pretty impressed.</li>
            <li>the first time we were amazed at the results!!!!</li>
            <li>but it was still effective.</li>
            <li>so I thought it might be wise to stay away from these after reading some of the reviews, however I was able to use them with no pain at all.</li>
            <li>Instead, rinse with slightly warm water, and take your index finger and \\&quot;brush\\</li>
            <li>Instead, rinse with slightly warm water, and take your index finger and \\&quot;brush\\</li>
            <li>but my guess is they used them many times to get good results.</li>
            <li>I think the peroxide works best if you don&#x27;t get too much saliva on the strips.  </li>
            <li>It can be an honest mistake lets see when they refund me</li>
            <li>This is a very good product, and a good price for it, but they send me the product close to expire, that&#x27;s the only thing that I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>However, considering I am without the luxury of a dental office where they use the draining tube for that, this product does the job just fine!</li>
            <li>If I have a very important meeting sometimes I will want to whiten my teeth just a bit</li>
            <li>The strips are easy to apply and whiten effectively.</li>
            <li>I have used Crest Whitestrips many times and they stick to my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Crest whitestrips for many years.</li>
            <li>LOVE.  </li>
            <li>It is OK to stop the treatment for a day or two to let the gums heal.</li>
            <li>The bleaching effect works best on yellow stains.</li>
            <li>I decided to stick it out anyway, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I would feel confident in recommending this product to any of my friends.</li>
            <li>I went out and bought the 20 dollar Rembrant set with the gel and trays and it works so much better.  </li>
            <li>Some people can take it better than others, but almost all feel some sort of pain and sensitivity afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise be prepared to pay more than the $28.50 for it.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe this is truly a safe product for repeated use.</li>
            <li>Perhaps we salivate more when we&#x27;re working up a sweat.</li>
            <li>Perhaps we salivate more when we&#x27;re working up a sweat.</li>
            <li>And to help with the cash, be sure to check Crest&#x27;s web site where they sometimes offer coupons for the Whitestrips.</li>
            <li>Overall the Crest Strips are among the best whitening products I have used.</li>
            <li>and I more than recommend it.  </li>
            <li>This helped keep the saliva off of the bottom strip, so it stayed on better.  </li>
            <li>However, the results I did get were a lot better than paying loads more to the dentist.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>They could be whiter for sure</li>
            <li>Overall the product is a great value and a good buy.</li>
            <li>it just seems to work better on my teeth.</li>
            <li>so I feel more</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care how many packages of these you use, it will not work.</li>
            <li>But I managed to get most of them on</li>
            <li>Most everyone noticed w/out even a prompted question to them.</li>
            <li>, some people have more porous teeth than others, and for them it might work.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>It is kind of a hassle to dry up your teeth, gums, and mouth area in order to get a perfect fit.</li>
            <li>I am super glad I bought these!</li>
            <li>During my previous experiences with the strips i experienced no burning, but after i got my braces off, i experienced an unbearable burning.</li>
            <li>The whitestrips worked pretty good.</li>
            <li>These seem to work ok, but the bottom strip can come off easily since saliva accumulates over the 30 minutes period you have to keep these in.  </li>
            <li>I would also suggest not doing anything incredibly vigorous (such as cleaning the house) during that half-hour.</li>

            <li>More comments on whiter teeth and nicer smile than i&#x27;ve ever had in my life !   </li>
            <li>I found this easy to use and my dentist recommended it.</li>
            <li>It whitens and the trays are easy to keep in.  </li>
            <li>I feel a lot more confident when I smile now</li>
            <li>My teetch became noticably whiter very quickly.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really easy to apply and take off, although the gel on the strips can whiten the tips of your fingers if you don&#x27;t wash it off immediately.  </li>
            <li>but they are supposed to be easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel cleaner and look healthier, strong recommends for any caffeine junkies out there.</li>
            <li>Results are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I am on day 5 now and my husband actually said my teeth looked great.</li>
            <li>My teeth look fantastic, but I stop because I don&#x27;t want them to look unnatural.</li>
            <li>Your teeth are some of the first things that people notice about you, and they also are something easy you can do to make yourself look more youthful.</li>
            <li>Your teeth are some of the first things that people notice about you, and they also are something easy you can do to make yourself look more youthful.</li>
            <li>I really think Crest could do a better job of making these strips easy to use.</li>
            <li>The higher the dose of hydrogen peroxide, the most costly the product package.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really excited because after three days of use, I can see some improvement in my teeth already.</li>
            <li>I always prefer the original</li>
            <li>You should use trays and gel, it gives you great results and dosen&#x27;t cost half as much as these strips....stay away!!!!</li>
            <li>The backing should be a different material and the strips should be precut, something more like bandages would be nice.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for taking so good care of my order.    </li>
            <li>Otherwise you could have spots that aren&#x27;t as clean as the others.  </li>
            <li>I truly recommend this vendor, they are the best on customer care, they go the extra mile for our complete satisfaction, I got the product in the expected time and their products are great.    </li>
            <li>I received a free sample of Crest White Strips in the mail and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Many thanks to Israel,    </li>
            <li>Chocolate, anything sweet or acidic all set my teeth on edge.</li>
            <li>This can be true.</li>
            <li>And to help with the cash, be sure to check Crest&#x27;s web site where they sometimes offer coupons for the Whitestrips.hem to your teeth rather than gums as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m someone who brushes my teeth daily and has good dental hygiene, but I&#x27;m also a coffee drinker.</li>
            <li>I make sure the strips are on straight</li>
            <li>The  strips seem to fit my teeth well and should whiten all teeth that show when I smile.</li>
            <li>Now, after the whole 7 days, I am pleased.</li>
            <li>The dentist will cost more, but it will be what you are really expecting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more mild, takes longer, but gentle on the teeth.</li>
            <li>I would usually smile with my lips closed or cover my mouth when I laughed because I wasn&#x27;t confident of my smile.</li>
            <li>also experienced the tooth sensitivity that other reviewers have described.  </li>
            <li>Get that Cali girl bright white smile.  </li>
            <li>For about 2 weeks afterwards I still had a tremendous amount of pain.</li>
            <li>The main thing that I am sure has been mentioned over and over is pain.  </li>
            <li>This above all pleased me the most--</li>
            <li>These strips maintain a bright white smile.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure someone older than my self with a life time of say, smoking, drinking coffee or tea, would probably want to get themselves two boxes.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if extra stripes were given for free just to practice putting it</li>
            <li>If your stains are due to tetracycline (brownish grey stains in a band on your teeth, your best bet is to have a dentist whiten your teeth as the dentist will use a tray to hold a more concentrated form of the chemical on your teeth for a longer period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I saw results instantly, and by the last day my smile was perfect.</li>
            <li>years ago when the original whitestrips first came out, i tried them.  </li>
            <li>It is unlike any other tooth pain I&#x27;ve ever experienced, and I can see why some people would stop after their first encounter with this pain.</li>
            <li>they fit very well also</li>
            <li>There is nothing more gross than seeing someone&#x27;s front teeth bright white</li>
            <li>and i had amazing results from only one strip!  </li>
            <li>the results are WELL WORTH it for me.....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the regular Whitestrips before this and got great results (my sister, a dental hygienist, saw me and exclaimed \\&quot;wow, your teeth are white!\\&quot;), so I was eager to try the Premium Whitestrips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Premium kit will give you 7 days&#x27; worth of strips.</li>
            <li>If the strips start to fall off (and that is rare)</li>
            <li>For the price, it was worth it.  </li>
            <li>Just after couple of days of use I got whiter smile.</li>
            <li>The best part is that, even though I was skeptical about the label mentioning that it lasts for up to a year, I haven&#x27;t used them since those first 7 days and, with daily brushing, my smile is still as bright as it was after day 7.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten countless compliments on how white and beautiful my smile is.  </li>
            <li>It has been 3 days since I stopped using them, and my gums still do not feel right.  </li>
            <li>just when you think you have it right where you want it, you move your tongue and it has rearranged itself.  </li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>Since I only started with my top teeth I felt lucky that they worked</li>
            <li>I kept hearing stories of people&#x27;s teeth becoming really sensitive from these strips.  </li>
            <li>I purposely only did my top teeth at first because I wanted to see if there was a true noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li>Crest White Strips Premium do do a good job of whitening, but they also made my teeth ultra sensitive.</li>
            <li>After using them, I noticed an immediate change in that I smile openly and more often than I have in years.</li>
            <li>They shipping was very fast also.</li>
            <li>However, they have to be used correctly and I recommend that you follow the directions exactly as specified inside the</li>
            <li>Since most people notice the front 6 teeth anyway, this is not a big deal.</li>
            <li>I would higher recommend.</li>
            <li>works really fast!</li>
            <li>to use and really works!</li>
            <li>First they don&#x27;t slide around in your mouth, competing strips I have tried have to be adjusted every time you speak, swallow or breathe...not convenient.</li>
            <li>Okay I am not going to go over the same moans and complains that you have heard everywhere.  </li>
            <li>Also you have got to put them on straight every time!  </li>
            <li>It whitened my teeth, but not to the point of looking funny.  </li>
            <li>Your life surely has 30-minute increments of time that you&#x27;re simply not needing to talk.</li>
            <li>Your life surely has 30-minute increments of time that you&#x27;re simply not needing to talk.</li>
            <li>Im halfway through the box and have noticed whiter teeth, however, Im pretty sure the seller of these has kept white strips from a decade ago and is selling them now.</li>
            <li>After my year is up, I definitely plan on buying more and using this product again</li>
            <li>However, when i started my lower teeth this morning, I found that I have the same problem as many others...............</li>
            <li>buy the strips, they really work!</li>
            <li>The other products in this line are much better and stay on your teeth--doing their job--better than these!  </li>
            <li>I experienced no sensitivity, and only minor burning to my gums.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention, the cost would most definitely drop if a more practical box were implemented for future customers.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Further, you&#x27;d have to apply three on the bottom, and three on the top, else only your front teeth are whitened.  </li>
            <li>i had great results and the whitening actually lasted longer than i had expected.  </li>
            <li>but they are absolutely good enough (especially at only $25).</li>
            <li>That little bit of pain was worth it to me to have a better smile.</li>
            <li>The Premium and Premium Pro are likely to give you more sensitivity than the Classic.  </li>
            <li>The Premium and Premium Pro are likely to give you more sensitivity than the Classic.  </li>
            <li>I also used the Classic Crest Strips and these definitely worked faster and better.</li>
            <li>The peroxide isn&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
            <li>Things are prescribed a certain way for a reason.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say how well it works long term, but the short term effects were good.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how safe that could be, but it&#x27;s not very promising to me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no burning of gums and have experienced only a slight sensitivity to my teeth.</li>
            <li>This was due to the problem that I didn&#x27;t position the strips perfectly and the ends usually start falling off.</li>
            <li>Application was pretty easy - be sure to press down the strip as much as possible as a lot of saliva collects while they are on.</li>
            <li>Their fine to finish my whitening routine right now, but I will order the up-to-date strips (i think only a few bucks more) with \\&quot;advance seal technology\\</li>
            <li>This really helps.  </li>
            <li>Also, why not make the lower strips as wide as the top?</li>
            <li>They got whiter, but not by  much.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>if you can afford it, go to the dentist and get the real stuff done.  </li>
            <li>I happen to have one porcelain veneer in the front of my mouth, and I found that while the strips whitened my teeth, they didn&#x27;t do it so much that it made my veneer look out of place.  </li>
            <li>Then apply the strips, trying to limit them to your teeth rather than gums as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, you really can&#x27;t talk very well while they&#x27;re in your mouth, and you feel a bit like you&#x27;re foaming at the mouth.</li>
            <li>I decided to go forth and purchase them anyhow because the resounding tone was that the strips really did work.  </li>
            <li>and I really like the results.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know what to say.</li>
            <li>The goal being to keep the strips from getting diluted with too much saliva and keep the strips from shifting around in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>but the sensitivity is very tolerable for me.</li>
            <li>The product works very well.</li>
            <li>For some reason these strips bothered my gums and they were very sore after using the strips two times.</li>
            <li>they really work</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really carry a toothbrush and tooth paste around me all the time, I guess I should look into chewing whitening gums.</li>
            <li>This product really works, no bs.</li>
            <li>i guess partly because i drink too much coffee...</li>
            <li>This is much more expensive, but eh concentration of hydrogen peroide is much higher and this works better on stubbornly-stained teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is much more expensive, but eh concentration of hydrogen peroide is much higher and this works better on stubbornly-stained teeth.       </li>
            <li>The original Whitestrips supposedly last 6 months.</li>
            <li>The classic strips have a thicker whitener, these have a very runny whitener that sticks to the plastic the strips come on.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to apply and usually stay on for the full time once they are applied.</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums are pretty sensitive</li>
            <li>Try to tolerate the sensitivity if it is mild, but if more severe, take a day or two off to let the teeth settle down and then pick up where you left off.</li>
            <li>The main difference is in the strength of the hydrogen peroxide, and the price.  </li>
            <li>Younger people with yellow stains seem to respond better than older people or those with gray stains.  </li>
            <li>The Classic works in 2 weeks and is about $1.80 a day.  </li>

            <li>The Classic works in 2 weeks and is about $1.80 a day.  </li>
            <li>I like the &#x27;classic strips&#x27; from Crest...and these are not them.  </li>
            <li>Some gripes: I wish they made the upper strip longer to cover more of the upper teeth</li>
            <li>and I wish they had cut the lower strip better because you can very well see 3/4 of an inch wasted when you peel off the lower strip from its plastic backing.</li>
            <li>I had trouble with making sure it is in the right position because I kept thinking if it was too far to the right or left.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for these, but after using them I couldn&#x27;t see the slightest difference and</li>
            <li>Something in your mouth, which shouldn&#x27;t be there, but you&#x27;ll be able to work around it with a little practice.  </li>
            <li>Before applying the strips, dry your mouth and teeth with a clean towel.</li>
            <li>You may notice the distinct difference between the back (unbleached) teeth and the front (bleached) teeth.</li>
            <li>Does anyone know if this is normal?  </li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re like me, and just had a bit of a yellow tint to your teeth and want to brighten your smile a bit, this product will do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There were quite a few stickers on top of the box indicating this product was not for resale????  </li>
            <li>and I found that they were not hard to place on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>box lasts me at least a year, but I am not a fanatic about white teeth, maybe because I was blessed with good teeth.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used them in about a year, but today I decided to resume my whitening again with a new box of premium whitestrips.  </li>
            <li>they are very easy to put in and there is hardly any taste if at all.</li>
            <li>The cheapest method (at around 25 dollars, is the Crest Classic Whitestrips, but it takes 2 weeks to complete the treatment).  </li>
            <li>If you are not satisfied with the results and still want whiter teeth, you can then see your dentist for a more concentrated form of bleaching using a custom-tray system or in-office bleaching.  </li>

            <li>After the first day, I can tell that the whitening effect is stronger; however, the overall result is probably diminished by the difficulty of usage.    </li>
            <li>I gave this five stars because it DEFINITELY whitens AND WHITENS FAST!    </li>
            <li>In fact, just a couple of months ago I  did the entire 7-day process and within the first two uses</li>
            <li>Everyone asks if I got my teeth professionally whitened!</li>
            <li>No staining just a pretty white</li>
            <li>The strips were in the regular Crest plastic container, however the circular tape that was holding the top down was not stuck on the container</li>
            <li>I had previously used a generic store brand and had hoped to achieve better results with these.</li>
            <li>I would suggest you do it exactly as prescribed rather than following the other reviewer&#x27;s claim that it&#x27;s okay to wear them back to back for an hour.</li>
            <li>Plus next time just because there are more strips and that way, if I want to brighten a little more in a few months, there are the extra strips.</li>
            <li>It does the job but can make your gums extremely sensitive.  </li>
            <li>White Strips don&#x27;t work as fast as a dentist-made custom tray bleaching, (or in-office bleaching) but over time, you will get a result that will be close to that of a dentist, and you will save money too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>WOW ...</li>
            <li>A tip for anyone with sensitive teeth: clenching my jaw or rubbing the gum area directly below the affected teeth helped with the severity of the pain.</li>
            <li>Another important thing is that they will not fit everyone&#x27;s teeth.  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product for anyone with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Things are sensitive, so give your mouth and gums a rest.</li>
            <li>Things are sensitive, so give your mouth and gums a rest.</li>
            <li>The only real caution is--DON&#x27;T SNEEZE.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had professionally whitened teeth</li>
            <li>the box says, I noticed results after the third day and by the end of the week my teeth were very noticeably whiter.</li>
            <li>the money from these and go to the dentist and have a professional zoom whitening.</li>
            <li>Seemed like old product that was expired.  </li>
            <li>However, if you have a wide toothy smile, you may want to have a dentist</li>
            <li>So unless you put the excess stips on the rest, you have some white, and some yellow teeth when you smile.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, the verdict for this for me is that it&#x27;s a really good alternative to whitening your teeth for an expensive cost at the dentist because it works well and is affordable.  </li>
            <li>The only downside to it is that I had a strange after taste from the chemicals, but I easily solved this problem by chewing minty-fresh gum daily, which is something I would have done anyways.</li>
            <li>The main thing that you should really think about is the fact that if you need deep cleaning all over, then this isn&#x27;t for you because they really only do the front teeth.  </li>
            <li>In short, I would like to see a more environmentally and financially responsible company helping me achieve my shallow need for whiter teeth.</li>
            <li>You can do the math and see what&#x27;s worth it to you financially (and if you really think it will last as long as claimed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Something about having that gap in treatments during the day seems to give the teeth time to calm down and be ready for the next session.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Crest White Strips Classic (6% hydrogen peroxide, 14-day treatment).  </li>
            <li>recommend starting with with either the Classic or the Premium-Pro.</li>

            <li>My husband tried it later and for him, it hurt his gums and teeth and his first strip was his last.  </li>
            <li>Admittedly, my expectations for this product weren&#x27;t that high prior to using it, but I think they exceeded those expectations in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>First brush your teeth with a wet toothbrush to remove the layer of plaque</li>
            <li>I had tried the Listerine Dissolving Strips, TOTAL waste, I think I saw more difference just using regular whitening toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>have only two days left of this round of Chrst Whitestrips, and I&#x27;m already incredibly pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>have only two days left of this round of Chrst Whitestrips, and I&#x27;m already incredibly pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I found that the only way to make sure the strips didn&#x27;t slide around was to wipe my teeth dry before I applied them (i.e. the same concept as when the dentist uses an air tube to dry an area of your mouth before he works in it).  </li>
            <li>so I lay on my back and look at the ceiling for the whole 30 minutes letting the saliva pool in the back of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>Will report back on the final result once I&#x27;ve finished the whole treatment.</li>
            <li>If you have very sensitive teeth I would recommend using crest regular (14 days) system.</li>
            <li>What I mean is, unlike the basic strips, I&#x27;m noticing lots more sensitivity with the Premium ones.</li>
            <li>Other Crest whitestrips are more heavy duty and do not have this problem.</li>
            <li>They whiten OK, but are difficult to work with, particularly the bottom.  </li>
            <li>It made my teeth look bright and white, but not like fake white</li>
            <li>If your teeth become too sensitive, back off on the strips until the sensitivity is gone before resuming</li>
            <li>I have seen big ones that they will not cover completely regardless.  </li>
            <li>I constantly have to fix them - or give up and take them off early.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 27 years old though, so my teeth were just starting to get that yellow-ish tint to them.</li>
            <li>It worked wonders for my boyfriend, which is why it&#x27;s getting 4 stars, but it barely did anything for me...</li>
            <li>For anyone who has tried whitening strips in the past, Crest White Strips offer significant benefits.</li>
            <li>This product may be very effective when used correctly, but I cannot recommend it simply because it is nearly impossible to use correctly.</li>
            <li>Is this huge, plastic box really necessary to carry 28 one millimeter thick strips?  </li>
            <li>After the first application I felt a little soreness on the area where I applied the strips.</li>
            <li>Also told me that the results are directly proportional to how long you leave the strips on.  </li>
            <li>The stripes barely covered enough teeth for me.   </li>
            <li>My teeth were already pretty white, but wanted a little brighter.  </li>
            <li>Too much tea had made my teeth look less than sparkling</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m getting braces in a month, and i wanted quick results that would last at least through a portion of my treatment.  </li>
            <li>Not uncomfortable, just a bit odd, at least at first.</li>
            <li>My gums burned a little but not any real pain.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t help but think that those who just quickly apply them and do other things will end up with uneven results.    </li>
            <li>The strips are really hard to put on, and they only cover a 8 teeth, when 10 teeth show when you smile.  </li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t put them on perfectly, I found, that they would just fall off</li>
            <li> great product!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the results and recommend them.</li>
            <li> excellent product.</li>
            <li> I chose this item based on the best price I could find on the internet.</li>
            <li> Excellent product..</li>
            <li> But when i did use them before i had braces, the effects were incredible.</li>
            <li> and so I had real nice pearly whites for my wedding.  </li>
            <li> and I still had great results.  </li>
            <li> This product is great.  </li>
            <li> I know there are people out there who are happy with them</li>
            <li> This worked GREAT.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was happy with the results for about a month.</li>
            <li> The gel stays on the teeth and tastes like a pleasant toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> With this info, I used the strips with good results and no discomfort.    </li>
            <li> So reading, watching the news, driving to work, vegetating-these are all good</li>
            <li> So reading, watching the news, driving to work, vegetating-these are all good</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have a comparison but find these results good for the cost.</li>
            <li> Good luck, trying to make that work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so great as expected...they do looks better though.</li>
            <li> I can not imagine fighting with the strips on my lower teeth for 6 more days!</li>
            <li> and I must say I&#x27;m actually pretty impressed.</li>
            <li> the first time we were amazed at the results!!!!</li>
            <li> but it was still effective.</li>
            <li> so I thought it might be wise to stay away from these after reading some of the reviews, however I was able to use them with no pain at all.</li>
            <li> Instead, rinse with slightly warm water, and take your index finger and \\&quot;brush\\</li>
            <li> Instead, rinse with slightly warm water, and take your index finger and \\&quot;brush\\</li>
            <li> but my guess is they used them many times to get good results.</li>
            <li> I think the peroxide works best if you don&#x27;t get too much saliva on the strips.  </li>
            <li> It can be an honest mistake lets see when they refund me</li>
            <li> This is a very good product, and a good price for it, but they send me the product close to expire, that&#x27;s the only thing that I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> However, considering I am without the luxury of a dental office where they use the draining tube for that, this product does the job just fine!</li>
            <li> If I have a very important meeting sometimes I will want to whiten my teeth just a bit</li>
            <li> The strips are easy to apply and whiten effectively.</li>
            <li> I have used Crest Whitestrips many times and they stick to my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest whitestrips for many years.</li>
            <li> LOVE.  </li>
            <li> It is OK to stop the treatment for a day or two to let the gums heal.</li>
            <li> The bleaching effect works best on yellow stains.</li>
            <li> I decided to stick it out anyway, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I would feel confident in recommending this product to any of my friends.</li>
            <li> I went out and bought the 20 dollar Rembrant set with the gel and trays and it works so much better.  </li>
            <li> Some people can take it better than others, but almost all feel some sort of pain and sensitivity afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise be prepared to pay more than the $28.50 for it.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe this is truly a safe product for repeated use.</li>
            <li> Perhaps we salivate more when we&#x27;re working up a sweat.</li>

            <li> And to help with the cash, be sure to check Crest&#x27;s web site where they sometimes offer coupons for the Whitestrips.</li>
            <li> Overall the Crest Strips are among the best whitening products I have used.</li>
            <li> and I more than recommend it.  </li>
            <li> This helped keep the saliva off of the bottom strip, so it stayed on better.  </li>
            <li> However, the results I did get were a lot better than paying loads more to the dentist.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> They could be whiter for sure</li>
            <li> Overall the product is a great value and a good buy.</li>
            <li> it just seems to work better on my teeth.</li>
            <li> so I feel more</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care how many packages of these you use, it will not work.</li>
            <li> But I managed to get most of them on</li>
            <li> Most everyone noticed w/out even a prompted question to them.</li>
            <li> , some people have more porous teeth than others, and for them it might work.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product.</li>
            <li> It is kind of a hassle to dry up your teeth, gums, and mouth area in order to get a perfect fit.</li>
            <li> I am super glad I bought these!</li>
            <li> During my previous experiences with the strips i experienced no burning, but after i got my braces off, i experienced an unbearable burning.</li>
            <li> The whitestrips worked pretty good.</li>
            <li> These seem to work ok, but the bottom strip can come off easily since saliva accumulates over the 30 minutes period you have to keep these in.  </li>
            <li> I would also suggest not doing anything incredibly vigorous (such as cleaning the house) during that half-hour.</li>

            <li> More comments on whiter teeth and nicer smile than i&#x27;ve ever had in my life !   </li>
            <li> I found this easy to use and my dentist recommended it.</li>
            <li> It whitens and the trays are easy to keep in.  </li>
            <li> I feel a lot more confident when I smile now</li>
            <li> My teetch became noticably whiter very quickly.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really easy to apply and take off, although the gel on the strips can whiten the tips of your fingers if you don&#x27;t wash it off immediately.  </li>
            <li> but they are supposed to be easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel cleaner and look healthier, strong recommends for any caffeine junkies out there.</li>
            <li> Results are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I am on day 5 now and my husband actually said my teeth looked great.</li>
            <li> My teeth look fantastic, but I stop because I don&#x27;t want them to look unnatural.</li>

            <li> I really think Crest could do a better job of making these strips easy to use.</li>
            <li> The higher the dose of hydrogen peroxide, the most costly the product package.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really excited because after three days of use, I can see some improvement in my teeth already.</li>
            <li> I always prefer the original</li>
            <li> You should use trays and gel, it gives you great results and dosen&#x27;t cost half as much as these strips....stay away!!!!</li>
            <li> The backing should be a different material and the strips should be precut, something more like bandages would be nice.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for taking so good care of my order.    </li>
            <li> Otherwise you could have spots that aren&#x27;t as clean as the others.  </li>
            <li> I truly recommend this vendor, they are the best on customer care, they go the extra mile for our complete satisfaction, I got the product in the expected time and their products are great.    </li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Crest White Strips in the mail and I am very pleased with the results.</li>

            <li> I make sure the strips are on straight</li>
            <li> The  strips seem to fit my teeth well and should whiten all teeth that show when I smile.</li>
            <li> Now, after the whole 7 days, I am pleased.</li>
            <li> The dentist will cost more, but it will be what you are really expecting.</li>

            <li> This above all pleased me the most--</li>
            <li> These strips maintain a bright white smile.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure someone older than my self with a life time of say, smoking, drinking coffee or tea, would probably want to get themselves two boxes.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if extra stripes were given for free just to practice putting it</li>
            <li> If your stains are due to tetracycline (brownish grey stains in a band on your teeth, your best bet is to have a dentist whiten your teeth as the dentist will use a tray to hold a more concentrated form of the chemical on your teeth for a longer period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I saw results instantly, and by the last day my smile was perfect.</li>
            <li> years ago when the original whitestrips first came out, i tried them.  </li>
            <li> It is unlike any other tooth pain I&#x27;ve ever experienced, and I can see why some people would stop after their first encounter with this pain.</li>
            <li> they fit very well also</li>
            <li> There is nothing more gross than seeing someone&#x27;s front teeth bright white</li>
            <li> and i had amazing results from only one strip!  </li>
            <li> the results are WELL WORTH it for me.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the regular Whitestrips before this and got great results (my sister, a dental hygienist, saw me and exclaimed \\&quot;wow, your teeth are white!\\&quot;), so I was eager to try the Premium Whitestrips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Premium kit will give you 7 days&#x27; worth of strips.</li>
            <li> If the strips start to fall off (and that is rare)</li>
            <li> For the price, it was worth it.  </li>
            <li> Just after couple of days of use I got whiter smile.</li>
            <li> The best part is that, even though I was skeptical about the label mentioning that it lasts for up to a year, I haven&#x27;t used them since those first 7 days and, with daily brushing, my smile is still as bright as it was after day 7.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten countless compliments on how white and beautiful my smile is.  </li>
            <li> It has been 3 days since I stopped using them, and my gums still do not feel right.  </li>
            <li> just when you think you have it right where you want it, you move your tongue and it has rearranged itself.  </li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> Since I only started with my top teeth I felt lucky that they worked</li>
            <li> I kept hearing stories of people&#x27;s teeth becoming really sensitive from these strips.  </li>
            <li> I purposely only did my top teeth at first because I wanted to see if there was a true noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li> Crest White Strips Premium do do a good job of whitening, but they also made my teeth ultra sensitive.</li>
            <li> After using them, I noticed an immediate change in that I smile openly and more often than I have in years.</li>
            <li> They shipping was very fast also.</li>
            <li> However, they have to be used correctly and I recommend that you follow the directions exactly as specified inside the</li>
            <li> Since most people notice the front 6 teeth anyway, this is not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I would higher recommend.</li>
            <li> works really fast!</li>
            <li> to use and really works!</li>
            <li> First they don&#x27;t slide around in your mouth, competing strips I have tried have to be adjusted every time you speak, swallow or breathe...not convenient.</li>
            <li> Okay I am not going to go over the same moans and complains that you have heard everywhere.  </li>
            <li> Also you have got to put them on straight every time!  </li>
            <li> It whitened my teeth, but not to the point of looking funny.  </li>
            <li> Your life surely has 30-minute increments of time that you&#x27;re simply not needing to talk.</li>
            <li> Your life surely has 30-minute increments of time that you&#x27;re simply not needing to talk.</li>
            <li> Im halfway through the box and have noticed whiter teeth, however, Im pretty sure the seller of these has kept white strips from a decade ago and is selling them now.</li>
            <li> After my year is up, I definitely plan on buying more and using this product again</li>
            <li> However, when i started my lower teeth this morning, I found that I have the same problem as many others...............</li>
            <li> buy the strips, they really work!</li>
            <li> The other products in this line are much better and stay on your teeth--doing their job--better than these!  </li>
            <li> I experienced no sensitivity, and only minor burning to my gums.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention, the cost would most definitely drop if a more practical box were implemented for future customers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Further, you&#x27;d have to apply three on the bottom, and three on the top, else only your front teeth are whitened.  </li>
            <li> i had great results and the whitening actually lasted longer than i had expected.  </li>
            <li> but they are absolutely good enough (especially at only $25).</li>
            <li> That little bit of pain was worth it to me to have a better smile.</li>
            <li> The Premium and Premium Pro are likely to give you more sensitivity than the Classic.  </li>
            <li> The Premium and Premium Pro are likely to give you more sensitivity than the Classic.  </li>
            <li> I also used the Classic Crest Strips and these definitely worked faster and better.</li>
            <li> The peroxide isn&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
            <li> Things are prescribed a certain way for a reason.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say how well it works long term, but the short term effects were good.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how safe that could be, but it&#x27;s not very promising to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no burning of gums and have experienced only a slight sensitivity to my teeth.</li>
            <li> This was due to the problem that I didn&#x27;t position the strips perfectly and the ends usually start falling off.</li>
            <li> Application was pretty easy - be sure to press down the strip as much as possible as a lot of saliva collects while they are on.</li>
            <li> Their fine to finish my whitening routine right now, but I will order the up-to-date strips (i think only a few bucks more) with \\&quot;advance seal technology\\</li>
            <li> This really helps.  </li>
            <li> Also, why not make the lower strips as wide as the top?</li>
            <li> They got whiter, but not by  much.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> if you can afford it, go to the dentist and get the real stuff done.  </li>
            <li> I happen to have one porcelain veneer in the front of my mouth, and I found that while the strips whitened my teeth, they didn&#x27;t do it so much that it made my veneer look out of place.  </li>
            <li> Then apply the strips, trying to limit them to your teeth rather than gums as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, you really can&#x27;t talk very well while they&#x27;re in your mouth, and you feel a bit like you&#x27;re foaming at the mouth.</li>
            <li> I decided to go forth and purchase them anyhow because the resounding tone was that the strips really did work.  </li>
            <li> and I really like the results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what to say.</li>
            <li> The goal being to keep the strips from getting diluted with too much saliva and keep the strips from shifting around in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> but the sensitivity is very tolerable for me.</li>
            <li> The product works very well.</li>
            <li> For some reason these strips bothered my gums and they were very sore after using the strips two times.</li>
            <li> they really work</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really carry a toothbrush and tooth paste around me all the time, I guess I should look into chewing whitening gums.</li>
            <li> This product really works, no bs.</li>
            <li> i guess partly because i drink too much coffee...</li>
            <li> This is much more expensive, but eh concentration of hydrogen peroide is much higher and this works better on stubbornly-stained teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is much more expensive, but eh concentration of hydrogen peroide is much higher and this works better on stubbornly-stained teeth.       </li>
            <li> The original Whitestrips supposedly last 6 months.</li>
            <li> The classic strips have a thicker whitener, these have a very runny whitener that sticks to the plastic the strips come on.  </li>
            <li> They are easy to apply and usually stay on for the full time once they are applied.</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums are pretty sensitive</li>
            <li> Try to tolerate the sensitivity if it is mild, but if more severe, take a day or two off to let the teeth settle down and then pick up where you left off.</li>
            <li> The main difference is in the strength of the hydrogen peroxide, and the price.  </li>
            <li> Younger people with yellow stains seem to respond better than older people or those with gray stains.  </li>
            <li> The Classic works in 2 weeks and is about $1.80 a day.  </li>

            <li> The Classic works in 2 weeks and is about $1.80 a day.  </li>
            <li> I like the &#x27;classic strips&#x27; from Crest...and these are not them.  </li>
            <li> Some gripes: I wish they made the upper strip longer to cover more of the upper teeth</li>
            <li> and I wish they had cut the lower strip better because you can very well see 3/4 of an inch wasted when you peel off the lower strip from its plastic backing.</li>
            <li> I had trouble with making sure it is in the right position because I kept thinking if it was too far to the right or left.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for these, but after using them I couldn&#x27;t see the slightest difference and</li>
            <li> Something in your mouth, which shouldn&#x27;t be there, but you&#x27;ll be able to work around it with a little practice.  </li>
            <li> Before applying the strips, dry your mouth and teeth with a clean towel.</li>
            <li> You may notice the distinct difference between the back (unbleached) teeth and the front (bleached) teeth.</li>
            <li> Does anyone know if this is normal?  </li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re like me, and just had a bit of a yellow tint to your teeth and want to brighten your smile a bit, this product will do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There were quite a few stickers on top of the box indicating this product was not for resale????  </li>
            <li> and I found that they were not hard to place on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> box lasts me at least a year, but I am not a fanatic about white teeth, maybe because I was blessed with good teeth.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them in about a year, but today I decided to resume my whitening again with a new box of premium whitestrips.  </li>
            <li> they are very easy to put in and there is hardly any taste if at all.</li>
            <li> The cheapest method (at around 25 dollars, is the Crest Classic Whitestrips, but it takes 2 weeks to complete the treatment).  </li>
            <li> If you are not satisfied with the results and still want whiter teeth, you can then see your dentist for a more concentrated form of bleaching using a custom-tray system or in-office bleaching.  </li>

            <li> After the first day, I can tell that the whitening effect is stronger; however, the overall result is probably diminished by the difficulty of usage.    </li>
            <li> I gave this five stars because it DEFINITELY whitens AND WHITENS FAST!    </li>
            <li> In fact, just a couple of months ago I  did the entire 7-day process and within the first two uses</li>
            <li> Everyone asks if I got my teeth professionally whitened!</li>
            <li> No staining just a pretty white</li>
            <li> The strips were in the regular Crest plastic container, however the circular tape that was holding the top down was not stuck on the container</li>
            <li> I had previously used a generic store brand and had hoped to achieve better results with these.</li>
            <li> I would suggest you do it exactly as prescribed rather than following the other reviewer&#x27;s claim that it&#x27;s okay to wear them back to back for an hour.</li>
            <li> Plus next time just because there are more strips and that way, if I want to brighten a little more in a few months, there are the extra strips.</li>
            <li> It does the job but can make your gums extremely sensitive.  </li>
            <li> White Strips don&#x27;t work as fast as a dentist-made custom tray bleaching, (or in-office bleaching) but over time, you will get a result that will be close to that of a dentist, and you will save money too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> WOW ...</li>
            <li> A tip for anyone with sensitive teeth: clenching my jaw or rubbing the gum area directly below the affected teeth helped with the severity of the pain.</li>
            <li> Another important thing is that they will not fit everyone&#x27;s teeth.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product for anyone with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Things are sensitive, so give your mouth and gums a rest.</li>
            <li> Things are sensitive, so give your mouth and gums a rest.</li>
            <li> The only real caution is--DON&#x27;T SNEEZE.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had professionally whitened teeth</li>
            <li> the box says, I noticed results after the third day and by the end of the week my teeth were very noticeably whiter.</li>
            <li> the money from these and go to the dentist and have a professional zoom whitening.</li>
            <li> Seemed like old product that was expired.  </li>
            <li> However, if you have a wide toothy smile, you may want to have a dentist</li>
            <li> So unless you put the excess stips on the rest, you have some white, and some yellow teeth when you smile.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, the verdict for this for me is that it&#x27;s a really good alternative to whitening your teeth for an expensive cost at the dentist because it works well and is affordable.  </li>
            <li> The only downside to it is that I had a strange after taste from the chemicals, but I easily solved this problem by chewing minty-fresh gum daily, which is something I would have done anyways.</li>
            <li> The main thing that you should really think about is the fact that if you need deep cleaning all over, then this isn&#x27;t for you because they really only do the front teeth.  </li>
            <li> In short, I would like to see a more environmentally and financially responsible company helping me achieve my shallow need for whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> You can do the math and see what&#x27;s worth it to you financially (and if you really think it will last as long as claimed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Something about having that gap in treatments during the day seems to give the teeth time to calm down and be ready for the next session.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Crest White Strips Classic (6% hydrogen peroxide, 14-day treatment).  </li>
            <li> recommend starting with with either the Classic or the Premium-Pro.</li>
            <li> I recommend starting with with either the Classic or the Premium-Pro.</li>
            <li> My husband tried it later and for him, it hurt his gums and teeth and his first strip was his last.  </li>
            <li> Admittedly, my expectations for this product weren&#x27;t that high prior to using it, but I think they exceeded those expectations in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> First brush your teeth with a wet toothbrush to remove the layer of plaque</li>
            <li> I had tried the Listerine Dissolving Strips, TOTAL waste, I think I saw more difference just using regular whitening toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> have only two days left of this round of Chrst Whitestrips, and I&#x27;m already incredibly pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> have only two days left of this round of Chrst Whitestrips, and I&#x27;m already incredibly pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I found that the only way to make sure the strips didn&#x27;t slide around was to wipe my teeth dry before I applied them (i.e. the same concept as when the dentist uses an air tube to dry an area of your mouth before he works in it).  </li>
            <li> so I lay on my back and look at the ceiling for the whole 30 minutes letting the saliva pool in the back of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Will report back on the final result once I&#x27;ve finished the whole treatment.</li>
            <li> If you have very sensitive teeth I would recommend using crest regular (14 days) system.</li>
            <li> What I mean is, unlike the basic strips, I&#x27;m noticing lots more sensitivity with the Premium ones.</li>
            <li> Other Crest whitestrips are more heavy duty and do not have this problem.</li>
            <li> They whiten OK, but are difficult to work with, particularly the bottom.  </li>
            <li> It made my teeth look bright and white, but not like fake white</li>
            <li> If your teeth become too sensitive, back off on the strips until the sensitivity is gone before resuming</li>
            <li> I have seen big ones that they will not cover completely regardless.  </li>
            <li> I constantly have to fix them - or give up and take them off early.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27 years old though, so my teeth were just starting to get that yellow-ish tint to them.</li>
            <li> It worked wonders for my boyfriend, which is why it&#x27;s getting 4 stars, but it barely did anything for me...</li>
            <li> For anyone who has tried whitening strips in the past, Crest White Strips offer significant benefits.</li>
            <li> This product may be very effective when used correctly, but I cannot recommend it simply because it is nearly impossible to use correctly.</li>
            <li> Is this huge, plastic box really necessary to carry 28 one millimeter thick strips?  </li>
            <li> After the first application I felt a little soreness on the area where I applied the strips.</li>
            <li> Also told me that the results are directly proportional to how long you leave the strips on.  </li>
            <li> The stripes barely covered enough teeth for me.   </li>
            <li> My teeth were already pretty white, but wanted a little brighter.  </li>
            <li> Too much tea had made my teeth look less than sparkling</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m getting braces in a month, and i wanted quick results that would last at least through a portion of my treatment.  </li>
            <li> Not uncomfortable, just a bit odd, at least at first.</li>
            <li> My gums burned a little but not any real pain.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t help but think that those who just quickly apply them and do other things will end up with uneven results.    </li>
            <li> The strips are really hard to put on, and they only cover a 8 teeth, when 10 teeth show when you smile.  </li>
            <li> It was at least a year before I noticed a less white smile, and then I just bought a new pack.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Contrary to what some reviewers are stating here, the difference between the different Whitestrips are not how white they make your teeth, but how long the whiteness will last.</li>
            <li> If you notice a burning sensation when you use the product, it is the chemical oxidizing (or burning) your gums (it will turn them white with a minor chemical burn).</li>
            <li> Actually, I noticed whiter teeth after even the first day, but by day three, I was feeling a few shades shy of Regis Philbin&#x27;s pearly (okay, stark) whites.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There was a little mild sensitivity, usually immediately after use and would disappear throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Other than that I had no gum pain or anything, nor did it turn my gums white like it warns is possible.</li>
            <li> The strips are very thin and shift easily</li>
            <li> Seriously, this is a huge waste.  </li>
            <li> But the directions do say that it is not for people with weak teeth and gums and not to use it right after brushing.  </li>
            <li> You may notice much more sensitivity to cold water, ice cream, etc.  </li>
            <li> I spent the entire time they were on in front of the mirror adjusting and dealing with saliva.</li>
            <li> plus other people even say How did you get your teeth so white???!!!!</li>
            <li> Asked my dentist friend and he told me that is likely due to getting the material (peroxide) on the gums.  </li>
            <li> In this case, it may be due to the time necessary for your teeth to \\&quot;recover\\&quot; from the treatments.</li>
            <li> The taste can last a little longer than the 7 days, but within the next week it was gone.</li>
            <li> It did hurt my gums a little bit a few times but not so much that I was in agony or anything.  </li>
            <li> This particular whitestrip is flimsy and hard to use.</li>
            <li> Strips do take a bit getting used to as they can slide around and you have to be very careful when putting them on, but I would definitely use them again.  </li>
            <li> was only semi-pleased with the results only because of a few factors I encoutered.</li>
            <li> You have a sort of raw feeling like you get when you cut yourself, but not deep enough to make it bleed.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure why Crest recently came out with \\&quot;Renewal\\&quot;, as it is a 9.5% hydrogen peroxide formulation which is not significantly different from the 10% concentration.</li>
            <li> And finally b/c the strips adhere tightly to the surface of your teeth</li>
            <li> After about 4 minutes of wearing the strips, I experienced the WORST PAIN</li>
            <li> so I expected to have some of the symptoms described in the reviews, but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days and it has worked a lot</li>
            <li> I had to keep it closed with tape.</li>
            <li> Or if you have to sneeze, keep your mouth firmly closed.  </li>
            <li> I did notice my gums were a bit sore while brushing my teeth a few days after the last day of the strips, but hey, no pain, no gain.</li>
            <li> I expected them to stick to my teeth</li>
            <li> &quot; it was completly empty with the instructions I am asking for a refund I will let you know what happens..</li>
            <li> My only discouragement is how can I maintain that result if I drink coffee and tea everyday?</li>
            <li> , they are supposed to work after only a few treatments.  </li>
            <li> My hygenist said people with thin teeth or thin enamel experience the most sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> It did make my teeth a little whiter but not completely white, I&#x27;m not sure if a second box of that will help.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that they&#x27;re a little pricey (use coupons).</li>
            <li> the solvent is equally distributed and you don&#x27;t get a messy half-white, half coffee-colored look on your face.</li>
            <li> so you would look stupid with both white and yellow teeth when you smile.</li>
            <li> I would describe the the pain as sharp zaps that come and go.</li>
            <li> I just press them firmly back into place with a cotton swab and that usually does the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had yellowed teeth for years, probably due to coffee and tea comsumption.    </li>
            <li> I thought that they would stick to your teeth allowing you to go about other things</li>
            <li> In a time when conservation is a buzz word and petroleum products should be kept to a minimum for a variety of reasons, Crest decides to package a tiny product in a small boat.  </li>
            <li> They do whiten, but you have to be very careful while they are on your teeth</li>
            <li> The peroxide causes an inflamation of the inner pulp, or nerve center of the tooth and makes the teeth very sensitive to biting or cold drinks or foods.  </li>
            <li> , if I go more then a few days, my teeth start to get sensitive, which I find very annoying, so I stop.</li>
            <li> other reviewers have stated, after a few days of using the product your gums may become a bit sore.</li>
            <li> paid 40 bucks for these, and half are still in the box.  </li>
            <li> The peroxide will slightly foam in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> Hot or cold foods were AGONY on my teeth.</li>

            <li> I do not recommend getting this specific type due to the poor quality.</li>
            <li> However, there is very little after taste--and my teeth look cleaner without look other worldly.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve got nothing to lose but some gray-yellow staining and a little bit of cash.</li>

            <li> Or, get those little teeth trays, put baking soda in the trays, and take a shower or do something which won&#x27;t make you swallow much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are a little messy.  </li>
            <li> The box warns about tooth/gum sensitivity, and I have heard of some people having a difficult time with it, but personally it has been quite minimal.  </li>
            <li> and I wasted them.</li>
            <li> esp for my husband who is a heavy coffee drinker, pop drinker and smoker.</li>
            <li> It felt as it the pain was coming from inside my bottom teeth, and I actually was nauseated from the pain</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve read reviews that state people have had pain in their gums and teeth, I&#x27;ve not had a bit of trouble with pain.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after a few applications.  </li>
            <li> Not the glow in the dark, frighteningly unnatural white that you often see on people who have had a dental bleaching</li>
            <li> The only other annoying thing was that if I swallowed I got nauseous (probably from the peroxide on the strips, some of which in all likelihood gets mixed into your saliva).  </li>
            <li> Over the years my teeth had built up yellow-ish stains and my smile was definitely not very white, though it wasn&#x27;t terrible.</li>
            <li> the only thing for me is YES the first 3-5 minutes my gums burn and it is uncomfortable but not too bad..</li>
            <li> So while it was ultimately the least unpleasant to let a big wad of spit accumulate in my mouth (and then spit when I was removing the strips), it was not exactly enjoyable.  </li>
            <li> and I noticed that a few of the reviews said that the strips were hard to place on the teeth.  </li>
            <li> Applying the strips has a small learning curve as you will probably bend or fold a couple of them before you get the technique</li>
            <li> , I am a small person with small teeth.  </li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> The bottom strips are too small to cover your teeth and they float off in your saliva.</li>
            <li> Some tips I learned the hard way:    </li>
            <li> The strips are hard to keep on for 20 minutes, and the product tastes gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Others have mentioned that it&#x27;s hard to keep the lower strip in place.</li>
            <li> but instead they&#x27;re hard to keep in place.  </li>
            <li> comes the confusing part</li>
            <li> knew I wouldn&#x27;t get the same gleaming results as I would by getting my teeth whitened at the dentist office; anyone who has those kinds of expectations from a $25.00 grocery store item is setting themselves up for disappointment.</li>
            <li> The only thing I disliked about them was that they were extremely annoying to deal with and the taste it would leave.</li>
            <li> Warning: If you have sensitive teeth you may hate this product.  </li>
            <li> 30 minutes is a really long time to keep something disgusting and slippery on your teeth though -- I wonder if there is a way they could make a product that would only take 10 or 15 minutes?</li>
            <li> I did notice sensitivity but it wasn&#x27;t that painful, but my fingers were stinging really badly when I didn&#x27;t wash them right away after applying them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They were very painful and made my teeth very sensitive.</li>
            <li> nothing I would even remotely describe as painful.</li>
            <li> (toothpaste is unnecessary).</li>
            <li> only reason I docked the product one star is because it is a bit annoying to use.  </li>
            <li> I live in Upstate NY &amp; it is winter and the cold air felt very painful.</li>
            <li> I could not complete them in the instructed 7 days, and instead took over a month to use the strips as my teeth were SO painful!</li>
            <li> I mean seriously for the price you CANNOT BEAT IT!!!</li>
            <li> It is a weird and creepy effect.  </li>
            <li> I got whitening, but I don&#x27;t look like I have a fake tooth in front.   </li>
            <li> This morning I did the second application and now my teeth are in terrible, distracting pain.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s wrong...  </li>
            <li> I salivate like crazy with the strips in my mouth</li>
            <li> They make my teeth hurt if I use them too often... but not as bad as the \\&quot;classic\\&quot; whitestrips that they used to sell.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know if this is bad or what, if anyone could tell me i&#x27;d like to know.</li>
            <li> I did take off one star because at times they can be somewhat painful because of the added pressure.</li>
            <li> I was highly disappointed with the strips.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used Crest Whitestrips many times and they stick to my teeth.  These do not stick at all.  They do whiten, but you have to be very careful while they are on your teeth or they will slide off onto your gums.</li>
            <li> These strips did what they said they would. It took a while to to notice the results but it was still effective. I did not like how the strips would come off. When the came off  I could taste the whitening gel and it was AWFUL. If you don&#x27;t put them on perfectly, I found, that they would just fall off and I wasted them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest whitestrips for many years. This particular whitestrip is flimsy and hard to use. They slip off my teeth. Other Crest whitestrips are more heavy duty and do not have this problem. I am very disappointed in this product. I do not recommend getting this specific type due to the poor quality. ):</li>
            <li> LOVE.  Get that Cali girl bright white smile.  Results are fantastic.  Warning: If you have sensitive teeth you may hate this product.  I never noticed sensitivity before this, but did in the hours after using a strip.  The directions indicate that if you experience sensitivity you should not use twice a day and maybe use something like once every couple days.  This really helps.  Also, I brush with Sensodyne PRONAMEL during the couple weeks I am using the whitening strips.  These two tips eliminated any sensitivity and I still had great results.  It was at least a year before I noticed a less white smile, and then I just bought a new pack.</li>
            <li> It does the job but can make your gums extremely sensitive.  I purchased a Sonicare toothbrush shortly after using this.  I would suggest using an electric toothbrush over this.</li>
            <li> I am a dentist who recommends Crest-brand White Strips to my patients becasue they do work to whiten teeth. However, they have to be used correctly and I recommend that you follow the directions exactly as specified inside the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. First brush your teeth with a wet toothbrush to remove the layer of plaque (toothpaste is unnecessary). Rinse your teeth well with water.  Tooth enamel has pores, and the pores need to be open for the chemical to penetrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Use the strips as directed on the box.  The instructions will tell you to bleach twice a day for 30-minutes a time.  The inner part of the strip has a chemical called hydrogen peroxide; (in-office, or dentist-assisted dental whitening uses a 15-35% version of the same chemical) that causes the stains inside your teeth to be oxidized and turn white. Applying the strips has a small learning curve as you will probably bend or fold a couple of them before you get the technique down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Leave the strips on for the time recommended in the instructions and do not overbleach your teeth, as this leads to sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disadvantages&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Hydrogen Peroxide can \\&quot;burn\\&quot; your gums. If you notice a burning sensation when you use the product, it is the chemical oxidizing (or burning) your gums (it will turn them white with a minor chemical burn). Depending on how severe the burning is, it may cause you to want to stop the treatment. It is OK to stop the treatment for a day or two to let the gums heal. Once they are healed, resume treatment with the White Strips. Try to not get the strip on your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Your teeth may become senstiive during the week treatment time. Try to tolerate the sensitivity if it is mild, but if more severe, take a day or two off to let the teeth settle down and then pick up where you left off. You may notice much more sensitivity to cold water, ice cream, etc.  The peroxide causes an inflamation of the inner pulp, or nerve center of the tooth and makes the teeth very sensitive to biting or cold drinks or foods.  If your teeth become too sensitive, back off on the strips until the sensitivity is gone before resuming bleaching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The strips only cover your front teeth, so only your front teeth will bleach. You may notice the distinct difference between the back (unbleached) teeth and the front (bleached) teeth. Since most people notice the front 6 teeth anyway, this is not a big deal. However, if you have a wide toothy smile, you may want to have a dentist make you a tray that will hold the chemical on the back teeth to whiten them too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The bleaching effect works best on yellow stains. If your stains are due to tetracycline (brownish grey stains in a band on your teeth, your best bet is to have a dentist whiten your teeth as the dentist will use a tray to hold a more concentrated form of the chemical on your teeth for a longer period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now comes the confusing part: Crest White Strips come in 4 different packages, each a bit different than the others.  The main difference is in the strength of the hydrogen peroxide, and the price.  The higher the dose of hydrogen peroxide, the most costly the product package.  Here are the 4 packages:  1. Crest White Strips Classic (6% hydrogen peroxide, 14-day treatment).  2. Crest White Strips Premium (10% hydrogen peroxide, 7-day treatment).  3. Crest White Strips Premium Plus (10% hydrogen peroxide, and has 12 additional strips).  4. Crest White Strips Renewal (9.5% hydrogen peroxide).  The cheapest method (at around 25 dollars, is the Crest Classic Whitestrips, but it takes 2 weeks to complete the treatment).  Premium and Premium Pro are both 10% peroxide formulations, work in 7-10 days, and the \\&quot;Premuim-Plus\\&quot; gives you 12 additional strips.  I am not sure why Crest recently came out with \\&quot;Renewal\\&quot;, as it is a 9.5% hydrogen peroxide formulation which is not significantly different from the 10% concentration. Leave it to the manufacturer to confuse the consumer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest White Strips work for the vast majority of people. Younger people with yellow stains seem to respond better than older people or those with gray stains.  White Strips don&#x27;t work as fast as a dentist-made custom tray bleaching, (or in-office bleaching) but over time, you will get a result that will be close to that of a dentist, and you will save money too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend starting with with either the Classic or the Premium-Pro. The Classic works in 2 weeks and is about $1.80 a day.  The Premium Pro works in 10 days and is about $2 dollars a day.  The Premium and Premium Pro are likely to give you more sensitivity than the Classic.  If you are not satisfied with the results and still want whiter teeth, you can then see your dentist for a more concentrated form of bleaching using a custom-tray system or in-office bleaching.  This is much more expensive, but eh concentration of hydrogen peroide is much higher and this works better on stubbornly-stained teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim \\&quot;Konedog\\&quot; Koenig, DDSork for the vast majority of people.

            <li> This product may be very effective when used correctly, but I cannot recommend it simply because it is nearly impossible to use correctly. I had previously used a generic store brand and had hoped to achieve better results with these. After the first day, I can tell that the whitening effect is stronger; however, the overall result is probably diminished by the difficulty of usage.    Some tips I learned the hard way:    -Don&#x27;t believe that you can just throw them on and do something else. I spent the entire time they were on in front of the mirror adjusting and dealing with saliva. Paper towel is almost a necessity. I can&#x27;t help but think that those who just quickly apply them and do other things will end up with uneven results.    -Don&#x27;t rip the pouches open, use scissors. Ripping them will pull on the backing, and wrinkle up the strips before you can use them.    -Immediately after placing the strip, wipe your fingers off before adjusting the strips. Adjusting could take a while, and your fingertips will turn white from the gel.    I really think Crest could do a better job of making these strips easy to use. Some rigidity to the strips would do wonders. The backing should be a different material and the strips should be precut, something more like bandages would be nice. Also, why not make the lower strips as wide as the top? The material is there, they just cut a smaller strip out...    I may end up with whiter teeth, but next time I&#x27;m using the old-fashioned tray and gel.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth so I expected to have some of the symptoms described in the reviews, but WOW ... I didn&#x27;t know what I was in for. I would describe the the pain as sharp zaps that come and go. It is unlike any other tooth pain I&#x27;ve ever experienced, and I can see why some people would stop after their first encounter with this pain. I decided to stick it out anyway, and I&#x27;m glad I did. I saw results instantly, and by the last day my smile was perfect. A tip for anyone with sensitive teeth: clenching my jaw or rubbing the gum area directly below the affected teeth helped with the severity of the pain.</li>
            <li> I found this easy to use and my dentist recommended it. My gums burned a little but not any real pain. I am on day 5 now and my husband actually said my teeth looked great. I would feel confident in recommending this product to any of my friends.</li>
            <li> Pain is not beauty when it comes to this product. They were very painful and made my teeth very sensitive. They got whiter, but not by  much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days and it has worked a lot and I would buy this product again and recommend it to others as well.</li>
            <li> The expiration date was October 2010!!!! They don&#x27;t make this product anymore, and it should not be sold to anyone!</li>
            <li> These are the only white strips i trust! they actually whiten your teeth. I would higher recommend. They shipping was very fast also.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product. After just 1 day I had terrible pain but as the directions say to do, I stuck with it. For about 2 weeks afterwards I still had a tremendous amount of pain. And the product didn&#x27;t work. I called the manufacturer to get my money back and found out that they no longer make this product and that it was actually expired. Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> I truly recommend this vendor, they are the best on customer care, they go the extra mile for our complete satisfaction, I got the product in the expected time and their products are great.    Thanks so much for taking so good care of my order.    Many thanks to Israel,    EO</li>
            <li> My teeth were already pretty white, but wanted a little brighter.  Says you notice difference in three days, I noticed in ONE!  I had tried the Listerine Dissolving Strips, TOTAL waste, I think I saw more difference just using regular whitening toothpaste.  I gave this five stars because it DEFINITELY whitens AND WHITENS FAST!    Strips do take a bit getting used to as they can slide around and you have to be very careful when putting them on, but I would definitely use them again.  I might get the Premium Plus next time just because there are more strips and that way, if I want to brighten a little more in a few months, there are the extra strips. I also used the Classic Crest Strips and these definitely worked faster and better.</li>
            <li> works really fast! If you have very sensitive teeth I would recommend using crest regular (14 days) system. It&#x27;s more mild, takes longer, but gentle on the teeth. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;easy to use and really works!</li>
            <li> my husband I and have used these twice. the first time we were amazed at the results!!!! that was about 8 months ago and now for the holidays we just did another treatment this week. they are very easy to put in and there is hardly any taste if at all. they fit very well also and I have had no problems of them coming off liek others say. I mean seriously for the price you CANNOT BEAT IT!!! esp for my husband who is a heavy coffee drinker, pop drinker and smoker. the only thing for me is YES the first 3-5 minutes my gums burn and it is uncomfortable but not too bad..the results are WELL WORTH it for me.....I would not say it lasts 18 months but about 6 months for me...great product!! I highly recommend! plus other people even say How did you get your teeth so white???!!!!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Crest White Strips in the mail and I am very pleased with the results. For anyone who has tried whitening strips in the past, Crest White Strips offer significant benefits. First they don&#x27;t slide around in your mouth, competing strips I have tried have to be adjusted every time you speak, swallow or breathe...not convenient. Second Crest has eliminated the slimy-gel that gets all over your hands while you&#x27;re putting them in. And finally b/c the strips adhere tightly to the surface of your teeth the solvent is equally distributed and you don&#x27;t get a messy half-white, half coffee-colored look on your face. My teeth feel cleaner and look healthier, strong recommends for any caffeine junkies out there. Cheers, K.</li>
            <li> I kept hearing stories of people&#x27;s teeth becoming really sensitive from these strips.  Asked my dentist friend and he told me that is likely due to getting the material (peroxide) on the gums.  Also told me that the results are directly proportional to how long you leave the strips on.  With this info, I used the strips with good results and no discomfort.    If you&#x27;re wondering what it feels like to use these, it&#x27;s very similar to getting an x-ray or mold at the dentist.  Something in your mouth, which shouldn&#x27;t be there, but you&#x27;ll be able to work around it with a little practice.  Not uncomfortable, just a bit odd, at least at first.</li>
            <li> This product is so different than the tv says.  The strips are really hard to put on, and they only cover a 8 teeth, when 10 teeth show when you smile.  So unless you put the excess stips on the rest, you have some white, and some yellow teeth when you smile.  The strips are hard to keep on for 20 minutes, and the product tastes gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid 40 bucks for these, and half are still in the box.  I went out and bought the 20 dollar Rembrant set with the gel and trays and it works so much better.  The gel stays on the teeth and tastes like a pleasant toothpaste.  It whitens and the trays are easy to keep in.  I will throw-out the Crest strips, if I can&#x27;t give them away...do not use them!</li>
            <li> Crest White Strips Premium do do a good job of whitening, but they also made my teeth ultra sensitive. I could not complete them in the instructed 7 days, and instead took over a month to use the strips as my teeth were SO painful! I had to take off days in between use. Hot or cold foods were AGONY on my teeth. I live in Upstate NY &amp; it is winter and the cold air felt very painful. If I use these again it will be in the summertime!</li>
            <li> Okay I am not going to go over the same moans and complains that you have heard everywhere.  The main thing that you should really think about is the fact that if you need deep cleaning all over, then this isn&#x27;t for you because they really only do the front teeth.  There is nothing more gross than seeing someone&#x27;s front teeth bright white and then they grin and the side ones look gross.  It is a weird and creepy effect.  Also you have got to put them on straight every time!  Otherwise you could have spots that aren&#x27;t as clean as the others.  Yuck!  Can you imagine looking like you have a piece of a popcorn hull stuck in your gums forever?!  Another important thing is that they will not fit everyone&#x27;s teeth.  I have relatively standard sized teeth, but my husband&#x27;s are a bit wider, so they didn&#x27;t cover his teeth the same.  Keep this in mind because his teeth are not big.  I have seen big ones that they will not cover completely regardless.  The main thing that I am sure has been mentioned over and over is pain.  Well, don&#x27;t think that it won&#x27;t bother you.  It will.  Some people can take it better than others, but almost all feel some sort of pain and sensitivity afterwards.  To me it feels as if a layer of your teeth have been stripped away.  You have a sort of raw feeling like you get when you cut yourself, but not deep enough to make it bleed.  Well imagine all of your front teeth feeling like that!  They are exposed to liquids and foods of all kinds of temperatures.  Yikes!  This feeling sticks with you for quite a while after this, so if you can afford it, go to the dentist and get the real stuff done.  Otherwise be prepared to pay more than the $28.50 for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a coffee/tea drinker; I bought the stripes to try to combat some yellowness from that. I wasn&#x27;t expecting supermodel teeth-- just a noticeable improvement. The bottom line is that they didn&#x27;t work.  I can think of a million things I wish I&#x27;d bought with the money instead. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I also experienced the tooth sensitivity that other reviewers have described.  It has been 3 days since I stopped using them, and my gums still do not feel right.  I cannot believe this is truly a safe product for repeated use. &lt;br /&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;In addition, I am a small person with small teeth.  The stripes barely covered enough teeth for me.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums are pretty sensitive so I thought it might be wise to stay away from these after reading some of the reviews, however I was able to use them with no pain at all. The only thing I disliked about them was that they were extremely annoying to deal with and the taste it would leave.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  It whitened my teeth, but not to the point of looking funny.  The box warns about tooth/gum sensitivity, and I have heard of some people having a difficult time with it, but personally it has been quite minimal.  I happen to have one porcelain veneer in the front of my mouth, and I found that while the strips whitened my teeth, they didn&#x27;t do it so much that it made my veneer look out of place.  This above all pleased me the most--I got whitening, but I don&#x27;t look like I have a fake tooth in front.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only reason I docked the product one star is because it is a bit annoying to use.  I found that the only way to make sure the strips didn&#x27;t slide around was to wipe my teeth dry before I applied them (i.e. the same concept as when the dentist uses an air tube to dry an area of your mouth before he works in it).  This helped the strips to stay in place while I was waiting for the 30 minutes.  The only other annoying thing was that if I swallowed I got nauseous (probably from the peroxide on the strips, some of which in all likelihood gets mixed into your saliva).  So while it was ultimately the least unpleasant to let a big wad of spit accumulate in my mouth (and then spit when I was removing the strips), it was not exactly enjoyable.  However, considering I am without the luxury of a dental office where they use the draining tube for that, this product does the job just fine!</li>
            <li> After the first application I felt a little soreness on the area where I applied the strips. This morning I did the second application and now my teeth are in terrible, distracting pain. I would not recommend this product for anyone with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the regular Whitestrips before this and got great results (my sister, a dental hygienist, saw me and exclaimed \\&quot;wow, your teeth are white!\\&quot;), so I was eager to try the Premium Whitestrips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to what some reviewers are stating here, the difference between the different Whitestrips are not how white they make your teeth, but how long the whiteness will last. Crest Premium Whitestrips supposedly make your teeth whiter for 12 months, whereas the Ultra ones keep your teeth whiter for 18 months. The original Whitestrips supposedly last 6 months. You can do the math and see what&#x27;s worth it to you financially (and if you really think it will last as long as claimed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True to the package cover, I started seeing measurable results at around 3 days. Actually, I noticed whiter teeth after even the first day, but by day three, I was feeling a few shades shy of Regis Philbin&#x27;s pearly (okay, stark) whites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Premium kit will give you 7 days&#x27; worth of strips. You wear both upper and lower for 30 minutes twice a day. I would suggest you do it exactly as prescribed rather than following the other reviewer&#x27;s claim that it&#x27;s okay to wear them back to back for an hour. Things are prescribed a certain way for a reason. In this case, it may be due to the time necessary for your teeth to \\&quot;recover\\&quot; from the treatments. What I mean is, unlike the basic strips, I&#x27;m noticing lots more sensitivity with the Premium ones. I&#x27;m following the directions and wearing for 30 minutes twice a day. Chocolate, anything sweet or acidic all set my teeth on edge. Something about having that gap in treatments during the day seems to give the teeth time to calm down and be ready for the next session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have mentioned that it&#x27;s hard to keep the lower strip in place. This can be true. I&#x27;ve found a couple of things that help immensely. Before applying the strips, dry your mouth and teeth with a clean towel. Then apply the strips, trying to limit them to your teeth rather than gums as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, though some have said it&#x27;s possible to talk with them, just don&#x27;t.  Your life surely has 30-minute increments of time that you&#x27;re simply not needing to talk. I would also suggest not doing anything incredibly vigorous (such as cleaning the house) during that half-hour. For some reason, I&#x27;ve found that makes it more difficult to keep the strips in place. Perhaps we salivate more when we&#x27;re working up a sweat. So reading, watching the news, driving to work, vegetating-these are all good activities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When time&#x27;s up, pull the strips off and toss them. Don&#x27;t brush your teeth! Things are sensitive, so give your mouth and gums a rest. Instead, rinse with slightly warm water, and take your index finger and \\&quot;brush\\&quot; your teeth with it to remove any extra gel. Spit (don&#x27;t swallow that stuff) and smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only two days left of this round of Chrst Whitestrips, and I&#x27;m already incredibly pleased with the results. Your teeth are some of the first things that people notice about you, and they also are something easy you can do to make yourself look more youthful. You&#x27;ve got nothing to lose but some gray-yellow staining and a little bit of cash.

            <li> No doubt about it, these strips work.  I&#x27;ve gotten countless compliments on how white and beautiful my smile is.  I haven&#x27;t used them in about a year, but today I decided to resume my whitening again with a new box of premium whitestrips.  After about 4 minutes of wearing the strips, I experienced the WORST PAIN I EVER FELT IN MY LIFE.  It felt as it the pain was coming from inside my bottom teeth, and I actually was nauseated from the pain, that&#x27;s how severe it was.  I immediately ripped off the strips and rinsed out my mouth, and now I&#x27;m PETRIFIED to attempt using them again.  Does anyone know if this is normal?  Please email me and let me know why this happened!! (thethugyone@aol.com).</li>
            <li> I have used these for a while and I have seen results with them. They are easy to apply and usually stay on for the full time once they are applied. If the strips start to fall off (and that is rare) I just press them firmly back into place with a cotton swab and that usually does the job. I did take off one star because at times they can be somewhat painful because of the added pressure. Overall the Crest Strips are among the best whitening products I have used.</li>
            <li> I like the &#x27;classic strips&#x27; from Crest...and these are not them.  The classic strips have a thicker whitener, these have a very runny whitener that sticks to the plastic the strips come on.  I won&#x27;t be buying these again.</li>
            <li> Im halfway through the box and have noticed whiter teeth, however, Im pretty sure the seller of these has kept white strips from a decade ago and is selling them now. They slip off my teeth even without talking! I constantly have to fix them - or give up and take them off early. Their fine to finish my whitening routine right now, but I will order the up-to-date strips (i think only a few bucks more) with \\&quot;advance seal technology\\&quot; that look NEW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And my box doesn&#x27;t close all the way :/ I had to keep it closed with tape.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had yellowed teeth for years, probably due to coffee and tea comsumption.    I decided to try an inexpensive fix and this seemed the ticket.   I tried the Crest Whitestrips and they did just that, whitened my teeth.  I am very happy with the results and recommend them.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t yet bought the strips from Amazon, however, I have used them before. In fact, just a couple of months ago I  did the entire 7-day process and within the first two uses (That&#x27;s one day if you do it day and night) I saw results. There was a little mild sensitivity, usually immediately after use and would disappear throughout the day. Other than that I had no gum pain or anything, nor did it turn my gums white like it warns is possible. I&#x27;m someone who brushes my teeth daily and has good dental hygiene, but I&#x27;m also a coffee drinker. Over the years my teeth had built up yellow-ish stains and my smile was definitely not very white, though it wasn&#x27;t terrible. I would usually smile with my lips closed or cover my mouth when I laughed because I wasn&#x27;t confident of my smile. After using them, I noticed an immediate change in that I smile openly and more often than I have in years. It definitely gave me a confidence that I&#x27;m grateful of. The best part is that, even though I was skeptical about the label mentioning that it lasts for up to a year, I haven&#x27;t used them since those first 7 days and, with daily brushing, my smile is still as bright as it was after day 7. After my year is up, I definitely plan on buying more and using this product again and I more than recommend it.  The only downside to it is that I had a strange after taste from the chemicals, but I easily solved this problem by chewing minty-fresh gum daily, which is something I would have done anyways. The taste can last a little longer than the 7 days, but within the next week it was gone.</li>
            <li> The strips are easy to apply and whiten effectively. The only down side is that they&#x27;re a little pricey (use coupons).</li>
            <li> These strips maintain a bright white smile.  I use maybe twice a month for maintaining white teeth. I have no sensitivity to this whitening method.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 4 days and I can see a result already.  Not the glow in the dark, frighteningly unnatural white that you often see on people who have had a dental bleaching--you know that silvery white look that doesn&#x27;t occur in nature. I think the strips have whitened my teeth without making it obvious I&#x27;ve been whitening them. It&#x27;s how my teeth looked ten years ago, before ten years of coffee and soda buildup.  Although I&#x27;ve read reviews that state people have had pain in their gums and teeth, I&#x27;ve not had a bit of trouble with pain.  The only real caution is--DON&#x27;T SNEEZE.  Or if you have to sneeze, keep your mouth firmly closed.  When I sneezed, the strips came flying out of my mouth.  Also, you really can&#x27;t talk very well while they&#x27;re in your mouth, and you feel a bit like you&#x27;re foaming at the mouth. However, there is very little after taste--and my teeth look cleaner without look other worldly.  I would definately recommend.</li>
            <li> I just bought this product and have been using it for 3 days and already I see a difference.  I purposely only did my top teeth at first because I wanted to see if there was a true noticeable difference.  I truly see a difference (not glowing white, mind you)so this morning I decided to put the strips on my bottom teeth.  After trying to install the strip on my lower teeth is when I also decided to write a review.  Before purchasing the strips I read the reviews and I noticed that a few of the reviews said that the strips were hard to place on the teeth.  I decided to go forth and purchase them anyhow because the resounding tone was that the strips really did work.  Since I only started with my top teeth I felt lucky that they worked and I found that they were not hard to place on my teeth.  The strip went on and stayed in one place.  However, when i started my lower teeth this morning, I found that I have the same problem as many others...............the friggin strip moves all around your teeth and just when you think you have it right where you want it, you move your tongue and it has rearranged itself.  My solution.......use the strips on your upper teeth and use the paste on the lower teeth.  I can not imagine fighting with the strips on my lower teeth for 6 more days! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Final review...............buy the strips, they really work!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product twice before and I really like the results. I&#x27;ve never had professionally whitened teeth so I don&#x27;t have a comparison but find these results good for the cost.</li>
            <li> These seem to work ok, but the bottom strip can come off easily since saliva accumulates over the 30 minutes period you have to keep these in.  I hated swallowing while keeping these in, because the taste is really bad -- so I started folding up a napkin and putting it under my tongue when I began the 30 minute period.  This helped keep the saliva off of the bottom strip, so it stayed on better.  30 minutes is a really long time to keep something disgusting and slippery on your teeth though -- I wonder if there is a way they could make a product that would only take 10 or 15 minutes?</li>
            <li> I tried this product about a month ago and I must say I&#x27;m actually pretty impressed. Admittedly, my expectations for this product weren&#x27;t that high prior to using it, but I think they exceeded those expectations in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew I wouldn&#x27;t get the same gleaming results as I would by getting my teeth whitened at the dentist office; anyone who has those kinds of expectations from a $25.00 grocery store item is setting themselves up for disappointment. However, the results I did get were a lot better than paying loads more to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the box says, I noticed results after the third day and by the end of the week my teeth were very noticeably whiter. I&#x27;m 27 years old though, so my teeth were just starting to get that yellow-ish tint to them. I&#x27;m sure someone older than my self with a life time of say, smoking, drinking coffee or tea, would probably want to get themselves two boxes. However, if you&#x27;re like me, and just had a bit of a yellow tint to your teeth and want to brighten your smile a bit, this product will do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have stated, after a few days of using the product your gums may become a bit sore. It&#x27;s not unbearable and it goes away shortly after you take the strips off. I did notice my gums were a bit sore while brushing my teeth a few days after the last day of the strips, but hey, no pain, no gain. That little bit of pain was worth it to me to have a better smile. I feel a lot more confident when I smile now, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what to say. It worked wonders for my boyfriend, which is why it&#x27;s getting 4 stars, but it barely did anything for me... so I guess it depends on your teeth.</li>
            <li> I was highly disappointed with the strips.  I expected them to stick to my teeth but instead they&#x27;re hard to keep in place.  I did NOT get white teeth.  I didn&#x27;t even see a difference.  I know there are people out there who are happy with them but my guess is they used them many times to get good results.</li>
            <li> They make my teeth hurt if I use them too often... but not as bad as the \\&quot;classic\\&quot; whitestrips that they used to sell.</li>
            <li> Everyone asks if I got my teeth professionally whitened!</li>
            <li> My experience after using them 3 days:  My teeth are getting whiter.  No pain.  No sensitivity.  My hygenist said people with thin teeth or thin enamel experience the most sensitivity.  The strips are very thin and shift easily so don&#x27;t move your mouth when wearing them.  I make sure the strips are on straight and I press the strips into the cracks between my teeth to insure even whitening.  The peroxide will slightly foam in your mouth.  I think the peroxide works best if you don&#x27;t get too much saliva on the strips.  I salivate like crazy with the strips in my mouth so I lay on my back and look at the ceiling for the whole 30 minutes letting the saliva pool in the back of my mouth.  I occasionally swallow to limit the pooling of saliva or use a rolled up paper towel to blot out the saliva.  The goal being to keep the strips from getting diluted with too much saliva and keep the strips from shifting around in your mouth.  The  strips seem to fit my teeth well and should whiten all teeth that show when I smile.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my teeth were beginning to yellow. My dentist (of course) suggested that I use an in-office whitening system that would cost a LOT of money. I decided I would give the Crest system a shot before I took the plunge with the dentist. This worked GREAT. In a couple of days my teeth had already begun to get lightened. Now, after the whole 7 days, I am pleased. They could be whiter for sure but they are absolutely good enough (especially at only $25). Application was pretty easy - be sure to press down the strip as much as possible as a lot of saliva collects while they are on. I got a little tender but nothing I would even remotely describe as painful. I am super glad I bought these!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really excited because after three days of use, I can see some improvement in my teeth already. I&#x27;ve had no burning of gums and have experienced only a slight sensitivity to my teeth. I don&#x27;t know if the Sensodyne I started using two weeks ago in preparation for the use of the strips had any effect but the sensitivity is very tolerable for me. Some gripes: I wish they made the upper strip longer to cover more of the upper teeth and I wish they had cut the lower strip better because you can very well see 3/4 of an inch wasted when you peel off the lower strip from its plastic backing. Will report back on the final result once I&#x27;ve finished the whole treatment.</li>
            <li> They whiten OK, but are difficult to work with, particularly the bottom.  While the results are mixed, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase them again.</li>
            <li> I opened up the crest strips to \\&quot;NO AVAIL\\&quot; it was completly empty with the instructions I am asking for a refund I will let you know what happens.. It can be an honest mistake lets see when they refund me</li>
            <li> years ago when the original whitestrips first came out, i tried them.  i had great results and the whitening actually lasted longer than i had expected.  fastforward a handful of years and i have decided to try the premium strips.  i&#x27;m getting braces in a month, and i wanted quick results that would last at least through a portion of my treatment.  i used the premium strips for 30mins lastnight and i had amazing results from only one strip!  if my teeth keep whitening like this, i will have to stop using them before the box is done to prevent having the unnatural &#x27;hollywood glow&#x27;.  i was blown away!</li>
            <li> The other products in this line are much better and stay on your teeth--doing their job--better than these!  These fall off.</li>
            <li> For the price, it was worth it.  I don&#x27;t think whitening strips are for me.  They are a little messy.  I thought that they would stick to your teeth allowing you to go about other things but they slid around and made a bubbling mess in my mouth.</li>
            <li> excellent product. I noticed a difference after a few applications.  My teetch became noticably whiter very quickly.</li>
            <li> The whitestrips worked pretty good. I experienced no sensitivity, and only minor burning to my gums.  I can&#x27;t really say how well it works long term, but the short term effects were good.  Overall the product is a great value and a good buy.</li>
            <li> The product works very well. I chose this item based on the best price I could find on the internet.</li>
            <li> The strips were in the regular Crest plastic container, however the circular tape that was holding the top down was not stuck on the container and it appeared the box had been opened.  There were quite a few stickers on top of the box indicating this product was not for resale????  I examined the strips and it did not appear that they were tampered with but I don&#x27;t know why the box was opened.  I have used Crest Whitestrips before and have had no problems.  For some reason these strips bothered my gums and they were very sore after using the strips two times.</li>
            <li> Does the product work?  Yes - that can be seen in any review here.  I would like to bring up the topic of packaging - I will be brief.  Is this huge, plastic box really necessary to carry 28 one millimeter thick strips?  In a time when conservation is a buzz word and petroleum products should be kept to a minimum for a variety of reasons, Crest decides to package a tiny product in a small boat.  Seriously, this is a huge waste.  Not to mention, the cost would most definitely drop if a more practical box were implemented for future customers.  In short, I would like to see a more environmentally and financially responsible company helping me achieve my shallow need for whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> I always prefer the original it just seems to work better on my teeth. No staining just a pretty white</li>
            <li> If I have a very important meeting sometimes I will want to whiten my teeth just a bit so I feel more confident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually see results after one 20-30 minute session. After 3-4 days, I am done. My teeth look fantastic, but I stop because I don&#x27;t want them to look unnatural. I cannot even imagine what 14 days of this would look like! :-#&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if I go more then a few days, my teeth start to get sensitive, which I find very annoying, so I stop. Any sensitivity is gone in a day or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One box lasts me at least a year, but I am not a fanatic about white teeth, maybe because I was blessed with good teeth. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> These do NOT whiten teeth. I&#x27;ve tried them and the commercials are deceiving. You will NOT get the results they show on the commercials. I was very disappointed in this product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Save the money from these and go to the dentist and have a professional zoom whitening. There is no way you are going to whiten your teeth at home using these. The peroxide isn&#x27;t strong enough. The dentist uses over twice the strength of these. I don&#x27;t care how many packages of these you use, it will not work. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also...The bottom strips are too small to cover your teeth and they float off in your saliva. You&#x27;re basically ingesting peroxide from them. I don&#x27;t know how safe that could be, but it&#x27;s not very promising to me. The dentist will cost more, but it will be what you are really expecting. Save your money.</li>
            <li> I recently got my braces removed and decided to whiten my teeth. During my previous experiences with the strips i experienced no burning, but after i got my braces off, i experienced an unbearable burning. Im sticking through it, but when i take them off...my gums turn white where the strips were. i don&#x27;t know if this is bad or what, if anyone could tell me i&#x27;d like to know. But when i did use them before i had braces, the effects were incredible. they really work</li>
            <li> these strips don&#x27;t whiten your teeth AT ALL, even if they did the bottom strip only covers 6 teeth so you would look stupid with both white and yellow teeth when you smile. You should use trays and gel, it gives you great results and dosen&#x27;t cost half as much as these strips....stay away!!!!</li>
            <li> As I read everyone&#x27;s reviews, it took me awhile to figure out how to properly put it on. It is kind of a hassle to dry up your teeth, gums, and mouth area in order to get a perfect fit. But I managed to get most of them on just right. I had trouble with making sure it is in the right position because I kept thinking if it was too far to the right or left. I didn&#x27;t know what to do with the saliva that kept coming out of my mouth so I just ended up swallowing it before it reach my teeth. I did notice sensitivity but it wasn&#x27;t that painful, but my fingers were stinging really badly when I didn&#x27;t wash them right away after applying them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was only semi-pleased with the results only because of a few factors I encoutered. Part of my teeth weren&#x27;t white enough, like the ones at the ends. This was due to the problem that I didn&#x27;t position the strips perfectly and the ends usually start falling off. It did make my teeth a little whiter but not completely white, I&#x27;m not sure if a second box of that will help. It would be nice if extra stripes were given for free just to practice putting it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy with the results for about a month. My only discouragement is how can I maintain that result if I drink coffee and tea everyday? Currently my teeth looks exactly the way it was before I used the Crest White Strips, I&#x27;m just disappointed that I wasn&#x27;t able to maintain the same whiteness. I can&#x27;t really carry a toothbrush and tooth paste around me all the time, I guess I should look into chewing whitening gums.</li>
            <li> Just after couple of days of use I got whiter smile. This product really works, no bs. you should check this product out. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This is a very good product, and a good price for it, but they send me the product close to expire, that&#x27;s the only thing that I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for these, but after using them I couldn&#x27;t see the slightest difference and neither could my husband. :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so great as expected...they do looks better though. But the yellowness hasn&#x27;t gone totally...i guess partly because i drink too much coffee...besides, if the time btw was too short(&lt;12h), my tooth get very cold...cold&#x3D;&#x3D;b I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s wrong...  my suggestion is used 2 package..</li>
            <li> Terrible product.  Gooy out of the box.  Seemed like old product that was expired.  Did not stay on teeth.  Never buy again.</li>
            <li> Too much tea had made my teeth look less than sparkling so I decided to try this a month before my wedding.  It made my teeth look bright and white, but not like fake white and so I had real nice pearly whites for my wedding.  They&#x27;re really easy to apply and take off, although the gel on the strips can whiten the tips of your fingers if you don&#x27;t wash it off immediately.  Even so, this whitening effect on your fingers will go away.  What else?  It did hurt my gums a little bit a few times but not so much that I was in agony or anything.  My husband tried it later and for him, it hurt his gums and teeth and his first strip was his last.  But the directions do say that it is not for people with weak teeth and gums and not to use it right after brushing.  Anyway, the verdict for this for me is that it&#x27;s a really good alternative to whitening your teeth for an expensive cost at the dentist because it works well and is affordable.  Bravo for Crest!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.. More comments on whiter teeth and nicer smile than i&#x27;ve ever had in my life !   Most everyone noticed w/out even a prompted question to them. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Supposedly, these strips are designed to whiten teeth browned or yellowed from coffee or tea.  Yeah, right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only that, but they are supposed to be easy to apply.  Yeah, right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further, you&#x27;d have to apply three on the bottom, and three on the top, else only your front teeth are whitened.  Good luck, trying to make that work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, they are supposed to work after only a few treatments.  Yeah, right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, if you brush your teeth with baking soda like gramma used to do, you&#x27;ll likely get the same results.  Or, get those little teeth trays, put baking soda in the trays, and take a shower or do something which won&#x27;t make you swallow much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, some people have more porous teeth than others, and for them it might work.</li>
