            <li>Max Factor is still the best!!!!  </li>
            <li>, my make over its perfect now</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best concealer stick I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with it and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>The color and texture are wonderful.</li>
            <li>Great product, I have been using it since the 1960&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been happy with it.</li>
            <li>You cannot see the Erase, and my skin looks more flawless.</li>
            <li>This is a good cover up concealer and a good match for my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved Max Factor and I&#x27;m going to keep buying it.</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t know how good it is as a concealer.  </li>
            <li>Used this years ago and loved it</li>
            <li>I have very fair pink toned skin and the Fair 02 shade matches perfectly.</li>
            <li>I ordered Fair 02 hoping that it would work on my very light olive complexion and it does.  </li>
            <li>It stays on nicely.</li>
            <li>Glad I was able to order a supply!</li>
            <li>I really liked how the product arrived so quickly!</li>
            <li>I can not find it in the stores any more, but so glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>but I had not been able to find it in the United States</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>LOVE FROM THE SEVENTIES</li>
            <li>Easily goes on under eyes and is pretty good coverage.  </li>
            <li>I cry that it is no longer available in America---like so many of our tried and true and favorite make-up products and pharmaceuticals.</li>
            <li>Amazing, i have not words, this one make me look so clear and nice</li>
            <li>It covers dark circles brilliantly!</li>
            <li>After the product was no longer available in the US</li>
            <li>Its not horrible, but I have to put it on right after using my moisturizer or it will just stick in one spot and not rub in.</li>
            <li>I do wish the packaging were a little more attractive and not quite so utilitarian-looking.</li>
            <li>Been using this wonderful product to hide the dark circles under my eyes for more years than some of y&#x27;all have been alive.</li>
            <li>Got it quickly ...missed it....</li>
            <li>covers dark circles under eyes and is a great product for  the money.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product for concealing those dark shadows under the eyes.  </li>
            <li>Immediately I found exactly what I wanted and had all 10 boxes delivered to my office in 48 hours!  </li>
            <li>This concealer may be ok but just having this cheap perfume smelling stuff on my face once was enough for me to wash it right off</li>
            <li>I will need to purchase a brush to use with it, which then makes the purchase price even higher.</li>
            <li>Max is hard to find and very good stuff not glamorous enough for the US</li>
            <li>This concealer is cheap but it works as well as similar products costing 4 times as much.</li>
            <li>It does look like the real thing, which I have to assume it is, or</li>
            <li>very cakey.</li>
            <li>Covers the darker line under eyes very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use it as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>Apparently, it is not the original formula and is highly perfumed.  </li>
            <li>This concealer is a classic.</li>
            <li>So what else is new?</li>
            <li>There was the odd bit of time when for some reason Max Factor was either almost out of business or was discontinuing its &amp;#34;Old Standbys&amp;#34; ... or something was going on where this product became as rare as hens teeth or cost over 10 bucks!</li>
            <li>I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR MY 90 YEAR OLD MOTHER</li>
            <li>It covers imperfections completely while remaining creamy not chalky.</li>
            <li>and I used to use this product frequently 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li>As other reviewers noted, not the same as the old Erace, but it works fine, and though smaller than the original, also cost less, so I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried at least 7 other brands of similar products and none were as good as this one.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m thankful that at least Amazon has it available on line.</li>
            <li>This seems to be be the same Erase as the old one.</li>
            <li>The actual product is a tone lighter and does not cover a lot like before, but the texture is just as creamy and soft than before.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive and dry skin</li>
            <li>Other products irritate my very sensitive skin</li>

            <li> Did not work for me due to my sensitive skin - although it did glide on well and concealed dark circles and other imperfections.  </li>
            <li> I was little upset to find out that this order actually came out of the U.K.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a pity you can&#x27;t buy it in the stores anymore.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a very long time to erase dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have used dozens of concealers in the past and have 5 different brands at the moment and none have added perfume.  </li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed when I opened it that the top of the concealer had been squashed against the inside cover</li>
            <li> I use this on my undereye circles and on any dark spots or blemishes.</li>
            <li> I have inherited dark circles under my eyes and thus product literally erases them.</li>
            <li> i live overseas in a country that only sells products for darker skin tones, so it was disappointing after finding this shade online.</li>
            <li> Still, it was just a little bit that was lost</li>
            <li> I does not feel heavy and didn&#x27;t irritated my skin at all.  </li>
            <li> At least I&#x27;m not aware of any stores that are selling Max Factor.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too stiff nor greasy.  </li>
            <li> waste of money and now sits at bottom of a drawer somewhere in my house!</li>
            <li> While it was sealed, it came with half the product broken and stuck up in the lid.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!</li>
            <li> Too bad that I can purchase it only online.</li>
            <li> Perfume in makeup is never a good thing since it is an irritant and is 100% unnecessary.  </li>
            <li> I believe this is a fake product.</li>
            <li> and it is getting really difficult to find.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used Erase for years. I can not find it in the stores any more, but so glad I found it on Amazon. I apply it from the tube onto a make-up brush made for this purpose. I blend it out, then place mineral powder over my face. You cannot see the Erase, and my skin looks more flawless. MAK, PA</li>
            <li> Been using this wonderful product to hide the dark circles under my eyes for more years than some of y&#x27;all have been alive. I&#x27;ve tried at least 7 other brands of similar products and none were as good as this one. I cry that it is no longer available in America---like so many of our tried and true and favorite make-up products and pharmaceuticals. Think about it---an affordable and trustworthy make-up that still does the job for a woman at the age of 65 that it did for a woman at 28----  THAT IS AN AMAZING PRODUCT!!!!</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR MY 90 YEAR OLD MOTHER , SHE COULD NOT FIND IT ANYWHERE SHE IS VERY HAPPY WITH IT</li>
            <li> As other reviewers noted, not the same as the old Erace, but it works fine, and though smaller than the original, also cost less, so I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Max Factor is still the best!!!!  This product is everything I thought and hoped it would be.  Max Factor rocks!!!!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have looked for almost a year.  Then someone said try Amazon.  Immediately I found exactly what I wanted and had all 10 boxes delivered to my office in 48 hours!  Unbelievable!</li>
            <li> Its not horrible, but I have to put it on right after using my moisturizer or it will just stick in one spot and not rub in.</li>
            <li> Amazing, i have not words, this one make me look so clear and nice, my make over its perfect now</li>
            <li> I was little upset to find out that this order actually came out of the U.K.  I don&#x27;t remember it showing that anywhere on the order. Did I miss something?  The items look like a legitimate item and I just assume Max Factor also manufactures in the U.K. and if they do, why does the casing have a completely different look.  If I had known this order was going out of the country, I never would have ordered it.  It does look like the real thing, which I have to assume it is, or Amazon would not have it on their wedsite, but I haven&#x27;t actually used it yet.</li>
            <li> I believe this is a fake product.</li>
            <li> Easily goes on under eyes and is pretty good coverage.  I&#x27;d order it again and recommend it. I really liked how the product arrived so quickly!</li>
            <li> This concealer is a classic. It&#x27;s just a pity you can&#x27;t buy it in the stores anymore. It covers imperfections completely while remaining creamy not chalky. I use this on my undereye circles and on any dark spots or blemishes. I have very fair pink toned skin and the Fair 02 shade matches perfectly.</li>
            <li> While it was sealed, it came with half the product broken and stuck up in the lid. I will need to purchase a brush to use with it, which then makes the purchase price even higher. i live overseas in a country that only sells products for darker skin tones, so it was disappointing after finding this shade online.</li>
            <li> This is a good cover up concealer and a good match for my skin tone.  I was a little disappointed when I opened it that the top of the concealer had been squashed against the inside cover - it must have been protruding up when they put the cap on at the factory.  Still, it was just a little bit that was lost and this did not effect the efficacy of the product.  I do wish the packaging were a little more attractive and not quite so utilitarian-looking.</li>
            <li> I have inherited dark circles under my eyes and thus product literally erases them.</li>
            <li> Great product, I have been using it since the 1960&#x27;s.  It&#x27;s the best concealer stick I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me due to my sensitive skin - although it did glide on well and concealed dark circles and other imperfections.  Apparently, it is not the original formula and is highly perfumed.  I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> very cakey. does not rub in well. does not cover well. very obvious when your wearing it. waste of money and now sits at bottom of a drawer somewhere in my house!</li>
            <li> covers dark circles under eyes and is a great product for  the money.  I will continue to use this product but I had not been able to find it in the United States</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Max Factor and I&#x27;m going to keep buying it. Other products irritate my very sensitive skin but I hadn&#x27;t had any problems with Max Factor products yet and I&#x27;ve been using them for a while now. Too bad that I can purchase it only online. At least I&#x27;m not aware of any stores that are selling Max Factor. But I&#x27;m thankful that at least Amazon has it available on line.</li>
            <li> Perfume in makeup is never a good thing since it is an irritant and is 100% unnecessary.  This concealer may be ok but just having this cheap perfume smelling stuff on my face once was enough for me to wash it right off so I wouldn&#x27;t know how good it is as a concealer.  I have used dozens of concealers in the past and have 5 different brands at the moment and none have added perfume.  Just too stinky to use!</li>
            <li> Love it but the size has definitely shrunk!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for concealing those dark shadows under the eyes.  It isn&#x27;t too stiff nor greasy.  It stays on nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Erase for decades and I&#x27;ve been happy with it. However, this &amp;#34;Made In Ireland&amp;#34; version has a much smaller stick and much larger price. So what else is new?</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a very long time to erase dark circles under my eyes. After the product was no longer available in the US I tried substitutes, but nothing compared. This seems to be be the same Erase as the old one. I am very happy with it and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Used this years ago and loved it so we&#x27;ll see if it still works as well. Max is hard to find and very good stuff not glamorous enough for the US I guess</li>
            <li> This concealer is cheap but it works as well as similar products costing 4 times as much. There was the odd bit of time when for some reason Max Factor was either almost out of business or was discontinuing its &amp;#34;Old Standbys&amp;#34; ... or something was going on where this product became as rare as hens teeth or cost over 10 bucks! Whatever it was got sorted out and we can buy it again. Yay.</li>
            <li> I ordered Fair 02 hoping that it would work on my very light olive complexion and it does.  I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Got it quickly ...missed it....not found in US....LOVE FROM THE SEVENTIES</li>
            <li> Have been using it for years and it is getting really difficult to find.  Glad I was able to order a supply!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive and dry skin and I used to use this product frequently 10 years ago.  The actual product is a tone lighter and does not cover a lot like before, but the texture is just as creamy and soft than before. I does not feel heavy and didn&#x27;t irritated my skin at all.  I&#x27;m definitely going to buy again but I will try different tones.</li>
            <li> Covers the darker line under eyes very well. Can&#x27;t even notice any makeup there.</li>
            <li> The color and texture are wonderful. It covers dark circles brilliantly! I&#x27;ll continue to use it as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
