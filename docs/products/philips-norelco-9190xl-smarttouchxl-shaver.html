    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The norelco shaver is excellent shaver for its price.</li>
            <li>The touch feeling is very comfortable!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Norelco Electric Razors for 20 years &amp; have been a very happy customer, always upgrading every 2 years or so.</li>
            <li>the norelco 9190xl razor gives me my best shave ever.</li>
            <li>amazon shipping and tracking were superb.</li>
            <li>It worked wonderfully and even he says it shaves CLOSER than a blade.</li>
            <li>And he was very happy with it.</li>
            <li>buy this shaver, it is awesome.</li>
            <li>This shaver is the best shaver I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>This is the best electric razor I have ever used bar none.</li>
            <li>the others, this one is the best.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Other than that - an excellent machine.</li>
            <li>This is the best electric shaver I have had.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very impressed and very happy.  </li>
            <li>biggest improvement I can see is in the head design - the SpeedXL heads are very good at what they do.  </li>
            <li>It is really very good feature though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really beautiful to hold in hand.</li>
            <li>was great though...</li>
            <li>The Norelco 9190XL is a great shaving system.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and he loves it.</li>
            <li>If you can find it at a great price, buy it.</li>
            <li>The head does indeed pivot, but not to a great extent and not without undue pressure.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The 9190XL does great at longer hairs.</li>
            <li>THE BATTERY LIFE IS GREAT, AND IT HAS ALL THE FEATURES YOU COULD WANT.</li>
            <li>You have great people,thank you.</li>
            <li>I am happy w/ the shaver.</li>
            <li>I got it, I was so happy</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s better in 3 weeks, GREAT!  </li>
            <li>This seems to be a very good design and probably contributes most to the quality of shave offered by the 9190xl.   </li>
            <li>When the batteries stop taking a good charge(about 5 years), I discard the shaver and buy the newest model.</li>
            <li>I loved that cleaning it was just a matter of holding under the faucet.</li>
            <li>I do think you could receive as good of a shave without the pivoting SmartTouchXL head setup, and I would not worry about buying a cheaper Norelco with just the SpeedXL shaver heads.  </li>
            <li>the shaver is good.</li>
            <li>It is a good razor.</li>
            <li>It looks good.</li>
            <li>It feels good (in your hand and on your skin)</li>
            <li>recharge notification is a good feature.</li>
            <li>would have rated it four stars if the price had been lower or if all of the features had a good purpose.</li>
            <li>I would have rated it five stars if all of the features had a good purpose and the price had been lower.</li>
            <li>I hope this helps you guys before you make your purchase good luck.... &lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks very nice and feels very comfortable on my face.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this shaver was going to work as well as a razor, but it was great</li>
            <li>of this considered, I am very pleased with the 9190xl.  </li>
            <li>Nice bright display showing charge minutes remaining.</li>
            <li>I was using before Philishave, and was very satisfied with the performance.</li>
            <li>Why you would want to deal with a bulky stand and cleaning solution, when you could run it through water (nearly free!!)</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with the nice close shave it gives me.  </li>
            <li>The LCD screen is easy (for me) to read, and a very nice feature.</li>
            <li>Anyway, nice shaver, don&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
            <li>I bought this electric razor for my husband after reading MANY reviews and decided it sounds like a good one.   </li>
            <li>Another nice feature is the travel lock.</li>
            <li>and it was nicely packed.</li>
            <li>While a nice zippered case is provided for the shaver, there is no provision for packing the charger cord.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li>The fact that you can hold this under tap water to clean it is alone a great feature.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Norelco&#x27;s for over 30 years and this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>I believe this to be the best Norelco shaver you have producted so far.  </li>
            <li>His face was very smooth.</li>
            <li>It comes with a great stainless steel carry case.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about two weeks and love it.  </li>
            <li>i think it&#x27;s 50% more shaving surface.</li>
            <li>The shaving unit also has 3 rubber cushions for more following-the-contours-of-your-face capabilities.</li>
            <li>and i love the close shave he gets with it</li>
            <li>The heads have a lot more shaving area</li>
            <li>I like being able to rinse the heads.  </li>
            <li>The adjustable comfort control seems to work ok.  </li>
            <li>but, Nooo, I knew better.</li>
            <li>either unless you&#x27;re an idiot)because Norelco said it was their top of the line razor.</li>
            <li>Nice to have a husband with a smooth face in a minute.    </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
            <li>more comfort during shaving.  </li>
            <li>This time, I wanted to try the latest to see if the coverage and close shave is any better.</li>
            <li>noticed the head is lighter, probably because you can rinse the head in water; therefore, most parts are plastic.</li>
            <li>, it worked better then</li>
            <li>They all did a better job than this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li>I was able to purchase it.</li>
            <li>This is THE closest shave that I&#x27;ve had in as many years.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it though.</li>
            <li>But for sure the trimmer is for the birds, it does not cut anything.</li>
            <li>Outstanding razor.</li>
            <li>But I give AMAZON,COM outstanding for service and follow up .</li>
            <li>things considered, it has been a worthwhile purchase for me and should provide years of reliable service.</li>
            <li>This one you will enjoy !</li>
            <li>Also it is supposed to give 90 minutes of shaving time - the display never showed more than 85 minutes.  </li>
            <li>This newest iteration is better than before.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t, this clock may be ok.</li>
            <li>BUT, you do need to maintain this shaver since it has moving parts therefor you need to follow the manual accordingly for the best shave and again no big deal for me because....</li>
            <li>You just have to have the patience to look closely in a mirror while you shave in order to make sure you cut every hair.  </li>
            <li>you won&#x27;t  regret, I am sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this added to the irritation.</li>
            <li>I mayhave to replace the battery since it does not work nowadays more than 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Philips and Norelco for a great product.  </li>
            <li>It also has a nice battery indicator screen and notifies you when you need to clean the thing.</li>
            <li>This is the best investment that I&#x27;ve made in a long time.  </li>
            <li>I really have not been able to determine how good a shave it gives.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>it is also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The battery keeps its charge a long time and the LCD is not a problem...it does what it suppose to do w/ minimum effort, some people are just way too picky for their own good but to each their own</li>
            <li>That said, I did get a very good shave with the Mach 3, so I was looking for something similar in an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>It is great for people that has sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The shaver really feels good and sturdy.</li>
            <li>Since my husband has got the Norelco Shaver he shaves every morning - which is unusual for me!!!:)</li>
            <li>My wife is hoping I will be more inclined to be clean shaven morning and night.</li>
            <li>VERY quick easy shave  </li>
            <li>Easy to use  </li>
            <li>It cuts the neck hairs better and is also easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The shave is pretty close which is amazing.</li>
            <li>so it was great for him to be able to use it on board and airplane so he did not arrive at his destination looking like a monkey.</li>
            <li>The LCD display is just fine; I don&#x27;t know why anyone is complaining about this.</li>
            <li>This was a positive investment and a perfect present.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the cheaper unit would have done the same job for cheaper, but I&#x27;m happy with the 9190.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth plastic with some rubber running along the sides, the contour looking bit is under the plastic.  </li>
            <li>I did not expect the rinse indicator to light up each time I use it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has some nice features including a screen that tells you how many minutes you have used and how many you have left.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a Reminton Microscreen for the last 10 years and have been happy with it</li>
            <li>I was told that there were no stores that could order this for me and that it wasn&#x27;t available via the company website.</li>
            <li>When I asked Philips customer support from the Philips website, I was told that since the model had been discontinued, the information was no longer available on the website.</li>
            <li>I picked up the cheapest, and oldest, Norelco model available.</li>
            <li>This razor provides a good shave and remains sufficiently charged for nearly a month of my shaves.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, if you have a light beard then this would be a great shaver; it&#x27;s certainly easy to clean (just rinse under water after each shave) and very light weight.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean out and there are indicators on the screen that tell you when to clean it, charge it, or replace the blades.</li>
            <li>However, all the things the company claims about it being good with every curve of your face is pretty much exageration.</li>
            <li>You also can know how much time that you can use very easily.</li>
            <li>I bought one of the new Norelco 9000 series, (all 9000 series are the same except for jet cleaning/LCD screens), and wasn&#x27;t impressed.  </li>
            <li>Motor is quieter, design is pretty, better handling, but</li>
            <li>Well worth the cash!</li>
            <li>This happened more in the first month of shaving...</li>
            <li>This is my third Norelco and by far the best.</li>
            <li>The razor LED tells you when to clean the heads.</li>
            <li>I clean it after every shave.</li>
            <li>Clean close shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like &lt;br /&gt;having to clean it as often as is recommended.  </li>
            <li>Close, comfortable and quick.</li>
            <li>And its very smooth and fast too.</li>
            <li>If your trying to grind your face off with the 9190xl, and applying an accordingly high degree of pressure, then maybe the SmartTouchXL will make it slightly more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Good solid product  </li>
            <li>It was superior to the low end 6843.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get a full charge and the time indicator may indicate anywhere from 33 to 73 minutes.</li>
            <li>And after using more than 5 years I replaced it with this beauty 9190XL SmartTouchXL, and indeed it&#x27;s really smart!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The battery is good enough it will work for 15 days easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The display indicates 85 minutes of shaving on a full charge.</li>
            <li>If you have sensative skin and are willing to pay $200 I strongly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li>Not that I really expected anything more, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s deserving of any praise that Norelco gives it.  </li>
            <li>But I was quickly moved over by this 9190XL shaver.</li>
            <li>so rather quick</li>
            <li>Great Razor and saves time compared to using a conventional razor and shaving cream.</li>
            <li>The shaver does a good job of giving a smooth shave, but it is loaded with extras that sound good and don&#x27;t mean much and with one that I really don&#x27;t understand at all.</li>
            <li>I believe it would work exceptionally for someone with a little more meat on their bones.  </li>
            <li>time I went for the new top of the line</li>
            <li>After I use this new one I&#x27;ll give a more qualified review.</li>
            <li>A great improvement over previous Norelco shavers I have owned in every way.</li>
            <li>But there is so much more, including the way it shaves your face without pulling on your beard even if it is long (most times for me).</li>
            <li>giving an excellent shave, there are other major advantages.  </li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>when used with the grain, this is well worth the dollar/quids/</li>
            <li>probably $130 with its fany looks and all but not at all worth 2 bills.</li>
            <li>But big fluckkin deal, what does it matter when it doesn&#x27;t give you a smooth shave &amp; as I said causes ingrown hairs &amp; makes you skin feel like sandpaper &amp; leaves too many unshaven hairs.</li>
            <li>The shaver has a nice, substantial feel to it - very solid.  </li>
            <li>WELL WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li>I liked the Spectra, but compared to it the XL simply outclasses</li>
            <li>It shaves as close, quicker, with no heating of the blades, and doesn&#x27;t nick the skin when you are shaving in more sensitive areas than your face.  </li>
            <li>The razor irritated my face on the most sensitive setting.</li>
            <li>Other than replacing the battery once or twice, it&#x27;s been a good shaver for me, and it had an LCD display on it too.  </li>
            <li>They say you need to use the razor exclusively for 3-weeks before you decide if it&#x27;s right for you.</li>
            <li>This feature is a must and helped make my decision easy, on which new model to buy.</li>
            <li>it works well enough, but it&#x27;s clear that it is nothing more than cheap injection molded plastic, with a cheap quartz clock to match.  </li>
            <li>The only time it opened easily is when it fell on the floor !</li>
            <li>This razor avoids a lot of the useless options and has many useful ones (like the lcd display with battery life - which is very nice if you travel often like I do).  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe this new shaver!!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not perfect, but I do think it&#x27;s the best on the market right now</li>
            <li>and this is so good, not only am I able to use this everyday, I even gave away all of my straight razors, which was tons, because i was convinced that this was going to be able to convert completely to electric shaving...and it has.</li>
            <li>The travel case that it comes with - reasonably nice nylon that is stiffened on one side, works well; fit is very tight and it seems to offer ample protection to the head of the razor (coupled with the not-really-all-that-bad plastic cover).  </li>
            <li>Provides a pretty close shave compared to blades  </li>
            <li>Used consistently for the recommended 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>This model is marginally better than the earlier 955RX.</li>
            <li>The means of cleaning it - running it through water - is ingenious, if not exceedingly simple.  </li>
            <li>But it was the first charge cycle</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and the battery lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>This is my first Electric Shaver ever.</li>
            <li>i say ;).</li>
            <li>I had to choose something to gripe about, it would be that the hairs do not get cut on the first pass sometimes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am really happy to have it, it is little expensive but you have to pay more if you want more!</li>
            <li>If protecting the heads is so important, why didn&#x27;t they make the head protector piece a little more rugged?  </li>
            <li>would like to see a shaver that does not have as many needless features, but has all of the good features of this model at a lower price.</li>
            <li>Great on face area  Extremely and amazingly quiet    </li>
            <li>First off I have to say I have very sensative skin around my neck and throat area.</li>
            <li>The heads do warm up just a bit(I heard not as much like other shavers)</li>
            <li>Cleanup is fast and easy by simply flushing the shaver under hot water.  </li>
            <li>I was seduced by the new features offered by this shaver thinking it was worth it but found out after one week using it that it is not.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price, and not having to worry about buying new packs of blades every month.</li>
            <li>Not a debilitating issue, I notice it every once in awhile and it&#x27;s easy to play around with it for a second until it rights itself.</li>
            <li>Second, although the timer display is large, certain numbers are not so easy to read.</li>
            <li>I tried the 21 day trial with the Philips Norelco 9190XL Smart Touch XL Shaver.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Philips Norelco 9190XL Smart TouchXL Shaver on April 30, 2007,had</li>
            <li>It shaves well and comes with a hard travel protective case (good for travel as well).  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say the first time I used I had very little razor burn.</li>
            <li>Gives a very close shave for smooth skin, lasts forever and has a big display.</li>
            <li>I have had no skin irritation, although the additional holes in the screen cause a bit more drag across my face.  </li>
            <li>it definately reduces the shaving time and is very convenient to have.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, it gives you a superfast shave much faster then</li>
            <li>It gives close, comfortable shaves that last the day.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to reviews like these, I found the Norelco 9190 XL (although I don&#x27;t believe everything I read).</li>
            <li>any razor could have, he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have as much five o&#x27;clock shadow as I use to</li>
            <li>I get a sligly faster shave (but not closer) but irritates my skin (thanks to the three ring shaving heads, faster shave but uncortable one).</li>
            <li>(cause sometimes you really need to as manual indicates).  </li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve owned Norelco shavers in the past, I am very pleased with the smooth, fast, quiet shave given by the 9190XL.</li>
            <li>With the three settings for sensitivity, I was able to adjust the heads to achieve a shave as close as a blade with absolutely no irritation.  </li>
            <li>I really like this razor.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li>In comparison to a Mach 3, which I would shave with and against the grain with, the 9190xl is very close, but not quite there in terms of closeness.  </li>
            <li>the SmartTouchXL system as a whole:  </li>
            <li>A very close shave.</li>
            <li>They are reliable and don&#x27;t heat up that much.  </li>
            <li>It shaves much closer than a blade...</li>
            <li>It comes with charger and it is so fast.</li>
            <li>Although, not by much.</li>
            <li>I purchased it in 2007 and it still works very well.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Customer services also works very well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a brand that I really trust.</li>
            <li>The display is clear and gives the appropriate information regarding time consumed by the shave and time left in the charge.</li>
            <li>The older models (pre 8000) didn&#x27;t drop large, very noticeable amounts of shavings when they were used.  </li>
            <li>SURPRISED AT HOW QUIET, COMFORTABLE AND CLOSE THE SHAVE WAS FROM THE FIRST TIME I USED IT.</li>
            <li>Its also quiet in operation and easey to clean under the faucet.    </li>
            <li>Bear in mind that satisfaction with a particular shaver is very subjective and variable.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, years ago it did not take long for my face to adjust.</li>
            <li>, I cannot really tell a difference between this and sensitive, and I have yet to notice the head really moving much when shaving.  </li>
            <li>(my opinion there, of course, is pretty much completely unfounded</li>
            <li>This new model shows the Spectra was a lemon model and that the rotary technology can improve and deliver a close, fast and painless shave.  </li>
            <li>I have had many electric shavers including previous Norelco models.</li>
            <li>My previous one was have more noise.</li>
            <li>This razor works way better than the newer one, and costs over $100 less.</li>
            <li>The main thing I like is the closer shave.  </li>
            <li>The battery lasts forever and it runs very quiet and, above all, gives a shave better than a safety razor.</li>
            <li>After many Foil replacements, I decided to go back to the Norelco as the Braun was not giving me a close enough shave.</li>
            <li>I get a closer shave than my older Norelco.</li>
            <li>No support for older models from the company website.  </li>
            <li>Save yourself some money and go with an older model.</li>
            <li>I guess the warning beep might be good, but I&#x27;m not lazy enough to not clean it after each shave, so I&#x27;ll never hear it.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>b/c I don&#x27;t like rechargeable razors and Philips Norelco doesn&#x27;t seem to make corded high end machines anymore.</li>
            <li>They could make that protective cover a little more sturdy.</li>
            <li>It has one little mark at the top where the twelve would be and nothing else.</li>
            <li>the old razor and the shave is closer, much closer.  </li>
            <li>I was really nervous about it because he has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>i thought there was something wrong with it because i couldn&#x27;t hear it running, the battery is great, haven&#x27;t had to charge it</li>
            <li>and I do enjoy the digital display however if you wanted to save $50 you could get the model without it and still have much of the same functionality.    </li>
            <li>I have it set to the normal sensitivity setting which means it tightens the spring and pressure of the floating heads.</li>
            <li>If after 3 or 4 weeks you don&#x27;t think the razor is right for you, send it back.</li>
            <li>I am 64 and purchase a new norelco about every four years.</li>
            <li>My new Philips Norelco Model #9190XL Electric Rechargeable Razor.  </li>
            <li>It does take about four weeks for the heads to seat properly, but after that it shaves quickly, quietly and comfortably.</li>
            <li>Because I frequently shave far away from an a/c outlet, I needed the timer display to tell me to get ready for a charge.</li>
            <li>The only thing I dislike is that the plastic head cover retaining tabs break the first week of usage.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not satisfied with this shave, coming from a blade, you may have more pressing issues to address.</li>
            <li>I first tried I was so amazed it was very low noise!</li>
            <li>I have been using electric razors since shortly after I first started shaving (I am 24 now)</li>
            <li>Cleaning the head is a simple matter of rinsing under hot water.</li>
            <li>His face is smooth and it cuts down his shaving time.</li>
            <li>Well I was replacing all my other shaver/trimmers, so might as well make a it a clean slate.  </li>
            <li>My husband has very sensitive skin, but the SmartTouchXL has 3 shaving selections which included sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It counts down how many minutes of charge time you have left as well as reminding you when to flush and charge and even replace the heads at the end of a year.</li>
            <li>my advice: not worth the upgrade from a recent model and not well suited for sensitive skins (although always better than manual razors).</li>
            <li>this also has a nice blue back lit background on the display and the numbers roll down like the timer on old fashioned audio cassette players.</li>
            <li>The shaver also left hairs on my face, which caused me to have to repeatedly shave certain areas (neck/jaw line) repeatedly.</li>
            <li>So far, no razor burn.</li>
            <li>This razor offers no excuses.</li>
            <li>This razor is comfortable to hold and gives a close shave in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I replaced a Norelco Quad  action with this razor.  </li>
            <li>I got this for my husband and he likes the convenience it offers</li>
            <li>then the heads on my old shaver.  </li>
            <li>I should have listened to the more negative reviews on this</li>
            <li>Maybe because its Saturday and they&#x27;re really busy but</li>
            <li>This model is much improved over the last model -  1) longer battery life per charge, 2)closer shave 3)</li>
            <li>He used to cut himself frequently with manual blades.</li>
            <li>head has more coverage; however, I think the multi opening is too complex (holds and line opening to cut closer).</li>
            <li>My old one is \\&quot;DEAD\\&quot; does not charge nor does it work with outlet (7 yrs).</li>
            <li>Transition has been seamless.</li>
            <li>My son-in-law bought one and his is set to the \\&quot;sensitive</li>
            <li>but once so far and i use it every day for about three weeks now.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m dissapointed: my old 8000 series was smoother, with the 9190</li>
            <li>thats is the least important stuff, I&#x27;m getting hurt with this shaver!.  </li>
            <li>But if your pushing a regular amount while shaving, I don&#x27;t think it will make much of a difference.</li>
            <li>Prior to purchasing the 9190 I had been using the 6843 for 2+ years I immediately noticed a much closer and easier shave with the 1990.</li>
            <li>I HAD BEEN USING AN OLD THREE BLADE MACH 3 RAZOR FOR YEARS.</li>
            <li>Thus far it has lived up to my expectations.</li>
            <li>When I lost my corded Philips Quadra Action</li>
            <li>So Far my experience</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost 59 years old and have been using an electric shaver (almost always Norelco) since I started shaving at 13.</li>
            <li>Last forever on a single full charge  </li>
            <li>My understanding is that the small holes shave stubble better than do the slots; with the SpeedXL heads, the outer ring is primarily slots with three small patches of holes each, the middle ring has a higher percentage of holes, and the inner ring is all holes.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m not particularly inclined to do so, and I&#x27;m satisfied as it is and would have no qualms buying another Norelco down the road (assuming it&#x27;s not for another 5 years).</li>
            <li>Shaves about 40 percent quicker than the older versions and is extremely quiet !  </li>
            <li>old razor had the digital information screen so that is what I wanted in a new razor.</li>
            <li>No, I mean the SAME shaver for 12 years.  </li>
            <li>I suppose it was adjusting to my pattern because the minutes available after that charge were less than after the initial charge.</li>
            <li>I find it gives me a much closer shave than my previous Norelco and is much faster to boot.</li>
            <li>It does take some getting used to the circular heads when shaving my upper lip but did cover the area better than the Braun - which left a  small ridge near my nose.  </li>
            <li>, i.e. the LCD gauge might indicate as far on the \\&quot;N\\&quot; side as possible, when in fact the dial is about as far to the \\&quot;S\\&quot; side as can be.  </li>
            <li>a handy travel lock to prevent accidental activation, its own washing machine, which it sinks inside and is fully automated and this base unit also charges it which is 80 minutes use from a 60 minute charge, plus the usual 3 minute quick charge, sensitivity adjustment, remaining power in minutes or battery icon, pop up trimmer for sids and moustaches, cleaning reminder, 2 year shaving head life for which it will also tell you when has arrived and redesigned heads with</li>
            <li>Other than flushing with hot water, Norelco recommends cleaning and lubricating once a month.</li>
            <li>I initially tried the middle setting and got a little irritation on my neck but otherwise fine.  </li>
            <li>It works with long hair, but much quicker with short hair.</li>
            <li>Once the SmartTouch is charged it stays charged for a long time, it even tells you how much time you have left before you have to charge it again.  </li>
            <li>I also really like the battery display, how long the battery lasts for, and how quiet the shaver runs.   </li>
            <li>Norelco offers a 60 day money back guarantee.</li>
            <li>It only needs to be cleaned once a week in spite of the water fawcett icon that appears after nearly every shave.</li>
            <li>This is simple as all you do is rinse it under hot water, shake off the excess water and set it back into the \\&quot;charger holder.\\&quot; With the Braun, you have to purchase the cleaning fluid cartridges, an extra expense.</li>
            <li>/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Recently had to replace a 7 year old Norelco shaver when the internal battery charging circuitry fizzled.</li>
            <li>As far as washing is concerned it is very simple.</li>
            <li>only arrangement on my old Norelco.</li>
            <li>For a razor this expensive, that is nice.</li>
            <li>Definitely don&#x27;t buy one with a jet clean option either, as it&#x27;s a total waste of money.</li>
            <li>My wife on the other hand thinks I need to be placed in a straight jacket for shelling out $ 275.00 for an electric razor.</li>
            <li>The bled are very high quality and very sharp.</li>
            <li>The first few times I shaved on normal, last time was at the medium setting and my skin was less irritated.  </li>
            <li>I picked up the 9190xl a little over a month ago, so I feel I can make a reasonable review of it now.</li>
            <li>It tells you how much time you have left, and even has a little clock on it.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> The norelco shaver is excellent shaver for its price.</li>
            <li> The touch feeling is very comfortable!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco Electric Razors for 20 years &amp; have been a very happy customer, always upgrading every 2 years or so.</li>
            <li> the norelco 9190xl razor gives me my best shave ever.</li>
            <li> amazon shipping and tracking were superb.</li>
            <li> It worked wonderfully and even he says it shaves CLOSER than a blade.</li>
            <li> And he was very happy with it.</li>
            <li> buy this shaver, it is awesome.</li>
            <li> This shaver is the best shaver I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric razor I have ever used bar none.</li>
            <li> the others, this one is the best.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Other than that - an excellent machine.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric shaver I have had.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very impressed and very happy.  </li>
            <li> biggest improvement I can see is in the head design - the SpeedXL heads are very good at what they do.  </li>
            <li> It is really very good feature though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really beautiful to hold in hand.</li>
            <li> was great though...</li>
            <li> The Norelco 9190XL is a great shaving system.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and he loves it.</li>
            <li> If you can find it at a great price, buy it.</li>
            <li> The head does indeed pivot, but not to a great extent and not without undue pressure.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The 9190XL does great at longer hairs.</li>
            <li> THE BATTERY LIFE IS GREAT, AND IT HAS ALL THE FEATURES YOU COULD WANT.</li>
            <li> You have great people,thank you.</li>
            <li> I am happy w/ the shaver.</li>
            <li> I got it, I was so happy</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s better in 3 weeks, GREAT!  </li>
            <li> This seems to be a very good design and probably contributes most to the quality of shave offered by the 9190xl.   </li>
            <li> When the batteries stop taking a good charge(about 5 years), I discard the shaver and buy the newest model.</li>
            <li> I loved that cleaning it was just a matter of holding under the faucet.</li>
            <li> I do think you could receive as good of a shave without the pivoting SmartTouchXL head setup, and I would not worry about buying a cheaper Norelco with just the SpeedXL shaver heads.  </li>
            <li> the shaver is good.</li>
            <li> It is a good razor.</li>
            <li> It looks good.</li>
            <li> It feels good (in your hand and on your skin)</li>
            <li> recharge notification is a good feature.</li>
            <li> would have rated it four stars if the price had been lower or if all of the features had a good purpose.</li>
            <li> I would have rated it five stars if all of the features had a good purpose and the price had been lower.</li>
            <li> I hope this helps you guys before you make your purchase good luck.... &lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks very nice and feels very comfortable on my face.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this shaver was going to work as well as a razor, but it was great</li>
            <li> of this considered, I am very pleased with the 9190xl.  </li>
            <li> Nice bright display showing charge minutes remaining.</li>
            <li> I was using before Philishave, and was very satisfied with the performance.</li>
            <li> Why you would want to deal with a bulky stand and cleaning solution, when you could run it through water (nearly free!!)</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased with the nice close shave it gives me.  </li>
            <li> The LCD screen is easy (for me) to read, and a very nice feature.</li>
            <li> Anyway, nice shaver, don&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
            <li> I bought this electric razor for my husband after reading MANY reviews and decided it sounds like a good one.   </li>
            <li> Another nice feature is the travel lock.</li>
            <li> and it was nicely packed.</li>
            <li> While a nice zippered case is provided for the shaver, there is no provision for packing the charger cord.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> The fact that you can hold this under tap water to clean it is alone a great feature.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco&#x27;s for over 30 years and this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> I believe this to be the best Norelco shaver you have producted so far.  </li>
            <li> His face was very smooth.</li>
            <li> It comes with a great stainless steel carry case.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about two weeks and love it.  </li>
            <li> i think it&#x27;s 50% more shaving surface.</li>
            <li> The shaving unit also has 3 rubber cushions for more following-the-contours-of-your-face capabilities.</li>
            <li> and i love the close shave he gets with it</li>
            <li> The heads have a lot more shaving area</li>
            <li> I like being able to rinse the heads.  </li>
            <li> The adjustable comfort control seems to work ok.  </li>
            <li> but, Nooo, I knew better.</li>
            <li> either unless you&#x27;re an idiot)because Norelco said it was their top of the line razor.</li>
            <li> Nice to have a husband with a smooth face in a minute.    </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
            <li> more comfort during shaving.  </li>
            <li> This time, I wanted to try the latest to see if the coverage and close shave is any better.</li>
            <li> noticed the head is lighter, probably because you can rinse the head in water; therefore, most parts are plastic.</li>
            <li> , it worked better then</li>
            <li> They all did a better job than this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li> I was able to purchase it.</li>
            <li> This is THE closest shave that I&#x27;ve had in as many years.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love it though.</li>
            <li> But for sure the trimmer is for the birds, it does not cut anything.</li>
            <li> Outstanding razor.</li>
            <li> But I give AMAZON,COM outstanding for service and follow up .</li>
            <li> things considered, it has been a worthwhile purchase for me and should provide years of reliable service.</li>
            <li> This one you will enjoy !</li>
            <li> Also it is supposed to give 90 minutes of shaving time - the display never showed more than 85 minutes.  </li>
            <li> This newest iteration is better than before.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t, this clock may be ok.</li>
            <li> BUT, you do need to maintain this shaver since it has moving parts therefor you need to follow the manual accordingly for the best shave and again no big deal for me because....</li>
            <li> You just have to have the patience to look closely in a mirror while you shave in order to make sure you cut every hair.  </li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t  regret, I am sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this added to the irritation.</li>
            <li> I mayhave to replace the battery since it does not work nowadays more than 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Philips and Norelco for a great product.  </li>
            <li> It also has a nice battery indicator screen and notifies you when you need to clean the thing.</li>
            <li> This is the best investment that I&#x27;ve made in a long time.  </li>
            <li> I really have not been able to determine how good a shave it gives.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> it is also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The battery keeps its charge a long time and the LCD is not a problem...it does what it suppose to do w/ minimum effort, some people are just way too picky for their own good but to each their own</li>
            <li> That said, I did get a very good shave with the Mach 3, so I was looking for something similar in an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> It is great for people that has sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The shaver really feels good and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Since my husband has got the Norelco Shaver he shaves every morning - which is unusual for me!!!:)</li>
            <li> My wife is hoping I will be more inclined to be clean shaven morning and night.</li>
            <li> VERY quick easy shave  </li>
            <li> Easy to use  </li>
            <li> It cuts the neck hairs better and is also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The shave is pretty close which is amazing.</li>
            <li> so it was great for him to be able to use it on board and airplane so he did not arrive at his destination looking like a monkey.</li>
            <li> The LCD display is just fine; I don&#x27;t know why anyone is complaining about this.</li>
            <li> This was a positive investment and a perfect present.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the cheaper unit would have done the same job for cheaper, but I&#x27;m happy with the 9190.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth plastic with some rubber running along the sides, the contour looking bit is under the plastic.  </li>
            <li> I did not expect the rinse indicator to light up each time I use it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has some nice features including a screen that tells you how many minutes you have used and how many you have left.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Reminton Microscreen for the last 10 years and have been happy with it</li>
            <li> I was told that there were no stores that could order this for me and that it wasn&#x27;t available via the company website.</li>
            <li> When I asked Philips customer support from the Philips website, I was told that since the model had been discontinued, the information was no longer available on the website.</li>
            <li> I picked up the cheapest, and oldest, Norelco model available.</li>
            <li> This razor provides a good shave and remains sufficiently charged for nearly a month of my shaves.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, if you have a light beard then this would be a great shaver; it&#x27;s certainly easy to clean (just rinse under water after each shave) and very light weight.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean out and there are indicators on the screen that tell you when to clean it, charge it, or replace the blades.</li>
            <li> However, all the things the company claims about it being good with every curve of your face is pretty much exageration.</li>
            <li> You also can know how much time that you can use very easily.</li>
            <li> I bought one of the new Norelco 9000 series, (all 9000 series are the same except for jet cleaning/LCD screens), and wasn&#x27;t impressed.  </li>
            <li> Motor is quieter, design is pretty, better handling, but</li>
            <li> Well worth the cash!</li>
            <li> This happened more in the first month of shaving...</li>
            <li> This is my third Norelco and by far the best.</li>
            <li> The razor LED tells you when to clean the heads.</li>
            <li> I clean it after every shave.</li>
            <li> Clean close shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like &lt;br /&gt;having to clean it as often as is recommended.  </li>
            <li> Close, comfortable and quick.</li>
            <li> And its very smooth and fast too.</li>
            <li> If your trying to grind your face off with the 9190xl, and applying an accordingly high degree of pressure, then maybe the SmartTouchXL will make it slightly more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Good solid product  </li>
            <li> It was superior to the low end 6843.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get a full charge and the time indicator may indicate anywhere from 33 to 73 minutes.</li>
            <li> And after using more than 5 years I replaced it with this beauty 9190XL SmartTouchXL, and indeed it&#x27;s really smart!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery is good enough it will work for 15 days easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The display indicates 85 minutes of shaving on a full charge.</li>
            <li> If you have sensative skin and are willing to pay $200 I strongly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> Not that I really expected anything more, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s deserving of any praise that Norelco gives it.  </li>
            <li> But I was quickly moved over by this 9190XL shaver.</li>
            <li> so rather quick</li>
            <li> Great Razor and saves time compared to using a conventional razor and shaving cream.</li>
            <li> The shaver does a good job of giving a smooth shave, but it is loaded with extras that sound good and don&#x27;t mean much and with one that I really don&#x27;t understand at all.</li>
            <li> I believe it would work exceptionally for someone with a little more meat on their bones.  </li>
            <li> time I went for the new top of the line</li>
            <li> After I use this new one I&#x27;ll give a more qualified review.</li>
            <li> A great improvement over previous Norelco shavers I have owned in every way.</li>
            <li> But there is so much more, including the way it shaves your face without pulling on your beard even if it is long (most times for me).</li>
            <li> giving an excellent shave, there are other major advantages.  </li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> when used with the grain, this is well worth the dollar/quids/</li>
            <li> probably $130 with its fany looks and all but not at all worth 2 bills.</li>
            <li> But big fluckkin deal, what does it matter when it doesn&#x27;t give you a smooth shave &amp; as I said causes ingrown hairs &amp; makes you skin feel like sandpaper &amp; leaves too many unshaven hairs.</li>
            <li> The shaver has a nice, substantial feel to it - very solid.  </li>
            <li> WELL WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li> I liked the Spectra, but compared to it the XL simply outclasses</li>
            <li> It shaves as close, quicker, with no heating of the blades, and doesn&#x27;t nick the skin when you are shaving in more sensitive areas than your face.  </li>
            <li> The razor irritated my face on the most sensitive setting.</li>
            <li> Other than replacing the battery once or twice, it&#x27;s been a good shaver for me, and it had an LCD display on it too.  </li>
            <li> They say you need to use the razor exclusively for 3-weeks before you decide if it&#x27;s right for you.</li>
            <li> This feature is a must and helped make my decision easy, on which new model to buy.</li>
            <li> it works well enough, but it&#x27;s clear that it is nothing more than cheap injection molded plastic, with a cheap quartz clock to match.  </li>
            <li> The only time it opened easily is when it fell on the floor !</li>
            <li> This razor avoids a lot of the useless options and has many useful ones (like the lcd display with battery life - which is very nice if you travel often like I do).  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this new shaver!!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, but I do think it&#x27;s the best on the market right now</li>
            <li> and this is so good, not only am I able to use this everyday, I even gave away all of my straight razors, which was tons, because i was convinced that this was going to be able to convert completely to electric shaving...and it has.</li>
            <li> The travel case that it comes with - reasonably nice nylon that is stiffened on one side, works well; fit is very tight and it seems to offer ample protection to the head of the razor (coupled with the not-really-all-that-bad plastic cover).  </li>
            <li> Provides a pretty close shave compared to blades  </li>
            <li> Used consistently for the recommended 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> This model is marginally better than the earlier 955RX.</li>
            <li> The means of cleaning it - running it through water - is ingenious, if not exceedingly simple.  </li>
            <li> But it was the first charge cycle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and the battery lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> This is my first Electric Shaver ever.</li>
            <li> i say ;).</li>
            <li> I had to choose something to gripe about, it would be that the hairs do not get cut on the first pass sometimes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am really happy to have it, it is little expensive but you have to pay more if you want more!</li>
            <li> If protecting the heads is so important, why didn&#x27;t they make the head protector piece a little more rugged?  </li>
            <li> would like to see a shaver that does not have as many needless features, but has all of the good features of this model at a lower price.</li>
            <li> Great on face area  Extremely and amazingly quiet    </li>
            <li> First off I have to say I have very sensative skin around my neck and throat area.</li>
            <li> The heads do warm up just a bit(I heard not as much like other shavers)</li>
            <li> Cleanup is fast and easy by simply flushing the shaver under hot water.  </li>
            <li> I was seduced by the new features offered by this shaver thinking it was worth it but found out after one week using it that it is not.  </li>
            <li> Worth the price, and not having to worry about buying new packs of blades every month.</li>
            <li> Not a debilitating issue, I notice it every once in awhile and it&#x27;s easy to play around with it for a second until it rights itself.</li>
            <li> Second, although the timer display is large, certain numbers are not so easy to read.</li>
            <li> I tried the 21 day trial with the Philips Norelco 9190XL Smart Touch XL Shaver.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Philips Norelco 9190XL Smart TouchXL Shaver on April 30, 2007,had</li>
            <li> It shaves well and comes with a hard travel protective case (good for travel as well).  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say the first time I used I had very little razor burn.</li>
            <li> Gives a very close shave for smooth skin, lasts forever and has a big display.</li>
            <li> I have had no skin irritation, although the additional holes in the screen cause a bit more drag across my face.  </li>
            <li> it definately reduces the shaving time and is very convenient to have.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, it gives you a superfast shave much faster then</li>
            <li> It gives close, comfortable shaves that last the day.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to reviews like these, I found the Norelco 9190 XL (although I don&#x27;t believe everything I read).</li>
            <li> any razor could have, he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have as much five o&#x27;clock shadow as I use to</li>
            <li> I get a sligly faster shave (but not closer) but irritates my skin (thanks to the three ring shaving heads, faster shave but uncortable one).</li>
            <li> (cause sometimes you really need to as manual indicates).  </li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve owned Norelco shavers in the past, I am very pleased with the smooth, fast, quiet shave given by the 9190XL.</li>
            <li> With the three settings for sensitivity, I was able to adjust the heads to achieve a shave as close as a blade with absolutely no irritation.  </li>
            <li> I really like this razor.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li> In comparison to a Mach 3, which I would shave with and against the grain with, the 9190xl is very close, but not quite there in terms of closeness.  </li>
            <li> the SmartTouchXL system as a whole:  </li>
            <li> A very close shave.</li>
            <li> They are reliable and don&#x27;t heat up that much.  </li>
            <li> It shaves much closer than a blade...</li>
            <li> It comes with charger and it is so fast.</li>
            <li> Although, not by much.</li>
            <li> I purchased it in 2007 and it still works very well.  </li>
            <li> I really recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Customer services also works very well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a brand that I really trust.</li>
            <li> The display is clear and gives the appropriate information regarding time consumed by the shave and time left in the charge.</li>
            <li> The older models (pre 8000) didn&#x27;t drop large, very noticeable amounts of shavings when they were used.  </li>
            <li> SURPRISED AT HOW QUIET, COMFORTABLE AND CLOSE THE SHAVE WAS FROM THE FIRST TIME I USED IT.</li>
            <li> Its also quiet in operation and easey to clean under the faucet.    </li>
            <li> Bear in mind that satisfaction with a particular shaver is very subjective and variable.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, years ago it did not take long for my face to adjust.</li>
            <li> , I cannot really tell a difference between this and sensitive, and I have yet to notice the head really moving much when shaving.  </li>
            <li> (my opinion there, of course, is pretty much completely unfounded</li>
            <li> This new model shows the Spectra was a lemon model and that the rotary technology can improve and deliver a close, fast and painless shave.  </li>
            <li> I have had many electric shavers including previous Norelco models.</li>
            <li> My previous one was have more noise.</li>
            <li> This razor works way better than the newer one, and costs over $100 less.</li>
            <li> The main thing I like is the closer shave.  </li>
            <li> The battery lasts forever and it runs very quiet and, above all, gives a shave better than a safety razor.</li>
            <li> After many Foil replacements, I decided to go back to the Norelco as the Braun was not giving me a close enough shave.</li>
            <li> I get a closer shave than my older Norelco.</li>
            <li> No support for older models from the company website.  </li>
            <li> Save yourself some money and go with an older model.</li>
            <li> I guess the warning beep might be good, but I&#x27;m not lazy enough to not clean it after each shave, so I&#x27;ll never hear it.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> b/c I don&#x27;t like rechargeable razors and Philips Norelco doesn&#x27;t seem to make corded high end machines anymore.</li>
            <li> They could make that protective cover a little more sturdy.</li>
            <li> It has one little mark at the top where the twelve would be and nothing else.</li>
            <li> the old razor and the shave is closer, much closer.  </li>
            <li> I was really nervous about it because he has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> i thought there was something wrong with it because i couldn&#x27;t hear it running, the battery is great, haven&#x27;t had to charge it</li>
            <li> and I do enjoy the digital display however if you wanted to save $50 you could get the model without it and still have much of the same functionality.    </li>
            <li> I have it set to the normal sensitivity setting which means it tightens the spring and pressure of the floating heads.</li>
            <li> If after 3 or 4 weeks you don&#x27;t think the razor is right for you, send it back.</li>
            <li> I am 64 and purchase a new norelco about every four years.</li>
            <li> My new Philips Norelco Model #9190XL Electric Rechargeable Razor.  </li>
            <li> It does take about four weeks for the heads to seat properly, but after that it shaves quickly, quietly and comfortably.</li>
            <li> Because I frequently shave far away from an a/c outlet, I needed the timer display to tell me to get ready for a charge.</li>
            <li> The only thing I dislike is that the plastic head cover retaining tabs break the first week of usage.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not satisfied with this shave, coming from a blade, you may have more pressing issues to address.</li>
            <li> I first tried I was so amazed it was very low noise!</li>
            <li> I have been using electric razors since shortly after I first started shaving (I am 24 now)</li>
            <li> Cleaning the head is a simple matter of rinsing under hot water.</li>
            <li> His face is smooth and it cuts down his shaving time.</li>
            <li> Well I was replacing all my other shaver/trimmers, so might as well make a it a clean slate.  </li>
            <li> My husband has very sensitive skin, but the SmartTouchXL has 3 shaving selections which included sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It counts down how many minutes of charge time you have left as well as reminding you when to flush and charge and even replace the heads at the end of a year.</li>
            <li> my advice: not worth the upgrade from a recent model and not well suited for sensitive skins (although always better than manual razors).</li>
            <li> this also has a nice blue back lit background on the display and the numbers roll down like the timer on old fashioned audio cassette players.</li>
            <li> The shaver also left hairs on my face, which caused me to have to repeatedly shave certain areas (neck/jaw line) repeatedly.</li>
            <li> So far, no razor burn.</li>
            <li> This razor offers no excuses.</li>
            <li> This razor is comfortable to hold and gives a close shave in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I replaced a Norelco Quad  action with this razor.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and he likes the convenience it offers</li>
            <li> then the heads on my old shaver.  </li>
            <li> I should have listened to the more negative reviews on this</li>
            <li> Maybe because its Saturday and they&#x27;re really busy but</li>
            <li> This model is much improved over the last model -  1) longer battery life per charge, 2)closer shave 3)</li>
            <li> He used to cut himself frequently with manual blades.</li>
            <li> head has more coverage; however, I think the multi opening is too complex (holds and line opening to cut closer).</li>
            <li> My old one is \\&quot;DEAD\\&quot; does not charge nor does it work with outlet (7 yrs).</li>
            <li> Transition has been seamless.</li>
            <li> My son-in-law bought one and his is set to the \\&quot;sensitive</li>
            <li> but once so far and i use it every day for about three weeks now.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m dissapointed: my old 8000 series was smoother, with the 9190</li>
            <li> thats is the least important stuff, I&#x27;m getting hurt with this shaver!.  </li>
            <li> But if your pushing a regular amount while shaving, I don&#x27;t think it will make much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Prior to purchasing the 9190 I had been using the 6843 for 2+ years I immediately noticed a much closer and easier shave with the 1990.</li>
            <li> I HAD BEEN USING AN OLD THREE BLADE MACH 3 RAZOR FOR YEARS.</li>
            <li> Thus far it has lived up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> When I lost my corded Philips Quadra Action</li>
            <li> So Far my experience</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 59 years old and have been using an electric shaver (almost always Norelco) since I started shaving at 13.</li>
            <li> Last forever on a single full charge  </li>
            <li> My understanding is that the small holes shave stubble better than do the slots; with the SpeedXL heads, the outer ring is primarily slots with three small patches of holes each, the middle ring has a higher percentage of holes, and the inner ring is all holes.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not particularly inclined to do so, and I&#x27;m satisfied as it is and would have no qualms buying another Norelco down the road (assuming it&#x27;s not for another 5 years).</li>
            <li> Shaves about 40 percent quicker than the older versions and is extremely quiet !  </li>
            <li> old razor had the digital information screen so that is what I wanted in a new razor.</li>
            <li> No, I mean the SAME shaver for 12 years.  </li>
            <li> I suppose it was adjusting to my pattern because the minutes available after that charge were less than after the initial charge.</li>
            <li> I find it gives me a much closer shave than my previous Norelco and is much faster to boot.</li>
            <li> It does take some getting used to the circular heads when shaving my upper lip but did cover the area better than the Braun - which left a  small ridge near my nose.  </li>
            <li> , i.e. the LCD gauge might indicate as far on the \\&quot;N\\&quot; side as possible, when in fact the dial is about as far to the \\&quot;S\\&quot; side as can be.  </li>
            <li> a handy travel lock to prevent accidental activation, its own washing machine, which it sinks inside and is fully automated and this base unit also charges it which is 80 minutes use from a 60 minute charge, plus the usual 3 minute quick charge, sensitivity adjustment, remaining power in minutes or battery icon, pop up trimmer for sids and moustaches, cleaning reminder, 2 year shaving head life for which it will also tell you when has arrived and redesigned heads with</li>
            <li> Other than flushing with hot water, Norelco recommends cleaning and lubricating once a month.</li>
            <li> I initially tried the middle setting and got a little irritation on my neck but otherwise fine.  </li>
            <li> It works with long hair, but much quicker with short hair.</li>
            <li> Once the SmartTouch is charged it stays charged for a long time, it even tells you how much time you have left before you have to charge it again.  </li>
            <li> I also really like the battery display, how long the battery lasts for, and how quiet the shaver runs.   </li>
            <li> Norelco offers a 60 day money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> It only needs to be cleaned once a week in spite of the water fawcett icon that appears after nearly every shave.</li>
            <li> This is simple as all you do is rinse it under hot water, shake off the excess water and set it back into the \\&quot;charger holder.\\&quot; With the Braun, you have to purchase the cleaning fluid cartridges, an extra expense.</li>
            <li> /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Recently had to replace a 7 year old Norelco shaver when the internal battery charging circuitry fizzled.</li>
            <li> As far as washing is concerned it is very simple.</li>
            <li> only arrangement on my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> For a razor this expensive, that is nice.</li>
            <li> Definitely don&#x27;t buy one with a jet clean option either, as it&#x27;s a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> My wife on the other hand thinks I need to be placed in a straight jacket for shelling out $ 275.00 for an electric razor.</li>
            <li> The bled are very high quality and very sharp.</li>
            <li> The first few times I shaved on normal, last time was at the medium setting and my skin was less irritated.  </li>
            <li> I picked up the 9190xl a little over a month ago, so I feel I can make a reasonable review of it now.</li>
            <li> It tells you how much time you have left, and even has a little clock on it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and the shave burned me slightly the first few times.</li>
            <li> would recommend everybody who are using Philips Shaver, just go and upgrade your old shaver, and if you are using other than Philips then immediately buy this</li>
            <li> subtract that from the features the company claims the product offers and u&#x27;d be left with a product that is not worth $200 at all.</li>
            <li> And front there is small display which shows times, how much you used and how much left!</li>
            <li> only \\&quot;set-back\\&quot; is that when your hair is long, it takes several passes to get it close.</li>
            <li> I like long shaves (6 minutes) and the batteries last only a month if you shave 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> but I emailed customer service last week, they gave me a number to call, I called it and it put me on hold for a long time and then couldn&#x27;t take my call and hung up on me.</li>
            <li> True to their word, each shave takes approximately 3 minutes once you get used to it.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint is really AMAZON not Norelco, the 9190XL was advertised with a $30 Amazon credit which never arrived.   </li>
            <li> the old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The XL takes less time, shaves closer and is quieter.</li>
            <li> One positive for the newer one, is that when I finally got all the stray hairs the 9000 series left behind I did notice a closer shave than the 7110X.</li>
            <li> So, although it may not be quite as close, you would really have to rub your face all day long to notice a difference, and even then it is hardly anything.  </li>
            <li> I tried different angles and push even harder to the face and it does not work well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Holds charge for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Norelco tends to pull hairs if you let the beard grow over a long weekend.</li>
            <li> Long battery life between charges.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using philips-Norelco electric shavers for the past 10 years, every couple of years I change for an updated new model, so I&#x27;m not new to these shavers.</li>
            <li> I think all the other features are the same on both, plus you would save a lot of money.</li>
            <li> You can rinse under water but it clogged a lot &amp; very hard to keep clean, shaving head has small parts like a puzzle to put back together.  </li>
            <li> He likes the fact that it&#x27;s a dry</li>
            <li> Now, with seven years in use I have to replace the charge corders since they bacame dry and can break any time.  </li>
            <li> The battery shaves for weeks on a single charge.  </li>
            <li> I set it to sensitive and have had very little skin irritation from day one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe this one will last me just as long as the previous model.</li>
            <li> My only complaints are that the carrying case only fits the shaver and not the charger and it is not always easy to guide the shaver onto its base properly.  </li>
            <li> Mine charges to 85 minutes, but the last time I ran it down</li>
            <li> am thinking of either returning it or replacing heads with the 8 series model (too bad after spending $200!) or keep suffering a couple of weeks more to see if my face gets used to the new blades</li>
            <li> power button is in an inconvenient location, which makes it easy to turn the power off while attempting to shave.</li>
            <li> he looked like he has just starting shaving as there were odd hairs all over his neck and sideburns, and inflammed patchy skin where he tried to catch all the hairs.    </li>
            <li> I have a moderately coarse beard and no significant ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> The low, almost inaudible hum, the feel of the new heads that use their entire flat surface for cutting.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not to say it&#x27;s bad in any way - in fact, along my chin, it is actually better.</li>
            <li> JUST WITH OUT THE USELESS DIGITAL FEATURE, THAT ISNT REALLY NEEDED</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shavetime is not really 90 minutes.  </li>
            <li> IT HAS BEEN HARDER AND HARDER TO GET BLADES.</li>
            <li> It was expensive, but was worth.  </li>
            <li> It is a good one but for some reason it does a real terrible job on the non facial areas.</li>
            <li> Often it will be overly sensitive, and a small bump will move it from one extreme to the other, despite that the dial itself may be on the entirely other extreme</li>
            <li> the dark side, I have also found a couple of minor shortcomings: First, the travel-carrying case is difficult to unlatch.</li>
            <li> This gauge is not very useful.  </li>
            <li> The razor is very little different from my 8894xl.  </li>
            <li> i forked out for this, already owning 3 other philishaves,</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t know how it compares to other brands on that level.</li>
            <li> I have purchased three other shavers thru the years.</li>
            <li> When I got down to 7 minutes the display then rapidly counted down to zero, curious.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this also means that you don&#x27;t get a particularly close shave either!  </li>
            <li> Second, the three shaving heads still can&#x27;t get into those &#x27;hard to reach areas&#x27;,</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it did not work well on my very slender neck.  </li>
            <li> My father loves his Philips / Norelco shavers, unfortunately they never did much for me.  </li>
            <li> I seem to average about 4 minutes for a shave.</li>
            <li> SO THE CHOICE CAME DOWN TO BUYING ANOTHER MANUAL, WITH BLADES COSTING THREE DOLLARS+ OR MOVING ON TO AN ELECTRIC.</li>
            <li> and then it causes a slight rash.   </li>
            <li> My previous model had 9.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t die, but I thought that was odd (and I recharged it anyway).  </li>
            <li> It takes me longer to shave than with my previous shaver</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I find that the time it takes to shave my face is much less with the Norelco.</li>
            <li> If you are traveling with your shaver and you wanted to check something in the manual, the previous models are not listed on the website.  </li>
            <li> I had to use the trimmer to trim down the few.</li>
            <li> Read your little instruction book if you get this razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it had a little \\&quot;bite\\&quot; to it in</li>
            <li> The included stand seems a little flimsy.</li>
            <li> the difference is this: if you have a tough beard, particularly with little &#x27;hard to reach areas&#x27; then don&#x27;t go for this brand - I&#x27;d say go for a Braun!  </li>
            <li> zero risk of nicks or cuts, a shave you can have everyday, thats closer than a blade</li>
            <li> but it took him a few weeks to get used to it.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have that heavy of a beard.</li>
            <li> and I do not have a heavy beard.</li>
            <li> It is slow, ocassionally cuts me and never really gives a close shave...</li>
            <li> The battery lasts forever, seriously it is sometimes hard to believe how long it lasts..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the shaver everyday for the past 3 weeks and haven&#x27;t had the need to recharge it.  </li>
            <li> It was fairly expensive for a shaver, but if it is anything like my previous Norelco shavers, it will last at least 3 years.</li>
            <li> I got the expensive 9190, but I assume that any of the SmartTouchXL shavers would do the same job.  </li>
            <li> I had been using the Braun for the past 4 years.</li>
            <li> it think no more buy it</li>
            <li> Because I did recharge it after that day&#x27;s use, I&#x27;m not sure if this issue was with the capacity of the battery, or the calibration of the meter.  </li>
            <li> The charging cord now has a small transformer lump on the outlet side making it bulkier than the cord</li>
            <li> I would have given 5 stars if it had been a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Norelco shaver for at least 12 years now.  </li>
            <li> NEGATIVE</li>
            <li> It also comes with one small analogue clock!</li>
            <li> Ths product should be recalled from the general public because it gives you the worst shave &amp; irritates your skin.</li>
            <li> Also, it is next to impossible to get a replacement for one.  </li>
            <li> I find that parts of my chin/throat area has a few strands that are difficult to cut.</li>
            <li> The Trimmer i Think is no good</li>
            <li> sick of throwing away big bucks for Phillips every 2-3 years.</li>
            <li> and I was tired of buying the cleaning system solution - which are a rip off in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> In fact its worse than a razor around the neck line.</li>
            <li> According to the manual, it takes up to 3 weeks to conform to your skin and you may get some irritation until it gets broken in.</li>
            <li> LCD is terrible (contrary to old model) can&#x27;t see info unless I turn on the razon.</li>
            <li> The charging base has a little clock, but I do not see the point in that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had never  tried a Norelco product  before and was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> this product being so expensive has its benifts.</li>
            <li> Totally useless on chin, neck area  </li>
            <li> Causes irritation  Useless on sideburns even with the pop up trimmer  </li>
            <li> Even after he received it, I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> It was expensive, but I feel no regret buying it.  </li>
            <li> But like all the rest, It had NiCad&#x27;s and went useless even with cord in after 3 years.</li>
            <li> I bought this model, it is expensive</li>
            <li> Have been using this expensive model for about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco razers for over 15 years, my last one, a Spectra, was the worst of the lot.</li>
            <li> I sadly put up with this for over a year because ocassionally it seemed to work.  </li>
            <li> cleaning reminder is meaningless because it shows after each shave.</li>
            <li> He  used to get crazy reactions to his skin.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would irritate his skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it was expensive and the trimmer is worthless but I would recomend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed because it is a state of the art shaver.  </li>
            <li> After using Norelco shavers for over 40 years I am disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend $3 on a stupid piece of plastic/metal that I would throw away every week.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t need a clock in the base.  </li>
            <li> (2 to 3 minutes) &lt;br /&gt;-The Mustache/beard trimmer built into the Norelco is worthless.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t understand why a clock was built into the base.</li>
            <li> I hated it and eventually got rid of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing the cause of this is the horrible HQ9 razor blades.</li>
            <li> Nolreco models as well as convential razors and have always had terrible razor burn.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this for my partner as a birthday gift. He travels quite a lot so it was great for him to be able to use it on board and airplane so he did not arrive at his destination looking like a monkey. I def recommend this for guys on the move and the carry case makes is travel well.</li>
            <li> the 2nd day shaving i pressed the button to pop the trimmer up and indeed the trimmer popped up - and out of the shaver.  after that happend the motor wont work and im stuck without a shaver.  the one shave that i did have with it was great though...</li>
            <li> My wife got this shaver for me as a birthday gift. It looks very nice and feels very comfortable on my face. I have it set to the normal sensitivity setting which means it tightens the spring and pressure of the floating heads. So far, no razor burn. This setting is suppose to also give the fastest shave. The shaver is very quiet. It comes with a great stainless steel carry case. For a razor this expensive, that is nice. I should not have to worry about it when I take trips. If I keep it in my car to shave while driving to work, it should be protected. Other than flushing with hot water, Norelco recommends cleaning and lubricating once a month. You can use their commericial products or, their instructions say use rubbing alcohol and mineral oil. They also suggest replacing the shaving heads once a year. Norelco offers a 60 day money back guarantee. They say you need to use the razor exclusively for 3-weeks before you decide if it&#x27;s right for you. This allows your skin to adjust to this razor. If after 3 or 4 weeks you don&#x27;t think the razor is right for you, send it back. So far, I&#x27;m pleased. If it&#x27;s better in 3 weeks, GREAT!  Read your little instruction book if you get this razor. I believe Norelco invested quite a bit into R&amp;D. For what this razor costs, you should take advantage of their efforts. My wife is hoping I will be more inclined to be clean shaven morning and night. This razor offers no excuses. The LCD display is just fine; I don&#x27;t know why anyone is complaining about this. Perhaps they are Braun employees. It counts down how many minutes of charge time you have left as well as reminding you when to flush and charge and even replace the heads at the end of a year. Norelco says I can expect about 80 minutes of run time from a charge. At 3 minutes a shave, that&#x27;s 26 shaves. Shave twive a day and you need to recharge twice a month. If necessary, you can run it with the cord pluged in as a corded shaver.</li>
            <li> This is my third Norelco and by far the best. I am a finicky shaver who, when I shaved with a blade, shaved against the grain to guarantee a close shave. This razor is comfortable to hold and gives a close shave in just a few minutes. It is easy to clean. The display is clear and gives the appropriate information regarding time consumed by the shave and time left in the charge. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Exceeds my expectations.</li>
            <li> The norelco shaver is excellent shaver for its price. It takes about two weeks to get familar with growth of the hair.</li>
            <li> A great improvement over previous Norelco shavers I have owned in every way. It does take about four weeks for the heads to seat properly, but after that it shaves quickly, quietly and comfortably. It only needs to be cleaned once a week in spite of the water fawcett icon that appears after nearly every shave.</li>
            <li> I replaced a Norelco Quad  action with this razor.  I have been using it for about two weeks and love it.  It shaves me in about 75% of the time it took with the old razor and the shave is closer, much closer.  I have had no skin irritation, although the additional holes in the screen cause a bit more drag across my face.  The battery shaves for weeks on a single charge.  The main thing I like is the closer shave.  I got the expensive 9190, but I assume that any of the SmartTouchXL shavers would do the same job.  I would buy this razor again.</li>
            <li> i forked out for this, already owning 3 other philishaves, (thats what these are called here in England) and this is so good, not only am I able to use this everyday, I even gave away all of my straight razors, which was tons, because i was convinced that this was going to be able to convert completely to electric shaving...and it has. &lt;br /&gt;Has a handy travel lock to prevent accidental activation, its own washing machine, which it sinks inside and is fully automated and this base unit also charges it which is 80 minutes use from a 60 minute charge, plus the usual 3 minute quick charge, sensitivity adjustment, remaining power in minutes or battery icon, pop up trimmer for sids and moustaches, cleaning reminder, 2 year shaving head life for which it will also tell you when has arrived and redesigned heads with i think it&#x27;s 50% more shaving surface. this also has a nice blue back lit background on the display and the numbers roll down like the timer on old fashioned audio cassette players. The shaving unit also has 3 rubber cushions for more following-the-contours-of-your-face capabilities. and improved areas that are rubberised for total control. &lt;br /&gt;for zero risk of nicks or cuts, a shave you can have everyday, thats closer than a blade when used with the grain, this is well worth the dollar/quids/whatever else is your currency in your country where you reading this &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver after giving up on my Braun 7600 series razor.  It just didn&#x27;t give me a close enough shave and I was tired of buying the cleaning system solution - which are a rip off in my opinion.  I had never  tried a Norelco product  before and was skeptical.  However it gives me the closest shave I have ever gotten from an electric.  I initially tried the middle setting and got a little irritation on my neck but otherwise fine.  It does take some getting used to the circular heads when shaving my upper lip but did cover the area better than the Braun - which left a  small ridge near my nose.  I like being able to just rinse the heads instead of an expensive and sticky cleaning system.  They could leave out all the fancy electronics and I didn&#x27;t need a clock in the base.  I would have given 5 stars if it had been a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> this product being so expensive has its benifts. it definately reduces the shaving time and is very convenient to have. However, all the things the company claims about it being good with every curve of your face is pretty much exageration. It does give a close shave on the face but the neckline is not covered by it at all. In fact its worse than a razor around the neck line. I got this for my husband and he likes the convenience it offers and i love the close shave he gets with it but it took him a few weeks to get used to it. He  used to get crazy reactions to his skin. It used to get very red and irritated. the neck line issues still remain. he uses a razor to shave his neck line. subtract that from the features the company claims the product offers and u&#x27;d be left with a product that is not worth $200 at all. probably $130 with its fany looks and all but not at all worth 2 bills. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> The Norelco 9190XL is a great shaving system.   I&#x27;ve used Norelco&#x27;s for over 30 years and this one is by far the best.  The only complaint is really AMAZON not Norelco, the 9190XL was advertised with a $30 Amazon credit which never arrived.   Be cautious on AMAZON Rebates &amp; CREDITS!!</li>
            <li> Well I was replacing all my other shaver/trimmers, so might as well make a it a clean slate.  I&#x27;ve been using a Norelco shaver for at least 12 years now.  No, I mean the SAME shaver for 12 years.  Other than replacing the battery once or twice, it&#x27;s been a good shaver for me, and it had an LCD display on it too.  I went back and forth between getting the 9190 and the cheaper 9160.  I didn&#x27;t have to have a LCD display, and almost went with the 9160, but decided since I was getting 20% off anyway, to spend the money on the 9190.  I don&#x27;t know if the cheaper unit would have done the same job for cheaper, but I&#x27;m happy with the 9190.  The heads have a lot more shaving area then the heads on my old shaver.  And this shaver is a lot quieter too.  I like being able to rinse the heads.  The adjustable comfort control seems to work ok.  The first few times I shaved on normal, last time was at the medium setting and my skin was less irritated.  If you&#x27;re looking at the picture of it and thinking it has contoured grips, it doesn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s smooth plastic with some rubber running along the sides, the contour looking bit is under the plastic.  Anyway, nice shaver, don&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and clean. You also can know how much time that you can use very easily. The touch feeling is very comfortable!!!</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the more negative reviews on this but, Nooo, I knew better. My mistake. I&#x27;ve been using Norelco Electric Razors for 20 years &amp; have been a very happy customer, always upgrading every 2 years or so. My last Norelco Razor was the Spectra 8894XL, which is now my present razor as well because of this 9190XL monstrosity. I purchased the 9190XL (I think its now the 9195XL don&#x27;t get that either unless you&#x27;re an idiot)because Norelco said it was their top of the line razor. Well after 4 months &amp; irritated skin &amp; ingrown hairs, I&#x27;ve given up on this danger to society. On the plus side, it gives you a superfast shave much faster then the 8894XL. But big fluckkin deal, what does it matter when it doesn&#x27;t give you a smooth shave &amp; as I said causes ingrown hairs &amp; makes you skin feel like sandpaper &amp; leaves too many unshaven hairs. I&#x27;m guessing the cause of this is the horrible HQ9 razor blades. In short, if you&#x27;re a masochist with an IQ of 2020, dismiss my review &amp; experience this for yourself. Ths product should be recalled from the general public because it gives you the worst shave &amp; irritates your skin.</li>
            <li> SAVE YOUR SELF THE XTRA 75 BUCKS AND JUST GET THE 9160XL SAME RAZOR JUST WITH OUT THE USELESS DIGITAL FEATURE, THAT ISNT REALLY NEEDED</li>
            <li> This is a shaver that does its job well, but it is a bit noisy.  It gives close, comfortable shaves that last the day.  I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> PROS;    Last forever on a single full charge  VERY quick easy shave  Good solid product  Easy to use  Provides a pretty close shave compared to blades  Great on face area  Extremely and amazingly quiet    CONS;    Totally useless on chin, neck area  Causes irritation  Useless on sideburns even with the pop up trimmer  Customer Service number leaves you on hold forever and then cuts you off.        I bought this electric razor for my husband after reading MANY reviews and decided it sounds like a good one.   It is a good one but for some reason it does a real terrible job on the non facial areas. Doesn&#x27;t catch longer hairs at all. You have to stretch out the skin on neck area to try and shave it and then it causes a slight rash.   The shave is pretty close which is amazing. Nice to have a husband with a smooth face in a minute.    Shame he looked like he has just starting shaving as there were odd hairs all over his neck and sideburns, and inflammed patchy skin where he tried to catch all the hairs.    We thought we&#x27;d try it for 21 days as they have a money back gurantee but I emailed customer service last week, they gave me a number to call, I called it and it put me on hold for a long time and then couldn&#x27;t take my call and hung up on me. Maybe because its Saturday and they&#x27;re really busy but overall experience with this razor and the company? NEGATIVE</li>
            <li> the norelco 9190xl razor gives me my best shave ever. it is also very easy to clean. amazon shipping and tracking were superb.</li>
            <li> This shave has met up to all of my expectations. The battery lasts forever and it runs very quiet and, above all, gives a shave better than a safety razor. You can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for about 40 years.  When the batteries stop taking a good charge(about 5 years), I discard the shaver and buy the newest model. This model is much improved over the last model -  1) longer battery life per charge, 2)closer shave 3) more comfort during shaving.  The only thing I dislike is that the plastic head cover retaining tabs break the first week of usage.  They could make that protective cover a little more sturdy.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas. I was really nervous about it because he has sensitive skin. But I did my research. Thanks to reviews like these, I found the Norelco 9190 XL (although I don&#x27;t believe everything I read). Even after he received it, I was skeptical. I thought it would take him weeks to get used to it. I was afraid it would irritate his skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it didn&#x27;t! It worked wonderfully and even he says it shaves CLOSER than a blade. His face was very smooth. And he was very happy with it. It&#x27;s easy to clean out and there are indicators on the screen that tell you when to clean it, charge it, or replace the blades. I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and he loves it. He used to cut himself frequently with manual blades. Even the \\&quot;quatro\\&quot; blades were of no use. He likes the fact that he doesn&#x27;t have to keep buying the manual blades and shaving cream. He likes the fact that it&#x27;s a dry shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only \\&quot;set-back\\&quot; is that when your hair is long, it takes several passes to get it close. But I don&#x27;t know how it compares to other brands on that level. It works with long hair, but much quicker with short hair.</li>
            <li> I tried the 21 day trial with the Philips Norelco 9190XL Smart Touch XL Shaver.  Unfortunately, it did not work well on my very slender neck.  I was really disappointed because it is a state of the art shaver.  I believe it would work exceptionally for someone with a little more meat on their bones.  I loved that cleaning it was just a matter of holding under the faucet.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco for 18 years now. I have purchased three other shavers thru the years. This time, I wanted to try the latest to see if the coverage and close shave is any better. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I noticed the head is lighter, probably because you can rinse the head in water; therefore, most parts are plastic. I did not expect the rinse indicator to light up each time I use it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The closeness setting has three modes. My previous model had 9. It did not matter; I use the closes setting all the time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The head has more coverage; however, I think the multi opening is too complex (holds and line opening to cut closer). I find that parts of my chin/throat area has a few strands that are difficult to cut. I tried different angles and push even harder to the face and it does not work well. I had to use the trimmer to trim down the few. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was tempted to return it since it has a 60 days money back. My old one is \\&quot;DEAD\\&quot; does not charge nor does it work with outlet (7 yrs). So I decided to push forward with this model. Maybe this one will last me just as long as the previous model. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tom (NYC)</li>
            <li> I Purchased this product for my husband for christmas, he never used an electric shaver before, he was always a razor man. My husband has very sensitive skin, but the SmartTouchXL has 3 shaving selections which included sensitive skin. I wasn&#x27;t sure if this shaver was going to work as well as a razor, but it was great, it worked better then any razor could have, he absolutely loves it. His face is smooth and it cuts down his shaving time. Once the SmartTouch is charged it stays charged for a long time, it even tells you how much time you have left before you have to charge it again.  This was a positive investment and a perfect present.</li>
            <li> I believe this to be the best Norelco shaver you have producted so far.  I would recommend it to all men.  I am 64 and purchase a new norelco about every four years.</li>
            <li> I had the \\&quot;James Bond\\&quot; Spectra razor for years, when it broke I purchased the 9190. Transition has been seamless. It cuts the neck hairs better and is also easy to clean. All the rest of the features are the same.</li>
            <li> The fact that you can hold this under tap water to clean it is alone a great feature. But there is so much more, including the way it shaves your face without pulling on your beard even if it is long (most times for me). It also has a nice battery indicator screen and notifies you when you need to clean the thing. The battery lasts forever, seriously it is sometimes hard to believe how long it lasts.. buy this shaver, it is awesome.</li>
            <li> I received the razor after christmas. I had been using the Braun for the past 4 years. After many Foil replacements, I decided to go back to the Norelco as the Braun was not giving me a close enough shave. The Norelco advises using it for 3 weeks so your beard and skin get accustomed to it. I already like it as this is my second week of usage. I get a closer shave than my older Norelco. The improved shaving heads seem to give a closer shave. I don&#x27;t have as much five o&#x27;clock shadow as I use to and I don&#x27;t have that heavy of a beard. The skin sensitivity control is a plus although I have it set to \\&quot;normal\\&quot;. My son-in-law bought one and his is set to the \\&quot;sensitive setting.\\&quot; He is not experiencing any irritation. They have inproved on the pivioting heads and I think this has a lot to do with the improved shave and comfort. The razor LED tells you when to clean the heads. I clean it after every shave. This is simple as all you do is rinse it under hot water, shake off the excess water and set it back into the \\&quot;charger holder.\\&quot; With the Braun, you have to purchase the cleaning fluid cartridges, an extra expense. The razor is extremely quiet compared to the Braun. Shaving at 5AM now doesn&#x27;t disturb my sleeping wife. This razor works for me.</li>
            <li> I bought the Philips Norelco 9190XL Smart TouchXL Shaver on April 30, 2007,had my doubt&#x27;s about all the reviews i was reading about this shaver, but i have to say they are true,i&#x27;ve been using a blade for the last 20 years and never knew it could be this good,after i charged this shaver i thought there was something wrong with it because i couldn&#x27;t hear it running, the battery is great, haven&#x27;t had to charge it but once so far and i use it every day for about three weeks now. If you&#x27;re thinking about it think no more buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I was seduced by the new features offered by this shaver thinking it was worth it but found out after one week using it that it is not.  &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using philips-Norelco electric shavers for the past 10 years, every couple of years I change for an updated new model, so I&#x27;m not new to these shavers. &lt;br /&gt;This time I went for the new top of the line and I&#x27;m dissapointed: my old 8000 series was smoother, with the 9190 I get a sligly faster shave (but not closer) but irritates my skin (thanks to the three ring shaving heads, faster shave but uncortable one). LCD is terrible (contrary to old model) can&#x27;t see info unless I turn on the razon. Pros: Motor is quieter, design is pretty, better handling, but thats is the least important stuff, I&#x27;m getting hurt with this shaver!.  &lt;br /&gt;I am thinking of either returning it or replacing heads with the 8 series model (too bad after spending $200!) or keep suffering a couple of weeks more to see if my face gets used to the new blades (cause sometimes you really need to as manual indicates).  &lt;br /&gt;So my advice: not worth the upgrade from a recent model and not well suited for sensitive skins (although always better than manual razors).</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve owned Norelco shavers in the past, I am very pleased with the smooth, fast, quiet shave given by the 9190XL. With the three settings for sensitivity, I was able to adjust the heads to achieve a shave as close as a blade with absolutely no irritation.  Cleanup is fast and easy by simply flushing the shaver under hot water.  I&#x27;ve used the shaver everyday for the past 3 weeks and haven&#x27;t had the need to recharge it.  I bought the shaver during the Father&#x27;s Day sale and saved a lot of money.  This shaver is the best shaver I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Used for a month - tried different settings - caused bizzare combination of ingrown hairs &amp; stubble.  You can rinse under water but it clogged a lot &amp; very hard to keep clean, shaving head has small parts like a puzzle to put back together.  I&#x27;ve used remmington &amp; panasonic electric shavers for over 30 years.  They all did a better job than this one.</li>
            <li> Used consistently for the recommended 3 weeks. This model is marginally better than the earlier 955RX. It is slower to use than a standard blade razor with wet gel, provides nowhere near as close a shave, caused irritation and development of ingrowing hairs on the neck of this Caucasian user.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for more than 10 years. This shaver has out preformed all others.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric razor I have ever used bar none. Clean close shave with no irritation. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I think electric shavers are a very personal thing:  My father loves his Philips / Norelco shavers, unfortunately they never did much for me.  And this one is no different.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;First, the product has been improved by making all three heads flex, which can give a smoother shave.   Unfortunately this also means that you don&#x27;t get a particularly close shave either!  Second, the three shaving heads still can&#x27;t get into those &#x27;hard to reach areas&#x27;, a problem I&#x27;ve always had when using this brand.  Third, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s designed for people who have whiskers &#x60;off the face&#x27; (like on the neck) as the shaver always seem to pull these out, rather than shave them!   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the end the difference is this: if you have a tough beard, particularly with little &#x27;hard to reach areas&#x27; then don&#x27;t go for this brand - I&#x27;d say go for a Braun!  On the other hand, if you have a light beard then this would be a great shaver; it&#x27;s certainly easy to clean (just rinse under water after each shave) and very light weight.  &lt;br /&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I really like this razor.  This razor avoids a lot of the useless options and has many useful ones (like the lcd display with battery life - which is very nice if you travel often like I do).  It shaves well and comes with a hard travel protective case (good for travel as well).  If you can find it at a great price, buy it.</li>
            <li> This is the best investment that I&#x27;ve made in a long time.  It is still working and well today nine years later.  Thanks to Amazon I was able to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Great Razor and saves time compared to using a conventional razor and shaving cream. Worth the price, and not having to worry about buying new packs of blades every month.</li>
            <li> This is my second Norelco shaver in about 10 years.  This is THE closest shave that I&#x27;ve had in as many years.  All of the features of this razor make it #1 in my book. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Forget the others, this one is the best.</li>
            <li> The razor is very little different from my 8894xl.  It takes me four minutes to shave.  This is the same as with my 8894xl.   I don&#x27;t like &lt;br /&gt;having to clean it as often as is recommended.  All in all, it isn&#x27;t &lt;br /&gt;worth the difference!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this razor.  It is great for people that has sensitive skin.  It tells you how much time you have left, and even has a little clock on it.</li>
            <li> I picked up the 9190xl a little over a month ago, so I feel I can make a reasonable review of it now. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I bought the razor after running out of Mach 3 razor heads - I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend $3 on a stupid piece of plastic/metal that I would throw away every week.  That said, I did get a very good shave with the Mach 3, so I was looking for something similar in an electric razor.  I had an old Norelco rotary razor quite awhile ago, however I had only spent maybe $60 on the thing and it never worked well.  I hated it and eventually got rid of it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The 9190xl is substantially better, needless to say.  In comparison to a Mach 3, which I would shave with and against the grain with, the 9190xl is very close, but not quite there in terms of closeness.  That&#x27;s not to say it&#x27;s bad in any way - in fact, along my chin, it is actually better. So, although it may not be quite as close, you would really have to rub your face all day long to notice a difference, and even then it is hardly anything.  If you&#x27;re not satisfied with this shave, coming from a blade, you may have more pressing issues to address. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Besides giving an excellent shave, there are other major advantages.  True to their word, each shave takes approximately 3 minutes once you get used to it.  The shaver has a nice, substantial feel to it - very solid.  The means of cleaning it - running it through water - is ingenious, if not exceedingly simple.  Why you would want to deal with a bulky stand and cleaning solution, when you could run it through water (nearly free!!) for 20 seconds is beyond me.  The travel case that it comes with - reasonably nice nylon that is stiffened on one side, works well; fit is very tight and it seems to offer ample protection to the head of the razor (coupled with the not-really-all-that-bad plastic cover).  The LCD screen is easy (for me) to read, and a very nice feature. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now on to the things I would say are not 100%... &lt;br /&gt;Shavetime is not really 90 minutes.  Mine charges to 85 minutes, but the last time I ran it down, it went from 11 minutes to...0 minutes.  It didn&#x27;t die, but I thought that was odd (and I recharged it anyway).  Because I did recharge it after that day&#x27;s use, I&#x27;m not sure if this issue was with the capacity of the battery, or the calibration of the meter.  The charging stand is so-so:  it works well enough, but it&#x27;s clear that it is nothing more than cheap injection molded plastic, with a cheap quartz clock to match.  Not that I really expected anything more, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s deserving of any praise that Norelco gives it.  The SmartTouch pivoting system has a gauge on the LCD screen to indicate the relative stiffness of the head.  This gauge is not very useful.  Often it will be overly sensitive, and a small bump will move it from one extreme to the other, despite that the dial itself may be on the entirely other extreme, i.e. the LCD gauge might indicate as far on the \\&quot;N\\&quot; side as possible, when in fact the dial is about as far to the \\&quot;S\\&quot; side as can be.  Not a debilitating issue, I notice it every once in awhile and it&#x27;s easy to play around with it for a second until it rights itself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the SmartTouchXL system as a whole:  I suspect it&#x27;s a bit of a gimmick.  The head does indeed pivot, but not to a great extent and not without undue pressure.  The amount of give in the individual rotary heads themselves would seem to supercede anything offered through the pivoting head.  I have mine on the medium level, I cannot really tell a difference between this and sensitive, and I have yet to notice the head really moving much when shaving.  If your trying to grind your face off with the 9190xl, and applying an accordingly high degree of pressure, then maybe the SmartTouchXL will make it slightly more comfortable.  But if your pushing a regular amount while shaving, I don&#x27;t think it will make much of a difference. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The biggest improvement I can see is in the head design - the SpeedXL heads are very good at what they do.  My understanding is that the small holes shave stubble better than do the slots; with the SpeedXL heads, the outer ring is primarily slots with three small patches of holes each, the middle ring has a higher percentage of holes, and the inner ring is all holes.  This seems to be a very good design and probably contributes most to the quality of shave offered by the 9190xl.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All of this considered, I am very pleased with the 9190xl.  It was expensive, but I feel no regret buying it.  It&#x27;s not perfect, but I do think it&#x27;s the best on the market right now (my opinion there, of course, is pretty much completely unfounded but...oh well).  I do think you could receive as good of a shave without the pivoting SmartTouchXL head setup, and I would not worry about buying a cheaper Norelco with just the SpeedXL shaver heads.  But I&#x27;m not particularly inclined to do so, and I&#x27;m satisfied as it is and would have no qualms buying another Norelco down the road (assuming it&#x27;s not for another 5 years). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor for my husband and he loves it. Gives a very close shave for smooth skin, lasts forever and has a big display.</li>
            <li> Prior to purchasing the 9190 I had been using the 6843 for 2+ years I immediately noticed a much closer and easier shave with the 1990. &lt;br /&gt;However, it had a little \\&quot;bite\\&quot; to it in that I felt a irritation for a couple days [maybe 3] before my skin adjusted to it. &lt;br /&gt;Prior to the 6843 I had used a Gold colored Norelco with an LCD shaves remaining window. It was superior to the low end 6843. But like all the rest, It had NiCad&#x27;s and went useless even with cord in after 3 years. &lt;br /&gt;I will experiment with de-soldering the NiCads out of the 6843 and replacing with HiMh. &lt;br /&gt;I sick of throwing away big bucks for Phillips every 2-3 years. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The 9190XL does great at longer hairs. I absolutely love it though. My wife on the other hand thinks I need to be placed in a straight jacket for shelling out $ 275.00 for an electric razor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;KenS</li>
            <li> First off I have to say I have very sensative skin around my neck and throat area. I have tried several diff. Nolreco models as well as convential razors and have always had terrible razor burn. I bought this model, it is expensive but I figured I would give it a shot. I can honestly say the first time I used I had very little razor burn. I am on my 2nd month of using and have all but eliminated the burn on my neck and throat. If you have sensative skin and are willing to pay $200 I strongly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> I HAD BEEN USING AN OLD THREE BLADE MACH 3 RAZOR FOR YEARS. IT HAS BEEN HARDER AND HARDER TO GET BLADES. SO THE CHOICE CAME DOWN TO BUYING ANOTHER MANUAL, WITH BLADES COSTING THREE DOLLARS+ OR MOVING ON TO AN ELECTRIC. AFTER READING A NUMBER OF REVIEWS I PURCHASES THE 9190XL. I WAS PLEASENTLY SURPRISED AT HOW QUIET, COMFORTABLE AND CLOSE THE SHAVE WAS FROM THE FIRST TIME I USED IT. THE BATTERY LIFE IS GREAT, AND IT HAS ALL THE FEATURES YOU COULD WANT. WELL WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li> After using Norelco shavers for over 40 years I am disappointed with this purchase.I don&#x27;t get a full charge and the time indicator may indicate anywhere from 33 to 73 minutes.It takes me longer to shave than with my previous shaver and I do not have a heavy beard.All this for $200.</li>
            <li> Have been using this expensive model for about 2 weeks. I really have not been able to determine how good a shave it gives. But for sure the trimmer is for the birds, it does not cut anything. In fact I called Norelco and they are sending me another razor to try. After I use this new one I&#x27;ll give a more qualified review.</li>
            <li> Outstanding razor. Close, comfortable and quick. Well worth the cash!</li>
            <li> I replaced my Norelco Spectra with this Smart-Touch 9190 XL and it works as advertised. I liked the Spectra, but compared to it the XL simply outclasses the old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The XL takes less time, shaves closer and is quieter. It also has a much bigger chamber to hold the cut hair. And the trimmer works well. According to the manual, it takes up to 3 weeks to conform to your skin and you may get some irritation until it gets broken in. I set it to sensitive and have had very little skin irritation from day one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has some nice features including a screen that tells you how many minutes you have used and how many you have left. Or, you can change the display to a battery indicator. It also tells you when to rinse, charge the razor and change the blades. Another nice feature is the travel lock. You hold the power button for 3 seconds and it locks which prevents it from accidentally turning on. The charging base has a little clock, but I do not see the point in that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old razor had the digital information screen so that is what I wanted in a new razor. However, if you do not need or want that feature then I would suggest getting the cheaper model. I think all the other features are the same on both, plus you would save a lot of money. Personally, I like the 9190XL but the choice is up to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Faster shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Information screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easily rinses clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holds charge for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quiet operation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pricey.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco razers for over 15 years, my last one, a Spectra, was the worst of the lot. It is slow, ocassionally cuts me and never really gives a close shave... I sadly put up with this for over a year because ocassionally it seemed to work.  This new model shows the Spectra was a lemon model and that the rotary technology can improve and deliver a close, fast and painless shave.  It redeems my faith in Norelco.  This one is a winner!</li>
            <li> the shaver is good. But I give AMAZON,COM outstanding for service and follow up . You have great people,thank you.</li>
            <li> This razor provides a good shave and remains sufficiently charged for nearly a month of my shaves. It is a good razor.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco cordless electric shavers for about 20 years now. Fortunately, years ago it did not take long for my face to adjust. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Recently had to replace a 7 year old Norelco shaver when the internal battery charging circuitry fizzled. Because I frequently shave far away from an a/c outlet, I needed the timer display to tell me to get ready for a charge. This feature is a must and helped make my decision easy, on which new model to buy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Only way to get my feature was to go for the top-of-the-line 9190 XL Norelco model and make the 200 smacker investment. Thus far it has lived up to my expectations. Shaves about 40 percent quicker than the older versions and is extremely quiet !  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the dark side, I have also found a couple of minor shortcomings: First, the travel-carrying case is difficult to unlatch. The only time it opened easily is when it fell on the floor ! This unit should not have popped open at all. Second, although the timer display is large, certain numbers are not so easy to read. A number 8 looks a lot like a 3. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All things considered, it has been a worthwhile purchase for me and should provide years of reliable service. This one you will enjoy !</li>
            <li> When I lost my corded Philips Quadra Action I was heartbroken, b/c I don&#x27;t like rechargeable razors and Philips Norelco doesn&#x27;t seem to make corded high end machines anymore. But I was quickly moved over by this 9190XL shaver. It looks good. It feels good (in your hand and on your skin) and I hope the batteries work out. So far the battery power is the only minus here. I like long shaves (6 minutes) and the batteries last only a month if you shave 3 minutes. Also, when it neared the end before recharging and I had 14 minutes shaving time left, it suddenly jumped to 2 minutes - no reason given. But it was the first charge cycle and I hope this kink will work itself out. Also it is supposed to give 90 minutes of shaving time - the display never showed more than 85 minutes.  &lt;br /&gt;Other than that - an excellent machine. I have sensitive skin and the shave burned me slightly the first few times. Now, after 10 days, almost nothing. Shaving with this almost becomes a meditation for me in the morning. The low, almost inaudible hum, the feel of the new heads that use their entire flat surface for cutting. &lt;br /&gt;I am looking forward to my shave every morning!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Reminton Microscreen for the last 10 years and have been happy with it but I decided to give the Norelco a second try.  &lt;br /&gt;-I find that the Norelco is supperior at trimming the swirl pattern under my chin.   &lt;br /&gt;-I find that the time it takes to shave my face is much less with the Norelco. (2 to 3 minutes) &lt;br /&gt;-The Mustache/beard trimmer built into the Norelco is worthless. I found that I needed to keep my Remington Beard and mustache trimmer to keep up my sideburns. &lt;br /&gt;-the Norelco tends to pull hairs if you let the beard grow over a long weekend. &lt;br /&gt;-In the last 75 days I&#x27;ve only had to charge it twice. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall it was expensive and the trimmer is worthless but I would recomend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Problems with owning a Philips shaver: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1.  Flimsy plastic head protector.  If protecting the heads is so important, why didn&#x27;t they make the head protector piece a little more rugged?  Also, it is next to impossible to get a replacement for one.  When I called customer support for the location of a store that carried this (or website) I was told that there were no stores that could order this for me and that it wasn&#x27;t available via the company website. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2.  Dropping shavings when shaving.  The older models (pre 8000) didn&#x27;t drop large, very noticeable amounts of shavings when they were used.  If you shaved with a longer beard, you would have had some problems with dropped shavings but nothing like with the 8000 series and newer, high-end models. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;3.  No support for older models from the company website.  If you are traveling with your shaver and you wanted to check something in the manual, the previous models are not listed on the website.  For example, voltages or time required for charging are unavailable.  When I asked Philips customer support from the Philips website, I was told that since the model had been discontinued, the information was no longer available on the website. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Since my husband has got the Norelco Shaver he shaves every morning - which is unusual for me!!!:)</li>
            <li> I have had many electric shavers including previous Norelco models. This is the best electric shaver I have had. Long battery life between charges.  A very close shave. Nice bright display showing charge minutes remaining.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of rotary systems for some time.  They are reliable and don&#x27;t heat up that much.  This newest iteration is better than before.  It shaves as close, quicker, with no heating of the blades, and doesn&#x27;t nick the skin when you are shaving in more sensitive areas than your face.  It&#x27;s easy to clean and the battery lasts a long time.  My only complaints are that the carrying case only fits the shaver and not the charger and it is not always easy to guide the shaver onto its base properly.  It was fairly expensive for a shaver, but if it is anything like my previous Norelco shavers, it will last at least 3 years.</li>
            <li> The shaver does a good job of giving a smooth shave, but it is loaded with extras that sound good and don&#x27;t mean much and with one that I really don&#x27;t understand at all. &lt;br /&gt;The cleaning reminder is meaningless because it shows after each shave. I guess the warning beep might be good, but I&#x27;m not lazy enough to not clean it after each shave, so I&#x27;ll never hear it. &lt;br /&gt;The power button is in an inconvenient location, which makes it easy to turn the power off while attempting to shave. &lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t understand why a clock was built into the base. If you want a clock where you shave, you probably already have one. If you don&#x27;t, this clock may be ok. If you want a clock to tell actual time, this is not the one. It has one little mark at the top where the twelve would be and nothing else. Norelco should have forgotten the clock and trimmed the price. &lt;br /&gt;The recharge notification is a good feature. According to the manual the minutes-used feature needs to adjust to your shaving pattern, so I&#x27;ve only had the opportunity to hear it one time. It did go from five minutes left to zero without any additional shaving time being used to warn me that it was time to recharge it. I suppose it was adjusting to my pattern because the minutes available after that charge were less than after the initial charge. &lt;br /&gt;The trimmer works well on sideburns, ears and nose. &lt;br /&gt;I decided to go with the more expensive model because I wanted the flexible heads that would adjust to the contours of my face and did not want a rubber exterior. I think it does that. &lt;br /&gt;I would like to see a shaver that does not have as many needless features, but has all of the good features of this model at a lower price. &lt;br /&gt;I would have rated it four stars if the price had been lower or if all of the features had a good purpose. I would have rated it five stars if all of the features had a good purpose and the price had been lower. The price here is as low as I could find it, so the price is a result of Norelco&#x27;s pricing.</li>
            <li> This is my first Electric Shaver ever. I don&#x27;t give this 5 stars because everything can always be improved and this item is no different. So Far my experience w/ it is this: it does give a close shave but ONLY IF you take your time w/ it. It takes me 10-15 mins to shave. However chances are you will get a closer &amp; faster shave if a) your skin has adopted to the shaver and b) shave before the hair grows 1/4\\&quot;. Now this is only my experience as of now. My face is still adapting to the irritation and its doing so rather quick so perhaps once it adopts I can get an even faster &amp; closer shave regardless of hair length. The heads do warm up just a bit(I heard not as much like other shavers) but this is no big deal for me because I AM MAN!. The Trimmer i Think is no good so after I shave i use a blade to even out my side burns and shave the  uneveness throughout my face,when needed, which takes me about 15 seconds. The shaver really feels good and sturdy. As far as washing is concerned it is very simple. BUT, you do need to maintain this shaver since it has moving parts therefor you need to follow the manual accordingly for the best shave and again no big deal for me because....I AM MAN! The battery keeps its charge a long time and the LCD is not a problem...it does what it suppose to do w/ minimum effort, some people are just way too picky for their own good but to each their own i say ;). I am happy w/ the shaver. I hope this helps you guys before you make your purchase good luck.... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;jc</li>
            <li> I used to shave with a norelco about 10 year ago.  Then my battery died and I switched to a blade.  I can&#x27;t believe this new shaver!!!  It shaves much closer than a blade...no 5 o&#x27;clock shadow anymore!  I also really like the battery display, how long the battery lasts for, and how quiet the shaver runs.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If I had to choose something to gripe about, it would be that the hairs do not get cut on the first pass sometimes.  You just have to have the patience to look closely in a mirror while you shave in order to make sure you cut every hair.  This happened more in the first month of shaving...I have to say that the longer I&#x27;ve use it (it&#x27;s been about 2 months now), the \\&quot;easier\\&quot; it gets to cut every hair.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very impressed and very happy.  Worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> I was using before Philishave, and was very satisfied with the performance. And after using more than 5 years I replaced it with this beauty 9190XL SmartTouchXL, and indeed it&#x27;s really smart!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got it, I was so happy and it was nicely packed. And when I just griped it I was amazed by its grip! It&#x27;s really beautiful to hold in hand. It comes with charger and it is so fast. It also comes with one small analogue clock! And front there is small display which shows times, how much you used and how much left! It&#x27;s so convenient to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first tried I was so amazed it was very low noise! My previous one was have more noise. And its very smooth and fast too. And plus point is that this machine is washable! It is really very good feature though. The bled are very high quality and very sharp. The battery is good enough it will work for 15 days easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really happy to have it, it is little expensive but you have to pay more if you want more! I got from Amazon at $150.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend everybody who are using Philips Shaver, just go and upgrade your old shaver, and if you are using other than Philips then immediately buy this you won&#x27;t  regret, I am sure.</li>
            <li> My new Philips Norelco Model #9190XL Electric Rechargeable Razor.  I have been using this razor for over two weeks now and I am very pleased with the nice close shave it gives me.  Its also quiet in operation and easey to clean under the faucet.    Ray Doss</li>
            <li> I bought one of the new Norelco 9000 series, (all 9000 series are the same except for jet cleaning/LCD screens), and wasn&#x27;t impressed.  The razor irritated my face on the most sensitive setting. I have been using electric razors since shortly after I first started shaving (I am 24 now) so the \\&quot;adjustment period\\&quot; is not an issue. The shaver also left hairs on my face, which caused me to have to repeatedly shave certain areas (neck/jaw line) repeatedly. I&#x27;m sure this added to the irritation. Eventually I had enough and returned it. I picked up the cheapest, and oldest, Norelco model available. (Norelco 7110X) This razor works way better than the newer one, and costs over $100 less. One positive for the newer one, is that when I finally got all the stray hairs the 9000 series left behind I did notice a closer shave than the 7110X. Although, not by much. That is the reason I gave it two stars instead of just one. My verdict: Save yourself some money and go with an older model. Definitely don&#x27;t buy one with a jet clean option either, as it&#x27;s a total waste of money. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 59 years old and have been using an electric shaver (almost always Norelco) since I started shaving at 13. I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for about a month. I find it gives me a much closer shave than my previous Norelco and is much faster to boot. I seem to average about 4 minutes for a shave. The display indicates 85 minutes of shaving on a full charge. When I got down to 7 minutes the display then rapidly counted down to zero, curious. The charging cord now has a small transformer lump on the outlet side making it bulkier than the cord only arrangement on my old Norelco. While a nice zippered case is provided for the shaver, there is no provision for packing the charger cord. The included stand seems a little flimsy. The manual warns not to keep the shaver plugged into the charger continuously or battery life would be shortened. The manual further warns that the shaver should be charged no longer than 1 hour after the initial 4 hour charge. I don&#x27;t know why there couldn&#x27;t be an electronic circuit to limit the charge without having to worry about causing battery damage. Cleaning the head is a simple matter of rinsing under hot water. I admit that I&#x27;m a hopeless techie and I do enjoy the digital display however if you wanted to save $50 you could get the model without it and still have much of the same functionality.    Bear in mind that satisfaction with a particular shaver is very subjective and variable. I have a moderately coarse beard and no significant ingrown hairs. My ethnicity is east European Ashkenazim. Your experience may vary.</li>
            <li> I purchased it in 2007 and it still works very well.  It was expensive, but was worth.  Now, with seven years in use I have to replace the charge corders since they bacame dry and can break any time.  I mayhave to replace the battery since it does not work nowadays more than 30 minutes.  I really recommend it.  Thanks Philips and Norelco for a great product.  Customer services also works very well.  I hafd a problem with its frame that hold the shaves and they did not hesitate to contact me and send another one to fix it.  It&#x27;s a brand that I really trust. I recommend.</li>
