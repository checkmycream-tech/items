            <li>Great addition to my dental care routine, I&#x27;m using one of the tools to clean around my son&#x27;s gums, he is 4 and brushing alone wasn&#x27;t enough to clean up his teeth, very happy with this dental tools.</li>
            <li>For what it is, its useful and a good price.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt to be able to see what is going on in your mouth.</li>

            <li>Okay truth time...</li>
            <li>:)  </li>

            <li>I ALSO LOVE PERIOGENL</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love having everything in the case.  </li>
            <li>Between cleanings I wanted to do more than just brushing and flossing</li>
            <li>So glad to make this investment.</li>
            <li>but I am glad I ordered another brand</li>
            <li>so I use the scaler the most.</li>
            <li>I love this kit.  </li>
            <li>I love to have the feeling that my teeth a cleaner.</li>
            <li>One of the tools is plastic, for picking out hard-to-reach places safely.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a life saver for cleaning around brackets and cheaper than paying $100 or more every 3 months</li>
            <li>and although I was told that was safe</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so sure</li>
            <li>This is the perfect kit to help you keep your teeth looking pearly white!</li>
            <li>I will recommend to friends and buy more.</li>
            <li>and I love the feeling of cleaner teeth.  </li>
            <li>Glad I bought these... everything that I needed</li>

            <li>Kind of cheap, but functional</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve managed to remove most of the tartar from my teeth</li>
            <li>I love these, instead of toothpicks.</li>
            <li>If you need it mostly for the scaler like me, buy this one instead: http://www.amazon.com/DenTek-Dental-Ultra-Anti-Mirror/dp/B00008BRR6/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1431379153&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;plaque+scraper</li>
            <li>The mirror is the most often used and helps to see which teeth need more brushing.</li>
            <li>Also, the package states that they&#x27;re dishwasher safe (top rack), which should appease anyone&#x27;s obsessive-compulsive tendencies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>This kit is OK for home use.</li>

            <li>, I told her that this kit is available on Amazon, and she said everyone should buy one.</li>
            <li>and you kind of have to maneuver it to really see anything.</li>
            <li>i had hoped it to be more useful.  </li>
            <li>this is a great simple teeth cleaning set.</li>

            <li>I use this product maybe once a month for a quick scrape</li>
            <li>I was worried I would damage my teeth because I had no clue what I was doing but a quick internet search on how to use a dental pick and scaler put my mind at ease before I got the product.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m able to get the tartar out that usually only the dentist is able to get.</li>

            <li>The mirror is handy to see what&#x27;s going on with cheek-side molars and the back side of front teeth.</li>
            <li>I bought this set just for the fun of it and can&#x27;t believe it works.</li>
            <li>The plastic scaler (kinda like a dental pick, but good for scraping, especially along the gum line) is much gentler</li>
            <li>I thought I found a product that could be useful and reused.</li>
            <li>Your dentist may not use rubber coated tools, but they do provide a nice solid grip.  </li>
            <li>I rarely use the dental pick, preferring instead to just use dental floss.</li>
            <li>But for just the scaler, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I was able to get the tea stains and tartar off my teeth with no trouble.</li>
            <li>Brushing and flossing not cutting the mustard?</li>
            <li>Looks great, neat, compact and clean...sturdy metal, not easily bent like others, I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this seems like a good addition to keep your teeth as clean as possible - even between professional cleanings.</li>
            <li>I love it for just basic cleanup when i cannot clean everything with the dental floss.</li>
            <li>Using this kit I was able to find the cavity and clean it out, it&#x27;s been a year and the pain hasn&#x27;t come back.</li>
            <li>Works beautifully for detail and hard to reach spots.</li>
            <li>the handles are strong enough to be precise at all.</li>
            <li>Also, unlighted mirror is of limited value, I find that a Tweezerman 10x Lighted Mirror works much better for inspecting teeth and gums - the spotlight makes a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly, I bled far more with the water irrigator I also bought which arrived a few days</li>
            <li>The tools bend slightly so I can never get a really good scrape on the backside of the teeth .</li>
            <li>Received super fast</li>
            <li>They are safe, keep them clean by spraying rubbing alcohol and let dry overnight before you use them again.  </li>
            <li>Effective way to clear away the yuck between professional teeth cleanings.  </li>
            <li>Just rinse it with warm water and let it air dry.</li>
            <li>Very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Very useful and so far it has gotten the job done!</li>
            <li>Still, DenTek&#x27;s Oral Care Kit does contain a very nice set of implements, which can be quite useful, as long as you exercise proper care.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good little kit.</li>
            <li>When you cut vinyl you have to be able to pull out tiny bits of it that you don&#x27;t want in the finished decal (the dot in the center of an O for example) and a sharp hook is perfect for that.  </li>
            <li>Nonetheless, my first visit scarred me for life: 8 cavities, gingivitis, and wisdom tooth extraction.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s pretty self-explanatory to use the items in here,</li>
            <li>The stainless steel pick is useful.</li>
            <li>She has a tartar build up problem, and this works pretty well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Good oral care kit for those wanting to step up their dental care but not quite enough if you more sever issues.</li>
            <li>so this is the first time using something like this</li>
            <li>The product overall is ok.</li>
            <li>you get exactly what you expect, and the mirror doesn&#x27;t fog up at all</li>
            <li>My daughter has a open bite and she was using a Water Pik , top of the line toothpaste and mouthwash and flossing</li>
            <li>I ordered this and like magic the ladies became quiet</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased this brand.</li>
            <li>Visually, this was the set that was of better quality.</li>
            <li>does exactly as featured in product description.</li>
            <li>No matter how much you brush your teeth!</li>
            <li>Looks exactly as pictured and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>The cleaning tools included in this kit are made of soft, cheap feeling plastic.  </li>
            <li>It is much more obvious than indoor light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*half a year</li>
            <li>Overall, I am satisfied with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as shown.</li>
            <li>The yellow tip perio tool is not included in most care kits.</li>
            <li>and it was still able to remove a lot in just two sessions (they recommend using the metal pick only once</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>The rubber probe made me realize how intense my tooth problem was and helped me make the right decision to extract it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little cheap in it&#x27;s construction and not the most sturdy.</li>
            <li>The metal scaler (which states it is for weekly use) and metal pic are nice - not overly sharp</li>
            <li>I had a plaque build on my front bottom teeth and decided to remove it myself (ok now call me crazy lol).</li>
            <li>It takes a few times of trying to figure out the most comfortable way to use it and do what you want.</li>
            <li>i only really use the scaler to keep on top of tarter/plaque/calculus.</li>
            <li>Great for hard to reach places!</li>
            <li>easy to use, basic set.</li>
            <li>These won&#x27;t stand up to the high heat sterilization, but for home use these seem to be good enough for me and will probably work well enough for you too.</li>
            <li>I had bought this kit mainly because of mirror, but other items are nice to have and they do their job well.</li>
            <li>Actually ran them through dishwasher, and they cam out fine.  </li>
            <li>These little tools come in really handy.</li>
            <li>The mirror is handy for checking little things out inside.</li>
            <li>This little kit is effective.</li>
            <li>This is a nice little set if you want to go a little deeper and do some teeth scraping of your own.</li>
            <li>My parents just didn&#x27;t feel the urgency or really have the funds to take me.</li>
            <li>I brush twice a day with a toothbrush that costs as much as some phones, and floss + rinse every night.</li>
            <li>Should help keep the dentist from griping so much</li>
            <li>she commented I didn&#x27;t have much plaque build up</li>
            <li>I like this kit, I really do.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>There is a plastic pick too, which doesn&#x27;t really seem to be of much use.  </li>
            <li>There is also a mirror which I haven&#x27;t really been using either.  </li>
            <li>All in all, worth the modest price.</li>
            <li>THE TOOL S ARE VERY ERGONOMIC  AND WORK</li>
            <li>I threw away the stuff inside and kept the case to hold my Stainless Steel dental picks.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions very strictly and voila it was removed.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>very careful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Item are really durable, not flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;Great  </li>
            <li>Then I purchased this and cleaned my teeth with a metal scratcher and was amazed how much gunk came off.</li>
            <li>but it is very time consuming though.</li>
            <li>Look for a completely stainless steel set (if any exist anymore).</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really figured out how to use them correctly.  </li>
            <li>&#x3D;) Be careful though</li>
            <li>I recommend another product as the scaler gives too much when applying pressure against the tooth.</li>
            <li>Very valuable kit for those who have teeth issues.</li>
            <li>I really like it and the container it comes in</li>
            <li>I should have bought the real deal metal ones.</li>
            <li>This helps me to keep my teeth a whole lot cleaner.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this kit!</li>
            <li>NOT metal pics; very flimsy PLASTIC pieces.  </li>
            <li>Also, the case is a real pain.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Really, at this price even just the thin wire pick is so good for a jerky eater, that it&#x27;s worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>not quite sure what to do with the other tool.</li>
            <li>I have to clean between the teeth because she has such a smelly breath.</li>
            <li>Its easy to use, comfortable grip, and takes up hardly any space in a drawer.</li>
            <li>I only go for special treatment is needed, this tool work wonders for the day to day cleaning.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the teeth will look smaller due to the 6inch distance to fit both your hands , but I found it to be easy linking up the images through 2 mirrors ...</li>
            <li>My first trip to the dentist ever in my life was when I was 19 years old -- I had NEVER been before.</li>
            <li>The plastic tool does nothing for me and the mirror is too small for someone attempting their own cleaning.</li>
            <li>Yes, the mirror is tiny, but that is true of all the sets I have tried.</li>
            <li>The box is hard to open every time, but they work great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try to use the other pieces included to keep my teeth clean though, promise!</li>
            <li>My previous Dentek kit was much better.</li>
            <li>so they are easy to use for an inexperienced person.</li>
            <li>which is the main issue with using a mouth mirror.  </li>
            <li>I haad the older verison and just upgraded to this one, looks nicer.</li>
            <li>I bought it mainly</li>
            <li>(the mirror is the main reason I got the kit, I am always trying to look at something in my mouth for some reason).</li>
            <li>Overall decent product for the price, the hand mirror does seems a bit flimsy in terms of the plastic support for the mirrored surface, but then again I am not paying for a dentist grade hand mirror with actual glass. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>BUT STILL, despite my best oral hygiene practices, tartar still finds a way to nest itself right at the base of my front lower teeth at the gum line</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this kit.</li>
            <li>High quality tools</li>
            <li>and these are definitely more professional by the angles and the sharp points.</li>
            <li>The three tools come in a nice hard shell</li>
            <li>So much better than wood toothpicks that fall apart in a few seconds.</li>
            <li>True these are not the same professional tools that your dentist uses but</li>
            <li>The explorer can get into many places, but also has the potential to do a lot of damage if used improperly, so again, you really need to be careful.  </li>
            <li>Only one side of one tool is worth anything.</li>
            <li>When I first saw this arrive, the first thing I noticed was that something strange was on the mirror.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So pick one up, however many tools you&#x27;ll use, because for cleaning, scraping or just plain picking....</li>
            <li>One tool has a stainless steel pick (explorer) on one end, and a stainless steel scaler (scraper) on the opposite end.  </li>
            <li>Love the little plastic case!</li>
            <li>I kinda had to order a second kit for my mouth after discovering that ;-)</li>
            <li>While they do have a design similar to real dental implements, since they can&#x27;t withstand being sterilized by high temperatures, characterizing these dental tools as \\&quot;professional\\&quot; is inappropriate.  </li>
            <li>The mirror is also extremely useful because it allows you to see tartar in places you may not normally check.</li>
            <li>The metal is kind of weak.  </li>
            <li>They work well, and I am extremely less worried about doing damage to my teeth/gums with these as they flex more and are obviously softer.</li>
            <li>kit feels very much like the tools that are used on me at the dentist (except for the cheaper plastic handles) and work well at removing anything between the teeth to the gumline as long as you can reach in there.  </li>
            <li>Actually, it is doubtful your dentist would advise you to buy this kit, it is very good quality, works as advertized, and is reasonably price...</li>
            <li>Also they are pretty weak and they bend easily.</li>
            <li>Great product though the third piece that is there to stimulate gum is rather useless to me.</li>
            <li>I only really use the thicker edged instrument to remove plaque...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll leave that to a professional.</li>
            <li>- Includes Tarter Scraper/Scaling Instrument, Dental Toothpick, Mouth Mirror - Professional Surgical Grade Dentist Approved Tools]]</li>
            <li>I used to only have a metal dental pick, but this whole set has made my teeth cleaner.</li>
            <li>Low price and fast delivery - AWSOME</li>
            <li>The only tool I really use is the dental pick</li>
            <li>I had a professional dental cleaning 1-2 months ago.</li>
            <li>The design of the metal scaler allows it to be much sturdier, and I feel that the pick would have benefited from a similar design.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect them to be anywhere near the quality or sharpness of tools you&#x27;d find at a dentist.</li>
            <li>&gt; The few extra minutes you spend to do the work using these tools as well as brushing your teeth and rinsing with mouthwash, will make quite a difference in maintaining the care needed to keep your gums and teeth healthy.</li>
            <li>The other tools seem to be of pretty decent quality too.</li>
            <li>Wish one of the metal picks was a little better than a wire, doesn&#x27;t bode well for long term reliability.</li>
            <li>it is useful as a tool for other things around the home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The other is stainless steel and as long as you are careful, will also provide opportunity to get food particles you may not be able to reach otherwise.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sharper end have some give to it, but I understand it is to stop the user from using excessive force which is more likely to lose control and</li>
            <li>A simple easy way to help keep your teeth clean and help to prevent unnecessary extra  build up of plaque on your teeth.</li>
            <li>Harder to use than I thought, but exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>The set isn&#x27;t very expensive, and quality appears to be pretty good, so these tools should last for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nothing more nothing less  they are plastic with metal head on the one the other is plastic</li>
            <li>Especially there is so much gunk at the back of your teeth!</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, these tools (in combination with my tongue cleaner) do an adequate job at supplementing the everyday toothbrush.</li>
            <li>There are no sharp edges anywhere.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t scrape off tartar well enough to avoid frequent trips to the dental hygienist.  </li>
            <li>Will be ordering a second set soon for my dogs as the old pet ones need replacing.</li>
            <li>For me, the mirror showed me that I had some tartar buildup behind my front top teeth.</li>
            <li>This is a nice set for the price but the plastic/rubber pick is all but useless.</li>
            <li>When it came out it was very hard and sharp, very interesting.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I  lost my old set in a move and bought this one thinking there wouldn&#x27;t be much difference between the previous set I had.</li>
            <li>The few parts that are made of metal aren&#x27;t hard/strong enough to actually help clean any plaque off or between teeth.</li>
            <li>The little orange rubber piece is useless but the others are great</li>
            <li>Bought this to help remove some plaque where it&#x27;s hard to clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to get between my teeth to clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently become obsessed with cleaning my teeth better and this little kit is great for getting in tough problem areas that I have in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Make sure that you&#x27;re careful with the metal tools, I once sliced my cheek with a clumsy move.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find brief instructional information regarding the use of each tool on the back of the case.</li>
            <li>I wish the pick was a little bit more stiff</li>
            <li>high quality and works as expected.</li>
            <li>(yes, it will actually remove tartar) in hard to clean areas.</li>
            <li>sometimes you get a little food stuck in a deep groove or a popcorn kernel behind you back molar, and I always wish I had something like this on hand when that happens, so this will hopefully be a good purchase over time.</li>
            <li>After my wife threw out a previous set like this I had for some time I was desperately looking for a replacement, and glad I found these, much better quality than the other ones.</li>
            <li>This is no replacement for a dentist, obviously, but it certainly helps to keep tartar build up down before a dentist visit.</li>
            <li>Every other year or so, I buy a new set of these.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Dental hygiene, and trying to minimize the growth of plaque, is a very tough task, and these tools can be quite useful for certain tasks.  </li>

            <li> you want a good scaler, you are better off with Hu Freidy (sp?).  </li>
            <li> It does the job, but i would have liked the picks to be sharper.</li>

            <li> Nice price too.</li>
            <li> both of us liked it.</li>
            <li> I think everyone needs to own these for every member of there household.</li>
            <li> but nevertheless it did do its job and was effective.</li>
            <li> But it does come in handy at times, like when you get a piece of pop-corn shell stuck between you teeth and gum.</li>

            <li> Nice kit</li>
            <li> Great to help keep the teeth clean</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the pick with great success.  </li>
            <li> Scraped all the plaque right off, and my teeth are looking great.</li>

            <li> Very handy and just the right size for home or travel.</li>
            <li> Love being able to clean my own teeth!</li>
            <li> The metal picks are great but the one with the rubber tip just melted away when I used hot water to sterilize it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and like the handy case.</li>
            <li> Great addition to my dental care routine, I&#x27;m using one of the tools to clean around my son&#x27;s gums, he is 4 and brushing alone wasn&#x27;t enough to clean up his teeth, very happy with this dental tools.</li>
            <li> For what it is, its useful and a good price.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt to be able to see what is going on in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Oh yes, these are lovely.</li>
            <li> Okay truth time...</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> My teeth just look better since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LOVE</li>
            <li> I ALSO LOVE PERIOGENL</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love having everything in the case.  </li>
            <li> Between cleanings I wanted to do more than just brushing and flossing</li>
            <li> So glad to make this investment.</li>
            <li> but I am glad I ordered another brand</li>
            <li> so I use the scaler the most.</li>
            <li> I love this kit.  </li>
            <li> I love to have the feeling that my teeth a cleaner.</li>
            <li> One of the tools is plastic, for picking out hard-to-reach places safely.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a life saver for cleaning around brackets and cheaper than paying $100 or more every 3 months</li>
            <li> and although I was told that was safe</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure</li>
            <li> This is the perfect kit to help you keep your teeth looking pearly white!</li>
            <li> I will recommend to friends and buy more.</li>
            <li> and I love the feeling of cleaner teeth.  </li>
            <li> Glad I bought these... everything that I needed</li>
            <li> The plastic items are fantastic!</li>
            <li> Kind of cheap, but functional</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve managed to remove most of the tartar from my teeth</li>
            <li> I love these, instead of toothpicks.</li>
            <li> If you need it mostly for the scaler like me, buy this one instead: http://www.amazon.com/DenTek-Dental-Ultra-Anti-Mirror/dp/B00008BRR6/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1431379153&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;plaque+scraper</li>
            <li> The mirror is the most often used and helps to see which teeth need more brushing.</li>
            <li> Also, the package states that they&#x27;re dishwasher safe (top rack), which should appease anyone&#x27;s obsessive-compulsive tendencies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This kit is OK for home use.</li>
            <li> The mirror is ok, however im</li>
            <li> Great high quality product.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good item.  </li>
            <li> Bottom line is dont look for other sets that cost more, this one does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li> Feels great to be able to clean near my gum line with this love it</li>
            <li> Great for in-between professional cleanings.</li>
            <li> Works really well and feels,like it&#x27;s good quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a place you could easily see, and this toolkit helped me see and remove it.</li>
            <li> it does what you buy it for, to clean your teeth : )</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and sturdy.</li>
            <li> They have rubber handles and are easy to hold and control.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> The dental hygienist makes it look so easy.</li>
            <li> it by the window during daytime to easily see the contrast between the dirt and your teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it&#x27;s a good toy set for grown kids in jr high school.</li>
            <li> Fine, it bents a bit when I press it, but works a bit.</li>
            <li> If I had wanted super sturdy, I would have paid more.  </li>
            <li> These are more than adequate for home use.</li>
            <li> n&#x27; so clean clean!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a huge oral hygiene nerd.</li>
            <li> , I told her that this kit is available on Amazon, and she said everyone should buy one.</li>
            <li> and you kind of have to maneuver it to really see anything.</li>
            <li> i had hoped it to be more useful.  </li>
            <li> this is a great simple teeth cleaning set.</li>
            <li> because at the store I  was at, I had a choice between the DenTek brand and some cheap no-name one.</li>
            <li> I only use the teeth scaler and mirror to get the plaque out of my teeth and it works great...</li>
            <li> I think it&#x60;s great to use it on a regular basis to minimize cavity.</li>
            <li> Easier to grip than I had hoped; easy clean.</li>
            <li> available in wallmart</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> Nice kit; really like that this comes in a plastic travel case.  </li>
            <li> but the mirror is great cool to see the back side of your teeth</li>
            <li> very nice when used with tooth filler and a daily clean</li>
            <li> Very useful to keep teeth clean in between dentist visits.</li>
            <li> Wonderful small dental kit.</li>
            <li> So for the rest of you reading this, be sure to clean these first before use.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;you can never keep their teeth too clean..</li>
            <li> This kit does the job, and helps me keep my teeth clean in between cleanings at my dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to clean my dogs teeth.</li>
            <li> Do no think of it a chore that has to be done, but think of it as help in keeping your teeth clean.</li>
            <li> My husband always went and got his teeth clean</li>
            <li> Quite convenient to carry around and keep the teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to take care of those nagging areas I can&#x27;t seem to keep clean.  </li>
            <li> and I use these to clean her teeth every once in awhile.</li>
            <li> The set makes it easier for me to keep my teeth clean with braces.</li>
            <li> And bought this set to help clean and examine my teeth.</li>
            <li> This oral care kit comes in handy especially when it comes to maintaining your teeth and keeping your gums in tip top shape.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my dog to clean her teeth.</li>
            <li> Clean your mouth the right way!</li>
            <li> It gets them right out!</li>
            <li> just shone a bright LED flashlight in my mouth and found tartar hiding at my upper front tooth</li>
            <li> Good quality, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who wants to take better care of their teeth.</li>
            <li> Good if I just purchase the solid steel version.</li>
            <li> Super  inexpensive way to keep your teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Nice and complete package</li>
            <li> only good for removing food from between your teeth, but you can do that with a tooth</li>
            <li> they are a bit flimsy, but not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Useful for scraping off plaque, don&#x27;t find the mirror very useful.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for those who wants to keep there teeth clean as possible without having to go to the dentist....</li>
            <li> Other than that, the items are great.</li>
            <li> handy little kit for keeping your teeth tidy between dental visits.</li>
            <li> At this price of roughly $6, I didnt hesitate to buy.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with it so far, it looks sturdy.</li>
            <li> I use this product maybe once a month for a quick scrape</li>
            <li> I was worried I would damage my teeth because I had no clue what I was doing but a quick internet search on how to use a dental pick and scaler put my mind at ease before I got the product.</li>
            <li> good news is the soft metal descaler and pick really get the job done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to get the tartar out that usually only the dentist is able to get.</li>
            <li> so I use the scrapping tools to remove it quickly &amp; efficiently.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Super high quality, very useable, and has really helped me keep things clean and in good shape.</li>
            <li> Awesome for those long times away from the dentist for daily upkeep.</li>
            <li> The mirror is rarely helpful, and I&#x27;m pretty sure the plastic descaler just does absolutely</li>
            <li> and this is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Now I can make my teeth pretty much as clean as the dentist.</li>
            <li> Great little kit.</li>
            <li> Great little kit.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s a nice set of instructions on the back of the box.</li>
            <li> My mouth comes out so fresh</li>
            <li> The tools in here are really useful for scraping off tartar that brushing and flossing doesn&#x27;t remove.</li>
            <li> The mirror is handy to see what&#x27;s going on with cheek-side molars and the back side of front teeth.</li>
            <li> I bought this set just for the fun of it and can&#x27;t believe it works.</li>
            <li> The plastic scaler (kinda like a dental pick, but good for scraping, especially along the gum line) is much gentler</li>
            <li> I thought I found a product that could be useful and reused.</li>
            <li> Your dentist may not use rubber coated tools, but they do provide a nice solid grip.  </li>
            <li> I rarely use the dental pick, preferring instead to just use dental floss.</li>
            <li> But for just the scaler, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I was able to get the tea stains and tartar off my teeth with no trouble.</li>
            <li> Brushing and flossing not cutting the mustard?</li>
            <li> Looks great, neat, compact and clean...sturdy metal, not easily bent like others, I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this seems like a good addition to keep your teeth as clean as possible - even between professional cleanings.</li>
            <li> I love it for just basic cleanup when i cannot clean everything with the dental floss.</li>
            <li> Using this kit I was able to find the cavity and clean it out, it&#x27;s been a year and the pain hasn&#x27;t come back.</li>
            <li> Works beautifully for detail and hard to reach spots.</li>
            <li> the handles are strong enough to be precise at all.</li>
            <li> Also, unlighted mirror is of limited value, I find that a Tweezerman 10x Lighted Mirror works much better for inspecting teeth and gums - the spotlight makes a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> Surprisingly, I bled far more with the water irrigator I also bought which arrived a few days</li>
            <li> The tools bend slightly so I can never get a really good scrape on the backside of the teeth .</li>
            <li> Received super fast</li>
            <li> They are safe, keep them clean by spraying rubbing alcohol and let dry overnight before you use them again.  </li>
            <li> Effective way to clear away the yuck between professional teeth cleanings.  </li>
            <li> Just rinse it with warm water and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Very useful and so far it has gotten the job done!</li>
            <li> Still, DenTek&#x27;s Oral Care Kit does contain a very nice set of implements, which can be quite useful, as long as you exercise proper care.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good little kit.</li>
            <li> When you cut vinyl you have to be able to pull out tiny bits of it that you don&#x27;t want in the finished decal (the dot in the center of an O for example) and a sharp hook is perfect for that.  </li>
            <li> Nonetheless, my first visit scarred me for life: 8 cavities, gingivitis, and wisdom tooth extraction.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty self-explanatory to use the items in here,</li>
            <li> The stainless steel pick is useful.</li>
            <li> She has a tartar build up problem, and this works pretty well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Good oral care kit for those wanting to step up their dental care but not quite enough if you more sever issues.</li>
            <li> so this is the first time using something like this</li>
            <li> The product overall is ok.</li>
            <li> you get exactly what you expect, and the mirror doesn&#x27;t fog up at all</li>
            <li> My daughter has a open bite and she was using a Water Pik , top of the line toothpaste and mouthwash and flossing</li>
            <li> I ordered this and like magic the ladies became quiet</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased this brand.</li>
            <li> Visually, this was the set that was of better quality.</li>
            <li> does exactly as featured in product description.</li>
            <li> No matter how much you brush your teeth!</li>
            <li> Looks exactly as pictured and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> The cleaning tools included in this kit are made of soft, cheap feeling plastic.  </li>
            <li> It is much more obvious than indoor light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*half a year</li>
            <li> Overall, I am satisfied with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as shown.</li>
            <li> The yellow tip perio tool is not included in most care kits.</li>
            <li> and it was still able to remove a lot in just two sessions (they recommend using the metal pick only once</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> The rubber probe made me realize how intense my tooth problem was and helped me make the right decision to extract it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little cheap in it&#x27;s construction and not the most sturdy.</li>
            <li> The metal scaler (which states it is for weekly use) and metal pic are nice - not overly sharp</li>
            <li> I had a plaque build on my front bottom teeth and decided to remove it myself (ok now call me crazy lol).</li>
            <li> It takes a few times of trying to figure out the most comfortable way to use it and do what you want.</li>
            <li> i only really use the scaler to keep on top of tarter/plaque/calculus.</li>
            <li> Great for hard to reach places!</li>
            <li> easy to use, basic set.</li>
            <li> These won&#x27;t stand up to the high heat sterilization, but for home use these seem to be good enough for me and will probably work well enough for you too.</li>
            <li> I had bought this kit mainly because of mirror, but other items are nice to have and they do their job well.</li>
            <li> Actually ran them through dishwasher, and they cam out fine.  </li>
            <li> These little tools come in really handy.</li>
            <li> The mirror is handy for checking little things out inside.</li>
            <li> This little kit is effective.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little set if you want to go a little deeper and do some teeth scraping of your own.</li>
            <li> My parents just didn&#x27;t feel the urgency or really have the funds to take me.</li>
            <li> I brush twice a day with a toothbrush that costs as much as some phones, and floss + rinse every night.</li>
            <li> Should help keep the dentist from griping so much</li>
            <li> she commented I didn&#x27;t have much plaque build up</li>
            <li> I like this kit, I really do.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> There is a plastic pick too, which doesn&#x27;t really seem to be of much use.  </li>
            <li> There is also a mirror which I haven&#x27;t really been using either.  </li>
            <li> All in all, worth the modest price.</li>
            <li> THE TOOL S ARE VERY ERGONOMIC  AND WORK</li>
            <li> I threw away the stuff inside and kept the case to hold my Stainless Steel dental picks.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions very strictly and voila it was removed.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> very careful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Item are really durable, not flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;Great  </li>
            <li> Then I purchased this and cleaned my teeth with a metal scratcher and was amazed how much gunk came off.</li>
            <li> but it is very time consuming though.</li>
            <li> Look for a completely stainless steel set (if any exist anymore).</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really figured out how to use them correctly.  </li>
            <li> &#x3D;) Be careful though</li>
            <li> I recommend another product as the scaler gives too much when applying pressure against the tooth.</li>
            <li> Very valuable kit for those who have teeth issues.</li>
            <li> I really like it and the container it comes in</li>
            <li> I should have bought the real deal metal ones.</li>
            <li> This helps me to keep my teeth a whole lot cleaner.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this kit!</li>
            <li> NOT metal pics; very flimsy PLASTIC pieces.  </li>
            <li> Also, the case is a real pain.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Really, at this price even just the thin wire pick is so good for a jerky eater, that it&#x27;s worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not quite sure what to do with the other tool.</li>
            <li> I have to clean between the teeth because she has such a smelly breath.</li>
            <li> Its easy to use, comfortable grip, and takes up hardly any space in a drawer.</li>
            <li> I only go for special treatment is needed, this tool work wonders for the day to day cleaning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the teeth will look smaller due to the 6inch distance to fit both your hands , but I found it to be easy linking up the images through 2 mirrors ...</li>
            <li> My first trip to the dentist ever in my life was when I was 19 years old -- I had NEVER been before.</li>
            <li> The plastic tool does nothing for me and the mirror is too small for someone attempting their own cleaning.</li>
            <li> Yes, the mirror is tiny, but that is true of all the sets I have tried.</li>
            <li> The box is hard to open every time, but they work great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try to use the other pieces included to keep my teeth clean though, promise!</li>
            <li> My previous Dentek kit was much better.</li>
            <li> so they are easy to use for an inexperienced person.</li>
            <li> which is the main issue with using a mouth mirror.  </li>
            <li> I haad the older verison and just upgraded to this one, looks nicer.</li>
            <li> I bought it mainly</li>
            <li> (the mirror is the main reason I got the kit, I am always trying to look at something in my mouth for some reason).</li>
            <li> Overall decent product for the price, the hand mirror does seems a bit flimsy in terms of the plastic support for the mirrored surface, but then again I am not paying for a dentist grade hand mirror with actual glass. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> BUT STILL, despite my best oral hygiene practices, tartar still finds a way to nest itself right at the base of my front lower teeth at the gum line</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this kit.</li>
            <li> High quality tools</li>
            <li> and these are definitely more professional by the angles and the sharp points.</li>
            <li> The three tools come in a nice hard shell</li>
            <li> So much better than wood toothpicks that fall apart in a few seconds.</li>
            <li> True these are not the same professional tools that your dentist uses but</li>
            <li> The explorer can get into many places, but also has the potential to do a lot of damage if used improperly, so again, you really need to be careful.  </li>
            <li> Only one side of one tool is worth anything.</li>
            <li> When I first saw this arrive, the first thing I noticed was that something strange was on the mirror.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So pick one up, however many tools you&#x27;ll use, because for cleaning, scraping or just plain picking....</li>
            <li> One tool has a stainless steel pick (explorer) on one end, and a stainless steel scaler (scraper) on the opposite end.  </li>
            <li> Love the little plastic case!</li>
            <li> I kinda had to order a second kit for my mouth after discovering that ;-)</li>
            <li> While they do have a design similar to real dental implements, since they can&#x27;t withstand being sterilized by high temperatures, characterizing these dental tools as \\&quot;professional\\&quot; is inappropriate.  </li>
            <li> The mirror is also extremely useful because it allows you to see tartar in places you may not normally check.</li>
            <li> The metal is kind of weak.  </li>
            <li> They work well, and I am extremely less worried about doing damage to my teeth/gums with these as they flex more and are obviously softer.</li>
            <li> kit feels very much like the tools that are used on me at the dentist (except for the cheaper plastic handles) and work well at removing anything between the teeth to the gumline as long as you can reach in there.  </li>
            <li> Actually, it is doubtful your dentist would advise you to buy this kit, it is very good quality, works as advertized, and is reasonably price...</li>
            <li> Also they are pretty weak and they bend easily.</li>
            <li> Great product though the third piece that is there to stimulate gum is rather useless to me.</li>
            <li> I only really use the thicker edged instrument to remove plaque...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll leave that to a professional.</li>
            <li> - Includes Tarter Scraper/Scaling Instrument, Dental Toothpick, Mouth Mirror - Professional Surgical Grade Dentist Approved Tools]]</li>
            <li> I used to only have a metal dental pick, but this whole set has made my teeth cleaner.</li>
            <li> Low price and fast delivery - AWSOME</li>
            <li> The only tool I really use is the dental pick</li>
            <li> I had a professional dental cleaning 1-2 months ago.</li>
            <li> The design of the metal scaler allows it to be much sturdier, and I feel that the pick would have benefited from a similar design.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect them to be anywhere near the quality or sharpness of tools you&#x27;d find at a dentist.</li>
            <li> &gt; The few extra minutes you spend to do the work using these tools as well as brushing your teeth and rinsing with mouthwash, will make quite a difference in maintaining the care needed to keep your gums and teeth healthy.</li>
            <li> The other tools seem to be of pretty decent quality too.</li>
            <li> Wish one of the metal picks was a little better than a wire, doesn&#x27;t bode well for long term reliability.</li>
            <li> it is useful as a tool for other things around the home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other is stainless steel and as long as you are careful, will also provide opportunity to get food particles you may not be able to reach otherwise.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sharper end have some give to it, but I understand it is to stop the user from using excessive force which is more likely to lose control and</li>
            <li> A simple easy way to help keep your teeth clean and help to prevent unnecessary extra  build up of plaque on your teeth.</li>
            <li> Harder to use than I thought, but exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> The set isn&#x27;t very expensive, and quality appears to be pretty good, so these tools should last for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing more nothing less  they are plastic with metal head on the one the other is plastic</li>
            <li> Especially there is so much gunk at the back of your teeth!</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, these tools (in combination with my tongue cleaner) do an adequate job at supplementing the everyday toothbrush.</li>
            <li> There are no sharp edges anywhere.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t scrape off tartar well enough to avoid frequent trips to the dental hygienist.  </li>
            <li> Will be ordering a second set soon for my dogs as the old pet ones need replacing.</li>
            <li> For me, the mirror showed me that I had some tartar buildup behind my front top teeth.</li>
            <li> This is a nice set for the price but the plastic/rubber pick is all but useless.</li>
            <li> When it came out it was very hard and sharp, very interesting.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I  lost my old set in a move and bought this one thinking there wouldn&#x27;t be much difference between the previous set I had.</li>
            <li> The few parts that are made of metal aren&#x27;t hard/strong enough to actually help clean any plaque off or between teeth.</li>
            <li> The little orange rubber piece is useless but the others are great</li>
            <li> Bought this to help remove some plaque where it&#x27;s hard to clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get between my teeth to clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently become obsessed with cleaning my teeth better and this little kit is great for getting in tough problem areas that I have in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Make sure that you&#x27;re careful with the metal tools, I once sliced my cheek with a clumsy move.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find brief instructional information regarding the use of each tool on the back of the case.</li>
            <li> I wish the pick was a little bit more stiff</li>
            <li> high quality and works as expected.</li>
            <li> (yes, it will actually remove tartar) in hard to clean areas.</li>
            <li> sometimes you get a little food stuck in a deep groove or a popcorn kernel behind you back molar, and I always wish I had something like this on hand when that happens, so this will hopefully be a good purchase over time.</li>
            <li> After my wife threw out a previous set like this I had for some time I was desperately looking for a replacement, and glad I found these, much better quality than the other ones.</li>
            <li> This is no replacement for a dentist, obviously, but it certainly helps to keep tartar build up down before a dentist visit.</li>
            <li> Every other year or so, I buy a new set of these.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Dental hygiene, and trying to minimize the growth of plaque, is a very tough task, and these tools can be quite useful for certain tasks.  </li>
            <li> but we always dealt with rude people who constantly said she wasn&#x27;t doing anything right because she always had buildup .</li>
            <li> Nothing much to say... extremely inexpensive product, does the job, and I wouldn&#x27;t be hesitant to buy another set due to price.</li>
            <li> I was so shocked and asked my dentist what I can do to help - he said that the occasional scraping will help, and this little tool set works just great for that.</li>
            <li> Long story short, it sucked, so lets skip to</li>
            <li> Recently I purchased the Dentek Professional Oral Care Kit, 3 Count because I had an upcoming dental appointment and was a little concerned with what the doc was going to say about the tartar build-up</li>
            <li> I could not use all of the features since my teeth are sensitive and the spaces between them tight.</li>
            <li> The only reason I take a star away, is because they call them professional, so I was hoping one of the metal ends to be a bit thinner of a point to get into those very tight spots.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been using this as much as I thought, but I intend to make it a part of at least a weekly routine.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for that long time ago, since I had the Tooth Pik from Walgreens.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> The second tool has a plastic scaler, with a pointed rubber stimulator on the other end.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is a plastic pic for daily use and on the other end</li>
            <li> Get some mouthwash while you&#x27;re at it to give you an over-the-top clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Thankfully only the scaler, the other end is too sharp.</li>
            <li> The metal has less &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; or texture to grab on and seems flimsier overall.</li>
            <li> Although they&#x27;re small enough to reach tight places, they&#x27;re still sturdy and not sharp.</li>
            <li> Being a little bit of a do-it-yourself-er I decided to take a chance and actually try using a dental pick set like this.</li>
            <li> Mirror isn&#x27;t bad, but could be better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to use it carefully.  </li>
            <li> but it is duller then I expected.</li>
            <li> This is not a substitute for going to the dentist/periodontist, but if you&#x27;re careful this can help supplement your cleaning routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Steel is obviously much harder than either your teeth or gums.  </li>
            <li> At this price, I have no real issues with it.</li>
            <li> Meets the quality expected.</li>
            <li> Does the job as expected for a home kit.</li>
            <li> Not much for instructions.</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewers state, &amp;#34;be careful and take your time&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Not much of a sharp edge to some of the tools, which makes it hard to scrape sometimes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, one complaint that I have is that the metal pick is slightly too thick to be as useful as it could be.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The instruments are not sharp in the least.  </li>
            <li> I tried toothpicks, my finger nails, bent straws and other plastic utensils</li>
            <li> I thought the sharp tool would be sharper</li>
            <li> This is a product link to the other kit that I prefer:</li>
            <li> Needed a pick since we lost the other ones.</li>
            <li> One tool has a dental pick on one end and a metal scaler on the other.</li>
            <li> ; on it by 1 hand holding the small mirror and 1 hand on the steel pick -- while looking into a bigger mirror</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as tools with sculpy and other clays.</li>
            <li> Both ends are flexible, one made of rubber the other of plastic.</li>
            <li> The other tools, of course, enable one to MAKE that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a smoker and heavy black coffee drinker with dark stains on the inside and outside of my lower teeth.  </li>
            <li> Plastic is soft and very hard to remove plaque etc.</li>
            <li> The scrapers are helpful for getting at hard to reach places, like the backside of your last teeth.  </li>
            <li> , so it&#x27;s a bit hard to get the necessary leverage with it (it might be designed that way on purpose, so you don&#x27;t damage your teeth and then try to sue the company).  </li>
            <li> unlike your average over-priced dentist.</li>
            <li> If you apply too much force to a tooth in the wrong place, it could crack or break, a filling could come out, or the gum could be punctured, so be</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, average quality.</li>
            <li> Just enough pressure to slowly work it out is all you need.</li>
            <li> These help to keep teeth plaque down to a minimum in between dental visits.</li>
            <li> Cut down on dental bills with this.</li>
            <li> One of these tools is all plastic, expected all metal, the little mirror is too little.  </li>
            <li> Be careful though, I tore up my gums the first few times (I used Ibuprofen and cold water swished around in my mouth to settle down the irritation).</li>
            <li> The steel tip is very sharp.</li>
            <li> What it does do is remove any thing that may be sticking to your teeth that would cause them to appear less</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not super into using this too often.</li>
            <li> I use the metal scraper for slight tarter build up.</li>
            <li> The mirror is a little iffy -</li>
            <li> A little flimsy.</li>
            <li> Tape the mirror onto a little LED flashlight.</li>
            <li> Just be careful when you&#x27;re using these, you don&#x27;t want to go too hard and really mess something up.  </li>
            <li> I have had it for a few about a month now.</li>
            <li> This one is a few bucks cheaper but a LOT suckier.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money -these</li>
            <li> After not having dental insurance throughout college, I went to the dentist this past year and had - quite - a few cavities and some plaque.</li>
            <li> When I wen to the dentist he had very little work to do.</li>
            <li> It cleans surface plaque well but trying to get to the inner front teeth can be difficult .  </li>
            <li> Does all it needs to, very helpful for those days where a small seed can make for an extremely painful day.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price for this add on item is hard to beat, so get it here if you need it.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to, I just have a hard to maneuvering the tools around.</li>
            <li> I have been having dental issues lately and thought about buying some kit like this.</li>
            <li> plastic handle, to delicate for me</li>
            <li> I just hope it wasn&#x27;t bug legs because it was bent and kinda thick like that.</li>
            <li> implements are not toys, and you can do some serious damage if you misuse them, so treat them with the respect they deserve, whether you are using them on yourself, or on another person.  </li>
            <li> Silhouette, Cricket and other craft companies have hooks in their brands but they&#x27;re all dull and clunky and useless!  </li>
            <li> Call me crazy (not really)</li>
            <li> I thought it was broken as it looked like cracks, but with closer inspection</li>
            <li> The plastic one is totally useless.</li>
            <li> unfortunately we can&#x27;t say a word because they will freak</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry  </li>
            <li> A lot of the tools in this thing are outright useless.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong for the money.</li>
            <li> The dual-ended tips help no one and hurt if you hold it wrong.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong when you purchase the name brand product.</li>
            <li> I get a build-up of plaque behind my lower, front teeth that drives my crazy</li>
            <li> This is the part that is incredibly dangerous.</li>
            <li> Which is a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I wish I had this the past 10-15 years!!!!!</li>
            <li> I did read some of the comments of people being fearful and others warning one could damage teeth.  </li>
            <li> Mirror is terrible, can&#x27;t see a thing!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I feel like a dentist with this kit!</li>
            <li> My first trip to the dentist ever in my life was when I was 19 years old -- I had NEVER been before. My parents just didn&#x27;t feel the urgency or really have the funds to take me. Nonetheless, my first visit scarred me for life: 8 cavities, gingivitis, and wisdom tooth extraction. Long story short, it sucked, so lets skip to now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s 3+ years later, and I&#x27;m a huge oral hygiene nerd. I brush twice a day with a toothbrush that costs as much as some phones, and floss + rinse every night. BUT STILL, despite my best oral hygiene practices, tartar still finds a way to nest itself right at the base of my front lower teeth at the gum line and I&#x27;d had enough. I tried toothpicks, my finger nails, bent straws and other plastic utensils short of a jackhammer to no avail. Then I thought, &amp;#34;hey, if the dentist cleans my teeth with these, why can&#x27;t I?&amp;#34; And, well, its now an hour after I got home from work and found a glistening Prime package sitting on my doorstep, which contained this inside. I immediately opened this and ran to my bathroom, where I meticulously savaged every speck of discoloration on my teeth that I could find. IT WORKED! Bye bye tartar build-up, hello glistening white teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty self-explanatory to use the items in here, and there&#x27;s a nice set of instructions on the back of the box. Just take your time and understand that if you rush this, you&#x27;re probably going to stab yourself in the mouth somewhere, and you don&#x27;t want that. Buy this, scape that $#!^ off of your teeth, and rock on.</li>
            <li> This is a nice kit. I seems to be very good quality and I like that is has a case so I don&#x27;t lose these in a drawer. I think it is a nice product at a fair price.</li>
            <li> Works great! Forget about the hygienist, I&#x27;ll do it myself! It feels the same as if a pro did it! My mouth comes out so fresh n&#x27; so clean clean!</li>
            <li> Good for those of us who have reached the age where good dental hygiene isn&#x27;t as easy as it once was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror allows looking at problem areas. The rubber tip is good for massaging gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the metal picks to scrape off plaque and tartar (yes, it will actually remove tartar) in hard to clean areas.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this for my 9 DOGs Oral Hygiene&lt;br /&gt;you can never keep their teeth too clean..&lt;br /&gt; why have your vet use anesthesia on them&lt;br /&gt;when you can just start when they are puppies&lt;br /&gt; and maintain those Canines..</li>
            <li> just what i was looking for</li>
            <li> This kit does the job, and helps me keep my teeth clean in between cleanings at my dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> It has everything I need to give myself an at-home cleaning between dentist appointments. The tools are well made.</li>
            <li> So great to have on hand and even for your purse. Handy case.</li>
            <li> Bought this to maintain my teeth between doctor visits, works well and good quality.</li>
            <li> I wish I had this the past 10-15 years!!!!! AWESOME!!!!</li>
            <li> came in quickly, very happy!</li>
            <li> Great for teeth cleaning in between visits</li>
            <li> Looks great, neat, compact and clean...sturdy metal, not easily bent like others, I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> Great little kit. Should help keep the dentist from griping so much lol. Good for scraping plaque off around the gums which is what i purchased the product for.</li>
            <li> My sister is a dental hygienist, and my Dad a retired dentist, and I used to be his assistant, so I have some clue as to what I&#x27;m doing with these. The last time my sister cleaned my teeth she commented I didn&#x27;t have much plaque build up, I told her that this kit is available on Amazon, and she said everyone should buy one.The plastic one is totally useless. For what it is, its useful and a good price. It doesn&#x27;t hurt to be able to see what is going on in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I like this kit, I really do. But I&#x27;ve always used the 2 piece kit and I don&#x27;t find the extra tool with this kit useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, some might like the tool and it is useful as a tool for other things around the home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, at this price even just the thin wire pick is so good for a jerky eater, that it&#x27;s worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So pick one up, however many tools you&#x27;ll use, because for cleaning, scraping or just plain picking....These tools work well.</li>
            <li> The mirror is a little iffy - it&#x27;s a plastic mirror in a plastic handle and you kind of have to maneuver it to really see anything. However, the pick and the gum stimulator are great and that&#x27;s what I got the kit for. I feel compelled to warn you that you might find yourself reaching for the implements again and again because they are great for getting junk out of your keyboard and stuff, too. I kinda had to order a second kit for my mouth after discovering that ;-) Anyway, this is the thing to have if you ever get popcorn kernels stuck in your back tooth. It gets them right out!</li>
            <li> Good quality products.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and like the handy case.</li>
            <li> When I wen to the dentist he had very little work to do. Great product</li>
            <li> Love being able to clean my own teeth!</li>
            <li> Oh yes, these are lovely. Great for in-between professional cleanings.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good little kit.</li>
            <li> Okay truth time... I bought this to use the pick/hook to weed vinyl decals I cut with my Silhouette crafting machine.  When you cut vinyl you have to be able to pull out tiny bits of it that you don&#x27;t want in the finished decal (the dot in the center of an O for example) and a sharp hook is perfect for that.  Silhouette, Cricket and other craft companies have hooks in their brands but they&#x27;re all dull and clunky and useless!  This hook works perfect haha. :)  I&#x27;ll try to use the other pieces included to keep my teeth clean though, promise!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to clean my dogs teeth.</li>
            <li> good product for the price</li>
            <li> This is a really great product. The tools in here are really useful for scraping off tartar that brushing and flossing doesn&#x27;t remove. The mirror is also extremely useful because it allows you to see tartar in places you may not normally check. For me, the mirror showed me that I had some tartar buildup behind my front top teeth. It&#x27;s not a place you could easily see, and this toolkit helped me see and remove it.</li>
            <li> Actually, it is doubtful your dentist would advise you to buy this kit, it is very good quality, works as advertized, and is reasonably price... unlike your average over-priced dentist. I&#x27;ll take this kit over floss any day. It has changed my dental care habits forever.</li>
            <li> This product is great for cleaning the plaque from your teeth. I feel like I just got back from the dentist after using this. My teeth just look better since I&#x27;ve been using it. I would recommend this product. It works great for me.</li>
            <li> Great addition to my dental care routine, I&#x27;m using one of the tools to clean around my son&#x27;s gums, he is 4 and brushing alone wasn&#x27;t enough to clean up his teeth, very happy with this dental tools.</li>
            <li> The metal is kind of weak.  A little flimsy.</li>
            <li> Good quality, especially for the price. I use these a lot.</li>
            <li> Pretty good item.  The stainless steel pick is useful. I&#x27;m trying to use it carefully.  Haven&#x27;t been using this as much as I thought, but I intend to make it a part of at least a weekly routine.  There is a plastic pick too, which doesn&#x27;t really seem to be of much use.  There is also a mirror which I haven&#x27;t really been using either.  All in all, worth the modest price.</li>
            <li> Useful for scraping off plaque, don&#x27;t find the mirror very useful.</li>
            <li> It cleans surface plaque well but trying to get to the inner front teeth can be difficult .  The tools bend slightly so I can never get a really good scrape on the backside of the teeth .</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my 7 year olds teeth. She has a tartar build up problem, and this works pretty well. This is no replacement for a dentist, obviously, but it certainly helps to keep tartar build up down before a dentist visit.</li>
            <li> GREAT BARGAIN ! THE TOOL S ARE VERY ERGONOMIC  AND WORK WELL . I REALLY LOVE THESE  AS TOOLS IN THE MY CLEANING ARSENAL I ALSO LOVE PERIOGENL</li>
            <li> One of these tools is all plastic, expected all metal, the little mirror is too little.  It&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li> handy little kit for keeping your teeth tidy between dental visits.</li>
            <li> It does the job its meant to do but wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for I thought the sharp tool would be sharper but it is duller then I expected.</li>
            <li> high quality and works as expected.</li>
            <li> Each piece seems well made considering they are plastic.  There are no sharp edges anywhere.  The mirror does not fog up which is the main issue with using a mouth mirror.  The metal and rubber picks both work as they should for removing stuck pieces of food.  Even the case is solid.  At this price you can get a backup as well.</li>
            <li> I love it. Has everything I need, especially the dental pick and the dental scaler. Although they&#x27;re small enough to reach tight places, they&#x27;re still sturdy and not sharp.</li>
            <li> Nice set for in between dentist visits.</li>
            <li> Very good quality.  Love having everything in the case.  Amazing results, and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Eh, didn&#x27;t work well for me.  Couldn&#x27;t scrape off tartar well enough to avoid frequent trips to the dental hygienist.  Also, unlighted mirror is of limited value, I find that a Tweezerman 10x Lighted Mirror works much better for inspecting teeth and gums - the spotlight makes a huge difference.  Threw this set away and went to my dentist, :D</li>
            <li> Nice kit. Bought for son with braces. He likes it. I will purchase again if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CAM</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for travel!</li>
            <li> Fine, it bents a bit when I press it, but works a bit.</li>
            <li> Good product, worth the money!</li>
            <li> i had hoped it to be more useful.  went to the dentist after all.</li>
            <li> Very useful to keep teeth clean in between dentist visits. I only really use the thicker edged instrument to remove plaque...I avoid the sharper one...I&#x27;ll leave that to a professional.</li>
            <li> I threw away the stuff inside and kept the case to hold my Stainless Steel dental picks.</li>
            <li> I use the plastic pick several times a day. It flexes when you run it between teeth and doesn&#x27;t break. So much better than wood toothpicks that fall apart in a few seconds. Have not used the metal pick or scaler yet. The mirror is handy to see what&#x27;s going on with cheek-side molars and the back side of front teeth. Tape the mirror onto a little LED flashlight.</li>
            <li> Bought this to help remove some plaque where it&#x27;s hard to clean. Works really well and feels,like it&#x27;s good quality. I have had it for a few about a month now.</li>
            <li> Another great hygiene tool.</li>
            <li> This is not a substitute for going to the dentist/periodontist, but if you&#x27;re careful this can help supplement your cleaning routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have periodontal disease (hereditary, etc.) and get my teeth cleaned often as a result.  Between cleanings I wanted to do more than just brushing and flossing so I decided to try this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit feels very much like the tools that are used on me at the dentist (except for the cheaper plastic handles) and work well at removing anything between the teeth to the gumline as long as you can reach in there.  The pick is very deep and the thicker scraper can be used to get any plaque off any reachable surface.  I have not used the mirror since I haven&#x27;t needed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this seems like a good addition to keep your teeth as clean as possible - even between professional cleanings.</li>
            <li> This is not quite what you would think. It does provide the majority of what you need for good dental care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought was looking for one additional tool to help remove tartar. It has a pick but I needed a rasp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of their clams and promises are good except you have to think of how it can whiten your teeth since it does nothing like that. What it does do is remove any thing that may be sticking to your teeth that would cause them to appear less white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good oral care kit for those wanting to step up their dental care but not quite enough if you more sever issues.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, Excellent value.. Easy to clean. I wish the scaler was sharper though..</li>
            <li> Call me crazy (not really) but I don&#x27;t like dentists and don&#x27;t trust them. I had a plaque build on my front bottom teeth and decided to remove it myself (ok now call me crazy lol). I bought this set just for the fun of it and can&#x27;t believe it works. I followed the instructions very strictly and voila it was removed. When it came out it was very hard and sharp, very interesting. I also like the mirror because it doesn&#x27;t fog up in the mouth.</li>
            <li> These little tools come in really handy. They seem to be made well. I like that the package  is also a case for them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this kit at all.&lt;br /&gt;The instruments are not sharp in the least.  They are blunt, so they can&#x27;t scrape off any tartar at all.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this oral care kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a good scaler, you are better off with Hu Freidy (sp?).  That brand is excellent.</li>
            <li> Looked used when arrived.</li>
            <li> Feels great to be able to clean near my gum line with this love it</li>
            <li> Great to help keep the teeth clean</li>
            <li> A simple easy way to help keep your teeth clean and help to prevent unnecessary extra  build up of plaque on your teeth. True these are not the same professional tools that your dentist uses but this care kit if used properly will make it easier for you and your dentist when you go for a check up or have your teeth cleaned.&lt;br /&gt; The few extra minutes you spend to do the work using these tools as well as brushing your teeth and rinsing with mouthwash, will make quite a difference in maintaining the care needed to keep your gums and teeth healthy. Do no think of it a chore that has to be done, but think of it as help in keeping your teeth clean. It is a simple as that. Now quit your bitching and do the exercise.</li>
            <li> So glad to make this investment. Received super fast</li>
            <li> I bought four of these for the family and they work great. The only reason I take a star away, is because they call them professional, so I was hoping one of the metal ends to be a bit thinner of a point to get into those very tight spots. They work great but I am glad I ordered another brand and these are definitely more professional by the angles and the sharp points. If you are not use to picking tarter off your teeth than I would say these are perfect and I do like the rubber/plastic pick and the mirror that comes with it. My husband always went and got his teeth clean so this is the first time using something like this and he loves it. This is a product link to the other kit that I prefer: [[ASIN:B00X9JE7LM #1 Dental Hygiene Kit - Includes Tarter Scraper/Scaling Instrument, Dental Toothpick, Mouth Mirror - Professional Surgical Grade Dentist Approved Tools]]</li>
            <li> The product overall is ok. It does the job, but i would have liked the picks to be sharper. Also they are pretty weak and they bend easily. I still got all the tartar that i wanted removed, so it works.</li>
            <li> Ex product. Almost as good as going to dentist for scrape and polish. Made excellent gifts. Unavailable in Australia at this quality</li>
            <li> Great kit! I used to only have a metal dental pick, but this whole set has made my teeth cleaner. The plastic scaler (kinda like a dental pick, but good for scraping, especially along the gum line) is much gentler so I can use it every day. And then there&#x27;s the metal tool. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who wants to take better care of their teeth. Now I can make my teeth pretty much as clean as the dentist.</li>
            <li> I have used it to scrape the junk off that my toothbrush cannot and I like the variety of tools that come with the scraper.</li>
            <li> Works great to remove plaque</li>
            <li> you get exactly what you expect, and the mirror doesn&#x27;t fog up at all so that&#x27;s great too</li>
            <li> Nice, dental kit and case, everything you need to care for your own teeth cleaning. Nice price too.</li>
            <li> Used it and gave one away both of us liked it. Tools are good quality and mirror works well too.</li>
            <li> I haad the older verison and just upgraded to this one, looks nicer.</li>
            <li> I like to keep my front teeth cleaned so I use the scaler the most. Good quality kit for home use.</li>
            <li> Every time I went to the dentist my mouth was torn and bleeding, since I bought this I only go for special treatment is needed, this tool work wonders for the day to day cleaning.</li>
            <li> I was looking for that long time ago, since I had the Tooth Pik from Walgreens.&lt;br /&gt;Good to have on emergencies or daily cleaning.</li>
            <li> you can buy this same kit at Walmart for the same price. I just ordered it off here, but its great it does what you buy it for, to clean your teeth : )</li>
            <li> I have been having dental issues lately and thought about buying some kit like this. At this price of roughly $6, I didnt hesitate to buy.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with it so far, it looks sturdy.</li>
            <li> Very useful and so far it has gotten the job done! I will buy it again!</li>
            <li> helps in between cleanings.  good as any of these products</li>
            <li> Helps maintain them pearly whites!</li>
            <li> Bought these for my dog...they are a bit flimsy, but not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I can get the tarter out from between my front teeth between dentist visits!</li>
            <li> It works great for me and I also bought it for my family.Quite convenient to carry around and keep the teeth clean.</li>
            <li> I love this kit.  After I use it, I have that &amp;#34;fresh from the dentist&amp;#34; feeling of very smooth teeth!  I&#x27;m a tea drinker, so this combined with Crest Optic White is keeping my teeth in good shape!  The directions say to only use the metal scraper weekly, but that the plastic one can be used daily.  I suppose this is to protect enamel?  The angled mirror is great for checking the often overlooked backs of teeth.</li>
            <li> Flossing and brushing is not enough because I wear a permanent retainer.  I love to have the feeling that my teeth a cleaner.</li>
            <li> Needed a pick since we lost the other ones.</li>
            <li> They are safe, keep them clean by spraying rubbing alcohol and let dry overnight before you use them again.  The rubber tip is great for the gums and also treats exposed roots.  If you use it regularly on exposed roots, the gum actually moves back to where it is supposed to be.  One of the tools is plastic, for picking out hard-to-reach places safely. The other is stainless steel and as long as you are careful, will also provide opportunity to get food particles you may not be able to reach otherwise.</li>
            <li> I thought I found a product that could be useful and reused. I could not use all of the features since my teeth are sensitive and the spaces between them tight. I am resorting back to floss now.</li>
            <li> Works very well.Wish it would include a tarter scraper in the kit.</li>
            <li> Perfect kit for touching up coffee stains. A+ recommend</li>
            <li> it cleaned his teeth well got in between the teeth got all tarter off his teeth he said this is the best thing some one came up with</li>
            <li> My daughter has a open bite and she was using a Water Pik , top of the line toothpaste and mouthwash and flossing but we always dealt with rude people who constantly said she wasn&#x27;t doing anything right because she always had buildup . I even had her teeth cleaned every 3 months and no pleasing anyone . I ordered this and like magic the ladies became quiet unfortunately we can&#x27;t say a word because they will freak but I showed her how to use the kit and it&#x27;s a life saver for cleaning around brackets and cheaper than paying $100 or more every 3 months and although I was told that was safe I&#x27;m sorry  I&#x27;m not so sure</li>
            <li> this is a great simple teeth cleaning set. easy to use, basic set. i like that the pick also has a scrapper.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for those who wants to keep there teeth clean as possible without having to go to the dentist....</li>
            <li> Great price- check&lt;br /&gt;Product as seen in photo- check&lt;br /&gt;Tools are perfect for at home teeth lovers- check&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, good buy. I just wanted something that would help me get some excess plaque off my teeth between dental visits. I use this product maybe once a month for a quick scrape and I&#x27;m not super into using this too often. Anyway, I do like it and think you probably will too!</li>
            <li> No complaints at all here. My last visit to the dentist was proof. Even the hygienist mentioned how brief the visit was. I use this about twice a week, and it does wonders.</li>
            <li> I think everyone needs to own these for every member of there household. It helps with keeping plaque and food off your teeth in between dental appointments. By no means is this a replacement for dental check ups but it is a good supplemental oral kit.</li>
            <li> Plastic is soft and very hard to remove plaque etc. as they bend. I would buy metal. I am disapointed.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to take care of those nagging areas I can&#x27;t seem to keep clean.  I&#x27;ve used the pick with great success.  Now the dentist won&#x27;t seem like he&#x27;s mining for gold when he does my cleaning.  Mirror is helpful.  I haven&#x27;t used the gum stimulator yet though.  Just be careful when you&#x27;re using these, you don&#x27;t want to go too hard and really mess something up.  Just enough pressure to slowly work it out is all you need.</li>
            <li> Bought a set for myself and husband.  Mirror doesn&#x27;t fog up.  Tools are will constructed.  Very reasonable price.  I would recommend this product without hesitation.</li>
            <li> While they do have a design similar to real dental implements, since they can&#x27;t withstand being sterilized by high temperatures, characterizing these dental tools as \\&quot;professional\\&quot; is inappropriate.  Still, DenTek&#x27;s Oral Care Kit does contain a very nice set of implements, which can be quite useful, as long as you exercise proper care.  The set isn&#x27;t very expensive, and quality appears to be pretty good, so these tools should last for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included are a dental mirror, and two double ended implements, all with rubber coated handles.  One tool has a stainless steel pick (explorer) on one end, and a stainless steel scaler (scraper) on the opposite end.  The second tool has a plastic scaler, with a pointed rubber stimulator on the other end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These implements are not toys, and you can do some serious damage if you misuse them, so treat them with the respect they deserve, whether you are using them on yourself, or on another person.  Steel is obviously much harder than either your teeth or gums.  If you apply too much force to a tooth in the wrong place, it could crack or break, a filling could come out, or the gum could be punctured, so be very careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dental hygiene, and trying to minimize the growth of plaque, is a very tough task, and these tools can be quite useful for certain tasks.  The scrapers are helpful for getting at hard to reach places, like the backside of your last teeth.  The explorer can get into many places, but also has the potential to do a lot of damage if used improperly, so again, you really need to be careful.  The stimulator is great for removing plaque along the gums.  The rubber tip is replaceable, so if you get some spare tips, you can continue using this tool indefinitely.  Your dentist may not use rubber coated tools, but they do provide a nice solid grip.  Amazon&#x27;s price for this add on item is hard to beat, so get it here if you need it.</li>
            <li> For under $6 this is a pretty superb set. I read reviews when i make my purchases so i do the same to help fellow amazoners out. The scaler broke some&lt;br /&gt;Plaque off that i didnt even know i had. Its easy to use, comfortable grip, and takes up hardly any space in a drawer. I wish the pick was a little bit more stiff but nevertheless it did do its job and was effective. Bottom line is dont look for other sets that cost more, this one does the job perfectly. It gave me that &amp;#34;just left the dentist&amp;#34; feeling in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Every other year or so, I buy a new set of these. This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased this brand. I bought it mainly because at the store I  was at, I had a choice between the DenTek brand and some cheap no-name one. Visually, this was the set that was of better quality. With this kit you get, three tools, a standard mouth mirror and two two-headed tools. One tool has a dental pick on one end and a metal scaler on the other. The second tool has a rubber gum stimulator and a plastic scaler. The metal scaler is meant to be used weekly, while the plastic one can be used daily. I rarely use the dental pick, preferring instead to just use dental floss. But it does come in handy at times, like when you get a piece of pop-corn shell stuck between you teeth and gum. The three tools come in a nice hard shell snap case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tools seem to do the things they&#x27;re suppose to, so I&#x27;m happy with my purchase of these.</li>
            <li> For the price you cannot beat this product. I use pick and the gum cleaner 3-4 times a week and they perform just as they did on day 1. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> So, so. Will do the job.  My previous Dentek kit was much better.</li>
            <li> Good item. Have some flex while using. Good if I just purchase the solid steel version.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect kit to help you keep your teeth looking pearly white!</li>
            <li> Recently I purchased the Dentek Professional Oral Care Kit, 3 Count because I had an upcoming dental appointment and was a little concerned with what the doc was going to say about the tartar build-up I was experiencing on my lower row of teeth. Being a little bit of a do-it-yourself-er I decided to take a chance and actually try using a dental pick set like this. I was worried I would damage my teeth because I had no clue what I was doing but a quick internet search on how to use a dental pick and scaler put my mind at ease before I got the product. When I received the package and opened everything up I was happy to see included instructions with the three tools. The set is very simple to use and I ended up removing a lot of tartar. When I went to the dentist I wasn&#x27;t scolded either. I had thought that maybe if I made a mistake with the tools that they could tell, but there were no problems. By the way, the 3 count is referring to the number of tools in the case. You get a pick, a scaler, and a mirror (I don&#x27;t even use the mirror). I highly recommend this kit. 5 stars, baby!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s addicting. Thankfully only the scaler, the other end is too sharp. The plastic tool does nothing for me and the mirror is too small for someone attempting their own cleaning. But for just the scaler, it&#x27;s worth it. Be careful though, I tore up my gums the first few times (I used Ibuprofen and cold water swished around in my mouth to settle down the irritation).</li>
            <li> I bought this somewhat on impulse but it was a great buy. I use it once in awhile and I can feel the difference on my teeth. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> very nice when used with tooth filler and a daily clean</li>
            <li> My husband The product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little cheap in it&#x27;s construction and not the most sturdy. It however works, so what can I say. At this price, I have no real issues with it.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm! I was able to get the tea stains and tartar off my teeth with no trouble.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Meets the quality expected.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that would help upkeep my gums in between dental appts. Great little kit. Does the job well. Sturdy.</li>
            <li> This is a good set of tools to help remove tartar and keep your teeth healthy. It takes a few times of trying to figure out the most comfortable way to use it and do what you want.</li>
            <li> Very nice and useful kit. does exactly as featured in product description. Mirror is especially useful. I had bought this kit mainly because of mirror, but other items are nice to have and they do their job well.</li>
            <li> Good product worked well.</li>
            <li> Wonderful small dental kit. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great high quality product.  Low price and fast delivery - AWSOME</li>
            <li> Great product. I will recommend to friends and buy more.</li>
            <li> I use between dental visits and I love the feeling of cleaner teeth.  Was so inexpensive too.</li>
            <li> Nice set. Sturdy and good price</li>
            <li> It works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Mirror is terrible, can&#x27;t see a thing! Haven&#x27;t used the tools, yet.</li>
            <li> A lot of the tools in this thing are outright useless. The mirror is rarely helpful, and I&#x27;m pretty sure the plastic descaler just does absolutely nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is the soft metal descaler and pick really get the job done. Scraped all the plaque right off, and my teeth are looking great.</li>
            <li> The quality of this set is excellent.  The only issue I&#x27;m having with using these tools is lighting.  I&#x27;d need a 3rd hand to hold the flashlight!  It&#x27;s definitely easier to use if you have a shaving mirror or lights at eye level.  Mine are above the mirror, so it casts a shadow in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought these... everything that I needed</li>
            <li> Great set for touch up between dentist appointment.  Item are really durable, not flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;Great  buy at this price</li>
            <li> Another great product. These help to keep teeth plaque down to a minimum in between dental visits. Nice case to keep them in too.</li>
            <li> As advertised! Nice product.</li>
            <li> Nothing much to say... extremely inexpensive product, does the job, and I wouldn&#x27;t be hesitant to buy another set due to price. The plastic items are fantastic! They work well, and I am extremely less worried about doing damage to my teeth/gums with these as they flex more and are obviously softer.</li>
            <li> I only use the teeth scaler and mirror to get the plaque out of my teeth and it works great... i like it.</li>
            <li> Does just what I need it to do! Easy to use and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I like that the items come in a plastic storage case. One thing I don&#x27;t like is that the dental pick is kinda fat. It&#x27;s hard to get between my teeth to clean. For this, I&#x27;ll probably have to purchase a different pick for that. Other than that, the items are great.</li>
            <li> I got these because I have a problem with tartar growing on my lower incisors no matter how often I brush or floss. The only tool I really use is the dental pick and it does its job well. I&#x27;m able to get the tartar out that usually only the dentist is able to get. So for my purposes the tools work out great. The other tools seem to be of pretty decent quality too. They have rubber handles and are easy to hold and control. Make sure that you&#x27;re careful with the metal tools, I once sliced my cheek with a clumsy move. These won&#x27;t stand up to the high heat sterilization, but for home use these seem to be good enough for me and will probably work well enough for you too.</li>
            <li> This kit is great, my dentist told me I was doing a great job using this kit to keep plaque out of my kids mouths. I use the scraper once a week to remove plaque from there teeth.  I let them play with the mirror while I&#x27;m scraping.  The little orange rubber piece is useless but the others are great</li>
            <li> Nice product for the price point.</li>
            <li> The box is hard to open every time, but they work great</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for I guess.  Only one side of one tool is worth anything.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. I think everybody should have it. I had a professional dental cleaning 1-2 months ago. Then I purchased this and cleaned my teeth with a metal scratcher and was amazed how much gunk came off. I literally did the dental cleaning as at the dentist. Especially there is so much gunk at the back of your teeth! No matter how much you brush your teeth! I think it&#x60;s great to use it on a regular basis to minimize cavity.</li>
            <li> After not having dental insurance throughout college, I went to the dentist this past year and had - quite - a few cavities and some plaque. I was so shocked and asked my dentist what I can do to help - he said that the occasional scraping will help, and this little tool set works just great for that. I use the plastic scraper, not the metal side. I also use the gum stimulation tool. The mirror is handy for checking little things out inside. I even bought one for my boyfriend to use too!</li>
            <li> Looks exactly as pictured and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Easy to use. Very nice quality. I was pleasantly surprised to find brief instructional information regarding the use of each tool on the back of the case.</li>
            <li> Kind of cheap, but functional</li>
            <li> Super  inexpensive way to keep your teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Bought two of the Dentek Oral Care Kit. One for my wife and one for myself. Good quality. Good reusable case. We plan to use this kit between dental visits. Can&#x27;t go wrong for the money. Good value</li>
            <li> Awesome! Works great 😁. Praying for fewer dental spots 😊</li>
            <li> I like it!  I&#x27;m a smoker and heavy black coffee drinker with dark stains on the inside and outside of my lower teeth.  Like the other reviewers state, &amp;#34;be careful and take your time&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My daughter has a problem with plaque buildup and I use these to clean her teeth every once in awhile. Work well and are fairly inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve managed to remove most of the tartar from my teeth but it is very time consuming though.</li>
            <li> I love these, instead of toothpicks. This set ahs a pick with rubber/plastic tips, too.</li>
            <li> Great for dental care.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently become obsessed with cleaning my teeth better and this little kit is great for getting in tough problem areas that I have in my mouth. My bottom row of teeth are crooked and this helps with cleaning out tartar build up in those problem areas. I&#x27;m happy with the price and my purchase.</li>
            <li> While the metal parts are sturdy, the plastic handle is incredibly flimsy and unreliable. This is the part that is incredibly dangerous. The plastic will slip while using the metal parts close to your gum line, causing you to slice your gums open. DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> Does the job as expected for a home kit.</li>
            <li> for the price it does what&#x27;s it&#x27;s supposed too</li>
            <li> The cleaning tools included in this kit are made of soft, cheap feeling plastic.  The few parts that are made of metal aren&#x27;t hard/strong enough to actually help clean any plaque off or between teeth. I do not recommend this item.  Look for a completely stainless steel set (if any exist anymore).</li>
            <li> I love it for just basic cleanup when i cannot clean everything with the dental floss. My teeth now feels cleaner especially that i drink lots of tea and this kit helps me cleanup some tea/coffee stains!</li>
            <li> This tool set has been a tooth saver with braces. The set makes it easier for me to keep my teeth clean with braces.</li>
            <li> Harder to use than I thought, but exactly as advertised.  The dental hygienist makes it look so easy.</li>
            <li> Love this kit! Teeth feel like I just went to the dentist!</li>
            <li> It came nearly perfect. When I first saw this arrive, the first thing I noticed was that something strange was on the mirror. I thought it was broken as it looked like cracks, but with closer inspection it was actually hairs or something. I just hope it wasn&#x27;t bug legs because it was bent and kinda thick like that. Maybe just eyelashes. lol So for the rest of you reading this, be sure to clean these first before use.</li>
            <li> Good product and serves my requirement. Product arrived on time and no complaints on the packing.</li>
            <li> This kit is inexpensive and effective. I have been using theses tools to give my teeth and extra bit of cleaning in-between dentist appointments and my hygienist gave me feedback that the extra work I have been doing was noticeable and made her job easier.</li>
            <li> Metal and plastic, great manufacturing work, nice grip and design, pretty happy with it, thinking on buying another set for my wife.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to, I just have a hard to maneuvering the tools around. Also, the mirror DOES fog up occasionally! Which is a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Ok.  Haven&#x27;t really figured out how to use them correctly.  Not much for instructions.</li>
            <li> i only really use the scaler to keep on top of tarter/plaque/calculus. My dentist says I do a great job &#x3D;) Be careful though, I&#x27;ve definitely hurt myself in the beginning. Anyway, I  lost my old set in a move and bought this one thinking there wouldn&#x27;t be much difference between the previous set I had. This one is a few bucks cheaper but a LOT suckier.  The metal has less &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; or texture to grab on and seems flimsier overall. The dual-ended tips help no one and hurt if you hold it wrong. If you need it mostly for the scaler like me, buy this one instead: http://www.amazon.com/DenTek-Dental-Ultra-Anti-Mirror/dp/B00008BRR6/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1431379153&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;plaque+scraper</li>
            <li> Nice kit with all of the tools you need.</li>
            <li> This kit says it is dishwasher safe (top rack) which is nice. The handles and the mirror casing are plastic, FYI. The mirror is good and doesn&#x27;t fog up, though I wish it was metal (the mirror is the main reason I got the kit, I am always trying to look at something in my mouth for some reason). The metal scaler (which states it is for weekly use) and metal pic are nice - not overly sharp so they are easy to use for an inexperienced person. There is a plastic pic for daily use and on the other end a &#x27;gum stimulator&#x27; which is something I&#x27;ve never heard of or felt the need to use. Generally a nice kit, I take really good care of my teeth and probably wont scale them too often, but sometimes you get a little food stuck in a deep groove or a popcorn kernel behind you back molar, and I always wish I had something like this on hand when that happens, so this will hopefully be a good purchase over time.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I like to keep up in between cleanings and this is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> The only piece of this packet that I use is the tooth scaler. I recommend another product as the scaler gives too much when applying pressure against the tooth. A fully metallic handle is preferable.</li>
            <li> Nice and complete package</li>
            <li> Overall decent product for the price, the hand mirror does seems a bit flimsy in terms of the plastic support for the mirrored surface, but then again I am not paying for a dentist grade hand mirror with actual glass. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I got braces recently... And bought this set to help clean and examine my teeth. Super high quality, very useable, and has really helped me keep things clean and in good shape. Recommended!</li>
            <li> Bought this product because I was experiencing a toothache and could not afford a dentist. Using this kit I was able to find the cavity and clean it out, it&#x27;s been a year and the pain hasn&#x27;t come back. Why pay a fortune for dentists when you could do the same thing yourself?</li>
            <li> Nothing more nothing less  they are plastic with metal head on the one the other is plastic i dont see using that one but the mirror is great cool to see the back side of your teeth</li>
            <li> Item as described. A+</li>
            <li> After my wife threw out a previous set like this I had for some time I was desperately looking for a replacement, and glad I found these, much better quality than the other ones. I use these about once a month to get the cruft out in between dentist visits to get a proper cleaning.</li>
            <li> The metal tool works.&lt;br /&gt;Thicker end helps to push and crush bigger pieces of dirt but can&#x27;t reach into smaller gaps. Solid enough to not bend.&lt;br /&gt;Sharper end have some give to it, but I understand it is to stop the user from using excessive force which is more likely to lose control and injure.&lt;br /&gt;Better than the safety pin I have been using, but not phenomenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it by the window during daytime to easily see the contrast between the dirt and your teeth. It is much more obvious than indoor light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*half a year later*&lt;br /&gt;I just shone a bright LED flashlight in my mouth and found tartar hiding at my upper front tooth&lt;br /&gt;did &amp;#34;dental surgery&amp;#34; on it by 1 hand holding the small mirror and 1 hand on the steel pick -- while looking into a bigger mirror&lt;br /&gt;the teeth will look smaller due to the 6inch distance to fit both your hands , but I found it to be easy linking up the images through 2 mirrors ... playing video games does help overcome the confusion&lt;br /&gt;If it missed it , it would have progressed into a cavity</li>
            <li> I thought this was a great buy for the price. I started out looking only for a dental mouth mirror, but I found this three in one Oral Care Kit from Dentek. I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> must need for every set of teeth.</li>
            <li> If I had wanted super sturdy, I would have paid more.  These are more than adequate for home use. Easier to grip than I had hoped; easy clean. Yes, the mirror is tiny, but that is true of all the sets I have tried. Actually ran them through dishwasher, and they cam out fine.  Will be ordering a second set soon for my dogs as the old pet ones need replacing.</li>
            <li> available in wallmart</li>
            <li> Awesome for those long times away from the dentist for daily upkeep.</li>
            <li> Very valuable kit for those who have teeth issues. The mirror is the most often used and helps to see which teeth need more brushing. The rubber probe made me realize how intense my tooth problem was and helped me make the right decision to extract it. I almost felt like a dentist inspecting my teeth!&lt;br /&gt;Invaluable for the price!</li>
            <li> very good home kit oral care kit!</li>
            <li> Overall, I am satisfied with this purchase.  The tools all do what they&#x27;re supposed to do, and I especially like the fact that the mirror does not fog up.  Also, the package states that they&#x27;re dishwasher safe (top rack), which should appease anyone&#x27;s obsessive-compulsive tendencies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, one complaint that I have is that the metal pick is slightly too thick to be as useful as it could be.  I also noticed that it wobbles/bends a bit while using it, so it&#x27;s a bit hard to get the necessary leverage with it (it might be designed that way on purpose, so you don&#x27;t damage your teeth and then try to sue the company).  The design of the metal scaler allows it to be much sturdier, and I feel that the pick would have benefited from a similar design.  Nevertheless, these tools (in combination with my tongue cleaner) do an adequate job at supplementing the everyday toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Great Product at the right price.</li>
            <li> Exactly as shown. Great</li>
            <li> very cheap and great product!!!</li>
            <li> Scrapes teeth.  As expected.</li>
            <li> I can now see and pick my way to a cleaner mouth. Brushing and flossing not cutting the mustard? This little kit is effective. Get some mouthwash while you&#x27;re at it to give you an over-the-top clean feeling. Breath smell like the cat&#x27;s backside? Clean your mouth the right way!</li>
            <li> Great Oral Care Kit.  This kit is quality and includes everything one may need for home care.  The yellow tip perio tool is not included in most care kits.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as tools with sculpy and other clays. Works beautifully for detail and hard to reach spots.</li>
            <li> Effective way to clear away the yuck between professional teeth cleanings.  Happy with the quality and function of these tools.</li>
            <li> Good quality and will see how it holds in time.</li>
            <li> Does all it needs to, very helpful for those days where a small seed can make for an extremely painful day.</li>
            <li> it is what it is,handy kit, won&#x27;t replace your dentist!</li>
            <li> This is a nice little set if you want to go a little deeper and do some teeth scraping of your own. I really like it and the container it comes in is sturdy and keeps the tools all together.</li>
            <li> This is a nice set for the price but the plastic/rubber pick is all but useless. Wish one of the metal picks was a little better than a wire, doesn&#x27;t bode well for long term reliability. However it does its job so works for me.</li>
            <li> I already broke the plastic mirror stick, it is still hanging on by the outer rubber coating and the plastic scraper just broke. I should have bought the real deal metal ones.</li>
            <li> I got this set for the pick and the scraper but was a bit optimistic about their quality given their price. Don&#x27;t expect them to be anywhere near the quality or sharpness of tools you&#x27;d find at a dentist. For me the pick and scraper were actually too blunt to use. Very safe, though; you won&#x27;t be mangling gums with them by accident.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for a good price.</li>
            <li> Here are the ADVANTAGES and DISADVANTAGES of this product.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;ADVANTAGES&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;1. The two picks do the job - scraping off tarter between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;2. The price is good.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;DISADVANTAGES&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;1. The short metal tip is fused into a plastic handle. Mine broke within a year.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;2. The steel tip is very sharp. It will scratch and wear away teeth enamel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had plaque for a while and it was still able to remove a lot in just two sessions (they recommend using the metal pick only once a week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife was impressed and wants to buy one as a gift and one for herself.</li>
            <li> Great product though the third piece that is there to stimulate gum is rather useless to me. Also using this take quite some practice!</li>
            <li> the handles are strong enough to be precise at all. and it can&#x27;t remove plague off your teeth b/c again, the handles are too flexible. only good for removing food from between your teeth, but you can do that with a tooth pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a good toy set for grown kids in jr high school.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an awesome product and worked exactly as it&#x27;s suppose to.  You can&#x27;t go wrong when you purchase the name brand product.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price!</li>
            <li> I had a set like this years ago that I was looking to replace.  This is an excellent replacement and the product is of good quality.  I am satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, average quality.</li>
            <li> Great for hard to reach places!</li>
            <li> I use the metal scraper for slight tarter build up. It&#x27;s gentle and effective. The gum stimulator is amazing and can help remove food particles.</li>
            <li> I get a build-up of plaque behind my lower, front teeth that drives my crazy so I use the scrapping tools to remove it quickly &amp; efficiently. I&#x27;ve used the tools several times and they are holding up well. I would repurchase this set in the future.</li>
            <li> This helps me to keep my teeth a whole lot cleaner.  Cut down on dental bills with this.</li>
            <li> Perfect kit to have on hand. High quality tools just like you would see your dentist use. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Nice kit so I thought by the look but did not do the job well.</li>
            <li> This oral care kit comes in handy especially when it comes to maintaining your teeth and keeping your gums in tip top shape. This kit comes with a gum stimulator, plaque remover, pick and mirror. It&#x27;s definitely great to have as it is travel friendly! Just rinse it with warm water and let it air dry. I&#x27;ve used it and it definitely helped reach areas that my floss couldn&#x27;t get to. I would highly recommend this kit!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my dog to clean her teeth. My dog is almost two and still has not lost her baby fangs. I have to clean between the teeth because she has such a smelly breath.</li>
            <li> This kit is OK for home use. The metal hooks works great for scraping and cleaning just below the gum line. The mirror is ok, however im not quite sure what to do with the other tool. Both ends are flexible, one made of rubber the other of plastic.</li>
            <li> NOT metal pics; very flimsy PLASTIC pieces.  Don&#x27;t waste your money -these do NOT work to remove stains from teeth like metal pics.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  I use it often since flossing and brushing don&#x27;t always get rid of plaque build-up.</li>
            <li> The metal picks are great but the one with the rubber tip just melted away when I used hot water to sterilize it. Also, the case is a real pain.  Unless the tools are laying just so the case won&#x27;t close.  Mirror isn&#x27;t bad, but could be better.</li>
            <li> Very handy and just the right size for home or travel. Love the little plastic case!</li>
            <li> Bought because I can&#x27;t currently afford the deep cleaning my dentist recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m already seeing great improvement in the problem areas identified by my dentist.  I did read some of the comments of people being fearful and others warning one could damage teeth.  I&#x27;ve not found any of that.  I bled twice and it was only a tiny bit which lasted seconds.  Surprisingly, I bled far more with the water irrigator I also bought which arrived a few days later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just having the mirror is helpful as then one can truly see what is going on in there and one can monitor any progress.  The other tools, of course, enable one to MAKE that progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> plastic handle, to delicate for me</li>
            <li> Not much of a sharp edge to some of the tools, which makes it hard to scrape sometimes.</li>
            <li> Nice kit; really like that this comes in a plastic travel case.  Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> They are good tools for the job! Haven&#x27;t had any problems yet!</li>
